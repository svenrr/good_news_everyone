FBI uncovered Russian bribery plot before Obama administration approved controversial nuclear deal with Moscow,http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration,"Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThe US must not lose the cyberwar with Russia Chechen leader: Macron's stance on Muhammad cartoons 'forcing people into terrorism' Russia implements national mask mandate as coronavirus cases rise MORE’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.

Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.

The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.

Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.

The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.

When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”

In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.

“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.

The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.

That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.

But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.

Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderAlarm grows over Trump team's efforts to monitor polls The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden on Trump: 'He'll leave' l GOP laywers brush off Trump's election remarks l Obama's endorsements Obama endorses Warnock in crowded Georgia Senate race MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.

Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.

Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.

Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.

His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.

In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a “racketeering scheme” that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.

“As part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,” Agent David Gadren testified.

“Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,” the agent added.

The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinTrump turns his ire toward Cabinet members Ex-deputy attorney general says Justice Dept. 'will ignore' Trump's threats against political rivals The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump's erratic tweets upend stimulus talks; COVID-19 spreads in White House MORE, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump Donald John TrumpHillary Clinton responds to Chrissy Teigen tweet: 'I love you back' Police called after Florida moms refuse to wear face masks at school board meeting about mask policy Supreme Court rejects Trump effort to shorten North Carolina mail-ballot deadline MORE’s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeHillicon Valley: CEOs of Google, Facebook and Twitter to testify before Senate | European Union police agency warns of increase in cybercrime | Twitter to remove posts hoping for Trump's death Graham officially schedules hearing on Trump's Supreme Court pick to start Oct. 12 The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump eager to leave the hospital MORE, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.

Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.

Its many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.

The case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia’s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.

One of Mikerin’s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.

Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency’s cap.

But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.

The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.

By that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’s approval.

The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.

The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.

On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, “a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison” and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.

Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin’s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.

“I had no idea this case was being conducted,” a surprised Hosko said in an interview.

Likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.

Former Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersDemocrats slam DHS chief for defying subpoena for testimony on worldwide threats Remembering 9/11 as we evaluate today's emerging threats Hillicon Valley: Tech CEOs brace for House grilling | Senate GOP faces backlash over election funds | Twitter limits Trump Jr.'s account MORE (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal.

“Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,” he said. “The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.”

British Muslims have handed out 3,000 roses to residents and tourists at London Bridge, one week after Islamic extremists slaughtered eight people in a van and knife rampage.

The group said they wanted to show ""love and solidarity"" with Londoners and the victims of the atrocity, which saw 48 people injured.

""After the events of last weekend we are making a symbolic gesture of love for the communities affected by the attack,"" said Zakia Bassou, one of the organisers of Sunday’s event.

""The whole concept is we are not going to let London Bridge, or any bridge, fall down.""

Londoner Elida Ercolano was visibly emotional after receiving her rose.

""I think it's lovely, it's what London is actually about as a city,"" she said.

""It's what people should remember despite what's gone on. It's a great symbol and of nothing else it's bringing people together.

""It's very easy to believe the fear but boil it down and we are actually, in the main, good people and we should remember that.""

June Collis, from Gillingham, Dorset, said it was ""beautiful and lovely to see this group come out and share their love against all the horrible things that have happened"".

""Muslims need to speak up and go against the extremists,"" she added.

""This is a good way of speaking up for themselves. Let's just hope we don't see any more of these horrible killings.""

David Hackett, visiting the capital from Durham, said he found the event ""very touching"".

""It's great to see people giving such a beautiful thing to demonstrate the love people have for each other,"" he said.

""It's a strong, powerful message in such a poignant place, given recent events.""

Nancy Cannata, 61, from Massachusetts in the US, said: ""It's very nice to see. And I think it's nice that they're Muslims - it's not everybody in the Muslim community carrying out these attacks. There are good and bad people in every religion, and I wish people could realise that.""

Ms Cannata was visiting London Bridge as part of a long-planned holiday to the UK with her husband, Gaetano, 63. The couple booked the trip in October last year, and said they had never considered changing their plans.

""We felt it would be safe and that there would actually be even more security, and we can see that's the case. We feel very safe,"" he said.

""We just hope the world is heading in a better direction.""

The 1,000 Roses London project paid for the roses through a crowdfunding campaign and bought the flowers at Zara Floral in East Grinstead.

Fundraising is continuing and the group is planning to hold another rally in the future."

(Reuters) - Kendrick Ray Castillo, the 18-year-old who sacrificed his life to save other students during a shooting in a suburban Denver high school, loved robotics, helping the elderly in his community and making people laugh, his friend told Reuters.

Cece Bedard, who knew Castillo since elementary school, said she broke down in tears when she heard her friend had died but was not surprised at his selfless act.

“There is no doubt in my mind that he would have done anything he thought he could have to help anyone,” Bedard said on Wednesday.

Two teenagers are accused of opening fire on fellow students on Tuesday at the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) School in Highlands Ranch, about 25 miles (40 km) south of Denver, killing Castillo and wounding eight other students.

Witnesses said Castillo, who was due to graduate in three days, charged at one of the shooters.

“Kendrick lunged at him,” senior Nui Giasolli told NBC News, referring to the older of the two shooting suspects, Devon Erickson, 18, who was being held on Wednesday on murder and attempted murder charges.

“He shot Kendrick, giving all of us enough time to get underneath our desks, to get ourselves safe, and to run across the room to escape,” Giasolli said.

Fellow student, Brendan Bialy, a U.S. Marine recruit who also charged the shooter with a third student, described Castillo as an unstoppable bowling ball.

“Basically when he gets moving there’s no stopping him,” Bialy said in an interview with multiple media outlets, including Denver’s Fox News affiliate, late on Wednesday.

Bialy said his friend showed no hesitation.

Bedard said she and Castillo both volunteered with their fathers at the local chapter of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic men’s community service organization, when they were in middle school.

Castillo loved tagging along with his father to volunteer with the Knights of Columbus, whether it involved carrying heavy crates of fruit for a peach drive or setting up senior lunches. He was especially good at connecting with the elderly people he served, Bedard said.

“He was always there earlier than I was and was always there later than I was,” she said.

His friends remembered Castillo as a goofy jokester, although his humor was never at anyone’s expense, Bedard said. He had a strong sense of self and did not care what other people thought of him, a trait that made him stand out among his peers.

Castillo was also a member of a regional robotics team, another community that was mourning his loss on Wednesday.

“We’re heartbroken by the death of Kendrick Castillo ... Kendrick was a member of @Frc4418, of which his father is Lead Mentor,” FIRST, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing youth in STEM, said on Twitter.

Bialy said Castillo was not a victim but someone who jumped into action.

“I love that kid,” Bialy said. “He died a trooper. He got his ticket to Valhalla, and I know he will be with me for the rest of my life.”"

Japan Made Secret Deals with the NSA that Expanded Global Surveillance,https://theintercept.com/2017/04/24/japans-secret-deals-with-the-nsa-that-expand-global-surveillance/,"I t began as routinely as any other passenger flight. At gate 15 of New York City’s JFK Airport, more than 200 men, women, and children stood in line as they waited to board a Boeing 747. They were on their way to Seoul, South Korea’s capital city. But none would ever make it to their destination. About 14 hours after its departure, the plane was cruising at around 35,000 feet not far from the north of Japan when it was shot out of the sky. The downing of Korean Airlines Flight 007 occurred on September 1, 1983, in what was one of the Cold War’s most shocking incidents. The plane had veered off course and for a short time entered Soviet airspace. At Dolinsk-Sokol military base, Soviet commanders dispatched two fighter jets and issued an order to “destroy the intruder.” The plane was hit once by an air-to-air missile and plummeted into the sea, killing all passengers and crew. President Ronald Reagan declared it a “crime against humanity,” marking the dawn of a volatile new chapter in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Soon, tensions would escalate to a level not seen since the Cuban missile crisis, which 20 years earlier had brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

As the international confrontation between the two adversaries played out publicly, behind closed doors another problem — which has never before been revealed — was developing. The U.S. and one of its closest allies, Japan, were embroiled in a dispute involving secret surveillance. Soviet officials were flat-out denying they had any role in shooting down the jet. At a spy base on Japanese territory, however, communications had been intercepted proving the Soviet military was the perpetrator. The U.S. wanted to obtain copies of the tapes but had to first receive approval from the head of a shadowy Japanese surveillance organization known as the “G2 Annex.” After some bureaucratic wrangling, the Japanese eventually signed off on the release and the highly sensitive recordings were sent to Washington. From there, the tapes were forwarded to New York City, where U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick brought them to the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan. On September 6 — just five days after the Korean Airlines jet was shot down — Kirkpatrick attended a meeting at the U.N. Security Council where she blasted the Soviet Union for telling “lies, half lies and excuses” about its involvement in the downing of the plane. She then proceeded to play the copy of the intercepted conversations, stating that the evidence was being presented in “cooperation with the government of Japan.” The case Kirkpatrick put forward against the Soviets was irrefutable and damning. But Japan’s spying capabilities had now been exposed — and the country’s officials were not pleased about it. The G2 Annex received new orders limiting its cooperation with the U.S., which affected the NSA’s relationship with its Japanese counterparts for the better part of a decade, at least until the Cold War ended in the early 1990s. The details about the Korean Airlines case are revealed in classified National Security Agency documents, obtained by The Intercept from the whistleblower Edward Snowden. The documents, published Monday in collaboration with Japanese news broadcaster NHK, reveal the complicated relationship the NSA has maintained with Japan over a period of more than six decades. Japan has allowed NSA to maintain at least three bases on its territory and contributed more than half a billion dollars to help finance the NSA’s facilities and operations. In return, NSA has kitted out Japanese spies with powerful surveillance tools and shared intelligence with them. However, there is a duplicitous dimension to the partnership. While the NSA has maintained friendly ties with its Japanese counterparts and benefited from their financial generosity, at the same time it has secretly spied on Japanese officials and institutions. The NSA declined to comment for this story.

O n August 14, 1945, Japan announced its unconditional surrender just days after U.S. Air Force planes dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, killing more than 100,000 people. The war was over, but as part of the peace agreement, Japan agreed to U.S. military occupation. American forces — led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur — drafted a new Japanese constitution and reformed the country’s parliamentary system. In April 1952, Japan’s sovereignty was restored, but the U.S. continued to maintain a major presence in the country — and that is where the NSA’s story begins. According to the agency’s documents, its relationship with Japan dates back to the 1950s. NSA’s presence in the country was for many years managed out of a “cover office” in the Minato area of downtown Tokyo, within a U.S. military compound called the Hardy Barracks. From there, NSA maintained close relations with a Japanese surveillance agency that it refers to as Japan’s Directorate for Signals Intelligence, or SIGINT. At first, the NSA appears to have kept a low profile in Japan, concealing details about its presence and operating undercover. But as its relationship with the country developed, that changed. By 2007, the agency had determined that “cover operations are no longer required” and it relocated its main office in Japan to a space within the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. “NSA’s partnership with Japan continues to grow in importance,” the agency noted in a classified October 2007 report, adding that it planned to take the country “to the next level as an intelligence partner with the U.S.” Beyond Tokyo, NSA has a presence today at several other facilities in Japan. The most important of these is located at a large U.S. airbase in Misawa, about 400 miles north of Tokyo. At what it calls its “Misawa Security Operations Center,” the agency carries out a mission under the code name LADYLOVE. Using about a dozen powerful antennas contained within large golf ball-like white domes, it vacuums up communications — including phone calls, faxes, and internet data — that are transmitted across satellites in the Asia-Pacific region.

Photo: Haraz N. Ghanbari/AP

As of March 2009, Misawa was being used to monitor “over 8,000 signals on 16 targeted satellites,” one NSA document noted. At the same time, the agency was working on beefing up the spy hub’s systems, so that it could meet a challenge set by then-Director Keith Alexander to “collect it all” — meaning, to sweep up as many communications as possible. Misawa’s NSA employees responded to Alexander’s call by developing technology to automatically scan and process more satellite signals. “There are multitude of possibilities,” one Misawa-based NSA engineer reported, predicting that the base would soon be “one step closer to ‘collecting it all.’” Strategically, Japan is one of the NSA’s most valuable partners. Because of its close proximity to major U.S. rivals like China and Russia, it has been used as a launching pad to spy on those countries. But NSA’s operations in Japan are not limited to monitoring the communications of nearby adversaries. At Misawa, the NSA deployed programs called APPARITION and GHOSTHUNTER, which pinpoint the locations of people accessing the internet across the Middle East and North Africa. NSA documents detailing GHOSTHUNTER’s deployment at the NSA’s British base Menwith Hill state the program was used to facilitate lethal strikes, enabling “a significant number of capture-kill operations” against alleged terrorists. One November 2008 document noted that Misawa had proved particularly useful in tracking down terror suspects in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and was also being used in an effort to identify targets in Indonesia. Over the past decade, the NSA’s tactics have evolved dramatically — and it has rolled out new and more controversial methods. By 2010, with the internet surging in popularity, the agency was continuing to focus on long-established spying tactics like eavesdropping on phone calls, but it was increasingly adopting more aggressive methods, such as hacking into its targets’ computers. At Misawa, the NSA began integrating hacking operations into its repertoire of capabilities. One such method it deployed at the base is called a “Quantum Insert” attack, which involves monitoring the internet browsing habits of people targeted for surveillance, before covertly redirecting them to a malicious website or server that infects their computers with an “implant.” The implant then collects data from the infected computer and returns it to the NSA for analysis. “If we can get the target to visit us in some sort of web browser, we can probably own them,” an NSA employee claims in one document describing the hacking techniques. “The only limitation is the ‘how.’”

T he Yokota Air Base, another U.S. military facility, sits at the foothills of Okutama mountains near the city of Fussa. The base is about a 90-minute drive west from central Tokyo and houses more than 3,400 personnel. According to the U.S. Air Force, Yokota’s function is to “enhance the U.S. deterrent posture and, if necessary, provide fighter and military airlift support for offensive air operations.” But it also serves another, more secret, purpose. NSA documents reveal that Yokota is home to what the agency calls its Engineering Support Facility, which supplies equipment used for surveillance operations across the world. In 2004, the agency opened a major new 32,000 square foot building at the site – about half the size of a football field – for the repair and manufacture of surveillance antennas it said would be used in places like Afghanistan, Korea, Thailand, the Balkans, Iraq, Central and South America, and Cyprus. The construction cost $6.6 million, which was paid almost entirely by the government of Japan, a July 2004 NSA report stated. Within the facility, Japan would finance the staff as well, the report noted, including seven designers, machinists, and other specialists, who were collectively receiving salaries worth $375,000. About 1,200 miles southwest of Yokota is the NSA’s most remote Japanese spying station, located on the island of Okinawa at a large U.S. Marine Corps base called Camp Hansen. It, too, has greatly benefited from a massive injection of Japanese money. In the early 2000s, NSA constructed a state-of-the-art surveillance facility on the island, paid for in full by Japan at a cost of some $500 million, according to the agency’s documents. The site was carved out of a “dense, hilly area” called Landing Zone Ostrich that the Marines had previously used for jungle training. The facility, built to include an “antenna field” for its spying missions, was designed to be low profile, blending in with the landscape. It replaced a previous spy hub NSA had maintained on Okinawa that the island’s Japanese residents had complained was unsightly. The role of the remote eavesdropping station is to collect high-frequency communications signals as part of a mission called STAKECLAIM. The NSA does not appear to have a large number of employees stationed on the island; instead, it remotely operates the Okinawa facility from a “24-hour collection operations center” in Hawaii. Hiroshi Miyashita, a former Japanese government data protection official, told The Intercept that Japan’s funding of U.S. intelligence activities is withheld from public disclosure under a state secrecy law, which he criticized. “It’s our money — Japanese taxpayers’ money,” he said. “We should know how much was spent for intelligence activities in Japan.” Miyashita, now an associate professor at Chuo University in Tokyo, said it was his understanding that NSA operates in the country outside Japan’s legal jurisdiction due to an agreement that grants U.S. military facilities in Japan extraterritoriality. “There is no oversight mechanism,” Miyashita said. “There is limited knowledge of activities within the bases.”

As recently as 2013, the NSA claimed to maintain “robust” working relations with its Japanese counterparts. The agency has two surveillance partners in Japan: the Directorate for SIGINT, and the Japanese National Police Agency. Japan has collaborated closely with the NSA on monitoring the communications of neighboring countries, and it also appears to rely heavily on U.S.-provided intelligence about North Korean missile launches. As of February 2013, the NSA was increasingly collaborating with its Japanese counterparts on cybersecurity issues. And in September 2012, Japan began sharing information with the NSA that could be used to identify particular kinds of malicious software being used by hackers. This was the first time the country had shared this kind of data and the NSA viewed it as highly valuable, potentially leading to the prevention or detection of hacking attacks on “critical U.S. corporate information systems.”

“Japanese citizens know almost nothing about Japanese government surveillance. It is extremely secret.”

In return, the NSA has provided Japanese spies with training, and it has also furnished them with some of its most powerful spying tools. An April 2013 document revealed that the NSA had provided the Japanese Directorate for SIGINT with an installation of XKEYSCORE, a mass surveillance system the NSA describes as its “widest reaching” for sweeping up data from computer networks, monitoring “nearly everything a typical user does on the internet.” Igeta Daisuke, a Japanese lawyer who specializes in civil liberties cases, said that the XKEYSCORE revelation was “very important” for the country. The Japanese government’s use of the system could violate Japan’s Constitution, which protects privacy rights, Daisuke told The Intercept. He added that Japan has a limited legal framework covering surveillance issues, largely because the scope of the government’s spying has never before been disclosed, debated, or ruled upon by judges. “Japanese citizens know almost nothing about Japanese government surveillance,” said Daisuke. “It is extremely secret.” The Japanese government’s defense ministry, which oversees the country’s surveillance capabilitites, declined to comment.

T he NSA works with a diverse range of counterparts in countries across the world — from the United Kingdom and Sweden to Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia. But the agency’s partnership with Japan is one of its most complex and seems tainted by a degree of distrust, highlighted by the dramatic aftermath of the Korean Airlines incident in 1983. In a November 2008 document, one of NSA’s then most senior officials in Japan offered an insight into the relationship. He described the Japanese as “very accomplished” at conducting signals intelligence but lamented that they were excessively secretive. The country’s spies were “still caught in a Cold War way of doing business,” the official wrote. “They treat SIGINT as a special-access program — the most sensitive program they have. The result is that they are rather stove-piped, somewhat like NSA was 10-or-more years ago.” The NSA participates in a group called the SIGINT Seniors Pacific, which has included surveillance agencies from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, India, New Zealand, Thailand, South Korea, and Singapore. The group keeps tabs on security issues in the Asia-Pacific region — issues of great interest to Japan, given its geographic location. Yet the country refused to join the meetings. “Japan was the only nation who was actually offered membership but turned it down,” wrote one NSA employee in a March 2007 document. “At the time, Japan expressed concerns that unintended disclosure of its participation would be too high a risk and had other reasons as well.” Some of the difficulties have directly impacted the NSA’s operations. According to the agency’s documents, for many years Japan participated in a surveillance program called CROSSHAIR, which involved sharing intelligence gathered from high-frequency signals. However, in 2009, the country abruptly ceased its participation in the program. Four years later, the issue was still causing NSA concern. Ahead of a February 2013 meeting the agency had scheduled with the deputy director of Japan’s Directorate for SIGINT, it prepared a briefing document that outlined the CROSSHAIR problem and warned of a “potential landmine” associated with the discussions. “In the past, the partner has mistakenly perceived that NSA was trying to force [the Directorate for SIGINT] to use U.S. technical solutions in place of their own,” the memo stated. “When this occurred, the partner reacted in a strong, negative manner.” But while NSA employees may walk on eggshells with Japan during face-to-face meetings, they have taken a different approach on a covert level. An NSA document from May 2006 indicated that a division of the agency — called Western Europe and Strategic Partnerships — was spying on Japan in an effort to gather intelligence about its foreign policy and trade activities. Moreover, as of July 2010, the NSA had obtained domestic court orders enabling it to conduct surveillance on U.S. territory of Japanese officials and the Bank of Japan, which has offices in Washington, D.C., and New York City. The NSA’s covert eavesdropping operations give it an insight into the Japanese government’s private negotiations and dealmaking. As was the case in late May 2007, during a secret meeting at the luxury Hotel Captain Cook in downtown Anchorage, Alaska."

This beautiful library in 'Minecraft' lets people access the work of censored journalists from anywhere,http://fastcompany.com/90476690/this-beautiful-library-in-minecraft-lets-people-anywhere-access-the-work-of-censored-journalists,"In countries where censorship is standard practice—such as China, where articles and social media posts about COVID-19 and the government’s slow initial response to the crisis have been quickly deleted by government censors, and where government critics can end up in jail—Facebook, Twitter, and many news sites are blocked. But it’s still possible to play Minecraft anywhere. That’s why a new project from Reporters Without Borders now uses Minecraft to share articles from censored journalists.

The project takes the form of a massive virtual library, called the Uncensored Library, made from more than 12.5 million of the Lego-like blocks that Minecraft players use to build virtual worlds. In the library, when an article is added, it appears as a book. “We were able to build and craft a huge library, which took a couple of months with multiple developers to build,” says Robert-Jan Blonk, a senior interactive producer at MediaMonks, a digital production company based in the Netherlands that partnered with BlockWorks, the agency that designed the project.

“Inside, you can find articles and information about the journalists that are being censored in their own countries,” he says. “We share these stories through the books that live in that library, and people can just openly read them, because even in the countries . . . where these journalists are from, you’re able to play Minecraft.”

The library, built in a classical, formal design that’s intended to evoke and subvert the repression of governments that censor information, includes articles from Mada Masr, an Egyptian news site that reports on corruption and has been blocked since 2017 in Egypt, a country where most media is controlled in some way by the state. It also includes stories from grani.ru, a blocked Russian site that reports on protests and activism at a time when Russia is aiming for systematic mass surveillance. The journalist Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of the executed Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, collaborated with the project to republish Khashoggi’s articles in the game; the exiled Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Van Dai and the murdered Mexican journalist Javier Valdez also have content in the virtual library.

The content can’t be changed, though players can add more. If a repressive government tries to hack the server hosting the game, other servers and hosts can take over. “With so many people playing the game, there’s always a version live, so they cannot take it down,” says Blonk.

More than 145 million people play Minecraft each month, and as more players around the world discover the library, the team is hoping that it can spread a message about the challenges to press freedom. The library also includes details about the current state of press freedom in 180 countries. “This is such a unique way of bringing attention to censorship,” he says. “We hope that with so many players and so many people that we basically bring this problem up again. People die because they’re being censored.”"
Fan with 96mph fastball gets pro contract and promptly throws strikes in debut,http://usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/athletics/2019/08/18/mlb-nathan-patterson-fans-three-oakland-as-minor-league-debut/2047016001/,"Fan who signed with A's, Nathan Patterson, strikes out side in minor league debut

Chris Bumbaca | USA TODAY

Nathan Patterson's fairy tale story has added another chapter. Because as far as debuts go, this is as good as it gets.

Patterson, the right-hander who drew notice after throwing 96 mph at a speed-pitch radar booth at a Colorado Rockies game this year, made his professional debut in the Oakland A's organization Thursday in the Rookie-level Arizona League and struck out all three batters he faced.

""Last night was incredible and truly a blessing as I made my first professional outing.

I’m not gonna lie, the nerves were flowing until I threw strike one. After that, I took a big deep breathe (sic) and realized all the hard work over the last year has prepared me for this moment,"" the 23-year-old wrote on Instagram the day after his outing. ""It could not have gone any better and I cannot thank my family, friends, teammates, and coaches enough for the love and support.""

The 23-year-old's journey Hollywood-esque journey is off to a strong start."
"Congressmen demand investigation of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, Sinclair Broadcast Group",http://static.techspot.com/news/71865-congressmen-demand-investigation-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-sinclair.html,"Two members of the US House of Representatives have sent a formal letter to the Federal Communications Commission Inspector General calling for an investigation of Chairman Ajit Pai. Energy and Commerce Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) and Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member Elijah E. Cummings (D-MD) believe Pai ""has taken actions to improperly beneﬁt Sinclair Broadcast Group.""

The investigation would focus on the interactions of Mr. Pai and officials at Sinclair Broadcast Group. The Congressmen believe Pai hasn't sufficiently answered questions related to these meetings and are hoping a federal investigation can clear things up.

They are questioning whether or not Pai and others at the FCC have used personal messaging channels and private emails to communicate with Sinclair. This would be a violation of the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act. The second part of the investigation centers around whether or not Mr. Pai's actions have shown a pattern of preferential treatment towards Sinclair.

Sinclair Broadcast Group is the second largest television station operator in the US and largest by total coverage. Their 173 different stations currently reach about 40% of American households and they are looking to grow by purchasing Tribune Media. Many believe recent decisions made by the FCC have been targeted to directly help Sinclair expand their reach. John Oliver ran a segment in July highlighting the practices of Sinclair and potential dangers of the merger.

The FCC recently rolled back TV station ownership limits which required stations to maintain studios on the communities they serve. This Thursday the FCC will vote on elimination additional restrictions. In a response to the request for investigation, Chairman Pai's office stated:

Unfortunately, this request appears to be part of many Democrats' attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views, an effort that dates all the way back to 2004 when Ranking Member Pallone, Ranking Member Cummings, and other Democrats demanded that the FCC investigate Sinclair based solely on the content of a documentary they didn't like and that hadn't even aired. Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless. For many years, Chairman Pai has called on the FCC to update its media ownership regulations—one of which dates back to 1975. The Chairman is sticking to his long-held views, and given the strong case for modernizing these rules, it's not surprising that those who disagree with him would prefer to do whatever they can to distract from the merits of his proposals."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — In a milestone win that instantly expanded the Oscars’ horizons, Bong Joon Ho’s masterfully devious class satire “Parasite” became the first non-English language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.

“Parasite” took Hollywood’s top prize on Sunday night, along with awards for best director, best international film and best screenplay. In a year dominated by period epics — “1917,” “Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood,” “The Irishman” — the film academy instead went overseas, to South Korea, to reward a contemporary and unsettling portrait of social inequality in “Parasite.”

True to its name, “Parasite” simply got under the skin of Oscar voters, attaching itself to the American awards season and, ultimately, to history. The win was a watershed moment for the Academy Awards, which has long been content to relegate international films to their own category. But in recent years, to diversify its membership, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has invited many more overseas voters.

Multiple standing ovations greeted Bong’s several wins. “I am ready to drink tonight,” Bong said, prompting roars from the crowd. Unexpectedly called up again for best director, Bong saluted his fellow nominees, particularly Martin Scorsese, and concluded: “Now I’m ready to drink until tomorrow.”

After the Dolby Theatre had emptied out, the “Parasite” team still remained on the stage, soaking in their win. Backstage, Bong was still gobsmacked. “It’s really f—-ing crazy,” he told reporters, clutching his awards.

The victory for “Parasite” — which had echoes of the surprise win by “Moonlight” over “La La Land” three years ago — came in a year when many criticized the lack of diversity in the nominees and the absence of female filmmakers. But the triumph for “Parasite,” the Palme d’Or-winner at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, enabled Hollywood to flip the script and signal progress, nevertheless. No Korean film had ever won an Oscar before.

In doing so, the film academy turned away another history-making event, again denying Netflix its first best-picture win despite two contenders in “The Irishman” and “Marriage Story,” and a big-spending awards campaign blitz.

Sam Mendes’ audaciously conceived World War I film “1917,” made to seem one continuous shot, had been the clear favorite heading into Oscars, having won nearly all the precursor awards, including top honors from the Producers Guild, the Directors Guild, the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs. In the end, “1917” went home with three awards for its technical virtuosity: Roger Deakins’ cinematography, visual effects and sound mixing.

All of the acting winners — Brad Pitt, Renée Zellweger, Joaquin Phoenix and Laura Dern — went as expected. While Pitt, notching his first acting Oscar , had regaled audiences with one-liners in the run-up to Sunday, he began his comments on a political note.

“They told me I have 45 seconds to speak, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week,” Pitt said, alluding to the impeachment hearings before mentioning director Quentin Tarantino. “I’m thinking maybe Quentin does a movie about it.”

Pitt said the honor had given him reason to reflect on his fairy-tale journey in the film industry, going back to when he moved to Los Angeles from Missouri. “Once upon a time in Hollywood,” said Pitt. “Ain’t that the truth.”

Zellweger completed a comeback , winning her second Academy Award for her fragile but indomitable Judy Garland in “Judy.” Dern won for her performance as a divorce attorney in Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story.” Accepting her first Oscar, Dern thanked her in-attendance parents, “my legends, Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern.”

Phoenix, long one of Hollywood’s most respected actors, took best actor for his limber but morose Joker. In his acceptance speech, Phoenix spoke deliberately about a host of issues, including sexism and racism in the film industry, ecological disaster and vegetarianism.

Full Coverage: Academy Awards

“I’ve been a scoundrel in my life. I’ve been selfish, I’ve been cruel at times and hard to work with. But so many of you in this room have given me a second chance,” Phoenix said. When people guide each other toward redemption, he added, “that is the best of humanity.”

He concluded quoting a lyric of his deceased brother, River Phoenix: “Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow.”

For the 87th time, no women were nominated for best director this year, a subject that was woven into the entire ceremony — and even into some attendees’ clothing. Natalie Portman wore a cape lined with the names of female filmmakers who weren’t nominated for their direction, including Lulu Wang (“The Farewell”), Greta Gerwig (“Little Women”) and Mati Diop (“Atlantics”).

Coming on a rare rainy day in Los Angeles, the ceremony was soggy and song-heavy. Some performances, like Eminem’s performance of “Lose Yourself,” were unexpected (and drew a wan response from Scorsese). All of the song nominees performed, including Elton John who won with his longtime songwriting partner Bernie Taupin for their “Rocketman” tune.

The hostless ceremony opened on a note of inclusion, with Janelle Monae performing “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” and her own song, “Come Alive,” with an assist from Billy Porter. “I’m so proud to be standing here as a black queer artist telling stories,” Monae said. “Happy Black History Month.”

Two former Oscar hosts, Chris Rock and Steve Martin, provided the opening monologue. “An incredible demotion,” Martin called it. Martin also reminded that something was missing from this year’s directing nominees. “Vaginas!” Rock replied.

There were milestones beyond “Parasite.” In winning best adapted screenplay for his Nazi satire “Jojo Rabbit,” the New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi became the first indigenous director ever to win an Oscar. He dedicated the award to “all the indigenous kids in the world who want to do art, dance and write stories.”

“We are the original storytellers,” Waititi said.

“Joker” composer Hildur Guðnadóttir became only the third woman to ever win best original score. ”To the girls, to the women, to the mothers, to the daughters who hear the music opening within, please speak up,” said Guðnadóttir. “We need to hear your voices.”

Awards were spread around to all of the best picture nominees, with the lone exception being Scorsese’s 10-time nominee “The Irishman.” When Bong mentioned his admiration of Scorsese, an impromptu tribute broke out, with the Dolby Theatre giving Scorsese a standing ovation. The car racing throwback “Ford v Ferrari” won both editing and sound editing. Gerwig’s Louisa May Alcott adaptation “Little Women” won for Jacqueline Durran’s costume design. “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood” won for Barbara Ling’s production design.

Netflix didn’t go home empty handed. Aside from Dern’s win for “Marriage Story,” the streamer’s “American Factory” won best documentary. The film is the first release from Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions.

Pixar extended its domination of the best animated film category, winning for “Toy Story 4.” It’s the 10th Pixar film to win the award and second “Toy Story” film to do so, following the previous 2010 installment.

It was an early award for the Walt Disney Co., which despite amassing a record $13 billion in worldwide box office last year and owning the network the Oscars are broadcast on, played a minor role in the ceremony. The bulk of its awards came from 20th Century Fox (“Ford v Ferrari”) and Fox Searchlight (“Jojo Rabbit”), both of which the company took control of after its $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox last year.

Disney’s ABC hoped a widely watched field of nominees — including the $1 billion-grossing “Joker” — will help viewership. Last year’s show garnered 29.6 million viewers, a 12% uptick.

Central Park Five receive standing ovation at BET Awards,http://cbsnews.com/news/central-park-5-bet-awards-regina-hall-yusef-salaam-when-they-see-us/,"The men known as the ""Central Park Five"" received roaring applause and a moniker change at the BET Awards in Los Angeles Sunday night. Regina Hall, host of the 19th annual award show, introduced Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana Jr., Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson and Antron McCray as the ""Exonerated Five.""

Hall welcomed the group onstage at the Microsoft Center, where they were met with a standing ovation. The men were wrongfully convicted of raping a woman in New York City's Central Park nearly 30 years ago — and served years in jail until DNA evidence and a serial rapist's confession bailed them out. Taking turns on the mic, all of them shared a powerful message to the audience about the truth.

""We are all on an individual journey in life,"" Wise said. ""We don't know where our journeys will take us or how they will collide with others,"" McCray added.

""I didn't know that one day would bond me to these men for the rest of our lives,"" Richardson continued.

""But I know that in telling our truth, our lives have been changed forever,"" Salaam said.

Santana Jr. concluded things: ""Your truth is the foundation your legacy will be built upon. Your truth will be the memories people keep long after you're gone.""

Their story is the subject of Academy Award-nominee Ava DuVernay's new four-part series, ""When They See Us."" She spoke to ""CBS This Morning"" about purposely avoiding the phrase Central Park Five in her title.

""For me, I was really interested in getting underneath this moniker given to them by the police, by the prosecutors, by the press — and really to humanize these boys and ask you to see them, not just the label they'd been given,"" she said.

There has been fallout in the aftermath of the series. Linda Fairstein, the woman who oversaw prosecutors interrogations in the case and novelist, was dropped by her publisher.

The exonerated men had long claimed they were coerced as teenagers to confess, after being denied food and sleep for dozens of hours. Four of the five served about seven-year sentences as juveniles, but the oldest of the group, Wise, served time as an adult. The group recounted their experiences on ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in May:

""Soon as we get in, they separate us and they start working on us,"" Salaam said. ""And I'm hearing Korey [Wise] being physically beaten in the next room. And I'm immediately beyond afraid.""

The case divided the city along racial lines, as many rushed to condemn the five black teenagers accused in the case. Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four New York papers calling for a return to the death penalty in the days after the rape.

In 2014, the city settled a lawsuit with the five for $41 million, a decision that Mr. Trump criticized."
Far-right Canadian activist Lauren Southern detained in Calais and banned from entering the UK.,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lauren-southern-far-right-canada-racist-calais-detain-uk-ban-enter-visa-a8254116.html,"Canadian far-right activist Lauren Southern has been detained in Calais and banned from entering the UK.

Ms Southern, who worked for far right Canadian site The Rebel Media, was held by Border Force in Coquelles on Monday.

A Home Office spokesperson told The Independent: “Border Force has the power to refuse entry to an individual if it is considered that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.”

Ms Southern, who supported a seaborne mission seeking to hamper the rescue of refugees, claimed British authorities had told her she was “officially banned from UK for racism” after being detained.

“They just locked me out and said 'au revoir'... Officially banned from UK for 'racism'.. Doing fine though, all the cool people are being banned anyway,” the ultra-conservative provocateur said on Twitter.

Writing in a Facebook post on Saturday, Generation Identity, a British white supremacist group, said Austrian activist Martin Sellner and his American girlfriend Britanny Pettibone, who is a YouTuber and author, were detained by the British government.

The far-right couple were refused entry at Luton Airport on Friday, also on grounds their presence was not conducive to the public good. Mr Sellner and Ms Pettibone were detained and subsequently removed from Britain on Sunday.

According to reports, Ms Southern was intending to meet Mr Sellner of the Generation Identity group and Ms Pettibone while in Britain.

But in a video interview with former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, Mr Sellner said he had planned to appear at Speaker’s Corner in Hyde Park on Sunday.

Ms Pettibone had allegedly also been planning to interview Mr Robinson - the far-right campaigner who announced he was leaving the EDL in 2013.

Dr Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher for anti-racism campaign Hope not Hate, raised concerns about Ms Southern's activism.

""We’ve been watching Lauren Southern for some time, and she has gradually become more and more extreme in her outbursts and associations,” he told The Independent in a statement.

“The decision to refuse her entry came after she distributed racist material in Luton on a recent visit to the UK.

""In our State of Hate 2018 report released earlier this month, we warned that one of the major threats we would witness this year was the linking-up between Stephen Lennon (Tommy Robinson) with North American far-right alternative media personalities such as Southern and the far-right Generation Identity (GI) movement in Europe. This has seen an unholy alliance start to come together particularly over social media but also in the offline space."
"The world's biggest seafood firms are all contributing to the deaths of more than 100,000 whales, dolphins, seals, turtles and seabirds that are killed in agony every year by discarded fishing equipment. Litter from boats becoming so bad that oceans could end up empty of edible fish.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/seafood-firms-discarded-lost-fishing-equipment-thousands-whales-dolphins-seals-die-plastic-pollution-a8244181.html,"The world’s biggest seafood firms are all contributing to the deaths of more than 100,000 whales, dolphins, seals, turtles and seabirds that are killed in agony every year by discarded fishing equipment, according to a new report.

Many of the creatures are drowned, strangled or mutilated by plastic gear lost or abandoned at sea, while others suffer “a prolonged and painful death, usually suffocating or starving” either because they cannot fish or their stomachs are full of plastic.

Campaigners believe the fishing litter problem is becoming so bad that the oceans could end up unable to provide any catches for humans to eat.

They say “ghost gear” has become a huge but overlooked threat to marine life, and 640,000 tons of it are added to the oceans each year – a rate of more than a ton every minute.

A new study analysed the approaches to fishing equipment of the world’s 15 biggest seafood companies, to rank them in five categories – but found that none could be ranked in the top two as having “best practice” or making “responsible handling” of their fishing gear integral to their business strategy.

Britain’s best known seafood giant, Young’s, was ranked in the third category, suggesting it has “work to do”.

World Animal Protection (WAP), which carried out the research, called on the Government to amend its 25-year environment plan, produced in January, to include reducing the marine plastic nuisance.

And the charity is also pressuring supermarkets to demand their suppliers clamp down on discarding the plastic and nylon nets, lines and traps that can take up to 600 years to decompose in water.

It comes after Greenpeace discovered microplastics in remote Scottish waters, which it says threaten basking sharks, gannets, puffins, razorbills and shearwaters.

In bad storms fishermen are sometimes forced to abandon gear worth thousands of pounds. But much of the ghost gear comes from illegal fishing: as unregulated crew try to avoid detection in a hurry, they are more likely to discard tackle and lines in the sea, and they don’t use marked gear.

World Animal Protection says that around the world, ghost gear made of non-biodegradable plastic and nylon kills millions of fish, with up to 30 per cent of the decline in some fish stocks attributed to it

This is in addition to the more than 100,000 whales, dolphins, seals and turtles killed. And more than seven in 10 entanglements of ocean wildlife involve plastic ghost gear such as lobster pots.

The report, entitled Ghosts beneath the Waves, says abandoned and lost gear is four times more likely to trap and kill creatures than all other forms of marine debris combined, and more than 70 per cent of visible plastic in the sea is fishing-related.

The problems also include:

Seabirds making nests with small pieces of netting and becoming entangled

Young seals playing with fishing nets that tighten around their necks or flippers

Whales, dolphins, porpoises and endangered leatherback turtles being tangled up as they swim in floating ropes, nets and lines, leading them to drown or starve

Microplastics – minuscule pieces – were found in the digestive tracts of 80 per cent of seals tested off the coast of Ireland, while other research cited found that plastic accounted for 69 per cent of the debris ingested by whales. Other studies said 98 per cent of whale entanglements involved ghost gear, while 82 per cent of North Atlantic right whales have become entangled at least once.

“This is a huge crisis of animal suffering, yet hardly anyone is talking about it,” said World Animal Protection.

In one deep water fishery in the north east Atlantic 25,000 nets have been recorded as lost or discarded each year, according to the report.

“Even within small areas, the amount of ghost gear can be staggering,” it said. “The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, for example, is estimated to be littered with 85,000 active ghost lobster and crab pots.

“Already threatened ecosystems, including shallow coral reef habitats, also suffer further degradation from ghost fishing gear. It undermines the viability of our fisheries too, as it catches and kills an enormous volume of seafood.”

In a foreword to the WAP report, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, Didier Reynders, said the deadly amounts of equipment being discarded were rising and could leave the seas barren.

“The enormous impacts of ghost gear spell out the need for urgent attention: if this deadly threat to our oceans, marine animals and ecosystems is not addressed, there is a great risk that that ghost gear will interact and combine with other current oceanic threats to create what the UN termed ‘a destructive cycle of degradation’. Ultimately this could mean our oceans simply stop providing for humans in the many ways we now rely on them,” he wrote.

“Worryingly, the level of ghost gear has increased in recent years and it is likely to grow further as fishing efforts intensify all over the world. Effective solutions are being found locally and nationally, yet I believe only a global approach can enable us to monitor and fight this threat.”

WAP found the average score in its survey on corporate responsibility was just 22 per cent, and fewer than half effectively addressed marine litter or entanglement.

Just three companies – Young’s Seafood, TriMarine and Thai Union - have established policies on lost and abandoned fishing gear, the survey found. Young’s supplies about 40 per cent of all the fish eaten in the UK, and Thai Union owns the John West brand.

Bumble Bee Seafoods, one of America’s largest seafood companies, which sells canned and pouched tuna, salmon and sardines, was among the companies showing “limited published evidence of implementing changes”.

Nearly 50,000 people have signed a World Animal Protection petition calling on supermarkets to pressure their suppliers to act responsibly. So far, only Sainsbury’s has fully committed, the group says.

Last year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced the Government would join the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI), a group founded by World Animal Protection to address the fishing litter issue.

World Animal Protection has also written to the admirals of the world’s 10 most powerful navies calling on them to increase patrols to combat illegal and unregulated fishing.

But the problem is also a local one, with fish killed and maimed by discarded tackle and lines from hobby anglers. David Jones, a volunteer diver with charity Neptune’s Army of Rubbish Cleaners, in Pembrokeshire, said seeing a fish caught on a recreational angler’s hook that had broken off in water was difficult.

“You can see the animal is suffering – if it was happening on land to our pets there’d be uproar,” he said. “But it’s always out of sight, out of mind. It’s never a nice experience to see.” The charity has been building relations with local fishermen to encourage them to report lost gear so their divers can try to retrieve it.

"Swiss voters have rejected proposal to cut taxpayer funding to public broadcasters, after campaign that stirred debate about media's role in fostering national unity...in a country that has four official languages.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/switzerland-votes-overwhelmingly-to-keep-its-public-broadcaster,"Debate focused on media’s role in fostering national unity in a country that has four official languages

Swiss voters have rejected a proposal to cut taxpayer funding to public broadcasters, after a campaign that stirred debate about the media’s role in fostering national unity.

The “No Billag” initiative – a reference to the Billag firm that collects the media licensing fee – divided Switzerland along political and generational lines.

But 71% voted “no” to the proposals on Sunday, according to official results published by the Swiss news agency ATS.

Rejection of the initiative was “a strong sign for the public service and for private regional radio and television”, said Gilles Marchand, director of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SSR).

He said he had noted criticism of SSR and announced an efficiency drive and 100m Swiss franc (£77m) investment from next year.

No Billag’s backers, led by the youth wing of the libertarian Free Democratic party (PLR), sought to portray the SSR as an unfairly dominant and outdated relic. Switzerland’s largest party, the nationalist and anti-migrant Swiss Peoples party (UDC), had also thrown its support behind the initiative.

SSR, which received about 1.2bn Swiss francs from the licence fee last year – or three-quarters of its budget – delivers news in the country’s four official languages: German, French, Italian and Romansch. Many credit it for guaranteeing that all Swiss residents receive information of crucial public interest, along with a range of opinion and analysis.

But No Billag’s proponents argued that freeing taxpayers of the 451-Swiss franc annual fee would unlock new economic potential, create a more competitive media sector and ultimately foster more choice. The cost is due to drop to 365 Swiss francs next year, but everyone will have to pay, even if they do not own a television or radio, after the government decided both platforms were watched and listened to via the internet.

Sunday’s poll was part of Switzerland’s direct democracy system, where proposed initiatives face a national vote four times a year. Turnout reached 54%, nearly 10% above the recent average.

A broad political coalition along with prominent athletes, filmmakers and even the chief executive of top Swiss bank UBS, Sergio Ermotti, came out in defence of public media. The committee formed to fight No Billag warned that with a substantial majority of the country’s wealth concentrated in German-speaking areas, programming would increasingly skew to that audience."
"Grooming gangs 'are abusing girls across the country', victims and investigators warn",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/grooming-gangs-asian-muslim-across-country-uk-girls-children-women-bradford-rotherham-newcastle-a7987381.html,"Grooming gangs across the country are repeating the horrific abuse exposed in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford and most recently Newcastle, victims and investigators have warned.

There are mounting calls for nationwide action to combat sexual exploitation, with authorities accused of playing catch-up after ignoring victims “for decades and decades”.

Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused as a teenager by the Rotherham ringleader Arshid “Mad Ash” Hussain and has waived her right to anonymity, said abuse was underway “all over the country”.

“It’s an issue for every town and city, more people are being failed,” she told The Independent. “I’m hearing a lot of new complaints from survivors.

“Some are saying they have been to the police and didn’t get taken seriously, others are getting support.

“But I think the Government is still trying to play this down and make out it’s not a major issue – they are not doing enough.”

Her calls for action came as figures show that in Bradford 1,153 referrals were made to its child sexual exploitation team in 2016/17 – a 62 per cent increase on the year before.

Bradford Metropolitan District Council’s specialist hub launched interventions for 861 children – including many who were referred more than once. The vast majority of possible victims are girls.

Ms Woodhouse said she had also noted a growing number of grooming victims contacting her who were from the city.

Authorities behind an investigation that identified more than 700 women and girls as potential victims of sexual exploitation in North East England believe the abuse is happening far beyond areas where perpetrators have been caught.

Pat Ritchie, the chief executive of Newcastle City Council, said “any area that says it does not have a problem is simply not looking for it”, while chief constable Steve Ashman of Northumbria Police told The Independent: “I think there’s every likelihood that this is happening in every town and city across the country.”

Operation Sanctuary: ""We do not believe that what we have uncovered is unique to Newcastle""

Dame Vera Baird, victims lead for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), also fears grooming is taking place nationwide.

She told The Independent that investigators in Newcastle found that women and girls were being trafficked beyond the city, suggesting “there is a market” elsewhere.

Dame Vera, who is the Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner, said the race or religion of perpetrators did not “make the slightest bit of difference” to investigators.

“I think an important point to make is some of the victims were Asian as well,” she added.

“This is about misogyny, and young women are in vulnerable situations whatever their race or anything related to that.”

Ms Woodhouse said her abusers and all those reported to her by other victims were from Muslim backgrounds.

“Nobody is saying that all Muslims commit abuse, but by saying it’s not an issue you’re silencing the victims,” she added.

Ms Woodhouse, who is now 32, said she knew one girl who was “read statements from the Quran” while being raped and said she was made to eat halal, while Mad Ash wanted to make her his second wife under Sharia law.

The proportion of white British victims of sexual exploitation prompted intense national debate in August, where the former director of public prosecution Lord McDonald called grooming a “profoundly racist crime”, despite a judge later finding victims in Newcastle were not targeted by race.

Men from a wide range of nationalities, races and religions have been prosecuted as part of grooming gangs but the prevalence of abusers from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds has been a point of controversy.

Ms Woodhouse was outraged by the sacking of Rotherham MP Sarah Champion from the Shadow Cabinet over a newspaper article in her name that claimed “Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls”.

She warned that if British society does not have “open and honest conversations” on the factors and attitudes driving grooming, the far-right will be able to control the debate.

“There’s more than the religion factor involved,” Ms Woodhouse added. “Abusers see girls and women are there to have sex, like we’re their property.

“There’s so much controversy but we need to talk about it.”

Lawyers defending alleged abusers in court have stated that several perpetrators were in forced marriages or under cultural restrictions that made them unable to have normal or varied relationships.

Dipu Ahad, a councillor in Newcastle, said grooming was not just an issue for South Asian communities, adding “the only box they fit into is of abusers”.

“In the biggest cases we’ve seen recently, we can’t deny they’re Asian men,” he told The Independent.

“This is an opportunity to look at how we use our communities, our culture, our religion to combat these issues.”

Mr Ahad said the grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford and Newcastle were “not followers of Islam but were from Muslim communities”.

He called for ethnic minority groups to be given the tools to debate views on women and relationships without making them feel targeted, adding: “Discussions need to happen now because God forbid there might be another city or another town.”

In Bradford, white children were over-represented in the latest figures among those affected compared to the general population, making up 70 per cent of open cases, compared to 16 per cent Asian and 7 per cent mixed.

The council is running a number of safeguarding initiatives and is training teachers, taxi drivers, shopkeepers and bar owners to spot suspicious behaviour, while running education programmes in schools.

Local groups have also started a project running sessions with men and boys from Pakistani backgrounds, including imams and Islamic schools.

Meanwhile, West Yorkshire Police is running a dedicated investigation, Operation Dalesway, with 66 suspects arrested so far, 10 charged and eight ongoing investigations.

Assistant chief constable Catherine Hankinson said child sexual exploitation was a “top priority” and proactive work was ongoing to identify those at risk.

“All reports alleging child abuse in West Yorkshire are investigated by specially trained officers to identify offences and those suspected of committing them,” she added.

“Safeguarding children is everyone’s responsibility and I would urge anyone with concerns over a vulnerable child to contact the police so swift action can be taken to address the issue.”

Ms Woodhouse said police have drastically improved training on grooming, which aims to eradicate the kind of treatment that saw her arrested after being found in bed with her much older abuser, as he walked free.

She is working with the Department of Education on relationship advice and helps authorities conduct specialist training, and is also proposing a law to pardon victims for crimes committed under duress.

Ms Woodhouse said “victim blaming” needed to be combated and urged the criminal justice system to implement measures making it less distressing for girls to come forward, adding: “The response is getting a lot better but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “This Government has done more than any other to tackle child sexual exploitation, declaring it a national threat and investing millions of pounds to enable officers to actively seek out and bring offenders to justice. This has led to a huge increase in police activity and a marked rise in prosecutions and convictions.

“We are continuing the urgent work of overhauling how our police, social services and other agencies work together to protect vulnerable children, especially from the kind of organised grooming and sexual exploitation that has come to light in towns and cities across the UK."
Corbyn tightens grip with resignation of Scottish Labour leader,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-scotland-labour-idUSKCN1BA1ED?il=0,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - The leader of Scottish Labour said she had resigned “on her own terms” in a move that will most likely cement leftist leader Jeremy Corbyn’s hold on a party which is struggling to regain traction in Scotland.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

Kezia Dugdale, who led for two years when Labour saw its support plummet following a Scottish independence referendum, told the BBC late on Tuesday she was leaving the role to hand over to someone with “fresh energy”.

She denied she was being pushed out, saying: “I’m going on my own terms.”

A critic of Corbyn, Dugdale is stepping down at a time when the Labour leader’s popularity is rising and even more centrist Scottish Labour lawmakers such as Anas Sarwar have praised him for being “a different kind of leader” who seeks to unite.

Local media suggest Sarwar could be a candidate to take over from Dugdale.

Labour National Executive Committee member Rhia Wolfson told the BBC the party needed a figure who could build support across Britain as whole.

“The national picture is what is key for Scottish Labour here and ... in terms of what we need in the next (Scottish) leadership (that) is someone who is going to build on that national picture vision,” she said.

Labour has struggled to tackle the pro-independence Scottish National Party, as well as a resurgent Scottish Conservative Party which is winning some unionists - those who want to remain in the United Kingdom - under leader Ruth Davidson.

A new leader will also need a clear voice on Brexit, particularly since Scotland, one of the UK’s four nations, voted to stay in the European Union along with Northern Ireland. Wales and England voted to leave.

Corbyn has been credited with boosting Labour’s popularity in Scotland at a June national election with promises of renationalizing services such as the railways and ending economic austerity policies.

Labour now has seven of Scotland’s 59 seats having fallen to just one seat in the 2015 election. Its position is still weak for a party that for decades dominated Scottish politics and had 41 seats in 2005.

Winning Scottish seats in the past gave Labour a springboard for a majority in Britain’s 650-seat national parliament in London.

Labour’s other big challenge will be to clarify what it will offer Scotland on the independence question after Scots rejected independence by a 10 point margin in 2014.

Corbyn clashed with Dugdale earlier this year when he said he would “open discussions” over a second Scottish independence referendum. The party’s official stance in Scotland was to “firmly oppose” a second referendum."
"Massive leak of 198 million US voter records is ""largest ever""",http://www.zdnet.com/article/security-lapse-exposes-198-million-united-states-voter-records/,"A huge trove of voter data, including personal information and voter profiling data on what's thought to be every registered US voter dating back more than a decade, has been found on an exposed and unsecured server, ZDNet has learned.

It's believed to be the largest ever known exposure of voter information to date.

The various databases containing 198 million records on American voters from all political parties were found stored on an open Amazon S3 storage server owned by a Republican data analytics firm, Deep Root Analytics.

UpGuard cyber risk analyst Chris Vickery, who found the exposed server, verified the data. Through his responsible disclosure, the server was secured late last week, and prior to publication.

This leak shines a spotlight on the Republicans' multi-million dollar effort to better target potential voters by utilizing big data. The move largely a response to the successes of the Barack Obama campaign in 2008, thought to have been the first data-driven campaign.

Through a handful of companies, including data firms, market researchers, and analytics providers, the GOP replicated that Obama campaign strategy by helping its political candidates make data-based decisions about their campaigns.

The exposed records include files provided by Data Trust, a data warehouse created by the GOP to serve as its exclusive data provider of voter records. The company sells and supplies voter data to political candidates, who rely on access to the data in order to shape their campaigns.

According to UpGuard, the folder includes dozens of spreadsheets containing a unique GOP identifier for each voter for the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, which link to ""dozens of sensitive and personally identifying data points, making it possible to piece together a striking amount of detail on individual Americans specified by name."" A folder containing 2016 data only included files for Ohio and Florida, two crucial battleground states.

Each record lists a voter's name, date of birth, home address, phone number, and voter registration details, such as which political party a person is registered with. The data also includes ""profiling"" information, voter ethnicities and religions, and various other kinds of information pertinent to a voter's political persuasions and preferences, as modeled by the firms' data scientists, in order to better target political advertising.

Senior executives at Data Trust would not speak on the record prior to publication.

The exposed server was also found to contain gigabytes of data from TargetPoint, a conservative market research firm focused on helping candidates better understand voters' policy preferences and political actions. Some of these files, says UpGuard, contain millions of entries that appear to rate voters on the post-election likelihood of supporting a certain policy, candidate, or belief on a scale of ""very unlikely"" to ""very likely.""

An email to TargetPoint prior to publication went unanswered. (If we hear back, we will update.)

Deep Root, which claims to be the ""most experienced group of targeters in Republican politics,"" uses that wealth of data to help its political clients make better decisions when buying television advertising air-time.

That, the hope is, allows prospective Republican candidates and their committees to target pro-trade Republicans who might vote blue, and Democrats who want tighter immigration controls who can be convinced to vote red.

Alex Lundry, co-founder of Deep Root, confirmed the company owned the Amazon S3 storage server, and said in an email that company has taken ""full responsibility for this situation.""

""Deep Root Analytics has become aware that a number of files within our online storage system were accessed without our knowledge,"" said Lundry.

""The data that was accessed was, to the best of our knowledge proprietary information as well as voter data that is publicly available and readily provided by state government offices. Since this event has come to our attention, we have updated the access settings and put protocols in place to prevent further access.""

We accept full responsibility, will continue with our investigation, and based on the information we have gathered thus far, we do not believe that our systems have been hacked,"" he said.

This isn't the first batch of voter data found by Vickery.

Vickery, who we profiled on ZDNet earlier this year, found 87 million Mexican voter records in an exposed database in 2016.

He was also responsible for discovering several US voter databases online totaling 18 million voters, and the state of Louisiana's entire database of 2.9 million voters.

Deep Root's exposure also appears to be larger than the 191 million voter records exposed in late 2015, and another massive leak of 154 million voter records a year later."
"India's Mars Mission Completes 1,000 Earth Days in Orbit",http://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/indias-mars-mission-completes-1000-earth-days-in-orbit/970925,"The country's low-cost Mars mission spacecraft that is on a rendezvous with the Red planet for an extended period completed 1,000 earth days in its orbit today.

""MOM completes 1,000 earth days in its orbit, today (June 19, 2017) well beyond its designed mission life of six months. 1,000 earth days corresponds to 973.24 Mars Sols (Martian Solar day) and MOM completed 388 orbits,"" ISRO said.

The satellite is in good health and continues to work as expected, it said, adding that scientific analysis of the data received from the Mars Orbiter spacecraft is in progress.

India on September 24, 2014 successfully placed the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) spacecraft in orbit around Mars in its very first attempt, breaking into an elite club.

ISRO had launched the spacecraft on its nine-month-long odyssey on a homegrown PSLV rocket from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on November 5, 2013 and it had escaped the earth's gravitational field on December 1, 2013.

Citing surplus fuel as the reason, ISRO in March, 2015 had first announced that the spacecraft's life was extended for another six months. Later in June, 2015 its Chairman A S Kiran Kumar had said it has enough fuel for it to last ""many years"".

The Rs 450-crore MOM mission is to study the Martian surface and mineral composition, and scan its atmosphere for methane, an indicator of life on Mars.

The Mars Orbiter has five scientific instruments - Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP), Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM), Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA), Mars Colour Camera (MCC) and Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS).

The Mars Colour Camera, one of the scientific payloads onboard MOM, has produced more than 715 images so far, ISRO said.

During its journey so far, MOM has gone through a communication 'blackout' as a result of solar conjunction from June 2, 2015 to July 2, 2015.

It experienced the 'whiteout' geometry (when the Earth is between the Sun and Mars and too much solar radiation may make it impossible to communicate with Earth) during May 18 to May 30, 2016.

An orbital manoeuvre was also performed on MOM spacecraft to avoid the impending long eclipse duration for the satellite.

ISRO had also launched MOM Announcement of Opportunity (AO) programmes for researchers in the country to use MOM data for R&D.

To expand inter-planetary research, ISRO is seeking scientific proposals for Mars Orbiter Mission-2, the government said in November last year."
"Saudi woman defies driving ban, saving man's life",https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/5/12/saudi-woman-defies-driving-ban-saving-mans-life,"A Saudi student has been hailed for her heroics after she ignored the country's ban on women driving, and drove an incapacitated bus driver to safety.

In Saudi Arabia, where women are banned from driving cars, a female university student has heroically driven a bus driver to safety after he suffered a stroke while behind the wheel.

Ashwaq al-Shamri this week saved the life of the driver in the northwestern city of Hail as he transported her home from university along with several of her female classmates.

""The driver told us that he felt dizzy and then suddenly stopped,"" Shamri told Saudi newspaper Okaz.

""Me and my colleagues got out, carried him and sat him in the back of the bus. They tried to give him first aid and I drove to the nearest shop on the agricultural road to get him cold water,"" the 20-year-old said.

She explained that the nearest hospital was miles away so she then took him to his house, where his family were able to rush him to hospital just in time to make a full recovery.

The university student's father, a local teacher, had taught her to drive at a young age to help with labour on their farmland.

Commenting on the incident he said: ""I am extremely proud of my daughter... her work on the farm has been part of her responsibilities since she was young.""

The ban on women driving has been hotly contested in recent years with prominent figures coming out and endorsing a lift on the prohibition, which is unique to the kingdom.

Last year, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said that he wanted an ""urgent"" end to the ban, arguing that overturning the law was a matter of women's rights and economic necessity.

Since 2011, Saudi activists on social media galvanised by the Arab Spring have expressed their dismay about their patriarchal society with online campaigns such as #Women2Drive.

Earlier this month, King Salman issued orders backing the relaxation of rules on male guardianship over Saudi women - a small step forward towards gender equality.

The orders are alleged to include the provision that Saudi women can access government services - including education and healthcare - without a male's consent."

"Loving-kindness meditation, which helps people cultivate warm and friendly feelings towards others, slows cellular aging, demonstrated by less telomere attrition than control group, suggests a new randomized controlled trial (n=142).",http://psypost.org/2019/08/study-provides-evidence-that-loving-kindness-meditation-slows-cellular-aging-54316,"In new research published in Psychoneuroendocrinology, scientists have shown that loving-kindness meditation has a positive impact at the cellular level. The study examined how different types of meditation influenced telomere length, an indicator of physiological aging.

Telomeres are the end caps of DNA on our chromosomes, which help in DNA replication and get shorter over time.

“Chronological age and biological age are not identical. The former is measured in years, whereas the latter is often indexed by telomere length,” the authors of the new study explained. “Telomeres progressively shorten with cell division (i.e., aging) in general, but may also be replenished, or lengthened, by the enzyme telomerase.”

For their 12-week long study, the researchers recruited 176 participants between 35-64 years old from Durham and Orange County of North Carolina. All of the participants reported having little to no meditation experience.

The participants were randomly assigned to a 6-week loving-kindness meditation workshop, a 6-week mindfulness meditation workshop, or a waitlist control group. To measure telomere length, the researchers collected blood samples from the participants at the beginning and end of the study.

While the mindfulness meditation workshop helped the participants to cultivate a nonjudgmental attitude and focus on the present moment, the loving-kindness meditation workshop helped the participants to cultivate warm and friendly feelings towards others.

Overall, telomere length tended to shorten for everyone. “However, the daily practice of loving-kindness meditation appeared to buffer against that attrition,” the researchers said. Participants in the loving-kindness group “showed no significant telomere shortening over time.”

“Whereas participants in the mindfulness group, on average, showed significant telomere shortening over time, those changes were intermediate between the loving-kindness meditation and waitlist control groups,” the researchers added.

The study is not the first to find a relationship between meditation and telomere length.

Research published in the journal Cancer in 2014 found that telomeres maintained their length in breast cancer survivors who practiced mindfulness meditation. Additionally, a 2018 study in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity found that telomere length actually increased in meditation retreat participants after three weeks.

But the new study was the first to compare loving-kindness meditation and mindfulness meditation.

The underlying mechanism that links meditation and the aging process is still unclear. The participants provided daily emotion reports throughout the study, but changes in positive and negative emotions had no relationship to changes in telomere length.

The study, “Loving-kindness meditation slows biological aging in novices: Evidence from a 12-week randomized controlled trial“, was authored by Khoa D. Le Nguyen, Jue Lin, Sara B. Algoe, Mary M. Brantley, Sumi L. Kim, Jeffrey Brantley, Sharon Salzberg, and Barbara L. Fredrickson."
"thanks to better climate models, swelling libraries of earlier analyses, and our improving understanding of these systems, researchers can now often say with virtual certainty that climate change made a particular event more likely or more severe.",http://technologyreview.com/s/614162/heat-waves-climate-change-extreme-weather-attribution-hurricanes-droughts-climate-model/,"A week after heat waves toppled records across Europe late last month, scientists were ready to declare that climate change almost certainly drove the deadly hot stretch.

On August 2, while the same heat wave was turning Greenland’s ice sheets into slush, World Weather Attribution reported that decades of greenhouse-gas emissions had raised the odds of such extreme weather by a factor of as much as 100 in some regions.

“Over France and the Netherlands, such temperatures would have had extremely little chance to occur without human influence on climate,” concluded the group, a kind of international rapid-response team set up to assess the potential role of climate change in extreme weather events that have recently occurred.

Just a few years ago, climate scientists’ standard response to questions about the cause of specific storms, floods, and droughts was, as the National Academies of Sciences noted in a 2016 paper, basically a shrug: “We cannot attribute any single event to climate change.”

But thanks to better climate models, swelling libraries of earlier analyses, and our improving understanding of these systems, researchers can now often say with virtual certainty that climate change made a particular event more likely or more severe.

These studies are giving researchers, policymakers, and the public a clearer sense of how far we’ve already diverged from the 100-year droughts and 1,000-year floods of the recent past and, in turn, what sorts of steps may be required to combat the rising threats.

“With this kind of science, we’re starting to understand what climate change really means,” says Friederike Otto, acting director of the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute and co-investigator at World Weather Attribution.

Crucially, she says, the work also helps researchers test and refine climate models, in part by underscoring when, as with the European heat waves, climate change is accelerating faster than projections would indicate.

Detecting the climate signal

A growing number of regions are exploring or actively setting up efforts to quickly assess the role of climate change in unfolding events, including the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service and the Australian, French, and German meteorological agencies.

World Weather Attribution is a loosely organized international collaboration of researchers at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. In the wake of a severe weather event, they begin by attempting to determine its characteristics and the conditions in which it formed. The researchers look at measures such as atmospheric pressure patterns and levels of water vapor by analyzing observational data from satellites, weather stations, and other sources.

But to determine cause and effect, you need to run controlled experiments that isolate the possible variables, says Noah Diffenbaugh, a Stanford climate scientist. Since researchers can’t do that on the climate itself, they often rely on powerful computer models."
Hundreds of people gathered at the world's most famous zebra crossing on Thursday to mark the 50th anniversary of the day the Beatles created one of the best-known album covers in music history and an image imitated by countless fans ever since.,https://reuters.com/article/us-music-beatles-abbey-road/crowds-gather-to-mark-50th-anniversary-of-the-beatles-abbey-road-album-photo-idUSKCN1UY0XD,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of people gathered at the world’s most famous zebra crossing on Thursday to mark the 50th anniversary of the day the Beatles created one of the best-known album covers in music history and an image imitated by countless fans ever since.

The picture of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr striding over the pedestrian crossing on Abbey Road was taken outside the EMI Recording Studios where they made the 1969 album of the same name.

To mark the anniversary, a special ‘Abbey Road’ package featuring new mixes of the album’s 17 tracks in stereo and 23 session recordings and demos, will be released on Sept. 27 by Apple Corps/Capitol/UMe, the record companies said on Thursday.

Scottish photographer Iain Macmillan took just six shots of the group on the crossing, with the fifth used as the cover of the band’s 11th studio album, released on Sept. 26 1969.

The picture shows Lennon in a white suit leading the group across the road. Starr wears a black suit while McCartney is barefoot, out of step and holding a cigarette. Harrison is in blue denim. A Volkswagen Beetle is parked in the background.

On Thursday, the Beetle was back in position while traffic crawled along the crowded street as dozens of fans paraded on the black and white painted crossing for souvenir photos.

Beatles insider and former Apple Records executive Tony Bramwell said nobody at the time was really aware that ‘Abbey Road’ would be one of the group’s last releases.

‘Let It Be’ was the final Beatles album, but it was mostly recorded before ‘Abbey Road’.

“In cultural terms it’s become iconic; the sleeve, the songs, the stories behind the songs,” Bramwell told Reuters.

He said the original idea for the picture had been McCartney’s. Asked why McCartney was barefoot, a subject of endless debate for fans, he replied: “It was hot.”

Abbey Road, which was voted the best Beatles album by readers of Rolling Stone in 2009, was the only one of the group’s original British albums to show neither the band’s name nor a title on the cover.

The album was the last to be recorded by all four members of the band together, and it had tracks written by each of them, including ‘Come Together’ by Lennon, ‘Here Comes the Sun’ by Harrison, ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’ by McCartney, and Starr’s ‘Octopus’s Garden’.

Lawmaker Louise Ellman, who represents Liverpool Riverside, said she had come down to join the celebrations.

“Everyone in Liverpool is a firm fan of the Beatles and captivated by their story and how they started off as local boys messing around with guitars and music, and became international idols,” she said.

Maggie Younis, a 43-year-old from Fort Wayne, Indiana, said she had taken a photograph with McCartney outside the studios 22 years ago when she was on a Beatles walking tour.

She was joined on Thursday by her friend Dawn Rigby, who was on the same tour. “We met that night waiting for Paul and out he came,” she said.

Less than a year after Abbey Road was released, rock music’s best-selling band had split up, ending a decade-long musical revolution that transformed popular music.

The studios, which were later renamed Abbey Road, and the zebra crossing in north London were granted protected status by the government in 2010."
Revolutionary Blast Furnace Vaporizes Trash and Turns It into Clean Energy (Without Any Emissions) & Can Be Used As Alternative to Current Fuel Types.,http://fastcompany.com/90382101/this-startup-just-raised-33-million-to-vaporize-trash,"When trash ends up in landfills, it’s not just taking up space, but as it breaks down, it also becomes a major source of methane, a greenhouse gas as much as 86 times as potent as CO2. As garbage grows around the world —like a mountain of trash outside New Delhi known locally as Mount Everest, which stands higher than 200 feet tall—so does the problem.

One startup wants to eliminate the pollution by essentially vaporizing garbage to turn it into clean energy and fuel. The company, called Sierra Energy, just raised a $33 million Series A investment round led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the Bill Gates-led fund that also includes investors like Marc Benioff, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos.

The company isn’t aiming to replace recycling or composting, but to handle the millions of tons of waste that currently goes to landfills. “We take what’s leftover,” says CEO Mike Hart. The technology can process nearly anything, including medical waste and hazardous waste. “It allows you to recycle the entire waste stream,” he says. “The way we do that is by bringing the temperature of waste up to 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, twice the temperature at the core of a volcano. At that temperature, everything breaks down molecularly.”

The technology, called FastOx, uses a modified blast furnace, the same basic equipment typically used to make steel. By injecting pure oxygen into the furnace, the new process starts a chemical reaction with carbon in the waste, heating up the furnace. “This doesn’t require external energy,” Hart says. “It’s just a chemical reaction of carbon and oxygen.” The process also adds steam to regulate the temperature, which sustains itself as the system keeps feeding in more trash. Any metal inside the garbage melts and can later be reused.

While other trash would create methane as it rots in a landfill, the extreme heat of the process and the steam create only carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Unlike an incinerator, it doesn’t produce emissions as it works; all of the gas is captured for reuse. The gas can be used to create a variety of products, from jet fuel to plastic or fertilizer, instead of making those products from fossil fuels. If the gas is used to make fuel, that fuel will still produce emissions, but fewer than the fossil alternative. (The company’s diesel, Hart says, is 20 times cleaner than the California fuel standard.) The company’s hydrogen can also power vehicles without emissions. The gas can also be used to produce electricity through fuel cells, gas turbines, or other equipment.

After a decade of smaller pilots, the company has a new plant located on an Army base in California where it takes in garbage, shreds it into smaller pieces, and feeds it into the furnace. At the demonstration plant, it’s also showing how the process can create both fuel and electricity (future plants will do one or the other). Since landfills charge “tipping fees” to take trash, the new system could actually save money; a waste hauler that currently pays a landfill, for example, could decide to build its own system using the technology and then could both avoid paying fees and make money by selling electricity or products like fuel. Cities could also decide to build plants of their own. “What we found is that people can make a profit at less than the current tipping fees in most countries in the world,” Hart says."

Ilhan Omar receives a hero's welcome at Minneapolis airport,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7263079/Ilhan-Omar-receives-heros-welcome-Minneapolis-airport.html,"Advertisement

Rep. Ilhan Omar has blasted President Donald Trump in her home district, one day after his supporters chanted 'send her back' of the congresswoman.

A crowd of supporters holding signs that read 'Stand with Ilhan' and 'Stop racism now' met her Thursday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport as she arrived from Washington DC.

'Welcome home Ilhan!' the crowd chanted as Omar arrived in the airport terminal.

'It feels good to be home,' Omar said into a bullhorn at the airport, telling the crowd that Trump's policies are 'fascist' and vowing to be a 'nightmare' for him.

'His nightmare is seeing a Somali immigrant refugee rise to Congress,' she said. 'His nightmare is seeing the beautiful mosaic fabric of our country welcome someone like me as their member of Congress home to Minnesota.'

'He's threatened because we are inspiring people to dream about a country that recognizes their dignity and humanity,' Omar said of Trump.

'We are going to continue to be a nightmare to this president, because his policies are a nightmare to us,' she said.

Omar later held a town hall about 'Medicare for all' on Thursday night in her Minneapolis district.

She received a standing ovation at the town hall, but declined to mention Trump by name during the 90-minute event focused on healthcare.

'I know there are a lot of people that are trying to distract us now, but I want you all to know that we are not going to let them,' Omar told the crowd at the town hall. 'I'm going to continue to do the work on behalf of the 5th (District), because you all send me to Washington to do the important work of progressing our country.'

Trump on Thursday chided his supporters who chanted 'send her back' when he questioned the loyalty of the Somali-born congresswoman, claiming he had tried to stop the chant at a campaign event Wednesday night in North Carolina.

However, the crowd's 'send her back' shouts resounded for 13 seconds as Trump made no attempt to interrupt them. He paused in his speech and surveyed the scene, taking in the uproar.

'I started speaking really quickly,' he told reporters Thursday. 'I was not happy with it. I disagree with it' and 'would certainly try' to stop any similar chant at a future rally.

Omar was pressed for a response on Thursday.

'This is what this president and his supporters have turned our country' into, she said as she walked outside the U.S. Capitol. 'This is not about me. This is about fighting about what this country truly should be and what it deserves to be.'

'I believe he is fascist,' she said.

The freshman congresswoman, a hijab-wearing Muslim, has fast become a leading face of the 'resistance' to Trump and his politics, winning fans at home and far beyond.

Trump started the week's tumult by tweeting Sunday that Omar and three other freshmen congresswomen could 'go back' to their native countries if they were unhappy here.

His other targets - all Trump detractors - were Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.

All are American citizens, and all but Omar was born in the U.S. She fled to America as a child with her family from violence-wracked Somalia.

The president did not back down from his criticism of Omar on Thursday.

They have 'a big obligation and the obligation is to love your country,' he said. 'There's such hatred. They have such hatred.'

Citing Trump's rhetoric, House Democrats said they were discussing arranging security for Omar and the three other congresswomen.

The Democratic-led House voted Tuesday to condemn Trump's tweets as racist. On Wednesday, it rejected a resolution by one Democrat to impeach Trump that was opposed by party leaders as premature.

The chants at the Trump rally brought scathing criticism from GOP lawmakers as well as from Democrats, though the Republicans did not fault Trump himself.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California declared that the chant has 'no place in our party and no place in this country.'

Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted that it was 'ugly, wrong, & would send chills down the spines of our Founding Fathers. This ugliness must end, or we risk our great union.'

Even by Trump's standards, the campaign rally offered an extraordinary tableau for American politics: a president drinking in a crowd's cries to expel a congresswoman from the country who's his critic and a woman of color.

It was also the latest demonstration of how Trump's verbal cannonades are capable of dominating the news. Democrats had hoped the spotlight on Thursday would be on House passage of legislation to boost the minimum wage for the first time in a decade.

To many GOP ears, this time the attention wasn't all positive.

Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, a conservative who attended Trump's rally, told reporters at the Capitol that the chant 'does not need to be our campaign call like we did 'Lock her up' last time.'

That was a reference to a 2016 campaign mantra that Trump continues to encourage aimed at that year's Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.

Walker, who called the chant 'offensive,' was among about 10 House GOP leaders who had breakfast Thursday with Vice President Mike Pence at Pence's residence in Washington. Walker said he cautioned Pence that attention to the chant could distract voters next year from the economy and other themes Republicans want to emphasize.

'We don't need to take it that far where we change the narrative of the story,' he said he told Pence.

Trump has harshly criticized the 'squad' of freshman Congresswomen (left to right): Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

The lawmakers attending agreed that the chant was inappropriate and could prove a harmful distraction, and Pence concurred and said he'd discuss it with Trump, said another participant who described the conversation on condition of anonymity.

In North Carolina, Trump berated each of the four congresswomen and said: 'They never have anything good to say. That's why I say, 'Hey if you don't like it, let 'em leave, let 'em leave.'' He added, 'I think in some cases they hate our country.'

His criticism of Omar included an accusation that she has voiced pride in al-Qaida, a reference to a video clip of her complaining that people use a sinister tone when referring to the terror group that they do not use when mentioning the U.S. military.

Among the Democrats criticizing Trump and his rally, 2020 presidential contender Joe Biden said Trump was exploiting race relations to excite his base and should have quieted the crowd.

'Let me hear you say 'I condemn them,'' the former vice president said of Trump following a campaign event in Los Angeles.

Underscoring the rocky period, House chaplain Pat Conroy's opening prayer Thursday began, 'This has been a difficult and contentious week in which darker spirits seem to have been at play in the people's house. In your most holy name, I now cast out the spirit of darkness from this chamber.'"

Hundreds of tonnes of an “antibiotic of last resort” – only used in the most extreme cases of sickness - are shipped to India each year to be used, without medical supervision, on animals that may not require the drugs but are being dosed with them nevertheless to promote the growth of healthy animals.



Routine use of some of the strongest antibiotics, which doctors have said should be preserved for the most extreme cases lest resistance to them should increase and prevent their use for the diseases for which they are intended, is now a common practice in farming in the developing world. The consequences will be felt throughout the world because resistance to strong antibiotics is spread among organisms.

Germs with qualities that can make them dangerous to humans will, if untreated or poorly treated, mutate into more powerful pathogens that are resistant to treatment. Poor or inadequate public heath treatments assists this process, potentially spreading pathogens around the world.

A study by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has found that hundreds of tonnes of colistin, described as an antibiotic of last resort, have been shipped to India for the routine treatment of animals, chiefly chickens, on farms.

The finding is concerning because the use of such powerful drugs can lead to an increasing resistance among farm animals around the world. Colistin is regarded as one of the last lines of defence against serious diseases, including pneumonia, which cannot be treated by other medicines. Without these drugs, diseases that were commonly treatable in the last century will become deadly once again.

There is nothing to prevent Indian farmers, which include some of the world’s biggest food producers, from exporting their chickens and other related products overseas. There are currently no regulations that would prevent such export to the UK on hygiene terms, except for those agreed under the EU. Any regulations to be negotiated after Brexit might not take account of these regulations."

Attorney General Sessions orders fresh look at Uranium One deal,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/prosecutors-ask-fbi-agents-info-uranium-one-deal-n831436,"On the orders of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Justice Department prosecutors have begun asking FBI agents to explain the evidence they found in a now dormant criminal investigation into a controversial uranium deal that critics have linked to Bill and Hillary Clinton, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News.

The interviews with FBI agents are part of the Justice Department's effort to fulfill a promise an assistant attorney general made to Congress last month to examine whether a special counsel was warranted to look into what has become known as the Uranium One deal, a senior Justice Department official said.

At issue is a 2010 transaction in which the Obama Administration allowed the sale of U.S. uranium mining facilities to Russia's state atomic energy company. Hillary Clinton was secretary of state at the time, and the State Department was one of nine agencies that agreed to approve the deal after finding no threat to U.S. national security.

A senior law enforcement official who was briefed on the initial FBI investigation told NBC News there were allegations of corruption surrounding the process under which the U.S. government approved the sale. But no charges were filed.

As the New York Times reported in April 2015, some of the people associated with the deal contributed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 for a Moscow speech by a Russian investment bank with links to the transaction.

Hillary Clinton has denied playing any role in the decision by the State Department to approve the sale, and the State Department official who approved it has said Clinton did not intervene in the matter. That hasn't stopped some Republicans, including President Trump, from calling the arrangement corrupt — and urging that Clinton be investigated.

In a letter to Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Stephen Boyd said Justice Department lawyers would make recommendations to Sessions about whether an investigation should be opened or expanded, or whether a special counsel should be appointed to probe a number of issues of concern to Republicans.

In recent weeks, FBI agents who investigated the case have been asked by Justice Department prosecutors to describe the results of their probe. The agents also have been asked if there was any improper effort to squash a prosecution, the law enforcement sources say.

The senior Justice Department official said the questions were part of an effort by the Sessions team to get up to speed on the controversial case, in the face of allegations from Congressional Republicans that it was mishandled.

An FBI spokesman declined to comment.

On June 8, 2010, Uranium One announced it had signed an agreement to sell a majority stake to the mining arm of Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy agency.

At the time, Uranium One's two licensed mining operations in Wyoming amounted to about 20 percent of all uranium mining production capacity in the U.S, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (That figure has since decreased.)

Because enriched uranium is a component of nuclear weapons, the deal required a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States.

As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, The New York Times reported, Uranium One's Canadian chairman, Ian Telfer, used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the foundation, the Times reported, despite a promise to publicly identify all donors. The foundation later said it made a mistake.

Others associated with Uranium One also donated to the Clinton Foundation, according to the Times.

Sen John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, raised objections to the sale, saying it would ""give the Russian government control over a sizable portion of America's uranium production capacity.""

The U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan also raised concerns in cables to Clinton's State Department that Rosatom was acting on behalf of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, to gobble up uranium mines after Russia felt ""squeezed"" by having their uranium imports limited by other countries.

Nonetheless, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, approved the deal by a unanimous vote, according to public reports. Clinton was just one member of the nine member CFIUS by virtue of her role as Secretary of State. The other eight members of CFIUS came from Treasury, Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense, Energy, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of Science & Technology, and the Justice Department.

Defenders of the deal point out that the Russians don't have a license to export the uranium out of the U.S., and that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found no risk to national security.

Clinton has said she was not involved in the deliberations and played no role in the decision.

Jose Fernandez, a former assistant secretary of state, told the Times that he represented the department on the committee, and that ""Mrs. Clinton never intervened with me on any C.F.I.U.S. matter."" He did not respond to a request for comment by NBC News.

A spokesman for Hillary Clinton did not answer whether she was ever briefed on the Uranium One deal.

""At every turn this storyline has been debunked on the merits,"" said the spokesman, Nick Merrill. ""This latest iteration is simply more of the right doing Trump's bidding for him to distract from his own Russia problems, which are real and a grave threat to our national security.""

Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2017

Stewart Baker, a former top lawyer in the George W. Bush administration and an expert in the CFIUS process, said he doubted that the Uranium One decision ever reached Clinton's desk.

About the donations, he said, ""Is it possible that the Russians thought they needed to do this and that it would help them? Yeah, but that doesn't mean that it actually did.""

Baker said it was disquieting that the Sessions Justice Department was re-examining a case that career officials already concluded warranted no charges.

""You'd like to think that that wouldn't happen often in a mature democracy,"" he said.

However, he pointed out that Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, ordered a new investigation into brutal CIA interrogations after career prosecutors had looked but filed no charges in the Bush administration. In the end, Holder's department didn't file charges, either.

Frank Giustra and Uranium One

Uranium One became a much bigger player in the uranium market after it absorbed a company run and co-owned by Frank Giustra, a Canadian businessman and Bill Clinton associate, in February 2007.

Giustra was the chairman of UrAsia, a company bidding for uranium rights in Kazakhstan. In 2005, after he had begun negotiating for the rights, he and Bill Clinton traveled to Kazakhstan on separate planes and attended a dinner with the country's president.

UrAsia had soon closed deals for uranium mining rights in Kazakhstan. In 2006, Giustra donated $31.3 million to the Clinton Foundation.

The value of UrAsia shares increased seventyfold between 2005 and 2007. Uranium One merged with UrAsia in 2007, after which, says Giustra, he sold his shares and left the company — three years before the controversial sale of U.S. uranium mining facilities.

Giustra has donated more than $100 million to the Clinton Foundation and currently sits on the foundation's board.

In a statement, Giustra said that he had been working on the purchase of mining stakes from a private Kazakh company in early 2005, and the purchase was concluded in late 2005.

""In late 2005, I went to Kazakhstan to finish the negotiations of the sale,"" said Giustra. ""Bill Clinton flew to Almaty a few days after I arrived in the country on another person's plane … Bill Clinton had nothing to do with the purchase of private mining stakes by a Canadian company."""
Conspiracy Theorists Were Right: Corporate Media Finally Forced to Admit America Armed ISIS,http://thefreethoughtproject.com/conspiracy-theorists-right-msm-admit-cia-armed-isis/,"Spread the love

While the mainstream media opted to protect the United States government by treating anyone who dared to question the government’s role in the rise of ISIS as crazy conspiracy theorists, a new report is forcing the MSM to admit that those “conspiracies” were true all along.

Now, mainstream media outlets such as Reuters and USA Today are suddenly reporting that the United States and its close ally, Saudi Arabia, were instrumental in supplying weapons and ammunition to ISIS. Both reports cite an investigation conducted by Conflict Armament Research (CAR), which looked at 40,000 items recovered from Islamic State militants between July 2014 and November 2017.

A final report from CAR titled “Weapons of the Islamic State,” concluded that the vast majority of the weapons used by ISIS were supplied in the thousands, given their origin and the fact that they were found “in numbers far beyond those that would have been available to the group through battlefield capture alone.”

More than 97 percent of the weapons and 87 percent of the ammunition used by ISIS were “Warsaw Pact calibers—originating primarily in China, Russia, and Eastern European producer states,” according to the report. However, the weapons were not distributed to the militants by China or Russia.

The weapons and ammunition were originally purchased by the United States and Saudi Arabia, and then distributed to rebel groups opposing the administration of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. While the U.S. claimed to be fighting ISIS, the fact is that ISIS was one of the Syrian rebel groups opposing Assad, and as the report noted, nearly all of their weapons came from those purchased by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.

“Unauthorized retransfer—the violation of agreements by which a supplier government prohibits the re-export of materiel by a recipient government without its prior consent—is a significant source of IS weapons and ammunition. The United States and Saudi Arabia supplied most of this materiel without authorization, apparently to Syrian opposition forces. This diverted materiel, recovered from IS forces, comprises exclusively Warsaw Pact caliber weapons and ammunition, purchased by the United States and Saudi Arabia from European Union (EU) Member States in Eastern Europe.”

While the report claims that many of the weapons were intended for other Syrian rebel groups before they ended up in the hands of ISIS militants, it also notes how quickly the transition between groups happened, after the weapons were originally supplied.

In one case, an advanced anti-tank guided weapon was “manufactured in the EU, sold to the United States, supplied to a party in the Syrian conflict, transferred to IS forces in Iraq, and documented by a CAR field investigation team following its recovery from IS forces.” The report noted that “the full chain of transactions occurred within two months of the weapon’s dispatch from the factory.”

The serial numbers on the weapons are also crucial in determining how the militants acquired them. According to the report, almost half of the weapons that were investigated featured “serial numbers that are close in sequence to those of other, identical weapons in the sample.” As a result, they found at least “240 sets of weapons that were manufactured in the same production runs and probably exported in the same, or successive, batches.” This suggests that in some cases, the weapons were delivered to the militants by the thousands.

The report noted that in many cases, the “supplies of materiel into the Syrian conflict” from the U.S. and Saudi Arabia allowed ISIS “to obtain substantial quantities of anti-armor ammunition. These weapons include ATGWs and several varieties of rocket with tandem warheads, which are designed to defeat modern reactive armor.”

As the investigation by Conflict Armament Research concluded, although the United States and Saudi Arabia both claimed to support coalitions that were formed for the purpose of defeating the Islamic State, the thousands of weapons they were supplying rebel groups did the opposite.

“These findings are a stark reminder of the contradictions inherent in supplying weapons into armed conflicts in which multiple competing and overlapping non-state armed groups operate. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to exert effective control over which groups ultimately gain custody of weapons. As this report demonstrates, Iraq and Syria have seen IS forces use large numbers of weapons, supplied by states such as Saudi Arabia and the United States, against the various international anti-IS coalitions that the two states support.”

While the mainstream media has failed to ask questions about some of the most obvious red flags in the United States’ foreign policy, The Free Thought Project has provided in-depth coverage of both the United States’ hypocrisy in the Syrian conflict, and Saudi Arabia’s assistance in helping to strengthen the same group of militants that the two countries claimed to be working to defeat.

Professor Philip Alston is an Australian academic with a formal title: UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.

General Dogon, himself a veteran of these Skid Row streets, strides along, stepping over a dead rat without comment and skirting round a body wrapped in a worn orange blanket lying on the sidewalk.

The two men carry on for block after block after block of tatty tents and improvised tarpaulin shelters. Men and women are gathered outside the structures, squatting or sleeping, some in groups, most alone like extras in a low-budget dystopian movie.

We come to an intersection, which is when General Dogon stops and presents his guest with the choice. He points straight ahead to the end of the street, where the glistening skyscrapers of downtown LA rise up in a promise of divine riches.

Heaven.

Then he turns to the right, revealing the “black power” tattoo on his neck, and leads our gaze back into Skid Row bang in the center of LA’s downtown. That way lies 50 blocks of concentrated human humiliation. A nightmare in plain view, in the city of dreams.

Alston turns right.

So begins a two-week journey into the dark side of the American Dream. The spotlight of the UN monitor, an independent arbiter of human rights standards across the globe, has fallen on this occasion on the US, culminating on Friday with the release of his initial report in Washington.

His fact-finding mission into the richest nation the world has ever known has led him to investigate the tragedy at its core: the 41 million people who officially live in poverty.

Of those, nine million have zero cash income – they do not receive a cent in sustenance.

Alston’s epic journey has taken him from coast to coast, deprivation to deprivation. Starting in LA and San Francisco, sweeping through the Deep South, traveling on to the colonial stain of Puerto Rico then back to the stricken coal country of West Virginia, he has explored the collateral damage of America’s reliance on private enterprise to the exclusion of public help.

The Guardian had unprecedented access to the UN envoy, following him as he crossed the country, attending all his main stops and witnessing the extreme poverty he is investigating firsthand.

Think of it as payback time. As the UN special rapporteur himself put it: “Washington is very keen for me to point out the poverty and human rights failings in other countries. This time I’m in the US.”

The tour comes at a critical moment for America and the world. It began on the day that Republicans in the US Senate voted for sweeping tax cuts that will deliver a bonanza for the super wealthy while in time raising taxes on many lower-income families. The changes will exacerbate wealth inequality that is already the most extreme in any industrialized nation, with three men – Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffet – owning as much as half of the entire American people.

A few days into the UN visit, Republican leaders took a giant leap further. They announced plans to slash key social programs in what amounts to an assault on the already threadbare welfare state.

“Look up! Look at those banks, the cranes, the luxury condos going up,” exclaimed General Dogon, who used to be homeless on Skid Row and now works as a local activist with Lacan. “Down here, there’s nothing. You see the tents back to back, there’s no place for folks to go.”

California made a suitable starting point for the UN visit. It epitomizes both the vast wealth generated in the tech boom for the 0.001%, and the resulting surge in housing costs that has sent homelessness soaring. Los Angeles, the city with by far the largest population of street dwellers in the country, is grappling with crisis numbers that increased 25% this past year to 55,000.

The safety net? It has too many holes in it for me Robert Chambers, Los Angeles

Ressy Finley, 41, was busy sterilizing the white bucket she uses to slop out in her tent in which she has lived on and off for more than a decade. She keeps her living area, a mass of worn mattresses and blankets and a few motley possessions, as clean as she can in a losing battle against rats and cockroaches. She also endures waves of bed bugs, and has large welts on her shoulder to prove it.



She receives no formal income, and what she makes on recycling bottles and cans is no way enough to afford the average rents of $1,400 a month for a tiny one-bedroom. A friend brings her food every couple of days, the rest of the time she relies on nearby missions.

She cried twice in the course of our short conversation, once when she recalled how her infant son was taken from her arms by social workers because of her drug habit (he is now 14; she has never seen him again). The second time was when she alluded to the sexual abuse that set her as a child on the path towards drugs and homelessness.

Given all that, it’s remarkable how positive Finley remains. What does she think of the American Dream, the idea that everyone can make it if they try hard enough? She replies instantly: “I know I’m going to make it.”

A 41-year-old woman living on the sidewalk in Skid Row going to make it?

“Sure I will, so long as I keep the faith.”

What does “making it” mean to her?

“I want to be a writer, a poet, an entrepreneur, a therapist.”

Robert Chambers occupies the next patch of sidewalk along from Finley’s. He’s created an area around his tent out of wooden pallets, what passes in Skid Row for a cottage garden.

He has a sign up saying “Homeless Writers Coalition”, the name of a group he runs to give homeless people dignity against what he calls the “animalistic” aspects of their lives. He’s referring not least to the lack of public bathrooms that forces people to relieve themselves on the streets.

LA authorities have promised to provide more access to toilets, a critical issue given the deadly outbreak of Hepatitis A that began in San Diego and is spreading on the west coast claiming 21 lives mainly through lack of sanitation in homeless encampments. At night local parks and amenities are closed specifically to keep homeless people out.

Skid Row has had the use of nine toilets at night for 1,800 street-faring people. That’s a ratio well below that mandated by the UN in its camps for Syrian refugees.

“It’s inhuman actually, and eventually in the end you will acquire animalistic psychology,” Chambers said.

He has been living on the streets for almost a year, having violated his parole terms for drug possession and in turn being turfed out of his low-cost apartment. There’s no help for him now, he said, no question of “making it”.

“The safety net? It has too many holes in it for me.”

Of all the people who crossed paths with the UN monitor, Chambers was the most dismissive of the American Dream. “People don’t realize – it’s never getting better, there’s no recovery for people like us. I’m 67, I have a heart condition, I shouldn’t be out here. I might not be too much longer.”

That was a lot of bad karma to absorb on day one, and it rattled even as seasoned a student of hardship as Alston. As UN special rapporteur, he’s reported on dire poverty and its impact on human rights in Saudi Arabia and China among other places. But Skid Row?

“I was feeling pretty depressed,” he told the Guardian later. “The endless drumbeat of horror stories. At a certain point you do wonder what can anyone do about this, let alone me.”

And then he took a flight up to San Francisco, to the Tenderloin district where homeless people congregate, and walked into St Boniface church.

What he saw there was an analgesic for his soul.

San Francisco, California, 6 December

About 70 homeless people were quietly sleeping in pews at the back of the church, as they are allowed to do every weekday morning, with worshippers praying harmoniously in front of them. The church welcomes them in as part of the Catholic concept of extending the helping hand.

“I found the church surprisingly uplifting,” Alston said. “It was such a simple scene and such an obvious idea. It struck me – Christianity, what the hell is it about if it’s not this?”

It was a rare drop of altruism on the west coast, competing against a sea of hostility. More than 500 anti-homeless laws have been passed in Californian cities in recent years. At a federal level, Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon who Donald Trump appointed US housing secretary, is decimating government spending on affordable housing.

Perhaps the most telling detail: apart from St Boniface and its sister church, no other place of worship in San Francisco welcomes homeless people. In fact, many have begun, even at this season of goodwill, to lock their doors to all comers simply so as to exclude homeless people.

As Tiny Gray-Garcia, herself on the streets, described it to Alston, there is a prevailing attitude that she and her peers have to contend with every day. She called it the “violence of looking away”.

That cruel streak – the violence of looking away – has been a feature of American life since the nation’s founding. The casting off the yoke of overweening government (the British monarchy) came to be equated in the minds of many Americans with states’ rights and the individualistic idea of making it on your own – a view that is fine for those fortunate enough to do so, less happy if you’re born on the wrong side of the tracks.

Countering that has been the conviction that society must protect its own against the vagaries of hunger or unemployment that informed Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and the Great Society of Lyndon Johnson. But in recent times the prevailing winds have blown strongly in the “you’re on your own, buddy” direction. Ronald Reagan set the trend with his 1980s tax cuts, followed by Bill Clinton, whose 1996 decision to scrap welfare payments for low-income families is still punishing millions of Americans.

The cumulative attack has left struggling families, including the 15 million children who are officially in poverty, with dramatically less support than in any other industrialized economy. Now they face perhaps the greatest threat of all.

As Alston himself has written in an essay on Trump’s populism and the aggressive challenge it poses to human rights: “These are extraordinarily dangerous times. Almost anything seems possible.”

Lowndes County, Alabama, 9 December

Trump’s undermining of human rights, combined with the Republican threat to pare back welfare programs next year in order to pay for some of the tax cuts for the rich they are rushing through Congress, will hurt African Americans disproportionately.

Black people are 13% of the US population, but 23% of those officially in poverty and 39% of the homeless.

The racial element of America’s poverty crisis is seen nowhere more clearly than in the Deep South, where the open wounds of slavery continue to bleed. The UN special rapporteur chose as his next stop the “Black Belt,” the term that originally referred to the rich dark soil that exists in a band across Alabama but over time came to describe its majority African American population.

The link between soil type and demographics was not coincidental. Cotton was found to thrive in this fertile land, and that in turn spawned a trade in slaves to pick the crop. Their descendants still live in the Black Belt, still mired in poverty among the worst in the union.

You can trace the history of America’s shame, from slave times to the present day, in a set of simple graphs. The first shows the cotton-friendly soil of the Black Belt, then the slave population, followed by modern black residence and today’s extreme poverty – they all occupy the exact same half-moon across Alabama.

There are numerous ways you could parse the present parlous state of Alabama’s black community. Perhaps the starkest is the fact that in the Black Belt so many families still have no access to sanitation. Thousands of people continue to live among open sewers of the sort normally associated with the developing world.

The crisis was revealed by the Guardian earlier this year to have led to an ongoing endemic of hookworm, an intestinal parasite that is transmitted through human waste. It is found in Africa and South Asia, but had been assumed eradicated in the US years ago.

Yet here the worm still is, sucking the blood of poor people, in the home state of Trump’s US attorney general Jeff Sessions.

A disease of the developing world thriving in the world’s richest country.

The open sewerage problem is especially acute in Lowndes County, a majority black community that was an epicenter of the civil rights movement having been the setting of Martin Luther King’s Selma to Montgomery voting rights march in 1965.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Philp Alston talks to a resident. Many families in Butler and Lowndes counties choose to live with open sewer systems made from PVC pipe. Photograph: Bob Miller for the Guardian

Despite its proud history, Catherine Flowers estimates that 70% of households in the area either “straight pipe” their waste directly onto open ground, or have defective septic tanks incapable of dealing with heavy rains.

When her group, Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise (Acre), pressed local authorities to do something about it, officials invested $6m in extending waste treatment systems to primarily white-owned businesses while bypassing overwhelmingly black households.

“That’s a glaring example of injustice,” Flowers said. “People who cannot afford their own systems are left to their own devices while businesses who do have the money are given public services.”

Walter, a Lowndes County resident who asked not to give his last name for fear that his water supply would be cut off as a reprisal for speaking out, lives with the daily consequences of such public neglect. “You get a good hard rain and it backs up into the house.”

That’s a polite way of saying that sewage gurgles up into his kitchen sink, hand basin and bath, filling the house with a sickly-sweet stench.

What I see is the failure of society. I see a society that let that happen, that is not doing what it should Philip Alston

Given these circumstances, what does he think of the ideology that anyone can make it if they try?

“I suppose they could if they had the chance,” Walter said. He paused, then added: “Folks aren’t given the chance.”

Had he been born white, would his sewerage problems have been fixed by now?

After another pause, he said: “Not being racist, but yeah, they would.”

Round the back of Walter’s house the true iniquity of the situation reveals itself. The yard is laced with small channels running from neighboring houses along which dark liquid flows. It congregates in viscous pools directly underneath the mobile home in which Walter’s son, daughter-in-law and 16-year-old granddaughter live.

It is the ultimate image of the lot of Alabama’s impoverished rural black community. As American citizens they are as fully entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It’s just that they are surrounded by pools of excrement.

This week, the Black Belt bit back. On Tuesday a new line was added to that simple graphic, showing exactly the same half-moon across Alabama except this time it was not black but blue.

It depicted the army of African American voters who turned out against the odds to send Doug Jones to the US Senate, the first Democrat from Alabama to do so in a generation. It delivered a bloody nose to his opponent, the alleged child molester Roy Moore, and his puppetmasters Steve Bannon and Donald Trump.

It was arguably the most important expression of black political muscle in the region since King’s 1965 march. If the previous entries in the graphic could be labeled “soil”, “slavery” and “poverty”, this one should be captioned “empowerment”.

Guayama, Puerto Rico, 10 December

So how does Alston view the role of UN rapporteur and his visit? His full report on the US will be released next May before being presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva.

Nobody expects much to come of that: the world body has no teeth with which to enforce good behavior on recalcitrant governments. But Alston hopes that his visit will have an impact by shaming the US into reflecting on its values.

“My role is to hold governments to account,” he said. “If the US administration doesn’t want to talk about the right to housing, healthcare or food, then there are still basic human rights standards that have to be met. It’s my job to point that out.”

Alston’s previous investigations into extreme poverty in places like Mauritania pulled no punches. We can expect the same tough love when it comes to his analysis of Puerto Rico, the next stop on his journey into America’s dark side.

Three months after Maria, the devastation wrought by the hurricane has been well documented. It tore 70,000 homes to shreds, brought industry to a standstill and caused a total blackout of the island that continues to cause havoc.

But Puerto Rico’s plight long predates Maria, rooted in the indifference with which it has been regarded since being acquired as a spoil of war in 1898. Almost half of Americans have no idea that the 3.5 million Puerto Ricans on the island are US citizens, which adds insult to the injury of the territory having no representation in Congress while its fiscal policies are dictated by an oversight board imposed by Washington. What was that about casting off the yoke of overweening government?

Nor do most people appreciate that the island has twice the proportion of people in poverty (44%) than the lowliest US state, including Alabama (19%). And that was before the hurricane, which some estimates suggest has pushed the poverty rate up to 60%.

“Puerto Rico is a sacrifice zone,” said Ruth Santiago, a community rights lawyer. “We are ruled by the United States but we are never consulted – we have no influence, we’re just their plaything.”

The UN monitor was given a sense of what being a plaything of the US means in practice when he travelled south to Guayama, a town of 42,000 close to where Maria made landfall. Devastation was everywhere – houses mangled, roofs missing, power lines drooping alarmingly overhead.

If Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty, then Trump is waging a war on the poor

Looming over the community is a coal-fired power plant built by the Puerto Rican branch of AES Corporation, a Virginia-headquartered multinational. The plant’s smoke stack dominates the horizon, as does a huge mound of residue from the combusted coal that rises to at least 70ft like a giant sandcastle.

The mound is exposed to the elements and local people complain that toxins from it leach into the sea, destroying the livelihoods of fishermen through mercury poisoning. They also fear that dust coming off the pile causes health problems, a concern shared by local doctors who told the UN monitor that they see a high incidence of respiratory disease and cancer.

“It kills the leaves of my mango tree,” said Flora Picar Cruz, 82. She was lying in bed at midday, breathing with difficulty through an oxygen mask.

Studies of the pile have found perilous levels of toxic substances including arsenic, boron, chloride and chromium. Even so, the Trump administration is in the process of easing the relatively lax regulations on monitoring dangerous effluents from it.

AES Puerto Rico told the Guardian that there was nothing to worry about, as the plant was one of the cleanest in the US having been purpose built to avoid any run-off into air or sea. That’s not what the people of Guayama think. They fear that the age-old pattern of being taken for granted by the US colonizer is about to rise to the next level.

When such attitudes are replicated across the island it helps explain why so many Puerto Ricans are voting with their feet: almost 200,000 have packed their bags and quit for Florida, New York and Pennsylvania since the hurricane, adding to the more than 5m who were already on the US mainland. Which gives a whole new meaning to the American Dream – anyone can make it, so long as they abandon their families, their homes, and their culture and head off into a strange and forbidding land.

Charleston, West Virginia, 13 December

“You’re an amazing people! We’re going to take care of a lot of years of horrible abuse, OK? You can count on it 100%.”



Donald Trump’s promise to the white voters of West Virginia was made just as he was securing the Republican presidential nomination in May 2016. Six months later, his audience handsomely repaid him with a landslide victory.

It is not surprising that white families in West Virginia should have responded positively to Trump’s charm offensive, given that he offered them the world – “We’re going to put the miners back to work!” After all, numerically a majority of all those living in poverty nationwide – 27 million people – are white.

In West Virginia in particular, white families have a lot to feel sore about. Mechanization and the decline of coal mining have decimated the state, leading to high unemployment and stagnant wages. The transfer of jobs from the mines and steel mills to Walmart has led to male workers earning on average $3.50 an hour less today than they did in 1979.

What is surprising is that so many proud working folk should have entrusted their dreams to a (supposed) billionaire who built his real estate empire on the back of handouts from his father.

Before he ran for the presidency, Trump showed scant interest in the struggles of low-income families, white or otherwise. After almost a year in the Oval Office, there is similarly little sign of those campaign promises being kept.

Quite the contrary. When the UN rapporteur decamped in Charleston, West Virginia on Wednesday as the final stop in his tour, he was inundated with evidence that the president is turning the screws on the very people who elected him.

That same day, Republicans in the Senate and House were fusing their plans for tax cuts ahead of a final vote next week. Many West Virginians will be lulled into believing that the changes are designed to help them, as initially everybody in the state will pay less tax.

But come 2027 when deficit-saving changes kick in, the bottom 80% of the population will pay more, while the top 1% will continue to enjoy a $21,000 bonanza.

“Trump’s policies will exacerbate inequality, suppress wages and make it harder for low-income families to seek assistance,” said Ted Boettner, executive director of the non-partisan West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy.

If sewage is the abiding image of the burden of the Black Belt, then a mouthful of rotting teeth is West Virginia’s.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A patient who came into the clinic needing all 30 of his teeth to have root canal surgery. Photograph: Doctors at Health Right

Doctors at Health Right, a volunteer-based medical center in Charleston that treats 21,000 low-income working people free of charge, presented the UN monitor with a photograph of one of its dentistry clients.

The man is only 32, but when he opened his mouth he turned into one of Macbeth’s witches. His few remaining rotting teeth and greenish-blue gums looked like the festering broth in their burning cauldrons.

Adult dentistry is uncovered by Medicaid unless it is an emergency, and so people do the logical thing – they do nothing until their abscesses erupt and they have to go to ER. One woman seen by the center’s mobile dentistry clinic was found to have nothing but 30 roots in her mouth, all of which needed surgery.

In other briefings, Alston was given a picture of life under siege for West Virginia’s low-income families. If Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty, then Trump is waging a war on the poor.

People are jailed for years because they cannot afford bail awaiting trial; private detectives are used to snoop on disability benefit claimants; mandatory minimum drug sentences are back in fashion; Jeff Sessions is scrapping federal rehabilitation schemes for those released from prison; tenants in subsidized housing are living in fear that they will be evicted for the slightest infraction – the list goes on and on.

And the result of this relentless drubbing? “People end up fighting each other,” said Eli Baumwell, policy director of the ACLU in West Virginia. “You become so obsessed with what you’ve got and what your neighbor has got that you become resentful. That’s what Trump is doing – turning one against the other.”

And so it was that Philip Alston boarded one last plane and headed for Washington, carrying with him the distilled torment of the American people.

At one point in the trip Alston revealed that he had had a sleepless night, reflecting on the lost souls we had met in Skid Row.

He wondered about how a person in his position – “I’m old, male, white, rich and I live very well” – would react to one of those homeless people. “He would look at him and see someone who is dirty, who doesn’t wash, who he doesn’t want to be around.”

Then Alston had an epiphany.

“I realized that’s how government sees them. But what I see is the failure of society. I see a society that let that happen, that is not doing what it should. And it’s very sad.”

The UN special rapporteur’s tour was done."

"All 535 members of Congress, and how much money they got from ISPs - The Verge",https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16746230/net-neutrality-fcc-isp-congress-campaign-contribution,"Share All sharing options for: Congress took $101 million in donations from the ISP industry — here’s how much your lawmaker got

The FCC is about to give massive internet service providers the power to divide the internet. It is at risk of becoming unrecognizable. A vital global utility that has been a boon to creative and economic freedom for people around the world may be turned into a twisted land of tolls and corporate control.

Those who control the network control the future

The stakes are high. The internet now touches every town, every city, and every single one of us — whether we use it or not. Those who control the network control the future.

The FCC is the current venue for this fight, but Congress will eventually intervene. As telecom expert Susan Crawford argues, the FCC is “being outrageous” to force Congress’ involvement. And both net neutrality advocates and the telecom industry have asked for lawmakers to act. Advocates believe a law will make net neutrality more durable. But ISPs are betting they’ll be able to write the bill — because they’ve paid for the opportunity.

In March, we published a story that showed contributions from the ISP industry to members of Congress who voted to repeal a landmark FCC privacy rule, opening the door to the sale of customer data. It was one of our most popular stories of the year, and many of you asked why we only published contributions to some members of Congress. Incidentally, every one of the 265 members who voted for the measure in March were Republicans. And many of those same members endorse the effort to end net neutrality.

But it’s fair to want to see monetary influence across all of Congress. While it is clear that alignment with the ISPs is currently drawn along party lines, the industry’s attempt to gain favor with lawmakers is not partisan. Entrenched telecommunications companies liberally spread money and attention to everyone who holds office. Sometimes that influence comes in the form of lavish parties with Olympic athletes and lobbyists, but consistently it comes in the form of contributions to campaigns.

It’s impossible to quantify the overall influence of this powerful industry, but we can chart some of it. Below you will find contributions to individual members of Congress, and those members’ leadership PACs, from 1989 to the present day. This money came from the telecommunication industry’s own PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals’ immediate families. This data was prepared for The Verge by The Center for Responsive Politics: an independent, non-partisan nonprofit research group that tracks money in US politics and its effect on elections and public policy.

100% Electric Bus Fleet For Shenzhen (Population 11.9 Million) By End Of 2017,https://cleantechnica.com/2017/11/12/100-electric-bus-fleet-shenzhen-pop-11-9-million-end-2017/,"100% Electric Bus Fleet For Shenzhen (Population 11.9 Million) By End Of 2017

November 12th, 2017 by Nicolas Zart

You are definitely living under a rock if you haven’t heard that many cities in China are suffering from record-breaking pollution levels. If you’re a hardcore regular of CleanTechnica, you also know that electric buses have been selling like hotcakes in China. The EV-loving city Shenzhen is taking it one step further. In Shenzhen, electric buses will make up all public bus transportation by the end of this year, primarily BYD electric buses.

Shenzhen Bus Fleet to Go Electric by End of 2017

There’s no denying that switching an entire public transportation bus fleet to electricity can drastically curb pollutants and respiratory complications. The city of Shenzhen sees the light, coming to the conclusion that human lives matter more than foreign oil company profits.

One more thing to note: Shenzhen has been working toward this goal for a while. It already has 14,000 electric buses on the street, with only has a few hundred diesel-powered buses left to replace. They will be decommissioned over the last two months of the year. BYD is in charge of providing 80% of the electric buses for the city. It is also heavily vested in electric vehicles (EV), leads the world-leading Chinese EV market, and has introduced its electric bus all over the world, including in Long Beach, California, where we were privileged enough to take its maiden ride.

BYD started the Shenzhen pilot test in 2011. In six years, the giant city (population 11.9 million) managed to implement a complete switch. So, what is taking us so long in the West?

A Global Call to Switch to Electricity

China isn’t the only country ditching diesel and CNG. France and Great Britain have vowed to end sales of gasoline and diesel cars by 2040. Although, that is still a very long time away. Norway set the target even closer at 2025. These countries are eager to reclaim a cleaner urban environment and are seen as global leaders. But have you heard of any other major cities switching 100% to electric buses in the next few years?

Numbers speak for themselves. China has to clean up its air pollution situation. The country is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Vehicles sold in China emitted 44.7 million tonnes of pollu­tants in 2016, according to the World Health Organization. The Ministry of Environmental Protection says going electric is the only feasible and practical solution.

To the latest rash of naysayers claiming that EVs pollute more than internal combustion engines, it is far easier to curb pollution at power stations than to do it on every single car exhaust pipe. Further, even today, electric vehicles are cleaner.

BYD & Shenzhen on the Electric Bus Lane

BYD, which stands for “build your dreams,” is indeed building its dream — after all, it produces 80% of this giant city’s electric buses. The company is also headquartered in the city (as you might have guessed … or known) and has been producing batteries since 1995. It started manufacturing “new energy vehicles” (NEVs) in 2003. Beijing considers hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEV), and pure EVs as NEVs.

BYD’s first electric bus started in 2011 and used a lot of space for its batteries, encumbering on its passenger capacity. But battery energy density and the overall technology has matured enough to allow electric buses to carry the load of a conventional diesel bus while making them more affordable to operate over their lifespan — much more affordable, according to some spreadsheets CleanTechnica has seen.

What really helped both BYD and the city of Shenzhen is when local authorities issued a list of policies to push for the development of NEVs — “Made In China 2025.” The plan boosted the country’s EV manufacturing output, with EVs singled out as one of 10 key sectors the government would help.

Lessons Learned from the BYD & Shenzhen Electric Bus Switch

One thing is for certain about China — it can quickly implement projects and pilot programs efficiently. This is something the West could only dream to achieve in such a short amount of time. While we are hopelessly lost in politics and endless debates that more often go nowhere, China has proven yet again it can get things done quickly, leaving us to our own unproductive infighting.

BYD (and some others) switching the city of Shenzhen’s bus fleet to electricity is something we would like to see happening everywhere — sooner than later, but preferably sooner.

Documents: Texas National Guard Installed Cellphone Spying Devices on Surveillance Planes,https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-national-guard-spying-devices-surveillance/,"“There are really big privacy and constitutional due-process concerns with the use of this technology,” a state lawmaker said.

The Texas National Guard last year spent more than $373,000 to install controversial cellphone eavesdropping devices in secretive surveillance aircraft.

Maryland-based Digital Receiver Technology Inc., or DRT, installed two of its DRT 1301C “portable receiver systems” in National Guard aircraft in partnership with the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to a contract between the Texas National Guard and the company. The contract states that the dirt boxes, as they’re often called after the company’s acronym, are for “investigative case analytical support” in counternarcotics operations and were purchased using state drug-asset forfeiture money.

Dirt boxes mimic cellphone towers by tricking every smartphone within a geographic area of up to one-third of a mile to connect with the technology, usually without cellphone users or telecom companies ever knowing about it. Also known as cell-site simulators, the devices can be used from land or air and are capable of intercepting the user’s location, phone numbers dialed, text messages and photos as well as recording or listening to phone calls.

Privacy and civil liberties advocates have called the use of dirt boxes a “digital dragnet,” because it’s nearly impossible for the government to avoid intercepting personal information from innocent cellphone users when pursuing investigative targets.

According to the contract documents obtained by the Observer, the eavesdropping devices were installed in two RC-26 surveillance planes used for counternarcotics operations. At one time, the RC-26s reportedly operated under a front company called Air Cerberus, but have since converted to military registrations, which generally mask their flight routes and unique tail numbers.

In a 2014 story, the Wall Street Journal revealed that the U.S. Marshals Service had been secretly using dirt boxes from a small Cessna aircraft to locate fugitives. Equipment and training was supplied by the CIA, but some officials inside the U.S. Justice Department were concerned that the activity was illegal. The revelations spurred numerous complaints from civil liberties advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, as well as lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

“Without a clear public policy posted on how they’re going to be allowed to use these kinds of devices, there’s nothing to stop them from using a cell-site simulator in a suburb of Dallas any more than at the border.”

Law enforcement’s use of the technology is usually considered legal when used against Americans with a warrant. The Texas Department of Public Safety has made similar purchases for covert surveillance equipment from a DRT competitor, Harris Corp., which offers comparable technology called Stingrays.

But the Texas National Guard is a military force under the governor’s command, not law enforcement. It’s unclear under what legal authorities the State Guard would be operating to conduct electronic eavesdropping. In 2015, the Justice Department issued guidelines for federal law enforcement agencies requiring that a probable cause warrant be obtained from a judge before using such technology. The Texas National Guard refused to explain to the Observer what steps, if any, it takes to secure a warrant prior to deploying the devices, or where the dirt boxes are being used.

Democratic state Representative César Blanco, a former Navy intelligence analyst who is the vice chairman of the Texas House committee that oversees the Texas National Guard, told the Observer that he wasn’t aware of the purchases, which haven’t previously been made public.

Blanco said the purchases concern him and he wants the Legislature to develop a committee modeled after the House and Senate intelligence committees in Congress, which oversee the sprawling federal intelligence bureaucracies like the FBI, CIA and NSA.

“There are really big privacy and constitutional due-process concerns with the use of this technology,” Blanco said. “If it’s useful to authorities, then I completely understand that. … [But] if the Texas National Guard want to get into the business of surveillance and utilizing intelligence and classifying intelligence, there’s got to be an oversight body that responds to the citizens of Texas.”

Because law enforcement agencies often sign nondisclosure agreements with companies such as DRT or Harris Corp., it’s difficult to determine how widely the surveillance equipment is used. The ACLU has identified 24 states, including Texas, where cell-site simulators are used by law enforcement.

One possibility is the dirt boxes are being used at the Texas-Mexico border, where the Texas National Guard has participated in border security and counternarcotics missions since 1989. Currently, there are 145 Army National Guard soldiers and 70 Air National Guard personnel working in tandem with state, local and federal law enforcement on counternarcotics operations.

But when asked to confirm details about the purchases, including whether the cell-site simulators are being used at the border, the Texas National Guard provided only a short written response: “In regard to your questions, the items you are asking about are not associated with the Operation Secure Texas mission.”

Operation Secure Texas is just one of many missions the Texas National Guard has participated in along the border. Asked whether the National Guard has the legal authority to obtain a warrant to conduct arrests or surveillance, a spokesperson declined to provide someone from the agency to answer questions and instead responded with written answers: “The Texas National Guard’s role along the border has always been to serve as a force multiplier and to deter and refer. Our current supporting roles do not include arrest or law enforcement authorizations.”

Austin attorney Scott McCollough, who specializes in technology and serves on the board of the Austin chapter of EFF, said that if military forces are using the surveillance devices without a warrant, innocent people affected by it might have grounds for a privacy lawsuit against the government.

McCollough also wondered whether any information collected by the Texas National Guard could be used to prosecute criminals in court if the underlying technology is considered legally questionable.

“These DRT boxes are far more capable than the old Stingrays,” McCollough said, “The old-style Stingrays were not able to capture content. Guess what? The DRT box is. … These newer ones get everything.”

Stephanie Lacambra, a staff attorney at EFF’s national office in San Francisco, said that so much secrecy has surrounded the use of the technology across the country that the public knows too little about what personal identifying information is being collected by the government when it deploys such tools and how the information is being handled. To shield the privacy of citizens, officials should commit to guidelines and make them public, she said.

“Without a clear public policy posted on how they’re going to be allowed to use these kinds of devices, there’s nothing to stop them from using a cell-site simulator in a suburb of Dallas any more than at the border,” said Lacambra. “And people should be legitimately concerned about that.”"
Somalia bomber 'was ex-soldier whose town was raided by US forces',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/somalia-bomber-was-ex-solider-whose-town-was-raided-by-us-forces,"Officials investigating attack that killed more than 300 people believe the bomber may have been motivated by desire for revenge for a raid in August

The man who killed more than 300 people with a truck bomb in the centre of Mogadishu on Saturday was a former soldier in Somalia’s army whose home town was raided by local troops and US special forces two months ago in a controversial operation in which 10 civilians were killed, officials in Somalia have said.



The death toll from the bombing now stands at more than 300, making it one of the most devastating terrorist attacks anywhere in the world for many years. On Tuesday remains of victims were still being brought out of rubble spread over hundreds of square metres.

Investigators believe the attack on Saturday may in part have been motivated by a desire for revenge for the botched US-led operation in August.



Mogadishu bombing: parents' grief for medical student killed in blast Read more

Al-Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack but a member of the cell detained by security forces has told interrogators the group was responsible, one security official told the Guardian.

Following the raid, in which three children aged between six and 10 died, local tribal elders called for revenge against the Somali government and its allies.

Not only was the bomber from the specific community targeted by the raid, but the investigation is also uncovering a series of other links to the town where it took place.

Details of the attack are now becoming clearer. Officials say it involved two vehicles – a Toyota Noah minivan and a much larger truck carrying around 350kg of military grade and homemade explosives.

The target for both vehicles was the heavily guarded airport compound in Mogadishu, where the United Nations, most embassies and the headquarters of the 22,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force, Amisom, are based, officials said.

The smaller device was supposed to blast open the heavily defended Medina Gate entrance to the compound to open the way for the bigger bomb, a standard militant tactic.



The minivan was stopped by at a checkpoint several hundred metres short of its target and the driver detained. This bomb later detonated, possibly set off by remote control or by security officials, without causing casualties, two officials told the Guardian.

Officials also said the driver was a veteran militant who had been involved in previous attacks in Mogadishu, including one on the Jazeera hotel in 2012 in which eight people died.

The bigger truck bomb was detonated at a busy crossroads at least a kilometre from the Medina Gate when it reached a checkpoint where security guards became suspicious. The explosion ignited a fuel truck nearby which caused a massive fireball. It has been impossible to identify the type of truck from the wreckage.

Officials said the driver had joined the army in 2010 but defected from his military post to join al-Shabaab around five years later.

The US involvement in Somalia intensified in the later years of the Obama administration but has increased significantly since Donald Trump became president, with greater latitude given to local commanders to order airstrikes or take part in raids.

Critics have argued this risks greater civilian casualties, which, in the tight-knit world of Somalia’s complex clan system, can prompt feuds and revenge attacks.

The raid in August targeted the small town of Bariire, 30 miles (50km) west of Mogadishu, which is a stronghold of al-Shabaab.



Investigators have established that both vehicles used in Saturday’s attack appear to have set out from Bariire, and the owner of the truck used for the bigger bomb was from the town or the surrounding region, officials say. He has been detained.

Investigators are probing the possibility that some individuals manning the checkpoints on the route taken by the bomb vehicles into Mogadishu from the direction of Bariire may have been complicit in the attack.

All those on duty on Saturday have been removed from their posts and put under investigation, apart from those who successfully stopped the smaller vehicle. The personnel who tried to stop the truck bomb near the Kilometre Five checkpoint are all dead.

Bariire is known as an al-Shabaab stronghold which has been a lanchpad for several major attacks on Mogadishu.

The group has been pushed out of major cities but retains control of swaths of countryside in the south and centre of Somalia.

In May a US Navy Seal was killed and two troops wounded in a raid on an al-Shabaab militant compound in Bariire, in what was the first US combat death in the African country since the 1993 “Black Hawk Down” disaster.

The town was recaptured by government troops earlier this year but abandoned in a “tactical withdrawal” last week. Analysts say the retreat left Mogadishu exposed.

The area has also been the site of intensive activity by US drones. Local media reported airstrikes around Bariire on Tuesday.

The links between the attack and Bariire will raise questions about the tactics and strategy of the campaign against al-Shabaab.

“If you go out more aggressively in this kind of environment you risk scoring some serious own goals. The extremists really cranked everything they could out of the botched raid in August. They put out images of the bodies of the kids, published the testimony of supposed witnesses,” said one western counter-terrorist expert with long experience of working with Somali authorities.

A second expert, who works closely with regional security forces in Somalia, described as “very plausible” the possibility that al-Shabaab, which have always exploited clan allegiances, may have played on traditions of exacting vengeance to convince members of the clan to assist al-Shabaab in the bombings.

A recent United Nations study found that in “a majority of cases, state action appears to be the primary factor finally pushing individuals into violent extremism in Africa”.



Of more than 500 former members of militant organisations interviewed for the report, 71% pointed to “government action”, including “killing of a family member or friend” or “arrest of a family member or friend” as the incident that prompted them to join a group.

Merkel warns against British 'illusions' as Brexit negotiations begin,http://www.dw.com/en/merkel-warns-against-british-illusions-as-brexit-negotiations-begin/a-38606210,"Ahead of a meeting of the 27 remaining European Union nations in Brussels on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel briefed the German parliament, the Bundestag, about Germany's strategy vis-a-vis Brexit. But at least in part her message was aimed across the English Channel.

The chancellor warned London not to expect a deal that would privilege the UK.

""A third-party state cannot enjoy the same advantages or be better positioned than an EU member state,"" Merkel said. ""I have the feeling that some people in Britain maintain illusions in this regard. They're wasting their time.""

That line drew applause from members of the Bundestag. Merkel reiterated that negotiators would have to resolve the details of Britain's exit from the EU, including financial obligations that could extend beyond Britain's departure, before any deals could be struck about a future English-EU relationship.

""These steps must happen in that order,"" Merkel said. ""Our goal is to get the best deal for Europe and its citizens.""

Merkel added that negotiations could only commence in earnest after the United Kingdom's parliamentary election on June 8.

Expats high on the agenda

Not all of Merkel's remarks focused on the potential conflicts of interest between the EU and the UK. The chancellor also said that Germany and the EU had an interest in a strong and prosperous Britain.

She said one of her priorities was to clear up the future status of the approximately 100,000 German citizens permanently living in Britain. In return, Germany and the EU were prepared to offer British expatriates in the bloc a ""fair deal.""

It's unclear how the EU will trade with a post-Brexit UK

Merkel also expressed confidence that the EU and post-Brexit Britain shared interests in businesses being able to sell their products to the other and fighting against terrorism and organized crime.

At the same time, the EU showed a high degree of solidarity in the wake of the British referendum in June 2016, in which a slight majority of UK voters supported the Brexit, Merkel added. Specifically naming Ireland, she said that it was a sign of European strength that none of the individual EU-27 states had engaged in ""preliminary negotiations"" with London.

A disintegrating EU?

Speaking for the Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partners with Merkel's conservatives in the government, Thomas Oppermann said: ""I'm glad that within the coalition we have consensus on this issue.""

The Left Party's Wagenknecht said Merkel was trying to strong-arm the UK

But Sahra Wagenknecht of the opposition Left Party accused Merkel's government of trying to ""punish"" the UK and of ignoring the social concerns she said had led many people in Britain to vote for the Brexit.

""The EU is threatening to fall apart,"" Wagenknecht said. ""Anyone who thinks he needs intimidation to ensure European solidarity has already long given up on Europe.""

Merkel's CDU-CSU, the SPD and the opposition Green Party rejected that assessment. The Greens, represented by Katrin Göring-Eckardt, called upon Merkel to reassure expats of their status by this summer.

Criticism of Erdogan, conflict over Le Pen

Significantly, Merkel began her address with statements critical of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and irregularities in Turkey's constitutional referendum, which gave him what some say, are quasi-autocratic powers. She also called for the release of a German journalist currently detained in Turkey.

""To be unmistakably clear, it's not compatible with the rule of law if the Turkish executive judges people in advance, as has obviously happened with Deniz Yücel,"" Merkel stated.

But Merkel said it would be a mistake for the EU to ""turn its back"" on Turkey, which is still, nominally, a candidate for potential membership in the bloc.

The outcome of the French election in early May is another major EU concern

Spokespeople for the parliamentary party groups joined in the criticism of Erdogan. They also took the opportunity to comment on the results of the first round of the French election, which left centrist investment banker Emmanuel Macron to face right-wing, anti-EU populist Marine Le Pen in a run-off vote on May 7.

Wagenknecht criticized the fact that the poll had left voters with a choice between a ""neo-liberal"" and Le Pen. That wasn't a popular view with her parliamentary peers.

Göring-Eckardt said all German parties had a responsibility to support ""democracy,"" in the form of Macron, against the ""hate mongering"" of Le Pen. SPD General Secretary Katarina Barley said Wagenknecht's remarks showed that she had ""no clue.""

It was an impressive display that the EU is confronted by issues other than Brexit and that national political squabbling continues as usual."

Obama's secret Iran deal giveaway - Politico,http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/24/obama-iran-nuclear-deal-prisoner-release-236966,"When President Barack Obama announced the “one-time gesture” of releasing Iranian-born prisoners who “were not charged with terrorism or any violent offenses” last year, his administration presented the move as a modest trade-off for the greater good of the Iran nuclear agreement and Tehran’s pledge to free five Americans.

“Iran had a significantly higher number of individuals, of course, at the beginning of this negotiation that they would have liked to have seen released,” one senior Obama administration official told reporters in a background briefing arranged by the White House, adding that “we were able to winnow that down to these seven individuals, six of whom are Iranian-Americans.”

But Obama, the senior official and other administration representatives weren’t telling the whole story on Jan. 17, 2016, in their highly choreographed rollout of the prisoner swap and simultaneous implementation of the six-party nuclear deal, according to a POLITICO investigation.

In his Sunday morning address to the American people, Obama portrayed the seven men he freed as “civilians.” The senior official described them as businessmen convicted of or awaiting trial for mere “sanctions-related offenses, violations of the trade embargo.”

In reality, some of them were accused by Obama’s own Justice Department of posing threats to national security. Three allegedly were part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics with applications in surface-to-air and cruise missiles like the kind Tehran test-fired recently, prompting a still-escalating exchange of threats with the Trump administration. Another was serving an eight-year sentence for conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology and hardware. As part of the deal, U.S. officials even dropped their demand for $10 million that a jury said the aerospace engineer illegally received from Tehran.

And in a series of unpublicized court filings, the Justice Department dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other men, all of them fugitives. The administration didn’t disclose their names or what they were accused of doing, noting only in an unattributed, 152-word statement about the swap that the U.S. “also removed any Interpol red notices and dismissed any charges against 14 Iranians for whom it was assessed that extradition requests were unlikely to be successful.”

Three of the fugitives allegedly sought to lease Boeing aircraft for an Iranian airline that authorities say had supported Hezbollah, the U.S.-designated terrorist organization. A fourth, Behrouz Dolatzadeh, was charged with conspiring to buy thousands of U.S.-made assault rifles and illegally import them into Iran.

A fifth, Amin Ravan, was charged with smuggling U.S. military antennas to Hong Kong and Singapore for use in Iran. U.S. authorities also believe he was part of a procurement network providing Iran with high-tech components for an especially deadly type of IED used by Shiite militias to kill hundreds of American troops in Iraq.

The biggest fish, though, was Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who had been charged with being part of a conspiracy that from 2005 to 2012 procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran via China. That included hundreds of U.S.-made sensors for the uranium enrichment centrifuges in Iran whose progress had prompted the nuclear deal talks in the first place.

When federal prosecutors and agents learned the true extent of the releases, many were shocked and angry. Some had spent years, if not decades, working to penetrate the global proliferation networks that allowed Iranian arms traders both to obtain crucial materials for Tehran’s illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs and, in some cases, to provide dangerous materials to other countries.

“They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,” said one former federal law enforcement supervisor centrally involved in the hunt for Iranian arms traffickers and nuclear smugglers. “And then they didn’t give a full story of it.”

In its determination to win support for the nuclear deal and prisoner swap from Tehran — and from Congress and the American people — the Obama administration did a lot more than just downplay the threats posed by the men it let off the hook, according to POLITICO’s findings.

Through action in some cases and inaction in others, the White House derailed its own much-touted National Counterproliferation Initiative at a time when it was making unprecedented headway in thwarting Iran’s proliferation networks. In addition, the POLITICO investigation found that Justice and State Department officials denied or delayed requests from prosecutors and agents to lure some key Iranian fugitives to friendly countries so they could be arrested. Similarly, Justice and State, at times in consultation with the White House, slowed down efforts to extradite some suspects already in custody overseas, according to current and former officials and others involved in the counterproliferation effort.

And as far back as the fall of 2014, Obama administration officials began slow-walking some significant investigations and prosecutions of Iranian procurement networks operating in the U.S. These previously undisclosed findings are based on interviews with key participants at all levels of government and an extensive review of court records and other documents.

“Clearly, there was an embargo on any Iranian cases,” according to the former federal supervisor.

“Of course it pissed people off, but it’s more significant that these guys were freed, and that people were killed because of the actions of one of them,” the supervisor added, in reference to Ravan and the IED network.

The supervisor noted that in agreeing to lift crippling sanctions against Tehran, the Obama administration had insisted on retaining the right to go after Iran for its efforts to develop ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads and cruise missiles that could penetrate U.S. defenses, and to illegally procure components for its nuclear, military and weapons systems.

“Then why would you be dismissing the people that you know about who are involved in that?” the former official asked.

A SHREWD CALCULATION

The saga of how the Obama administration threw a monkey wrench into its own Justice Department-led counterproliferation effort continues to play out almost entirely out of public view, largely because of the highly secretive nature of the cases and the negotiations that affected them.

That may be about to change, as the Trump administration and both chambers of Congress have pledged to crack down on Tehran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Last Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced a government-wide review of U.S. policy toward Iran in the face of “alarming and ongoing provocations that export terror and violence, destabilizing more than one country at a time.”

On Thursday, President Donald Trump declared that even if Iran is meeting the terms of its deal with the Obama administration and other world powers, “they are not living up to the spirit of it, I can tell you that. And we’re analyzing it very, very carefully, and we’ll have something to say about that in the not-too-distant future.”

Such reviews are likely to train a spotlight on an aspect of the nuclear deal and prisoner swap that has infuriated the federal law enforcement community most — the hidden damage it has caused to investigations and prosecutions into a wide array of Iranian smuggling networks with U.S. connections.

Valerie Lincy, executive director of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, said Obama administration officials made a shrewd political calculation in focusing public attention on just those seven men it was freeing in the United States, and portraying them as mere sanctions violators.

That way, she said, “They just didn’t think it was going to make too many waves. And I think they were right.”

But Lincy, who closely tracks the U.S. counterproliferation effort against Iran, said that by letting so many men off the hook, and for such a wide range of offenses, Washington has effectively given its blessing to Iran’s continuing defiance of international laws.

Former Obama administration officials deny that, saying the men could still be prosecuted if they continue their illegal activity. But with their cases dropped, international arrest warrants dismissed and investigative assets redirected, the men — especially the 14 fugitives — can now continue activities the U.S. considers to be serious threats to its national security, Lincy said.

“This is a scandal,” she said. “The cases bear all the hallmarks of exactly the kinds of national security threats we’re still going after. It’s stunning and hard to understand why we would do this.”

Even some initial supporters of negotiating with Iran said the disclosures are troubling.

“There was always a broader conceptual problem with the administration not wanting to upset the balance of the deal or the perceived rapprochement with the Iranian regime,” said former Bush administration deputy national security adviser Juan Zarate, who later turned against the accord. “The deal was sacrosanct, and the Iranians knew it from the start and took full advantage when we had — and continue to maintain — enormous leverage.”

Most, if not all, of the Justice Department lawyers and prosecutors involved in the Counterproliferation Initiative were kept in the dark about how their cases were being used as bargaining chips, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former officials.

So were the federal agents from the FBI and departments of Homeland Security and Commerce who for years had been operating internationally, often undercover, on the front lines of the hunt for Iranian arms and weapons smugglers.

It wasn’t just that prosecutors and agents with years of detailed knowledge about the cases were left out of the consultations about the significance of the 21 men let go in the swap. The lack of input also meant that negotiators were making decisions without fully understanding how the releases would impact the broader and interconnected matrix of U.S. investigations.

At the time, those investigations were providing U.S. officials with a roadmap of how, exactly, Tehran was clandestinely building its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and maintaining its military with the unwitting assistance of so many U.S. weapons parts and technology companies. The cases were also providing key operational details of how the Iranian procurement networks operate, and who in Tehran was calling the shots.

“So when they downplayed it, it really infuriated people,” said Kenneth MacDonald, a former senior Homeland Security official who helped establish the multi-agency coordination center at the heart of the National Counterproliferation Initiative.

“They’d spent months or years on these cases and the decisions were made with no review of what the implications were,” said MacDonald, who retired in 2013 but keeps in contact with agents as co-principal investigator at the DHS-affiliated Institute for Security Policy at Northeastern University. “There was absolutely no consultation.”

A SYSTEM IN LIMBO

The Obama administration’s decision to grant clemency to seven men in the U.S. and drop criminal charges and arrest warrants against 14 others overseas undermined strategic enforcement efforts against a broad array of Iranian procurement networks operating in the U.S. that have provided Tehran with a steady stream of critically important parts and technologies for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and to maintain and expand its military and weapons systems. Here are some of the key players let go in the prisoner swap. For more details on the key players, click here. The Nuclear Network Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, a Tehran-based import-export businessman, was charged under seal in Boston in 2013 with conspiring with Chinese associate Sihai Cheng (above) and two Iranian companies to procure thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran in a conspiracy dating back to 2005. Beginning in February 2009, the two allegedly conspired with others to illegally obtain hundreds of specially manufactured pressure transducers — believed critical to running Tehran’s clandestine nuclear program — from an Andover, Massachusetts, company that was not suspected of wrongdoing. Although Jamili was the suspected mastermind, Cheng pleaded guilty a month before the swap and is serving a nine-year prison sentence. The Missile Parts Pipeline Bahram Mechanic (above) was charged in Houston in April 2015, along with alleged U.S.-based associates Khosrow Afghahi and Tooraj Faridi and Matin Sadeghi of Turkey, with supplying Iran with U.S.-origin microelectronics and other commodities “frequently used in a wide range of military systems, including surface-air and cruise missiles.” The men, and four U.S. and Iranian companies, allegedly sent $24 million worth of commodities to Iran between 2010 and 2015 alone, in a conspiracy one Justice Department official described as “a clear threat to U.S. national security.” Mechanic has led a broader Houston-based Iranian procurement network since at least 1985, authorities say. The Improvised Explosives Network Amin Ravan, known by U.S. officials as a longtime globe-trotting procurement agent for Tehran, was charged in Washington, D.C., in 2011 along with his Tehran firm and others with smuggling U.S.-made military antennae to Hong Kong and Singapore for use in Iran. Authorities also say he is an unindicted co-conspirator in a sprawling procurement network that sent to Tehran thousands of U.S.-made radio frequency modules, some of which ended up in a particularly deadly form of IED responsible for killing American troops in Iraq. Ravan was arrested in Malaysia in 2012, but released before U.S. authorities could have him extradited. The Military and Weapons Pipeline Arash Ghahreman (above), a naturalized U.S. citizen from Staten Island, N.Y., was convicted in April 2015 and is serving 78 months for his role in a scheme to illegally procure marine navigation and military electronic equipment for Iran. Also charged in the San Diego case was Iranian national Koorush Taherkhani and his Dubai firm, described as a front established to obtain American goods and technologies for Iran. Ghahreman promised undercover agents posing as suppliers that his network needed “trusted and reliable” partners, prosecutors said. A top Justice Department official said the network had “the potential to harm U.S. national security objectives.” The Military Logistics Network Hamid Arabnejad (above), Gholamreza Mahmoudi and Ali Moattar, Iranian citizens and Mahan Air executives, were indicted in 2014 in connection with a conspiracy to illegally obtain six Boeing airplanes for the private Iranian airline. U.S. authorities also sanctioned Mahan Air and the men for a variety of alleged crimes, including using the airline to provide financial and logistical support to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and its paramilitary Quds Force, which the U.S. designated as a supporter of terrorism in 2007. Arabnejad was individually designated for allegedly overseeing Mahan Air’s sanctions evasion efforts and provision of support and services to Quds Force.



In a series of interviews, senior officials from the Obama White House and Justice and State Departments said the prisoner swap was a bargain for the U.S., given the release of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, former Marine Amir Hekmati and three others. Iran also promised cooperation on the case of former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who had disappeared in Iran nearly a decade earlier and was believed to be either imprisoned or dead.

Those senior officials acknowledged that all but a handful of people were kept in the dark, but said top representatives of the Justice Department and FBI helped vet the 21 Iranian proliferators and that then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch herself participated in blocking some other individuals demanded by Tehran from inclusion in potential prisoner trades.

“The condition was that they not be engaged in anything remotely attached to violence or proliferation activities,” said one senior Obama administration official familiar with the swap negotiations. “And none of them were in any stage where they were providing assistance to the [Tehran] government.”

That may be true for the seven men granted clemency in the United States, but it certainly wasn’t the case for the 14 fugitives.

“These were people under active investigation, who we wanted very badly because they were operating at such a high level that they could help us begin to find out what was happening inside the black box of how Iran’s procurement networks really operate,” said Aaron Arnold, a former intelligence analyst at CPC2, the FBI’s special Counterproliferation Center unit dedicated to thwarting Iranian nuclear and weapons smuggling. “Without that kind of strategic insight, it leaves our analysts, but more importantly, our policy-makers just guessing at what Iran is up to and how to stop it.”

Fifteen months later, the fallout from the nuclear deal and prisoner swap — and questions about the events leading up to them — continue to reverberate through the Justice Department and the specialized units at the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Commerce Department created to neutralize the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear and military ambitions.

The National Counterproliferation Initiative, created with much fanfare a decade ago, has suffered greatly, many participants said, even as they acknowledged that metrics are hard to come by. Much of the work is done in secret, and in long-range efforts that can’t be publicly disclosed, much less measured in annual arrest or conviction statistics.

But key enforcement efforts are in limbo as the result of stalled or stymied investigations and prosecutions, and the trail of some high-value targets has gone cold, numerous participants said.

At least six times in the run-up to the nuclear deal, federal investigators scrambled to get Justice and State Department approval to lure top Iranian targets into traveling internationally in order to arrest them, according to one top Obama administration Justice Department official and other participants. But the requests weren’t approved and the targets vanished, depriving the U.S. of some of its best opportunities to gain insight into the workings of Tehran’s nuclear, missile and military programs, the sources said.

“We would say, ‘We have this opportunity and if we don’t do it now, we’ll never have the opportunity ever again,” the recently departed Justice Department official recalls. But, he added, “There were periods of time where State Department cooperation was necessary but not forthcoming.”

Obama Secretary of State John Kerry declined to comment through a former senior State Department official, who said certain requests might have been delayed temporarily because they came at particularly sensitive times in the negotiations, but only with the concurrence of the White House and Justice Department.

But even now, many experienced agents and prosecutors say they are reluctant to pursue counterproliferation cases for fear that they won’t go anywhere. They say they have also received no helpful guidance on what they can — and cannot — investigate going forward given the complicated parameters of the Iran deal and lifting of nuclear sanctions. Some said they are biding their time to see how hard-liners in the new administration, including Trump himself, deal with Iran.

The Iran deal: The full picture Many of the 21 men were considered national security threats by the Justice Department before the Obama administration dropped the charges against them. Here are the details.

But others have grown so frustrated that they have moved on from the counterproliferation effort, taking with them decades of investigative experience and relationships cultivated with other government agencies and cooperating U.S. companies, a number of current and former officials said.

And critical momentum has been lost, many say, as the 10-year anniversary of the initiative in October approaches.

“This has erased literally years — many years — of hard work, and important cases that can be used to build toward other cases and even bigger players in Iran’s nuclear and conventional weapons programs,” said former Justice Department counterproliferation prosecutor David Locke Hall, adding that the swap demolished the deterrent effect that the arrests and convictions may have had. “Even though these men’s crimes posed a direct threat to U.S. national security, the [Obama] administration has essentially told them their efforts have produced nothing more than political capital that can be traded away when politically expedient.”

One senior Obama administration official who served at the White House and DHS disagreed, saying much of the intelligence about Iranian networks remains usable even though the 21 cases were vacated, and that counterproliferation agents are a resilient bunch who will continue to do their jobs.

When asked whether the counterproliferation effort has struggled, one current Justice Department spokesman said no and quipped, “We are still in the export violation prosecuting business.”

That may be the case, said David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security, a physicist and former weapons inspector whose decades of scientific research into Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program brings him into regular close contact with federal authorities.

But like others involved in ongoing U.S. counterproliferation efforts, Albright said he witnessed many instances since late 2014 in which important investigations and prosecutions were hindered. Albright, who serves as an expert witness in Justice Department Iran trafficking prosecutions, added that federal agents have told him of numerous cases of “lure memos” and other requests never approved by the State Department.

“You can’t keep turning these down and expecting them to want to keep doing this,” said Albright, who added that efforts to lure suspects to countries where they can be arrested are essential in getting beyond the lower rungs of middlemen for Iran. He said he could not disclose specific details, but said, “The amount of rejections has risen to the level where people were worried that it would kill the counterproliferation effort.”

“They had wanted all of these things prosecuted, they were on a roll, they were freaking out the Iranians and then they were told, boom, stop,” Albright said of the Obama administration’s counterproliferation efforts. “And it’s hard to get them back again. We are shooting ourselves in the foot, destroying the infrastructure that we created to enforce the laws against the Iranians.”

The repercussions from the prisoner swap are especially strong in Boston, where authorities had worked for years to build the case against Jamili, the suspected Iranian nuclear procurement agent, and his China-based associate Sihai Cheng.

The two were secretly indicted in 2013 along with two Iranian companies, and Cheng pleaded guilty in mid-December 2015 to four criminal counts. He acknowledged conspiring with Jamili to knowingly provide more than 1,000 high-tech components known as pressure transducers to Iran, which authorities say advanced its nuclear weapons capabilities.

Less than a month later, though, as the prisoner swap unfolded, Boston prosecutors got orders from Washington to file court papers vacating the charges against Jamili and dropping the Interpol arrest warrant for him.

It wasn’t until later that the case agents and prosecutors learned that the Iranian negotiators had specifically demanded that Jamili be included in the swap, said Arnold, the former analyst at the FBI’s Counterproliferation Center Iran unit, where he headed a financial intelligence team tracking the money flows of the Iranian networks.

A GLOBAL CAT AND MOUSE GAME

By the time of the nuclear deal and prisoner swap, the U.S. government had spent 35 years in pursuit of Iran’s ever more sophisticated web of smugglers, traffickers, transport operatives and procurement agents.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter declared that Iran constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. security after Islamic revolutionaries overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 Americans. Tehran began calling the United States “the Great Satan” and vowed its destruction, in part by using proxy forces like Hezbollah.

A raft of economic sanctions against Iran and Iranian entities were put in place, followed by other restrictions on U.S. parts and technology that Tehran needed for military or other restricted applications, including its squadrons of F-class fighter jets that Washington sold it during friendlier times. Its ambitious ballistic missile program became a grave concern over the years, especially when it became apparent that Tehran was using U.S. commodities to engineer inter-continental versions that could reach the United States, and to top them with nuclear, conventional or even chemical and biological weapons.

And as Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program ramped up, so did the U.S. effort to stop it.

Overseas, U.S. intelligence operatives shadowed Iranian procurement agents, cultivated informants and used cyberweapons to sabotage Iran’s clandestine program. The U.S. military tried to interdict illicit shipments headed for Tehran. The Treasury Department issued endless rounds of targeted sanctions, but each time it restricted access to global markets for suspect individuals and companies, Tehran would simply create new ones. And successive administrations tried the diplomatic route to slow or stop Iranian proliferation, including Tehran’s efforts to share weapons and research with other enemies of the United States, without success.

In response, federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors were deployed to shut down the Iranian procurement networks and dam the rivers of U.S. parts and technology illicitly flowing to Iran in violation of export control laws.

That proved virtually impossible, given the hundreds of trading, shipping and transport companies Iran employed, and the complex payment schemes and often unwitting procurement agents it used to get the products via other countries with lax export controls.

Meanwhile, since at least 1982, the Government Accountability Office began issuing stinging reports about how the lack of coordination and information-sharing among U.S. agencies severely hampered efforts to bring criminal cases against traffickers.

After the 9/11 attacks, those turf battles intensified. The cases often took years to investigate, and federal agents from two or even three agencies would sometimes discover they were conducting international undercover operations against the same target, a top former Homeland Security official recalls.

Securing convictions from American juries was also a huge challenge given the complex nature of the cases, especially when the procurement networks were buying so-called dual-use components that also could be used for less nefarious purposes.

Two post-9/11 cases exposed gaping holes in the global counterproliferation safety net. In the United States, Israeli-born trafficker Asher Karni was arrested for illegally shipping suspected U.S. nuclear components to Pakistan for its atomic bomb arsenal. And in Pakistan, metallurgist Abdul Qadeer Khan was caught selling his country's nuclear capability to Iran, Libya and North Korea.

Both cases ratcheted up Washington’s fears that the vast underground of WMD trafficking rings could sell their wares to Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.

In 2007, the Bush administration responded by establishing the National Counterproliferation Initiative, charging the Justice Department with coordinating and expanding U.S. efforts to dismantle the procurement networks.

Task forces were established around the country, with special training for prosecutors and agents in how to collectively build cases that would not only put front-line traffickers in prison, but also map the illicit networks and target their leadership.

From the outset, Iran cases were front and center, especially in cities like San Diego, Houston and New York with large military, industrial or technology sectors. Boston, in particular, seemed a favorite of the Iranian networks.

Soon, the multi-agency teams were homing in on key players in Iran’s nuclear and missile programs and another network procuring the IED components that Tehran’s fearsome Revolutionary Guard used to assist Iraqi insurgents killing American troops in Iraq.

An early high-value target was Amin Ravan, who by 2008 was working with a Singapore firm on behalf of the Aerospace Industries Organization, described by a secret State Department cable that year as “the umbrella organization and key procurement center for all Iranian industries responsible for developing and manufacturing missiles.”

Another was Behrouz Dolatzadeh, the suspected assault weapons buyer for Tehran. Authorities say he had been active as far back as 1995 in illegal arms smuggling and other illegal activities in connection with a sprawling business empire linked to Iran’s hard-line leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

By 2011, the Justice-led task forces had developed so many promising leads that the FBI, Commerce and Homeland Security Department had created special units to better coordinate efforts. Together, they also improved liaisons with overseas law enforcement agencies instrumental in interdicting shipments headed for Iran.

And working with U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department, the task forces successfully lured several key Iranian operatives out of Tehran and China for capture elsewhere, including two who would end up on Obama’s prisoner swap list.

Dolatzadeh was indicted under seal in Arizona in February 2012, lured to the Czech Republic to inspect weapons en route to Iran, and arrested. And Ravan, already linked to the IED network, was secretly indicted in Washington in November 2012 and captured soon after in Malaysia.

And after a three-year undercover investigation, U.S. authorities lured a major Iranian proliferator named Parviz Khaki to the Philippines in May 2012 and arrested him on charges of conspiring to smuggle nuclear-related U.S. equipment to Iran.

“By dismantling this complex conspiracy … we have disrupted a significant threat to national security,” John Morton, then-director of DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said at the time.

All three investigations provided U.S. officials with unprecedented insight into Iran’s secret procurement efforts, current and former task force members said. But Dolatzadeh and Ravan were released by courts overseas, and Khaki died in custody, before the U.S. could extradite them.

The counterproliferation teams also enlisted the help of American companies, providing them with Iran’s massive shopping list of needed items and hotlines to call when they got a nibble.

“It took a long time to mature, but by 2013 to 2014, it became very evident that we were getting a lot of great leads,” recalls Randall Coleman, who as assistant FBI director oversaw the bureau’s fledgling Counterproliferation Center and special coordinators in all 56 field offices.

“We were very aggressive, and as a result of that, our caseload went up about 500 percent,” Coleman said. “It really exploded. We were rocking and rolling.”

One of the most promising cases was in Boston, where federal agents were deep into their investigation of the illicit flow of parts to Iran from a Massachusetts firm, MKS Instruments, and its Shanghai subsidiary.

With help from MKS, which was not suspected of wrongdoing, agents initially focused on Cheng and gathered evidence that he had been indirectly supplying Iran with components with nuclear applications for years. The trail led to Eyvaz Technic Manufacturing, an Iranian company designated by European authorities as an entity involved in developing and procuring parts for Iran's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.

“Time is important, not only for you, for me, for your end user, but also for your nation,” Cheng wrote in a 2010 instant message to a suspected Iranian accomplice. “I personally believe the war will break out in 2 years and that will be the start of World War Three.”

But the agents’ curiosity was also piqued by another message from back in 2007, in which the Iranian accomplice, Seyed Jamili, asked Cheng for thousands of pressure transducers, for “a very big project and secret one.”

The project, authorities determined, was Iran’s clandestine uranium nuclear enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow, where the transducers helped run thousands of gas centrifuge cascades to reach weapons-grade capability. There was even a photo of then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad touring Natanz, with the centrifuges — and MKS transducers clearly visible — in the background.

International U.S. arrest warrants were secretly issued for the two men, and authorities nabbed Cheng when he traveled to London to watch a soccer match in February 2014. After he was extradited and brought to Boston that December, authorities began to realize that Jamili was a far more important cog in Iran’s proliferation network than they had suspected.

It was Jamili who had recruited Cheng with the promise of big and easy money, they determined, and who had been using his Iranian import-export firm as cover for personally recruiting other procurement agents on trips to China and possibly other countries.

Around that same time, negotiations over a comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran were heating up, and so were the top-secret prisoner swap talks on the sidelines of them.

AN OPERATIONAL SLOWDOWN

By the winter of 2014, federal agents and prosecutors began to detect waning support at the higher rungs of the Obama administration for their counterproliferation efforts against Iran, according to numerous officials involved. Also, they said, Justice Department management — and an interagency Iran working group — suddenly were scrutinizing Iran cases more closely, asking a lot more questions and holding up requests and approvals that in the past had been routine.

No specific guidance or order was given, some said, but the message was clear.

“They didn’t want to have cases just popping up in the workup to the agreement or shortly after the agreement. The administration would not look good if there were [cases documenting] these acquisition attempts. And the Iranians kept doing it,” MacDonald, the former senior Homeland Security official, said of Tehran’s illegal procurement efforts.

“They were never told no, just to wait,” MacDonald said of the agents. “It was a common theme among the people working these cases. The official response was that nothing had changed, that if you brought the case forward, it would be worked. But unofficially, that was just not the case.”

Some of the cases involved significant investigations into nuclear and missile proliferation that required State Department approval, including visas to lure suspects to the U.S. for arrest, said MacDonald, who had also served on the White House Task Force on Export Control Reform. “I’ve been told that the highest levels of the State Department weren’t processing those, and the cases couldn’t move forward.”

A former senior State Department official said that in most cases, State Department and White House could only provide nonbinding guidance on how ongoing law enforcement operations might affect the sensitive negotiations. Ultimately, he said, the Justice Department was responsible for pushing back and protecting the integrity of its investigations and prosecutions.

And while it’s possible that federal law enforcement officials missed opportunities as a result of State Department delays, “I am not aware of a single case where they lost out on some key arrest or information, or some proliferation activity was allowed to continue,” the former senior State Department official said, adding that some lures and extraditions were approved “until the very end of our tenure.”

Richard Nephew, a former top Iran sanctions official at the State Department and National Security Council, said any delays were “much more a case of managing the diplomatic initiative than letting the bad guys get away with stuff. If we found out in the NSC that something involved active law enforcement activity, then we were advised to stay the hell away from it.”

A top Obama Justice Department official rejected the notion that the State Department didn’t undermine important cases. He said prosecutors and investigators sometimes acceded to requests for delays they believed to be reasonable. But they became infuriated at times, he said, especially when opportunities to lure and arrest key Iranian proliferators were lost due to delay or outright rejection by State.

“The impediment was not the leadership of DOJ but the other agencies that DOJ has to work with to bring these cases successfully,” the Obama Justice official said. “They can kibosh it, they can pocket veto it, they can tell us no, they can punt it down a couple of steps.”

Justice Department officials demanded “high-level conversations” with the State Department and White House, but “not a whole lot” changed, the Obama Justice official said. “Did it fix the issue? I don’t think it did. I remember people up and down at DOJ being frustrated with the inability to move things.”



Getty Statements by the Obama administration officials about the prisoner swap: “In a reciprocal humanitarian gesture, six Iranian-Americans and one Iranian serving sentences or awaiting trial in the United States are being granted clemency. These individuals were not charged with terrorism or any violent offenses. They’re civilians, and their release is a one-time gesture to Iran given the unique opportunity offered by this moment and the larger circumstances at play.” — President Barack Obama, Jan. 17, 2016 “We made a reciprocal humanitarian gesture by releasing seven individuals, six of whom were U.S. nationals, who had either been tried and convicted of nonviolent crimes — essentially sanctions violations or violations of the trade embargo the United States has in place against Iran.” — Press Secretary Josh Earnest, White House press briefing, Jan. 19, 2016 “We ... did not have to release any Iranians involved in terrorism or convicted of violent crimes. Iran had a significantly higher number of individuals, of course, at the beginning of this negotiation that they would have liked to have seen released. But we were able to winnow that down to these seven individuals, six of whom are Iranian-Americans.” — Senior Obama administration official, Jan. 17, 2016, background briefing for reporters arranged by the White House “These are people with sanctions violations. So we feel very comfortable that the United States of America held onto its principles, got its people home, kept faith with them. … There was going to be a lifting of sanctions there and it made sense for us to link sanctions-related offenses, which were about to expire anyway and be released, to the release of our people who had years ahead of them in jail.”

The Obama administration actually granted clemency to seven Iranian-born men convicted or awaiting trial in the United States, including some that Justice Department officials said posed threats to national security, and dropped U.S. charges and international arrest warrants against 14 others. All fugitives, the 14 included some of the most wanted Iranian agents suspected of procuring parts and technology for Tehran’s nuclear, ballistics missile and weapons programs.

A senior former federal law enforcement official involved in counterproliferation efforts agreed, saying the FBI was especially impacted. “Did some of these other agencies’ actions … undermine what we were trying to accomplish in terms of the Iran network in the U.S.? Yes. But you are treading into waters where people don’t like what you are doing because it affects other things they are trying to do, diplomatically and politically.”

Ultimately, the dysfunction created by the slowdown spread far beyond the enforcement agencies and damaged relationships with partners in private industry and foreign governments, former DHS official MacDonald and others said.

By early 2015, the Obama administration’s oft-publicized desire for securing an Iran deal “was politicizing all of the ongoing investigations,” Arnold said. He visited his former CPC Iran Unit colleagues that August while briefing Treasury and FBI officials on the Iran deal, reached a month earlier, as a counterproliferation expert at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

“There was a fear that as negotiations went on, the White House wouldn’t want to get caught in a flap” created by a high-profile arrest or criminal case, Arnold said.

For agents and prosecutors, the headlines such an incident would create would antagonize not only their superiors but also a White House intent on proving to Tehran that it was committed to reaching an accord. On the flip side, it could also provide ammunition to the proposed deal’s many critics in Congress and elsewhere, who were claiming that Iran was aggressively continuing its clandestine procurement efforts even as it pledged good behavior.

But agents and prosecutors had an even more powerful reason to throttle back on Iran proliferation cases, according to Arnold and others.

Despite repeated requests, many were not given guidance or reassurances that the nuclear deal being negotiated in secret wouldn’t render unprosecutable new and ongoing cases, especially high-priority ones against nuclear traffickers, Arnold said. So agents had no confidence that their work would bear fruit.

“It was absolutely insane,” Arnold said. “People didn’t know what to do.”

“From the summer of 2015 on, there was a serious slowdown” as many counterproliferation officials shut down prosecutions and investigations voluntarily, Arnold said. “During that time, CPC wasn’t as aggressive as it should have been.”

The senior Obama administration official acknowledged that the twin sets of negotiations influenced the overall U.S. counterproliferation effort against Iran, especially the timing of individual investigations, prosecutions and international efforts to bring suspects to justice.

Such competing equities are unavoidable when high-level matters of diplomacy and geopolitics are under consideration, the official said. At those times, the White House must be guided by broader policy objectives, in this case de-escalating conflict with Iran, curbing its nuclear weapons program and freeing at least four American prisoners.

“The White House wouldn’t be getting involved in saying yea or nay to particular arrests or cases or the like” that are the purview of the Justice Department, the administration official said. “It was not uncommon, though, that before we were going to undertake a law enforcement action that we thought would have foreign policy implications, we would alert folks at the White House so that there could be appropriate notice given to a foreign government. That happens.”

The former official also acknowledged the complaints by agents and prosecutors about cases being derailed but said they were unavoidable, and for the greater good.

“It’s entirely possible that during the pendency of the negotiations, that folks who were doing their jobs, doing the investigations and bringing cases, having no understanding of and insight into the other process, were frustrated because they don’t feel like their stuff is moving forward,” said the Obama official. “Or they were not getting answers, because there are these entirely appropriate discussions happening on the policy side.

“That doesn’t strike me as being, a, unusual or, b, wrong,” the official added. “But I completely understand why it’s frustrating.”

The Justice Department refused repeated requests to make available for interviews anyone related to the counterproliferation effort since the Iran deal, or to provide information about its role in the negotiations.

But in a statement to POLITICO, the Justice Department said the negotiations “did not affect the Department’s determination to investigate and charge worthy cases” and that it continued to “investigate, charge, and prosecute viable criminal cases … throughout negotiations of the JCPOA,” the formal term for the Iran deal. The Justice Department said it filed federal charges against 90 individuals and entities for violations of export controls and sanctions implicating Iran between 2014 and 2016, many under seal. It did not provide information about cases under seal for those or other years, making it impossible to place those numbers in the proper context.

Also, some of those cases involve the 21 Iranians let go in the swap. And because numerous individuals and entities often are charged in a single case, the statistics suggest a slowdown in counterproliferation efforts, according to current and former investigators and a POLITICO review of DOJ cases.

The timing of arrests, prosecutions and other investigative activities “may be informed by a variety of factors, including, especially in the national security context, collateral foreign policy consequences and impacts on American lives,” the Justice Department said. “Once an individual is charged, the Department works to ensure that the defendant, whether located in the U.S. or abroad, is held accountable. In seeking to apprehend defendants located abroad, however, we need assistance from other departments, agencies, and countries, and sometimes we cannot accomplish an arrest without it.”

Senior Obama administration officials also said the negotiations over the nuclear deal and, even more so the prisoner swap, required such extraordinary secrecy that only a tiny number of people were involved.

But as the nation’s top law enforcement official — and as a participant in the negotiations —Lynch failed in her responsibility as attorney general to protect the integrity of the Justice Department’s investigations and prosecutions from any political interference, some current and former officials believe.

Lynch, through an aide, declined to comment.

Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, raised the issue of Justice Department independence in 2015, when as a senator he asked incoming Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates about whether she knew that she had “the responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that's improper?”

Earlier this year, this issue arose again when Trump fired then-Acting Attorney General Yates for doing just that and refusing to defend his executive order on immigration. By doing so, Trump had “placed the independence of the Justice Department at stake,” said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). “The attorney general is the people’s attorney, not the president’s attorney.”

Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis also emphasized the importance of such a firewall recently when addressing Trump’s claim that Obama had ordered wiretaps of him or his campaign. ""A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,"" Lewis said.

Many front-line current and former authorities disagree, and say the Iran deal and prisoner swap is a glaring example of that.

“A lot of people were furious; they had cases in the pipeline for months, in some cases years, and then, all of a sudden, they were gone — all because they were trying to sell the nuke deal,” a former Department of Commerce counterproliferation agent said. “Things fell apart after that. There are some really good cases out there and they are not going forward. They just let them die on the vine.”

A MASTERMIND EMERGES

Top Obama administration officials insist that the nuclear deal does not impede any of the broader U.S. efforts to go after Iran’s vast nuclear, missile and conventional weapons procurement efforts. Even so, many participants said the way forward is still sufficiently unclear that they can’t, or won’t, proceed.

Over the past year, the system has kicked back into gear, with some new cases filed and movement in existing ones. Some, however, involve activity dating to 2008, including the prosecution of some of Ravan’s suspected associates in the Iraq IED case. Privately, some prosecutors and investigators are hopeful that the Trump administration’s more hard-line approach to Tehran will mean more support for their efforts.

Like many others, though, Albright said he is concerned that the counterproliferation effort has suffered significant and lasting damage, even if much of it involves classified efforts that may never become public.

“How much damage was done to the law enforcement side of this from us pulling back from these prosecutions?” he asked. “We have to pick up the pieces.”

Albright said that is especially the case in Boston, where he testified for the government against Cheng.

A few weeks after the prisoner swap, a judge sentenced Cheng to nine years in federal prison, even more than the prosecutors asked for, for his role in the conspiracy.

Cheng’s lawyer, Stephen Weymouth, accused federal prosecutors of unfair treatment, saying they threw the book at his client, a relatively small fish, while dropping all charges against the “mastermind,” Jamili.

Since the swap, federal authorities have learned more about Jamili, including intelligence tying him directly to Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, a top Iranian nuclear official who supervised a key “commercial affairs” initiative at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, according to officials familiar with the case. Authorities believe Jamili was on the phone with Ahmadi-Roshan on Jan. 11, 2012, when unknown assailants on a motorbike killed him by attaching a bomb to his car. Tehran accused Israel’s Mossad in the attack.

But the federal agents’ efforts to pursue such leads, even in the U.S., have been complicated by the general uncertainty hanging over the broader counterproliferation effort, according to Arnold, the former FBI analyst.

“Part of the frustration is that there is strong evidence Iran is still conducting illegal procurement operations and the FBI can’t really go forward with these cases,” said Arnold, who has been closely following the Jamili-Cheng case as part of a Harvard research project into nuclear proliferation networks.

That frustration is especially acute when it comes to Jamili and the 13 other fugitives. When dropping the charges, the Justice Department said it was doing so in large part because it was unlikely that the U.S. would ever be successful in capturing or extraditing them anyway.

Some federal officials familiar with the cases scoffed at that, noting that they have lured many Iranians to places where they could be arrested, and that others were tripped up by sealed Interpol warrants while traveling. In Jamili’s case, said one, “he has traveled so we know there’s a chance we could get him.”

Despite decades of intensive investigations, Arnold said, U.S. officials still have a “major air gap” when it comes to understanding the intermediaries like Jamili involved in the Iranian networks — who are between foot soldiers like Cheng and government officials running the nuclear and weapons programs.

“All of a sudden, we’re no longer playing whack-a-mole, and we suddenly have this key player who is directly involved and has insider knowledge as to how this whole process works,” he said. “So to see him being traded away is frustrating.”"

Squatting is far more effective and a healthier way to excrete than sitting and helps to prevent a lot of ailments including colon cancer.,http://toilet-related-ailments.com/colon-cancer.html,"Colon Cancer - Why Is It So Common In The West, But Not In Other Places?

















Colon cancer, or colorectal cancer, is a major killer disease.

It is prevalent in the West but rare in the developing countries, as reported in Science News Online (Feb 13, 2003):

""Each year, about 150,000 people are diagnosed with colon cancer in the United States alone. Although the disease is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, few people living in developing nations contract the illness...""

For decades, many Western researchers have been trying to find an explanation for this phenomenon.

But coming from a society where sitting toilets are well and truly entrenched, they couldn't understand or accept how toilet posture could be the reason…

How could they? Almost none of them has ever use or seen a squatting toilet before... As a result, the researchers had missed the important connection between the toilet posture and colon cancer.

People in the developing world squat for waste elimination.

People in the West sit.

Lacking this insight, the researchers have mainly focused on dietary factors. Many have attempted to prove that a diet high in fiber prevents colon cancer.

Yet, this high fiber diet theory has NOT been proven.







SIDENOTE

=========================================

Fiber from whole plants has been shown to be beneficial in other disorders, including heart disease and diabetes. So there's good reason to keep eating it. But it is not the main factor in colon cancer cases.

=========================================



The truth is that colon cancer, like other kinds of cancer, is a complex disease. The exact cause is not very clear. Yet, the underlying cause is stagnation of waste (fecal stagnation) in the colon.

Which bring us to the next point.

What had protected the developing world from colon cancer is the natural cleanliness of the colon as a result of using the squatting position for waste evacuation.























By forcing users to sit instead of squat, the sitting toilet makes it physically impossible to evacuate waste effectively and causes fecal stagnation -- the primary cause of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases.





Sitting Toilets Put You At Great Risk

The colon or large intestine is five to six feet in length. It receives food wastes from the small intestine and moves them, by wavelike muscular contractions (peristalsis), towards the rectum to be passed out.

During this process, water is continuously extracted and the waste gradually solidifies. If there is any obstruction in the flow of waste for any reason, the continual drying process can cause waste to be glued to the colon walls.

When this occurs, the colon passageway becomes constricted and cells start to suffocate. The prolonged exposure to toxins could trigger the onset of colon cancer.

The colon is specifically designed with squatting in mind.

Sitting toilets obstruct the flow of waste in the colon because they ignore and break all the natural laws of waste elimination. They make elimination difficult and cause stagnation of waste.

Here's the reason why...

For safety, nature has created obstacles in the colon to maintain continence, ie: the ability to prevent accidental evacuation.









SIDENOTE

==========================================

Eighty percent (80%) of colon cancers are located in the grey areas. Not surprising, as these areas are where fecal stagnation is common.

This explains the strong correlation between constipation (fecal stagnation) and colon cancer, as reported by the Epidemiology Journal in 1998: ""People who frequently felt constipated were more than four times as likely to develop colon cancer as those who did not complain of constipation.""

==========================================



These obstacles in the colon can ONLY be released in the squatting position. In any other position, these obstacles are not released and the colon is in the ""continence mode"".

One of these obstacles is the kink (or bend) where the sigmoid colon joins the rectum.





For complete waste evacuation, the sigmoid colon needs the support of the left thigh. In the squatting position, the left thigh lifts the sigmoid colon and opens up the kink to let waste flow easily to the rectum.





The other obstacle is the bend where the rectum joins the anus. In the sitting position, the puborectalis muscle grips the rectum in a choked position to maintain continence.

In the squatting position, the puborectalis muscle relaxes its grip and straightens the bend to allow waste to be passed out easily.



But there is more…

In the squatting position, the right thigh -- pressed against the abdomen -- squeezes the cecum from below to push wastes upwards into the ascending colon. As the force is directed upwards, the ileocecal valve (the inlet valve of the colon) stays securely closed.



SIDENOTE

==========================================

The cecum is the second most common site for colon cancer. Squatting goes a long way to prevent cancer because the cecum, squeezed from below by the right thigh, is cleared of waste regularly. Two other benefits: a clean appendix and a small intestine that would not be contaminated by waste.

==========================================



In the squatting position, the weight of the entire upper body pressing down against the feet and thighs increases the pressure in the abdomen. This compresses the colon to create a natural laxative effect and encourages complete waste evacuation.

















All these things don't happen with sitting toilets...

The sitting toilet obstructs the flow of waste because it ignores all the natural requirements for waste elimination:

The left thigh does not lift the sigmoid colon to open up the kink to let waste flow easily to the rectum...

The right thigh does not squeeze the cecum so that waste is forced upwards into ascending colon and away from the appendix and small intestine...

The path between the rectum and anus is held in the choked position by the puborectalis muscle...

The entire colon is not properly sealed and pressurized for complete waste evacuation...



Is it any wonder why, when you use sitting toilets, elimination is so difficult? (It is like trying to drive a car with the parking brakes on.)

In spite of all the straining, the 'pushing' downwards with the diaphragm, holding the breath, in order to force waste through these obstacles, evacuation is never complete. This leads to stagnation of waste in the colon, especially in the sigmoid colon, cecum and rectum -- the three most common locations for colon cancer.





Colon Cancer: A Terrible Scourge in Modern Times

In the Western world, colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer, with almost 150,000 new cases each year in the United States alone.

Despite recent advances in screening and treatment for colon cancer, the number of people dying from the disease has remained steady since the late 1980s.

The immense pain and suffering due to colon cancer is totally unnecessary...

The good news is that you can do something about it... By choosing to squat for waste elimination, you need not fear this disease. You would also reap a lifetime of health dividends that come from having a cleaner and healthier colon.

One point though. If you have been sitting toilets all your life, squatting may be difficult at first. The cause is explained on this page about squatting facets. However, with some practice, it is possible for you to regain the ability to squat again.

That would allow you to switch from sitting to squatting for waste elimination, using one of the options listed here.



For most, however, the most feasible option would be to use a toilet squatting platform or converter, like this one featured here.

The coronavirus slayer! How Kerala's rock star health minister helped save it from Covid-19,http://theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/the-coronavirus-slayer-how-keralas-rock-star-health-minister-helped-save-it-from-covid-19?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"KK Shailaja has been hailed as the reason a state of 35 million people has only lost four to the virus. Here’s how the former teacher did it

On 20 January, KK Shailaja phoned one of her medically trained deputies. She had read online about a dangerous new virus spreading in China. “Will it come to us?” she asked. “Definitely, Madam,” he replied. And so the health minister of the Indian state of Kerala began her preparations.

Four months later, Kerala has reported only 524 cases of Covid-19, four deaths and – according to Shailaja – no community transmission. The state has a population of about 35 million and a GDP per capita of only £2,200. By contrast, the UK (double the population, GDP per capita of £33,100) has reported more than 40,000 deaths, while the US (10 times the population, GDP per capita of £51,000) has reported more than 82,000 deaths; both countries have rampant community transmission.

As such, Shailaja Teacher, as the 63-year-old minister is affectionately known, has attracted some new nicknames in recent weeks – Coronavirus Slayer and Rockstar Health Minister among them. The names sit oddly with the merry, bespectacled former secondary school science teacher, but they reflect the widespread admiration she has drawn for demonstrating that effective disease containment is possible not only in a democracy, but in a poor one.

How has this been achieved? Three days after reading about the new virus in China, and before Kerala had its first case of Covid-19, Shailaja held the first meeting of her rapid response team. The next day, 24 January, the team set up a control room and instructed the medical officers in Kerala’s 14 districts to do the same at their level. By the time the first case arrived, on 27 January, via a plane from Wuhan, the state had already adopted the World Health Organization’s protocol of test, trace, isolate and support.

As the passengers filed off the Chinese flight, they had their temperatures checked. Three who were found to be running a fever were isolated in a nearby hospital. The remaining passengers were placed in home quarantine – sent there with information pamphlets about Covid-19 that had already been printed in the local language, Malayalam. The hospitalised patients tested positive for Covid-19, but the disease had been contained. “The first part was a victory,” says Shailaja. “But the virus continued to spread beyond China and soon it was everywhere.”

In late February, encountering one of Shailaja’s surveillance teams at the airport, a Malayali family returning from Venice was evasive about its travel history and went home without submitting to the now-standard controls. By the time medical personnel detected a case of Covid-19 and traced it back to them, their contacts were in the hundreds. Contact tracers tracked them all down, with the help of advertisements and social media, and they were placed in quarantine. Six developed Covid-19.

Another cluster had been contained, but by now large numbers of overseas workers were heading home to Kerala from infected Gulf states, some of them carrying the virus. On 23 March, all flights into the state’s four international airports were stopped. Two days later, India entered a nationwide lockdown.

At the height of the virus in Kerala, 170,000 people were quarantined and placed under strict surveillance by visiting health workers, with those who lacked an inside bathroom housed in improvised isolation units at the state government’s expense. That number has shrunk to 21,000. “We have also been accommodating and feeding 150,000 migrant workers from neighbouring states who were trapped here by the lockdown,” she says. “We fed them properly – three meals a day for six weeks.” Those workers are now being sent home on charter trains.

Shailaja was already a celebrity of sorts in India before Covid-19. Last year, a movie called Virus was released, inspired by her handling of an outbreak of an even deadlier viral disease, Nipah, in 2018. (She found the character who played her a little too worried-looking; in reality, she has said, she couldn’t afford to show fear.) She was praised not only for her proactive response, but also for visiting the village at the centre of the outbreak.

The villagers were terrified and ready to flee, because they did not understand how the disease was spreading. “I rushed there with my doctors, we organised a meeting in the panchayat [village council] office and I explained that there was no need to leave, because the virus could only spread through direct contact,” she says. “If you kept at least a metre from a coughing person, it couldn’t travel. When we explained that, they became calm – and stayed.”

Nipah prepared Shailaja for Covid-19, she says, because it taught her that a highly contagious disease for which there is no treatment or vaccine should be taken seriously. In a way, though, she had been preparing for both outbreaks all her life.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist), of which she is a member, has been prominent in Kerala’s governments since 1957, the year after her birth. (It was part of the Communist Party of India until 1964, when it broke away.) Born into a family of activists and freedom fighters – her grandmother campaigned against untouchability – she watched the so-called “Kerala model” be assembled from the ground up; when we speak, this is what she wants to talk about.

The foundations of the model are land reform – enacted via legislation that capped how much land a family could own and increased land ownership among tenant farmers – a decentralised public health system and investment in public education. Every village has a primary health centre and there are hospitals at each level of its administration, as well as 10 medical colleges.

This is true of other states, too, says MP Cariappa, a public health expert based in Pune, Maharashtra state, but nowhere else are people so invested in their primary health system. Kerala enjoys the highest life expectancy and the lowest infant mortality of any state in India; it is also the most literate state. “With widespread access to education, there is a definite understanding of health being important to the wellbeing of people,” says Cariappa.

Shailaja says: “I heard about those struggles – the agricultural movement and the freedom fight – from my grandma. She was a very good storyteller.” Although emergency measures such as the lockdown are the preserve of the national government, each Indian state sets its own health policy. If the Kerala model had not been in place, she insists, her government’s response to Covid-19 would not have been possible.

That said, the state’s primary health centres had started to show signs of age. When Shailaja’s party came to power in 2016, it undertook a modernisation programme. One pre-pandemic innovation was to create clinics and a registry for respiratory disease – a big problem in India. “That meant we could spot conversion to Covid-19 and look out for community transmission,” Shailaja says. “It helped us very much.”

When the outbreak started, each district was asked to dedicate two hospitals to Covid-19, while each medical college set aside 500 beds. Separate entrances and exits were designated. Diagnostic tests were in short supply, especially after the disease reached wealthier western countries, so they were reserved for patients with symptoms and their close contacts, as well as for random sampling of asymptomatic people and those in the most exposed groups: health workers, police and volunteers.

Shailaja says a test in Kerala produces a result within 48 hours. “In the Gulf, as in the US and UK – all technologically fit countries – they are having to wait seven days,” she says. “What is happening there?” She doesn’t want to judge, she says, but she has been mystified by the large death tolls in those countries: “I think testing is very important – also quarantining and hospital surveillance – and people in those countries are not getting that.” She knows, because Malayalis living in those countries have phoned her to say so.

Places of worship were closed under the rules of lockdown, resulting in protests in some Indian states, but resistance has been noticeably absent in Kerala – in part, perhaps, because its chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, consulted with local faith leaders about the closures. Shailaja says Kerala’s high literacy level is another factor: “People understand why they must stay at home. You can explain it to them.”

The Indian government plans to lift the lockdown on 17 May (the date has been extended twice). After that, she predicts, there will be a huge influx of Malayalis to Kerala from the heavily infected Gulf region. “It will be a great challenge, but we are preparing for it,” she says. There are plans A, B and C, with plan C – the worst-case scenario – involving the requisitioning of hotels, hostels and conference centres to provide 165,000 beds. If they need more than 5,000 ventilators, they will struggle – although more are on order – but the real limiting factor will be manpower, especially when it comes to contact tracing. “We are training up schoolteachers,” Shailaja says.

Once the second wave has passed – if, indeed, there is a second wave – these teachers will return to schools. She hopes to do the same, eventually, because her ministerial term will finish with the state elections a year from now. Since she does not think the threat of Covid-19 will subside any time soon, what secret would she like to pass on to her successor? She laughs her infectious laugh, because the secret is no secret: “Proper planning.”

Nurses Are Finally Being Recognized as the Heroes They Have Always Been,http://thedailybeast.com/on-florence-nightingales-200th-birthday-thank-a-nurse-for-being-a-hero,"Leslie Neal-Boylan, The Conversation

Nurses are heroes of the COVID-19 crisis. May 12 is International Nurses Day, which commemorates the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the first “professional nurse.” The World Health Organization also named this year the “Year of the Nurse” in honor of Nightingale’s 200th birthday.

To nurses everywhere, this day and this year have great significance. Nurses, who are being recognized as heroes, have long awaited recognition as health care professionals in their own right and not ancillary to physicians. It’s wonderful to be recognized now in the context of coronavirus, but nurses have always been at the forefront—during war, epidemics and other times of disaster.

I have been a nurse for 40 years and a nurse practitioner for 17 of those years. An active clinician, researcher, scholar and educator, I currently serve as dean of the Solomont School of Nursing at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Throughout my career, nurses have typically been relegated to a secondary role, and if mentioned at all, we are described as assisting doctors. Nurses today are still asked why they didn’t become doctors instead. Aren’t we smart enough?

Many people don’t realize that nursing and doctoring are entirely different professions with different purposes. We are proud to work alongside doctors and other health professionals, but we have never worked behind them. Not all nurses work at the bedside, but we all touch the lives of patients.

Many nurses have doctoral degrees. They conduct research that advances the quality of patient care. Nurses change health care policy. For example, nurses play a significant role in health care reform and advise Congress on proposed health care rules and regulations. They also guide organizations regarding health care technology and care coordination and sit on executive boards of health care organizations. Nursing is both an art and a science.

The role of the nurse has evolved, but some things haven’t changed. Nurses have always cared for the sick, the well and the dying. We promote health and prevent illness. We interpret what is happening so that patients understand it. We are there for the entire patient experience from birth to old age, from wellness to illness, and throughout age and illness toward a peaceful and dignified death.

Our history provides many examples.

In 1854, Florence Nightingale brought 38 volunteer nurses to care for soldiers during the Crimean War. The cause of the conflict focused on the rights of Christians in the Holy Land and involved Russia, the Ottoman Empire, France, Sardinia and the United Kingdom. Male nurses provided care as far back as the Knights Hospitaller in the 11th century. But prior to Nightingale’s involvement, male and female nurses consisted of untrained family members or soldiers who cared for the ill and infirm.

Nightingale was the first to organize nurses and provide standardized roles and responsibilities for the profession. As such, she is credited with founding modern professional nursing. She was also an expert statistician, collecting data on patients and what did and didn’t work to make them better. Nightingale and her nurses improved sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. They provided care and comfort. Their work had a major impact on the survival of soldiers.

The American Civil War in the 1860s brought thousands of trained nurses to the battlefront, risking their lives to care for soldiers on both sides of the conflict. The most famous were Dorothea Dix, an advocate for indigenous populations and the mentally ill; Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross; and Louisa May Alcott, the author of “Little Women.”

Nurses again answered the call with the yellow fever epidemic of 1878, rushing from all over the country to Tennessee. The epidemic ultimately killed 18,000 people, and many nurses died while caring for the sick.

The U.S. recruited more than 22,000 trained nurses to treat Americans overseas and back at home from 1917 to 1919 during World War I. The war brought death from combat to about 53,000 Americans, while about 40 million civilians and military died worldwide. Time after time, nurses have left the warmth, comfort and safety of their homes to care for others.

Nurses were also among the millions who died from the 1918 influenza pandemic. Fifty million people died worldwide. This pandemic is probably most comparable to what we are experiencing today with COVID-19. But epidemics, such as polio, off and on from 1916 to 1954; the global pandemic of influenza A, 1957-1958; swine flu, 2009-2010; Ebola, 2014-2016; and Zika, 2015-2020, have also required constant nursing care.

I remember the AIDS pandemic, which began in 1981. I was a visiting nurse and saw many patients in their homes, from homeless shelters to penthouse apartments. Everyone suffered not only because of the physical and mental effects of the disease but also because of the stigma. People, even their families, were afraid to touch patients, kiss them or be near them. It was a lonely time for these patients. I watched them deteriorate and die. Nurses were often the only ones to hold the hands of these patients, so they wouldn’t die alone.

Nurses were also there during 9/11. They were among the courageous first responders who risked their lives to save others. Many have chronic diseases because of their exposure to Ground Zero.

Every year, nurses are voted first among the professions the public trusts the most, according to Gallup. We work hard to earn and maintain that trust. You will find us caring for people in their homes, in public health departments, in nursing homes and skilled care facilities, in rehabilitation hospitals, in prisons and correctional institutions, caring for the mentally ill and providing health care advice over phones and computers. Nurses work wherever there are people.

What do we ask in return? It’s simple. We don’t consider ourselves heroes, but we do deserve respect. Public images of the nurse in a sexy uniform or as a handmaiden to a doctor are wrong and insulting. We are professionals. Once the COVID-19 crisis is over, please don’t forget that we are always here for you. Always have been. Always will be.

Anti-Malaria Drug Hydroxychloroquine to Be Made Available to Coronavirus Patients. Approved by the Food and Drug administration and will be available for prescription immediately,http://thedailybeast.com/anti-malaria-drug-to-be-made-available-to-coronavirus-patients-almost-immediately-trump-says,"An anti-malaria drug has been approved for use in treating coronavirus symptoms, President Donald Trump said Thursday—however, officials immediately cautioned that approval for widespread use was still a long way off.

The drug Hydroxychloroquine, used on malaria and arthritis patients, will be made available “almost immediately” to coronavirus patients with a prescription, Trump said during the administration’s coronavirus task force briefing on Thursday.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has slashed red tape so they could fast track the approval of the drug’s new use, he added. It has had “very encouraging early results” in tests on COVID-19, he said, adding that the coronavirus pandemic was now a “medical war.”

Trump said people would be trying the drug “literally within a few days.” Almost immediately, however, the FDA cautioned a more measured approach.

Stephan Hahn, head of the FDA, said he would not confirm a timeline but, given that the drug was already approved for other usages, researchers had information about possible side effects. He said the initial approval phase was done quickly, but the testing phase was only now getting underway.

“I want to assure you we’re working as quickly as we can, I don’t want to speculate about a timeline,” he said, adding that the FDA was “looking at everything that’s coming across our desks as possible treatment options for coronavirus.”

Hahn said the drug would be initially used under “compassionate use,” which means doctors can ask to use the experimental drug on patients. The FDA can then gather data on its safety and efficacy from doctors ahead of a full-scale approval. “We are working expeditiously,” he said.

He said the president had directed the agency to take a closer look at whether the use of chloroquine could be expanded more widely beyond compassionate use.

“And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial,” he said, “a large, pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be asked and answered.”

After Trump’s comments, Bloomberg reported that an FDA spokesperson told the news organization that hydroxychloroquine had not yet been specifically approved to help people diagnosed with COVID-19.

In a statement posted online Thursday, the FDA said there are “no FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19, there are several FDA-approved treatments that may help ease the symptoms from a supportive care perspective.”

Studies are underway to determine the efficacy of using chloroquine to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to “potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease,” the agency said.

A study published by Nature on Tuesday found that Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, was effective in stopping a COVID-19 infection in vitro.

“There’s promising information to say that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may work based on laboratory studies, but that needs to be confirmed with human studies,” Dr. Timothy Brewer, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at UCLA, told The Daily Beast on Thursday.

“I think the FDA is correct in saying we clearly should study this but we should do it in the setting of a clinical trial to figure out, is this actually working or not in people?”

Hahn said on Thursday a second drug called remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, was also in a clinical trial in the U.S. and had been approved for “compassionate use” by doctors with suitable patients. Gilead said in February that they were expanding clinical trials of the anti-viral drug’s possible usage on COVID-19 patients.

In a statement, the FDA said innovators were looking into anti-viral drugs that might treat the virus, as well as host targets that may be helpful in reducing lung inflammation and improving lung function in COVID-19 patients. The agency said one drug company had started a clinical trial of an antibody drug and there was interest in evaluating the use of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin, antibody-rich blood products that are taken from blood donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19 and could possibly treat the illness in others.

The U.S. has confirmed at least 7,701 COVID-19 cases and 118 deaths, according to the Associated Press’ latest figures.

During Thursday’s press conference, Vice President Mike Pence said he had visited manufacturers to ensure that millions of N95 masks and other equipment were in production.

Towards the end of the briefing, however, Trump gave into one of his favorite pastimes of complaining about press coverage, reporters, and “fake news.”

It started when a reporter for One America News Network asked the president a question about whether he “considers the term Chinese food racist.”

Before answering, the president complimented OAN for treating him “very nicely.”

The moment became more surreal as the OAN reporter derided “major left wing news media,” for describing Trump as racist because of his decision to call the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus.”

The moment allowed Trump to return to familiar newspaper complaints about The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post as health fears and the pandemic continue to plague the nation.

In a surprisingly strong showing, Biden rolled to victories across the South, Midwest and New England on the biggest day of voting in the Democratic campaign. Americans in 14 states cast ballots for a challenger to Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

“For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign,” said Biden, the former vice president who had performed poorly in the first three nominating contests but broke through with a win in South Carolina.

“We are very much alive,” he told roaring supporters in Los Angeles.

Sanders, the one-time front-runner who had hoped to take a big step toward the nomination on Tuesday, won Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont, Edison Research said.

Fox News and AP projected Sanders won California, whose 415 delegates represent the largest haul in the nominating contest. But Edison Research and other networks held off declaring a winner as results trickled in.

With overwhelming support from African American, moderate and older voters, Biden swept to wins in Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia.

The second biggest prize Texas and Maine were too close to call. Sanders was slightly trailing Biden in Texas, a state he had heavily invested in and had hoped to win given its sizeable Latino population.

It was a spectacular turn of events for Biden, whose campaign was on life support after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. Until a week ago he trailed Sanders in most state and national polls.

Biden’s blowout win in South Carolina on Saturday provided a burst of new momentum, fueling a wave of endorsements from elected Democratic officials and former presidential rivals including Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota before voting began on Super Tuesday.

ONE THIRD UP FOR GRABS

More than one-third of the delegates who will pick the eventual nominee at a July convention were up for grabs in the primaries on Tuesday, which provided some clarity at last in a muddled race for the White House.

The results also left Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who spent more than half a billion dollars on advertising, largely out of the running, with his only victory coming in the U.S. territory of American Samoa.

Bloomberg campaign officials said he would reassess whether to stay in the race on Wednesday, but they said that did not mean he would drop out.

Biden was hoping to stay within reach of Sanders in delegates, giving him a chance to catch up as the race moved on. But after Tuesday, he led Sanders in delegates for the day 241 to 174, with hundreds more to be allocated.

Overall, Biden leads Sanders in delegates 294 to 234.

Without naming him, Sanders took direct aim at Biden during a rally with supporters in Vermont, criticizing his 2002 vote to authorize the war in Iraq and his support for global trade deals that Sanders opposed.

“We’re going to win the Democratic nomination and we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country,” Sanders said.

Biden accomplished his main Super Tuesday goal of muscling aside Bloomberg and consolidating support from moderates to turn the race into a one-on-one contest against Sanders.

BIDEN POPULAR WITH BLACK VOTERSBiden repeated his strong performance with black voters in South Carolina on Saturday. Edison Research exit polls showed Biden winning large majorities of African-American voters in the South.

His showing was further fueled by strong support among a older people, college graduates and those who considered themselves liberal or moderate.

Sanders countered with a strong showing among Latinos, young people and white men, helping him to wins in the West.

The results were disappointing for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who finished well behind Sanders and Biden in most states and trailed them in her home state of Massachusetts.

Bloomberg was a wild card heading into the voting, as he joined the competition for the first time. He was winning more than 15% of the vote, enough to pick up some delegates, in Tennessee, Texas, Colorado, Utah, California and Arkansas.

The moderate Bloomberg skipped the first four contests and bombarded Super Tuesday and later voting states with ads, but saw his poll numbers slip after coming under fire during Democratic debates over past comments criticized as sexist and a policing policy he employed as New York’s mayor seen as racially discriminatory.

Biden is hoping to build a bridge between progressive Democrats’ desire for big structural change and more moderate Democrats yearning for a candidate who will be able to win over enough independents and Republicans to oust Trump.

That effort gained fresh momentum on the eve of Tuesday’s voting as moderates Buttigieg and Klobuchar endorsed Biden after withdrawing from the race.

Biden pulled off his victories despite being vastly outspent on ads by Bloomberg, who had spent $377 million on ads by Feb. 23, and Sanders, who spent $20 million. Biden spent $4.7 million during the same period, according to the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks ad spending and content.

The pace of the Democratic race begins to accelerate after Super Tuesday, with 11 more states voting by the end of March. By then, nearly two-thirds of the delegates will have been allotted.

The next contests, on March 10, will be in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington state."
Grimes and Elon Musk are having a Baby!,http://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/grimes-pregnant-elon-musk/?fbclid=IwAR2EijR0fkcfEDCXbT46wUAM-jaOFkhYYkIn4bxkvmDTY3AVJsg5Za31lRc,"Grimes and Elon Musk, photo via Getty

Congratulations are in order to Grimes and Elon Musk, who are expecting a child their first child together.

Grimes shared the news on Instagram by posting a nude photo of herself with a fetus superimposed over her stomach. She further confirmed her pregnancy in a comment responding to a fan who applauded her decision to post an uncensored photo. Update: The original post has been removed by Instagram; she has since uploaded a censored version.



“I thought about censoring them for a hot minute haha (this may get taken down anyway) but the photo is so much less feral without the nipples. Plus being knocked up is a very feral & war-like state of being. Might as well be what it is.”

“Plus most of my friends told me not to post them so then I was afflicted w reverse psychology. Interrogated my shame on it and decide it was sum weird internalized self hatred to feel uncomfortable abt my body.”

Grimes and Musk have been dating since early 2018.

Next month brings the release of Grimes’ long-awaited new album, Miss_Antropocence. Given her past aversions to touring and her pregnancy, it’s unlikely we see her on the live stage anytime soon. Then again, if you believe Grimes, live music is about to become obsolete anyways."
Bernie Sanders is America's best hope for a sane foreign policy,http://theweek.com/articles/887731/bernie-sanders-americas-best-hope-sane-foreign-policy,"In the American foreign policy discussion, socialists are often presented as gormless naifs — people whose utopian projects might sound good in theory, but who can't be trusted to exercise real power in a dangerous world. Only hard-nosed liberals or conservatives can make the tough decisions required to protect American interests.

Yet it is beyond question that, for at least the last 20 years now, American foreign policy has indeed been in the grips of starry-eyed utopian cranks — the imperialist variety, whose violent madcap schemes have unleashed hell across the globe, for no purpose or benefit to anyone but a narrow elite. Most recently, the supposedly anti-war President Trump has assassinated Iran's most important military leader under the delusional belief that it will somehow reduce instability and violence in the region.

Meanwhile, the 2020 presidential candidate with the most serious, realistic foreign policy agenda is the self-identified socialist, Bernie Sanders. Sanders promises the most stubborn confrontation with this lunatic militarism on offer, and the best possibility that America might become a responsible member of the international community.

Let's briefly review American foreign policy since the turn of the millennium. After the 9/11 attacks, President Bush launched an invasion of Afghanistan to topple the Taliban and destroy Al Qaeda. This quickly became a quagmire of an occupation, with clueless U.S. forces halfheartedly trying to stand up a democracy in the graveyard of empires.

Then, as had been the plan all along, Bush launched a wholly illegal war of aggression against Iraq, justified by faked-up intelligence about weapons of mass destruction and heavy implications that Saddam Hussein had been behind 9/11. Neither was true, and while Hussein was defeated easily, another quagmire quickly developed — drastically worsened by the bungling idiots Bush put in charge of things, who dismissed the entire Iraqi army and forced destructive right-wing economic policy on the fledgling Iraqi state.

Meanwhile, occupation forces committed scores of atrocities in both countries — some the typical concomitants of war, some simply gratuitous crimes, as in the torture dungeon at Abu Ghraib and the Nisour Square massacre. Bush himself and all his top advisers set up a program of systematic illegal torture which produced no good intelligence and made it impossible to prosecute some of the perpetrators of 9/11.

Across the world, the U.S. was revealed as a shrieking, blood-drenched hypocrite — a nation that loudly proclaimed itself to be a paragon of freedom and democracy while contemptuously ignoring international law and committing horrifying war crimes by the score.

The decisive factor in Barack Obama's victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary was the fact that he had opposed the Iraq invasion while she had voted for it. But once in power, Obama appointed Clinton as secretary of state and largely embraced Bush's imperialist foreign policy. He slowly drew down forces in Iraq, but drastically escalated the war in Afghanistan, which accomplished nothing except more chaos and death. As the Afghanistan Papers recently published by the Washington Post reveal, Obama administration military commanders and officials lied constantly about the total lack of progress on any of the occupation's goals.

Obama also sharply escalated the use of drone attacks, killing thousands of people in several countries — including several U.S. citizens, one of them a 16-year-old boy. He largely backed the Saudi war in Yemen, which quickly turned into a humanitarian catastrophe. And while Obama banned torture by executive order, he refused to prosecute any of the perpetrators (as required by treaty) and quietly backed the CIA in its effort to suppress the Senate report on its torture program — which included illegal spying on Senate staffers.

The post-9/11 wars have already cost roughly $6.4 trillion (in current and future costs). Now President Trump has escalated U.S. troop deployments across the world, and further scaled up the use of drone attacks — culminating with the assassination of Iranian general Qassam Soleimani in Baghdad last week, raising the prospect of an all-out war with Iran.

Bernie Sanders has stood against the worst of all this. He opposed the Iraq invasion because of probable U.S. casualties, the terrible precedent it would set, the heavy cost, and possible blowback. He voted against Michael Mukasey to become attorney general in 2007 because he refused to say whether waterboarding was torture and refused to recognize any limits on the president's wartime authority. He opposed Obama's surge in Afghanistan. And he has loudly condemned practically every action of President Trump of any kind.

Now, foreign policy was clearly not Sanders' main concern during most of his time in Congress, and he has not been as strong a critic of imperialism as some people. He did, like everyone in Congress except Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), vote for the Afghanistan invasion. In 2011, he was mealy-mouthed on the assassination of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki.

But since foreign policy was identified as a weakness in his 2016 campaign, he has scaled up his policy work and staffing there, especially by hiring Matt Duss, a noted anti-war scholar. Sanders has bolstered his anti-war thinking and messaging, including both extensive speeches and contemptuous attacks on well-connected imperialists like Henry Kissinger. Sanders now says his Afghanistan vote was a mistake and favors a careful withdrawal of troops there.

In the 2020 campaign, Sanders has leaned into the anti-war message, distinguishing himself as the boldest critic of imperial overreach in the Democratic field. As Ryan Brooks writes at Buzzfeed News, Sanders was alone among the Democratic frontrunners in not implicitly justifying the assassination of Soleimani in his initial response. Even Elizabeth Warren couldn't manage this, though she did come out with a better response after her first one drew criticism from the left. (Joe Biden didn't even explain why the Obama administration didn't kill Soleimani, while Mike Bloomberg supported it outright.)

Make no mistake, any president attempting to even scale back the rate of atrocities committed by American military forces is going to face stiff resistance in Congress and especially from the complex of military contractors who have gotten hog-rich on ever-more bloated defense budgets — often by basically defrauding the government. But that is another mark in Sanders' favor. Only the most stubborn and committed anti-war president has a chance of putting U.S. foreign policy on an even slightly sane footing. At a minimum, Sanders is the candidate least likely to start a new war for no reason — no small thing!

Sanders could also possibly draw on deep wells of support for imperial rollback. Several studies and polls exploring the citizenry's opinion on foreign affairs have found a sort of bewildered irritation at the giant waste of resources all these wars have been. A recent poll asking what the U.S. should do regarding Iran found people against war by a 76-21 margin. A Center for American Progress focus group study described voters wanting ""their political leaders to make more public investments in the American people in order to compete in the world and to strike the right balance abroad after more than a decade of what they see as military overextension."" Veterans and ordinary people alike agree by huge margins that both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were a mistake.

In other words, most Americans are disturbed by the epic, endless scale of military spending, and would like a goodly portion of that to be redirected back into the country itself. Yet, it's a fairly quiet opinion, likely in part because only a tiny proportion of the citizenry actually serves in the military, and because almost all Washington foreign policy discussion is dominated by a knee-jerk imperialist mindset. The so-called Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a neoconservative think tank heavily funded by right-wing billionaires that has lobbied incessantly against the Iran nuclear deal and for regime change in that country, was cited at least four times in the New York Times' initial coverage of the Soleimani assassination. In the rest of the mainstream media, blind troop worship is typically the norm.

However, we can also see that warmongers of the D.C. ""Blob"" have not convinced the broader American public. Instead, they have prevented anyone from trying to activate voters using the (correct) argument that they are being fleeced by a corrupt military establishment. Many might be swayed to vote or pressure their members of Congress if they were presented with such an argument — which is exactly what Sanders plans to do.

The last 20 years of American foreign policy have seen bloody bungling on a scale of Napoleon's invasion of Russia. A sensible, realistic approach would start by not doing that anymore. Bernie Sanders is the best choice to bring America back to its foreign policy senses.

'Just don't waste': David Attenborough's heartfelt message to next generation,http://theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/19/just-dont-waste-david-attenborough-advice-bbc-seven-worlds-one-planet,"David Attenborough has delivered a heartfelt message to children around the world on how they can help save the planet: “Live the way you want to live but just don’t waste.”

At the first screening of the BBC’s forthcoming blockbuster nature series, Seven Worlds, One Planet, the 93-year-old offered his advice to a five-year-old in the London audience. The boy was overwhelmed by nerves when handed the microphone, so his father asked his question on his behalf: “What can he do to save the planet?”

“You can do more and more and more the longer you live, but the best motto to think about is not waste things,” Attenborough replied. “Don’t waste electricity, don’t waste paper, don’t waste food. Live the way you want to live but just don’t waste. Look after the natural world, and the animals in it, and the plants in it too. This is their planet as well as ours. Don’t waste them.”

A rapt audience of children in India and South Africa joined the event by videolink and lined up to ask Attenborough questions and wave posters. At Mumbai’s packed Royal Opera House, placards read “Sir David please come to India please” and “Sir David can I please come on a shoot with you?”

One asked Attenborough which animal he had found most difficult to document during his 70-year career. “I nominate going to look for mountain gorillas for the first time,” he said. “That was an unforgettable time and more successful than we could possibly have hoped … but it was a long time ago.”

Asked what was the greatest treat in store for viewers in the new series, Attenborough said: “There’s a wonderful creature called the golden-haired blue-faced snub-nosed snow monkey. I’d never seen film of it before. I once read a scientific paper and thought: we must go and film that! But that was back in the 60s and we couldn’t get to China so in the end I dropped it … and then, blow me, this lot pop up and say ‘we’ve got it’.”

Jonny Keeling, the series’ executive producer, described his excitement at showing Attenborough never-before-seen footage of the monkey, only for him to nonchalantly reply: “Ah yes, Rhinopithecus roxellana!”

Seven Worlds, One Planet took four years to make, with seven hours of television edited down from 2,000 hours of footage shot on every continent – including drone footage inside a volcano. Keeling said it stood out from other blockbuster nature documentaries because it embedded conservation throughout every episode rather than “just [having] a line about it”.

Tony Hall, the director general of the BBC, said: “There has never been a more important time to bring natural wonders to everybody.” He confirmed the BBC’s commitment to air a landmark nature series every year until 2023. “No other broadcaster comes close to that kind of commitment to the natural world.”

The BBC’s Natural History Unit has faced criticism for what some see as a reticence in spelling out how humans are damaging the natural world. This year, Attenborough’s move to Netflix for Our Planet – which made its message explicit throughout – was hailed as his first act as an “in-yer-face eco-warrior” and many felt it stole the BBC’s thunder.

Attenborough rejects such criticism, saying both he and the broadcaster had long been conscious of the climate crisis. “I don’t think I’ve made a series in the last 40 years where I haven’t made at the end an appeal about caring for the natural world,” he said.

“At the time I daresay people thought we were cranks, but as it’s gone on and we’ve repeated it on and on and on – not wasting things, not polluting things, and so on. Suddenly, for no reason I can understand because the message has been the same, you hit the right note.”

It was with Blue Planet II, he said, that the world became “electrified” about the crime of dumping plastic into the ocean. “Quite what it is that makes the messages ring the bell is very difficult to say. I daresay if we knew how to do it, we would do it more frequently.”

The Path to 100% Renewable Power Is Looking More Achievable,http://barrons.com/articles/renewable-energy-stocks-51571148477,"Text size

Electricity generation is the largest single contributor to the carbon emissions that are warming the planet. It accounts for 42% of global emissions, and that share is likely to grow as transportation increasingly is powered by batteries instead of oil.

As countries announce ambitious plans to wean their economies from fossil fuels, their efforts to shift how they generate electricity will determine whether they can hit those goals. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which helps governments come up with plans to shift to renewables, has estimated that 86% of electricity can be generated with renewables by 2050.

That number might seem high, but more data is now supporting the potential for an aggressive shift in power generation. In a new report, Bernstein analyst Meike Becker examined how countries can get to 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050, and the analysis has some good news about the potential for renewable generation.

The analysis underscores investor optimism about areas like solar and wind. The Invesco Solar ETF (ticker: TAN) is up 59% this year, while the First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy ETF (QCLN) is up 20%.

Becker’s report found that countries will take widely different paths to renewable generation, based on their natural resources. If coal and oil deposits determined a country’s fate in the 20th century, the force of its rivers and strength of its sunshine will likely determine its path in the 21st. Countries that generate hydroelectric power are way ahead in terms of producing clean power. Norway generates 98% of its electricity from renewable sources, largely because of hydro power. As of 2015, Brazil got 75% of its power from hydro sources. Canada relies on renewables for 67% of its electricity.

Newsletter Sign-up Review & Preview Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what's likely to matter tomorrow. PREVIEW

But even in countries without rushing water generating much electricity, Becker sees a feasible path to renewable generation. In Belgium, for instance, hydro accounts for just 7% of generation. What’s more, Belgium depends on nuclear power for about 30% of its electricity, and the country plans to phase nuclear out by 2025. Nonetheless, Becker expects Belgium can generate at least 75% of its electricity with renewables by 2050 by relying on solar, wind and a variety of other technologies, including so-called “combined cycle gas turbines” that use gas and steam for power. The key to doing this is being able to generate and store power at times when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing, using batteries and technologies that can use other fuels more efficiently.

The chances that countries can generate all their electricity with renewables by 2050 are “at this point very close to 100% for countries with good resources and a bit further away if conditions are less favourable,” she wrote in an email to Barron’s. Nonetheless, countries without the same resources can still generate “very high share, and usually higher than what most people currently think, I would say.”

"Emotional breakthroughs during psychedelic experiences linked to future increases in mental well-being, according to a new study (n=379), which suggests that confronting difficult emotions and allowing their expression within the session is a healthy process.",http://psypost.org/2019/09/emotional-breakthroughs-during-psychedelic-experiences-linked-to-future-increases-in-mental-well-being-54399,"New research highlights the importance of emotional breakthroughs on subsequent psychological outcomes after a psychedelic experience. The study, which was published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, sheds new light on the psychological mechanisms behind psychedelic-assisted therapy.

“Most of the papers that discuss current psychedelic therapy mention the mystical-type or peak experience as a mediator of the long term clinical changes,” explained Leor Roseman, the corresponding author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London.

“However, in practice, and based on qualitative research, it is known that there are other important mediators. One of them are moments of emotional catharsis within a psychedelic session.”

“I wanted to quantify these moments in order to increase our knowledge on the psychological mechanism that leads to long term changes and to broaden the narrative from mystical-type experiences to other experiences as well,” Roseman said.

The researchers recruited 379 participants via internet advertisements, who agreed to complete online surveys before and after a planned psychedelic experience.

Prior to taking the psychedelic drug, the participants completed questionnaires to assess demographic information, their intentions for the psychedelic experience, and general mental wellbeing. After the experience, the participants completed the new Emotional Breakthrough Inventory, along with the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and Challenging Experience Questionnaire.

The Emotional Breakthrough Inventory assesses the psychedelic experience with questions such as “I faced emotionally difficult feelings that I usually push aside” and “I was able to get a sense of closure on an emotional problem.”

In contrast, the Mystical Experience Questionnaire assesses experiences of oneness and loss of time/space, while the Challenging Experience Questionnaire assesses feelings of isolation, physical distress, anxiousness, paranoid, and similar experiences.

Long-term outcomes were then measured two weeks after the experience.

The researchers found that emotional breakthrough was positively associated with post-psychedelic increases in mental well-being. In other words, people who scored higher on the Emotional Breakthrough Inventory tended to have greater increases in well-being two weeks later.

Mystical Experience Questionnaire scores also predicted increases in well-being, while those who reported more challenging experiences tended to see smaller increases.

But the three scales did not appear to be redundant. Rather, “a multi-factorial predictor model that combines all three measures performs better than any alternative that neglects any one of them,” the researchers wrote in their study.

“The average person should take from this study the idea that the quality of the psychedelic experience is related to long term changes,” Roseman told PsyPost.

“That is to say, that the therapeutic potential of psychedelics is not solely pharmacological like other medications, but it supports the emergences of psychological transformative processes, that can lead to long term changes if integrated well. The focus here on emotional breakthrough suggests that confronting difficult emotions and allowing their expression within the session is a healthy process.”

“Besides mystical-type experiences and emotional breakthrough, there are other experiences that mediate long term changes, such as cognitive insights, the connection with the therapists, and so on,” Roseman added.

“These are not quantified yet, and it is good to know that psychedelic therapy is not just about peak or cathartic experiences (the ones that are quantified), but it is much broader than this and can be quite unexpected sometimes.”

The study, “Emotional breakthrough and psychedelics: Validation of the Emotional Breakthrough Inventory“, was authored by Leor Roseman, Eline Haijen, Kelvin Idialu-Ikato, Mendel Kaelen, Rosalind Watts, and Robin Carhart-Harris."
"Guacamole lovers, rejoice! The avocado genome has been sequenced",http://phys.org/news/2019-08-guacamole-lovers-avocado-genome-sequenced.html,"Researchers at UB, the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity (LANGEBIO) and Texas Tech University have sequenced the avocado genome.

We now know the DNA of guacamole.

Scientists have sequenced the avocado genome, shedding light on the ancient origins of this buttery fruit and laying the groundwork for future improvements to farming.

With regard to modern affairs, the study reveals for the first time that the popular Hass avocado inherited about 61 percent of its DNA from Mexican varieties and about 39 percent from Guatemalan ones. (Avocados come in many types, but Hass—first planted in the 1920s—comprises the bulk of avocados grown around the world.)

The research also provides vital reference material for learning about the function of individual avocado genes, and for using genetic engineering to boost productivity of avocado trees, improve disease resistance and create fruit with new tastes and textures.

The study is important for agriculture. The growing global market for avocados was worth about $13 billion in 2017, with Mexico, the largest producer, exporting some $2.5 billion worth of the fruit that year, according to Statista, a provider of market and consumer data. Around the world, avocados are spread on tortillas, mashed up to flavor toast, rolled into sushi and blended into milkshakes (a popular treat in parts of Southeast Asia).

Scientists sequenced not only the Hass avocado, but also avocados from Mexico, Guatemala and the West Indies, which are each home to genetically distinct, native cultivars of the fruit.

The project was led by the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity (LANGEBIO) in Mexico, Texas Tech University, and the University at Buffalo. The research was published on Aug. 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

""Avocado is a crop of enormous importance globally, but particularly to Mexico. Although most people will have only tasted Hass or a couple of other types, there are a huge number of great avocado varieties in the species' Mexican center of diversity, but few people will have tried them unless they travel south of the U.S. border. These varieties are genetic resources for avocado's future. We needed to sequence the avocado genome to make the species accessible to modern genomic-assisted breeding efforts,"" says Luis Herrera-Estrella, Ph.D., President's Distinguished Professor of Plant Genomics at Texas Tech University, who conceived of the study and completed much of the work at LANGEBIO, where he is Emeritus Professor, prior to joining Texas Tech University.

""Our study sets the stage for understanding disease resistance for all avocados,"" says Victor Albert, Ph.D., Empire Innovation Professor of Biological Sciences in the UB College of Arts and Sciences and a Visiting Professor at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore). Albert was another leader of the study with Herrera-Estrella. ""If you have an interesting tree that looks like it's good at resisting fungus, you can go in and look for genes that are particularly active in this avocado. If you can identify the genes that control resistance, and if you know where they are in the genome, you can try to change their regulation. There's major interest in developing disease-resistant rootstock on which elite cultivars are grafted.""

The family history of an eccentric, big-pitted fruit

While the avocado rose to international popularity only in the 20th century, it has a storied history as a source of sustenance in Central America and South America, where it has long been a feature of local cuisines. Hundreds of years ago, for example, Aztecs mashed up avocados to make a sauce called āhuacamolli.

Before that, in prehistoric times, avocados, with their megapits, may have been eaten by megafauna like giant sloths. (It's thought that these animals could have helped to disperse avocados by pooping out the seeds in distant locations, Albert says.)

The new study peers even further back into time. It uses genomics to investigate the family history of the avocado, known to scientists as Persea americana. ""We study the genomic past of avocado to design the future of this strategic crop for Mexico,"" Herrera-Estrella said. ""The long life cycle of avocado makes breeding programs difficult, so genomic tools will make it possible to create faster and more effective breeding programs for the improvement of this increasingly popular fruit.""

The avocado belongs to a relatively small group of plants called magnoliids, which diverged from other flowering plant species about 150 million years ago. The new research supports—but does not prove—the hypothesis that magnoliids, as a group, predate the two dominant lineages of flowering plants alive today, the eudicots and monocots. (If this is right, it would not mean that avocados themselves are older than eudicots and monocots, but that avocados belong to a hereditary line that split off from other flowering plants before the eudicots and monocots did.)

""One of the things that we did in the paper was try to solve the issue of what is the relationship of avocados to other major flowering plants? And this turned out to be a tough question,"" Albert says. ""Because magnoliids diverged from other major flowering plant groups so rapidly and so early on, at a time when other major groups were also diverging, the whole thing is totally damn mysterious. We made contributions toward finding an answer by comparing the avocado genome to the genomes of other plant species, but we did not arrive at a firm conclusion.""

Magnoliids were estimated by a 2016 research paper to encompass about 11,000 known living species on Earth, including avocados, magnolias and cinnamon. In comparison, some 285,000 known species were counted as eudicots and monocots.

The avocado as a chemist, and the heritage of the hybrid Hass

Scientists don't know how old the avocado is, and the new study doesn't address this question. But the research does explore how the avocado has changed—genetically—since it became its own species, branching off from other magnoliids.

The paper shows that the avocado experienced two ancient ""polyploidy"" events, in which the organism's entire genome got copied. Many of the duplicated genes were eventually deleted. But some went on to develop new and useful functions, and these genes are still found in the avocado today. Among them, genes involved in regulating DNA transcription, a process critical to regulating other genes, are overrepresented.

The research also finds that avocados have leveraged a second class of copied genes—tandem duplicates—for purposes that may include manufacturing chemicals to ward off fungal attacks. (Tandem duplicates are the product of isolated events in which an individual gene gets replicated by mistake during reproduction.)

""In the avocado, we see a common story: Two methods of gene duplication resulting in very different functional results over deep time,"" Albert says.

""In plants, genes retained from polyploidy events often have to do with big regulatory things. And genes kept from the more limited one-off duplication events often have to do with biosynthetic pathways where you're making these chemicals—flavors, chemicals that attract insects, chemicals that fight off fungi. Plants are excellent chemists,"" Herrera-Estrella says.

Having addressed some ancient mysteries of the avocado, the new study also moves forward in time to explore a modern chapter in the story of this beloved fruit: how humans have altered the species' DNA.

Because commercial growers typically cultivate avocados by grafting branches of existing trees onto new rootstocks, today's Hass avocados are genetically the same as the first Hass avocado planted in the 1920s. These modern-day Hass avocados are grown on Hass branches grafted onto various rootstock that are well adapted for particular geographic regions.

While the Hass avocado was long thought to be a hybrid, the details of its provenance—61 percent Mexican, 39 percent Guatemalan—were not previously known. The scientists' new map of the Hass avocado genome reveals huge chunks of contiguous DNA from each parental type, reflecting the cultivar's recent origin.

""Immediately after hybridization, you get these giant blocks of DNA from the parent plants,"" Herrera-Estrella says. ""These blocks break up over many generations as you have more reproductive events that scramble the chromosomes. But we don't see this scrambling in the Hass avocado. On chromosome 4, one whole arm appears to be Guatemalan, while the other is Mexican. We see big chunks of DNA in the Hass avocado that reflect its heritage.""

""We hope that the Mexican Government keeps supporting these types of ambitious projects that use state-of-the-art technology to provide a deep understanding of the genetics and genomics of native Mexican plants,"" Herrera-Estrella said.

Keanu Reeves' most excellent surprise for one fan is 'breathtaking',http://cnn.com/2019/07/20/us/keanu-reeves-surprised-fan-in-yard-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Most excellent, Keanu Reeves fans: The affable actor heard your prayers, and he answered with a ""breathtaking"" act of kindness.

His latest good deed to go viral occurred in Slidell, Louisiana, on Wednesday, when he stopped in on a fan on his way to a film set.

Stacey Hunt had heard that Reeves was filming the third installment in the ""Bill and Ted"" franchise just up the street from her home. Her 16-year-old son, Ethan, suggested the family welcome him to the neighborhood with a poster, she told CNN.

So at her son's request, Hunt created a sign that read, ""You're breathtaking!"" -- a reference to Reeves' appearance at the E3 gaming conference in June, where he told everyone in attendance they, too, were breathtaking. The moment became a popular meme.

Hunt's sign hearkend back to Reeves' use of the phrase at the E3 gaming conference in June.

A few hours after she planted the poster in her front yard, a car pulled up and a few people got out. You could say strange things were afoot in the Hunts' yard as the group admired the poster.

"Increasing smartphone usage temporarily diminishes the ability to interpret the deeper meaning of information, suggests a new study, which also unexpectedly found that smartphone use was positively associated with some cognitive abilities, such as the ability to judge the credibility of information.",http://psypost.org/2019/07/increasing-smartphone-usage-temporarily-diminishes-the-ability-to-interpret-the-deeper-meaning-of-information-54085,"A recently published study — which included two controlled experiments — has found that smartphone use can lead to a diminished ability to analyze and reason about the meaning of information. But this effect appears to be transient, according to the new research, which appears in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology.

“Students and I had heard anecdotally how people felt like too much reliance on smartphones was making them stupid,” remarked study author Peter Frost, a professor of psychology at Southern New Hampshire University.

“One student commented that technology had limited her attention to the extent that she felt she could no longer sustain attention for an entire novel. We also had seen books, like ‘What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains: The Shallows’ by Nicholas Carr, and articles like, ‘Is Google Making Us Stupid?’ by the same author.”

“We found that there were plenty of studies about how smartphones diminish cognitive processes like attention when the technology is present, but we were curious as to whether there are any lingering effects of technology on brain functioning.”

“Correlational studies existed on lingering cognitive effects, but we all have learned in college that correlation does not mean causation. We decided to conduct a controlled experiment. My student research assistants (all undergraduates) said they could show me how we could track usage with apps—it was a nice collaborative situation.”

The researchers conducted three studies to examine the impact of smartphones on cognition. In all of the studies, the participants installed tracking software on their phones so that the researchers could confirm their screen time.

“Using tracking apps, we found that people use their smartphones for about 5-and-a-half hours a day—that is about a third of people’s waking hours! One of our lab assistants was surprised when she found out how much she uses her smartphone — more hours than would be expected of a full-time job,” Frost said.

An initial cross-sectional study of 105 undergraduates found that smartphone use was associated with lower performance on measures of delay of gratification and social problem solving.

In the second study, a week-long controlled experiment of 50 undergraduates, the participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was instructed to use their smartphones no more than 2 hours per day, while the other was instructed to use their smartphones at least 5 hours per day.

Frost and his colleagues found that participants in the high-use group had a diminished ability to interpret and analyze meaning, as measured by the Cornell Critical Thinking Test

The third study of another 50 undergraduates used a similar methodology, but lasted for 28 days instead of just one week.

Replicating their previous findings, the researchers observed that participants had a diminished ability to interpret and analyze meaning, as measured by the California Critical Thinking Skills Test, after one week of using their smartphone more than 5 hours per day.

However, this effect dwindled into insignificance after four weeks. At the end of the month, there was no difference between lower and higher smartphone usage groups — indicating that the effect was only temporary.

“We examined whether continued use of smartphones change the neuroplasticity of the brain in the long run, especially in regards to the ability to delay gratification for longer-term goals, attention and the ability to patiently reflect,” Frost explained to PsyPost.

“In a nutshell, we found that very few aspects of cognition were affected in the long run. We did find that the ability to extract the deeper meaning of information was influenced by heavy, daily smartphone use, but only for a limited amount of time (for about no more than a month after increased use).”

“We believe it was the first study of its kind (implementing controlled experiments and tracking apps) and we hope it will spur a new research area on potential lingering effects of smartphone use on cognition,” Frost said.

But like all research, the study includes some caveats.

“We were limited in how long we could run this study given we anticipated a high dropout rate if we regulated people’s usage rates for much more than a month. A lingering question is whether we would find effects had we manipulated phone usage for longer intervals of time. Some brain scanning studies shows that technology can alter brain activity within a week, but many of those studies involved use of the internet and not smartphones,” Frost said.

“Another lingering question would be whether results would have been different if people were not aware they had downloaded tracking apps. There is a new app on iPhones that would allow us, with consent, to look at usage rates before participants become aware their usage is being observed (we could track usage backwards from the time of the first research session). We are making use of that technology in our next study.”

Unexpectedly, the researchers found that smartphone use was positively associated with some cognitive abilities — such as the ability to judge the credibility of information.

“We anticipated that we might find some lingering effects of smartphones on various aspects of higher cognition, but were surprised to find just one transitory effect associated with higher rates of smartphone usage that lasted no longer than a week (the ability to extract the deeper meaning of information),” Frost told PsyPost.

“We might have been swept up by a technology bias that seems to accompany the introduction of new technologies, even going back to books. Plato claimed our reliance on books might compromise memory. There have been similar fears expressed about radio, calculators, television, email and the internet.

“While fears of lingering effects might be more a social phenomenon than reality, we have to caution that there is research showing smartphones have addictive qualities and can compromise cognitive functions like attention while in use. In other words, some fears of smartphones are justified,” Frost said.

The study, “An examination of the potential lingering effects of smartphone use on cognition“, was authored by Peter Frost, Patrick Donahue, Keith Goeben, Megan Connor, Hoong Sing Cheong , and Aaron Schroeder."

New gene therapy able to heal damage caused by heart attack,http://brecorder.com/2019/05/20/497964/new-gene-therapy-able-to-heal-damage-caused-by-heart-attack/,"Scientists have created a technique that could regenerate heart cells damaged by a cardiac attack with the help of gene therapy, hence, also reducing risk of heart attacks.

Researchers from King’s College London have discovered new genetic therapy that can induce heart cells to regenerate after a heart attack, a condition that is caused by sudden blocking of one of the cardiac coronary arteries and now affects over 23 million people in the world.

The technique to significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks involved inserting a gene into patients’ cells, a process known as gene therapy and works at correcting the effects of disease-causing mutation – something that can lead to treat heart disease rather than using medicines or surgery.

Startup aims to use gene-editing technology to treat heart diseases

As per Science Daily, when a patient survives a heart attack, they are left with permanent structural damage to their heart through the formation of a scar, which can ultimately lead to heart failure in the future.

For this experiment, the team delivered a tiny piece of genetic material called microRNA-199 to the heart of pigs after a heart attack, which resulted in almost complete recovery of the cardiac function only a month later.

As explained by Express.co, a single injection is inserted into the blood stream, which then slips inside the cells and then releases a molecular gene editing kit. The aim for the genetic material is to mimic the natural mutation that protects against heart attacks.

Lead author Mauro Giacca said, “It is a very exciting moment for the field. After so many unsuccessful attempts at regenerating the heart using stem cells, which all have failed so far, for the first time we see real cardiac repair in a large animal.”

Giacca, however, clarified that the process needs more time in order to move on to the next stage of clinical trials. “We still need to learn how to administer the RNA as a synthetic molecule in large animals and then in patients, but we already know this works well in mice.”"
Therapy Dogs For The Parkland Shooting Survivors Got Their Own School Yearbook Page And It's Pretty Amazing,http://buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/therapy-dogs-parkland-shooting-survivors-yearbook,"""Including them was a really good representation of what we have gone through,"" said one student. ""These dogs are going to be there until the last of us are gone.""

Aerie Yearbook

After the last glossy page of underclassman yearbook photos, 14 smiling, tongue-flashing dogs sit in two rows, their names listed just like the rest of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students and staff.

For adviser Sarah Lerner, rising editor-in-chief Caitlynn Tibbetts, and the rest of the yearbook staff at the high school in Parkland, Florida, including the crew of therapy dogs in this year's edition perfectly encapsulated the difficult but rewarding challenge of creating the book in the wake of a campus shooting that still very much defines their daily existence. ""It's a balancing act,"" Tibbetts, a 17-year-old junior, told BuzzFeed News. ""After the shooting we wanted that yearbook to be perfect and had to cover as much as possible. This year, we wanted to give proper representation of our school and who we are now without giving so much focus to what happened to us in the past. The therapy dogs are the one thing from last year that is permanent and positive."" The crew of doggos has been an unwavering, consoling, integral part of the school since a gunman walked onto campus on Valentine's Day 2018 and killed 17 students and staff. They go to class, give handshakes in the hallways, and wag tails in the courtyard outside the cafeteria as teens flood in and out for lunch.

Aerie Yearbook

The dogs have been there as students and teachers grappled with the suicides of two Parkland teens this spring, a spate of traumatizing false fire alarms, the first anniversary of the massacre, the unexpected news that their principal was leaving, school shootings across the country, and other challenges. A few of the dogs even joined students at prom.



""There's nothing a dog can't fix,"" said Lerner, an English and journalism teacher and the yearbook adviser. ""I'll be teaching and in comes a dog and these big 18-year-old adults all the sudden become mushy 5-year-old kids and it's been such a comfort for us.""

The pups have become such a fixture that, last October during makeup picture day, Lerner suddenly had the idea to include them in the school's award-winning yearbook. ""I told one of their handlers about it and next thing I know I had 15 dogs in the room,"" she laughed. ""We sat them up on chairs, they were smiling for the camera. It was the greatest day of my life.""



The yearbook photo shoot of the extremely good dogs quickly went viral last fall as students captured their furry friends decked out in bow ties posing for the photographers.

Including the therapy/service dogs in the yearbook is the best decision we’ve made so far like this one dog had a bowtie and my heart 😭💗💕

""It was such a mood lifter,"" Tibbetts said. ""Including them was a really good representation of our school and what we have gone through. Seeing them is something we look forward to every day. These dogs are going to be there until the last of us are gone."" And, as these behind-the-scenes shots show, Grace, Emma, and Chief took the moment very seriously.

Just a few of the puppies who took pictures today... Grace, Emma & Chief were so happy to be included in the yearbook.

According to Chief's human, Yvonne McAlpin, the four-year-old Labrador Retriever has an incredibly special bond with the kids, so much so that he often sits in their laps, something she says ""he never does with me or anyone else."" ""It's magical to see the positive impacts he makes,"" McAlpin said. ""The students will come up and you can see they are having anxiety and within 10 minutes they are totally relaxed, rubbing his belly and giving him kisses. He greets all the students when he goes into classrooms.""

Yvonne McAlpin Chief with one of his bffs at MSD.

Like constantly hearing about their school in the media, seeing Chief, Molly, and the other therapy dogs wandering across campus every day has become part of a new, strange, and emotional reality that the yearbook class worked hard to highlight, Tibbetts said.

""We are a school where news trucks are always posted outside and there is so much to deal with and show. We want to keep the conversation going in a non-triggering way,"" Tibbetts said, ""and it's a hard thing to do to not make it sad and depressing, but still honor who we lost and what happened to us."" When conceptualizing the yearbook, the 35 students were adamant about making it more of a ""celebration,"" Lerner noted. The colors and fonts are clean and bright. There are no pictures of the victims this year, but photos of memorials and snippets of stories and tributes about them are woven throughout the pages. ""It's hard to be here some days because of the trauma and reliving and revisiting things,"" Lerner said. ""I couldn't be prouder of my students and the yearbook they put together. Honestly, it's my favorite. We have a different perspective on things now, and it's not just a yearbook — it's a record of history.""

The yearbook's theme, ""It All Depends,"" aims to highlight perspective, growth, and how the school and community have transformed since the massacre.

""We wanted to focus on how everyone is feeling and going through things differently,"" Tibbetts said. ""All these moments and experiences define us, and it's a matter of getting through it. Eventually, things will be better, so it's a matter of finding the small joys and happiness in the everyday."" One great example, she said, is watching her classmates pick up their yearbooks and gush over the photos of their grinning therapy dogs before the summer starts."
A British teenager has made a remarkable recovery after being the first patient in the world to be given a genetically engineered virus to treat a drug-resistant infection.,http://theguardian.com/science/2019/may/08/teenager-recovers-from-near-death-in-world-first-gm-virus-treatment?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"A British teenager has made a remarkable recovery after being the first patient in the world to be given a genetically engineered virus to treat a drug-resistant infection.

Isabelle Holdaway, 17, nearly died after a lung transplant left her with an intractable infection that could not be cleared with antibiotics. After a nine-month stay at Great Ormond Street hospital, she returned to her home in Kent for palliative care, but recovered after her consultant teamed up with a US laboratory to develop the experimental therapy.

The scientists behind the breakthrough have said bacteria-killing viruses, known as phages, have the potential to be used as an alternative treatment to counter the growing crisis of resistance to antibiotics.

Isabelle’s mother, Jo, who made the initial suggestion of phage therapy to doctors at Great Ormond Street after reading about it online, said her daughter was “the luckiest child on earth” to have received the treatment in time.

“It’s incredible medical science. It’s been a miracle,” she said.

Isabelle has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that results in frequent infections clogging up the lungs with mucus. By summer 2017, her lungs had less than a third of their normal function and she had been plagued by two stubborn bacterial strains for eight years. She and her doctors decided a double lung transplant was the best option, even though it meant her existing infections could spread.

After the transplant, this fear became a reality: a bacterial strain similar to TB took hold, colonising her surgical wound, then her liver, until eventually pockets of bacteria known as nodules began pushing through the skin on her arms, legs and buttocks.

“She lost so much weight. She was literally like a skeleton,” Jo said. “The bacteria was just coming through her skin. There was nothing they could do to make her comfortable. It was horrific.”

She searched the internet for alternative treatments and on reading about phage therapies asked Isabelle’s consultant, Helen Spencer, whether this might be an option.

By chance, a Great Ormond Street colleague was in touch with Prof Graham Hatfull, a scientist who had spent more than three decades amassing a collection of phages, stored in 15,000 frozen vials at the University of Pittsburgh. Hatfull agreed to help find a treatment for Isabelle and another teenage patient at Great Ormond Street who had a life-threatening infection.

Phages work by infecting bacteria cells and killing them, but they are very specific in which infections they can target. Hatfull and colleagues identified dozens of phages known to infect bacterial relatives of the patients’ strains, and tested thousands of combinations of them in petri dishes to see which wiped out the patients’ bacteria.

“The idea is to use [phages] as antibiotics – as something we could use to kill bacteria that cause infection,” Hatfull said.

In January 2018 they found a phage that could hit the strain that infected one of the teenagers. But they were too late: the patient had died earlier that month. Around the same time, Jo had been told her daughter was unlikely to survive.

Each experiment took a week because the bacteria grow slowly. Shortly after Isabelle was sent home on a palliative care plan, Hatfull’s lab identified a phage that wiped out the infection, and another two phages that could infect it but not kill it efficiently. By removing a single gene, they were able to increase the efficiency of these two phages, making a cocktail that they believed could kill the infection. A combination was used to avoid the possibility of the infection becoming resistant to the phage.

In June 2018, Isabelle returned to Great Ormond Street and after some safety tests, was given the cocktail twice daily via an intravenous drip and on her skin. Six weeks later a liver scan revealed the infection had essentially disappeared.

Jo said: “The open wounds on her wrist healed. You could see her sparkle coming back to the point where she was getting up, eating, arguing with her sister.”

There were almost no side effects.

Hatfull said: “We didn’t think we’d ever get to a point of using these phages therapeutically. It’s a brilliant outcome.”

Isabelle is still on the treatment and it has been a slow, steady recovery. All but one of her skin nodules have cleared. She has returned to school, is studying for A-levels, has started a part-time job and is learning to drive.

Her case, outlined in the journal Nature Medicine, follows the successful treatment last year of a US patient infected with a drug-resistant superbug and comes as the looming crisis of antibiotic resistance is fuelling a growing interest in phage research.

As Isabelle’s treatment was not part of a clinical trial, it is impossible to know how effective the therapy would be for others; the authors want larger clinical trials to establish this.

Spencer said: “The bigger question is whether it could be used to treat other resistant bacteria.”

Finding the right phages for each patient is a big challenge. In the future, scientists hope it may be possible to conduct automated searches of phage libraries to identify personalised treatments. Some infections, such as the hospital superbug Staphylococcus aureus, are known to be genetically homogeneous enough that a few phages could treat almost all strains of the infection, raising the prospect of phage therapy becoming routine.

“We’re sort of in uncharted territory,” Hatfull said.

Jason Gill, a senior scientist at the centre for phage technology at Texas A&M University, said phages could have huge potential to tackle drug-resistant infections.

“It’s probably going to turn out that the phages are going to be really effective for some conditions, and others they won’t work that well,” he said."

During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, an increase in life expectancy was driven mainly by improvements in sanitation, housing, and education, causing a steady decline in early and mid-life mortality, which was chiefly due to infections. This trend continued with the development of vaccines and then antibiotics. By the latter half of the twentieth century, there was little room for further reduction in early and mid-life mortality. The continuing increase is due almost entirely to a new phenomenon: the decline in late-life mortality."

Frontmen for shell companies could face jail in UK property crackdown - Frontmen of foreign shell companies that are used to hide the true ownership of some of London's most expensive properties could face up to two years in jail and unlimited fines under new government plans.,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/22/ministers-vow-to-end-secrecy-around-foreign-ownership-of-uk-property,"Frontmen of foreign shell companies that are used to hide the true ownership of some of London’s most expensive properties could face up to two years in jail and unlimited fines under new government plans.

The government announced the new sanctions on Thursday as it unveiled plans to set out draft laws this summer to lift the secrecy surrounding foreign ownership of billions of pounds worth of British property.



Under the draft laws, foreign companies must disclose who ultimately owns their properties. The plans follow new rules on ownership and control of UK companies that were introduced in 2016.

Questions surrounding secret and offshore ownership were highlighted by revelations from the Paradise Papers, published in the Guardian.



However, the timetable for the new property register had been subject to numerous delays and even a threat of rebellion by two Tory peers, who put forward an amendment to the sanctions and anti-money-laundering bill in January.

Facing a potential defeat, the government announced that it would table draft legislation by this summer, though transparency campaigners have said this will still in practice delay an operational register until 2021.

Russian ownership of UK property has been under the spotlight since the nerve agent attacked attributed to the Kremlin in Salisbury.

A Whitehall source said though the new draft law was not explicitly aimed at Russia, the UK had seen a significant increase in the number of Russians seeking to invest in property, with one estate agent reporting a 30% increase in interest in the first quarter of 2017.

Prominent Russian figures with ties to the Vladimir Putin regime own British properties worth nearly £1.1bn, although the true value may be greater because of the way ownership can be concealed.

In the Commons earlier this week, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, cited the case of Russia’s first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, who owns two flats in Whitehall bought in 2014 for £11.4m by a company that campaigners have alleged the minister owns. Shuvalov’s official salary in 2014 was £112,000.

Campaigners have repeatedly called for similar register of beneficial ownership to reveal details of companies based in Britain’s overseas territories, some of which have become major tax havens, which the government has so far resisted imposing, despite previous support by David Cameron.

British crown dependencies and overseas territories are currently only required to provide information on the true owners of offshore companies to law enforcement agencies, and only if requested.

The business minister, Andrew Griffiths, confirmed on Thursday that the UK would seek to introduce the UK property legislation early in the second session of this parliament.

“The UK is taking a leading role in the global fight against corruption, including cracking down on the use of shell companies to launder dirty money by buying up some of London’s prime real estate,” he said.

“Our public register will ensure we know who owns UK property wherever they are from and will help authorities come down hard on frontmen seeking to conceal their paymasters’ true identities.

“This is the first register of its kind in the world and we must be careful to ensure it strikes the right balance between improving transparency and minimising burdens on legitimate owners.”

In the announcement, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said more than £180m worth of property in the UK has been brought under criminal investigation as the suspected proceeds of corruption since 2004, and more than 75% of properties currently under investigation use off-shore corporate secrecy."

Niall Carson/PA Wire

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced a new scholarship programme which will allow people from the Choctaw Nation study in Ireland.

The Taoiseach made the announcement during an official visit to the Choctaw territory in Oklahoma.

Mr Varadkar, who is the first Taoiseach to visit the Choctaws, thanked the community for the support they provided to the Irish people during the Great Famine.

The Choctaw nation raised $170, which equates to thousands of dollars in modern currency, and sent it to Ireland in 1847.

The Taoiseach paid special tribute to the current Choctaw Chief Gary Batton and said the story of the community’s charity “symbolises the spirit of St Patrick better than anything else”.

“Back in the nineteenth century, when the Irish people were oppressed, abused, neglected and degraded by our colonial master, at our lowest, your spirit of generosity was at its highest,” Mr Varadkar said.

“You showed compassion to a starving people, who were dying in their hundreds of thousands, or about to embark on our own ‘Trail of Tears’ across the Atlantic Ocean to seek a new life in Canada or the United States.

“A few years ago, on a visit to Ireland, a representative of the Choctaw Nation called your support for us ‘a sacred memory’. It is that and more. It is a sacred bond, which has joined our peoples together for all time,” he added.

Mr Varadkar presented Chief Batton with a hurl and a copy of The Atlas of the Great Irish Famine.

Former President Mary McAleese previously visited the the reservation during her tenure and Minister of State for Trade Pat Breen met with Choctaw leaders last year.

During the infamous Trail of Tears almost half of the Choctaw nation perished due to starvation when they were forced to relocate by American settlers.

Now, the nation lives on prosperous reservation which generates income from a thriving casino business.

Later today, two Irish-American twins, Ireland and Declan Harber will play a bodhrán and sing traditional songs.

The Taoiseach will also meet with children from the Choctaw Nation Child Development Center.

Mr Varadkar also spoke to Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin before the ceremony.

Campaigning under the party slogan “stop the invasion”, Toni Iwobi, a 62-year-old businessman originally from Nigeria, won his seat in Spirano, a small town in the Lombardy province of Bergamo, as the party took almost 18% of the vote nationwide.

“It’s an incredible honour for me to be Italy’s first black senator,” he told the Guardian.

He shared success in the region with his party colleague Attilio Fontana, the new governor of Lombardy, who at the start of the election campaign said Italy’s migrant influx threatened to wipe out “our white race”.

Iwobi, who owns an IT company, came to Italy in the late 1970s to study in Perugia. He later moved to Spirano, where he said he found the two loves of his life: his Italian wife and the League, then known as the Northern League. He became a councillor for the party in 1995.

Iwobi, a Catholic, argues that people should travel to Italy legally, just like he did. “I came on a student visa,” he said. “During that period over 40 years ago, coming here meant needing a visa. My party is fighting to restore legal immigration.”

The League was the strongest force within a three-party rightwing coalition that won most of the votes in the elections but fell short of the 40% majority required to govern. Horse-trading between parties is now under way to come up with a coalition government.

Iwobi has played an instrumental role in driving the League’s success, having helped to create some of the party’s key policies since being appointed by its leader, Matteo Salvini, as head of its immigration and security committee in 2015.

Party goals include making it easier to deport migrants deemed to be in the country illegally, refusing to accept those without documents arriving on charity rescue ships, and developing EU-wide economic aid projects with countries of origin to stop people coming.

“Salvini appointing me as the head of immigration shows that he knows exactly what he is doing,” he said.

Like Salvini, who has called for a “mass cleaning” to rid Italy of people in the country illegally, Iwobi takes aim at the 600,000 people who have landed on its southern shores within the last four years. The highest number of asylum requests in Italy come from Nigerians.

“Anybody running away from a country because of conflict and war has to be hosted,” said Iwobi. “But anybody leaving their country for the wrong reason and travelling to others in the wrong way has to be stopped. Immigration shouldn’t cost thousands of lives at sea and neither should it cost a cent to the host country,” he said.

“I want to stress that the League isn’t against immigration as such – nobody in this world can stop people moving, it’s in the human DNA. But we are against illegal immigration.”

Iwobi’s views contradict those of Cécile Kyenge, who became Italy’s first black minister in the chamber of deputies, the lower house of parliament, in 2013 and later served as integration minister in Enrico Letta’s government.

Kyenge suffered high-profile racist attacks during the brief tenure, including having bananas thrown at her and being likened to an orangutan by a League senator, Roberto Calderoli. Iwobi criticised her policies on migrant reception, saying at the time that “we should help them at home”. He also opposed a law drafted by Kyenge that would have granted an earlier path to citizenship for children born in Italy to foreign parents.

But he insisted the party was not racist and urged foreigners worried about the recent spate of racist attacks to “stay calm”.

“Our policies are intended to bring peace and order to the nation,” he said."

Polish official: Germany may owe us $850 billion for WWII war crimes,https://www.timesofisrael.com/polish-official-germany-may-owe-poland-850-billion-for-wwii/,"WARSAW, Poland — A Polish official said Friday that Germany could owe his country $850 billion for the damage it inflicted during World War II.

Arkadiusz Mularczyk is leading a team in the parliament that is assessing potential reparations to Poland. Germany killed 6 million Polish citizens and caused great material losses during its nearly six-year occupation of Poland.

“We are talking about very large, but justified amounts of compensation for war crimes, for destroyed cities, villages and the lost demographic potential of our country,” Mularczyk said on Polsat News, a private broadcaster.

Last year, Poland’s ruling conservative nationalist Law and Justice party said the nation deserves compensation for its losses and set up a team of lawmakers under Mularczyk’s leadership to estimate how much is due.

To date, Poland has not made an official demand. Germany has repeatedly said there is no legal basis for Poland’s reparation claims because the matter was settled in a 1953 agreement.

Poland’s current authorities have argued the 1953 decision is invalid because it was dictated by Moscow when Poland was a satellite of the Soviet Union.

Since then, Germany has paid some compensation to individual Poles who were forced laborers or victims of German pseudo-medical experiments during the Nazis’ wartime occupation.

Poland has also embroiled itself in a bitter dispute with Israel over a law that went into effect on Thursday, which calls for prison terms of up to three years for attributing the crimes of Nazi Germany to the Polish state or nation. The bill would also set fines or a maximum three-year jail term for anyone who refers to Nazi German death camps as Polish.

Israel and the US have warned the law will inhibit free speech about the Holocaust.

Senior Israeli and Polish diplomats met in Jerusalem on Thursday in a bid to resolve differences over the controversial Holocaust law, with both sides vowing to preserve “the truth.”

Deputy foreign minister Bartosz Cichocki led the visiting Polish delegation, while Foreign Ministry Director General Yuval Rotem headed Israel’s team.

“I look forward to an open candid and friendly dialogue between Israel and Poland as expected between friends and allies,” Rotem told journalists before the start of the meeting. “We must make sure that historical truths are preserved and that there is no restriction on freedom of research and speech.”

Cichocki said, “We are committed to join our efforts to promote truth about the Holocaust and the Polish-Jewish centuries-old relationship.”

One key paragraph of the law states: “Whoever claims, publicly and contrary to the facts, that the Polish Nation or the Republic of Poland is responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes committed by the Third Reich… or for other felonies that constitute crimes against peace, crimes against humanity or war crimes, or whoever otherwise grossly diminishes the responsibility of the true perpetrators of said crimes – shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to three years.”

Jewish groups, Holocaust survivors and Israeli officials fear its true aim is to repress research on Poles who killed Jews during World War II. The law and subsequent backlash have unleashed a wave of anti-Semitism in Poland.

The law has also created tensions with Ukraine due to a provision that criminalizes denying the wartime crimes of Ukrainian nationalists, who killed up to about 100,000 Poles in wartime massacres.

Poland’s president signed the law last month but also sent it to the constitutional court for review. Polish officials have said no criminal charges will be brought until the court has made its ruling, expected in several weeks.

But prosecutors are already looking for cases where Poland is defamed over its wartime activities."

"More than 200 Quebec doctors oppose proposed pay raise for themselves: They want the provincial government to backtrack on plans for pay hikes, saying other employees in the health care industry such as nurses are continuing to work under tough conditions.",https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/02/26/more-than-200-quebec-doctors-oppose-proposed-pay-raise-for-themselves.html,"MONTREAL—More than 250 doctors and residents in Quebec have asked the provincial government to backtrack on plans to give them and other physicians substantial pay hikes, saying the money should instead be spent on the front lines of the health system.

In an open letter, they say the increases are particularly shocking given that other health-care workers such as nurses and orderlies face difficult working conditions.

The letter, which was signed by general practitioners, specialists and residents, comes at a time when many nurses are complaining about excessive workloads.

Isabelle Leblanc, president of the group behind the letter, said nurses, orderlies and other employees in the health-care system are working under awful conditions.

“Basically, the amount of money the health department has to run the system is finite,” she said in an interview Monday. “There’s only a specific amount of money and not more, and the more you give to the physicians, the less you give to workers or to improve access (to the system).”

Leblanc admitted it was unusual for doctors to say they don’t want more money.

“But I don’t think it’s that unusual for people to say ‘the workplace we work in needs more money, put it there and don’t put it in our pockets’,” she said. “We think it’s going to help patients a lot more if the money is injected in the system, and not into the pockets of the physicians.”

Leblanc said she has never seen so many people contacting her organization, asking it to do something.

“We have to stop using the argument that doctors should be paid more because they work hard,” she said. “A lot of people work hard.”

Quebec Health Minister Gaetan Barrette says he’s ready to take some of the money out of the doctors’ hands.

“If they feel they are overpaid, they can leave the money on the table and I guarantee you I can make good use of it,” he told reporters.

Barrette also pointed out he’s already been working with Quebec nurses to deal with issues like overtime and nurse-to-patient ratios. He said it was agreed to revisit working conditions under an “historic” collective agreement that was reached two years ago.

“The subject that has to get our total attention is personnel working conditions,” Barrette said.

“So we are entering that phase, we have the money to address that. That doesn’t mean we have infinite amounts of money, but we have the capacity to resolve that issue once and for all.”

The head of the Quebec Order of Nurses says the health-care crisis is such that nurses are calling on their professional order to openly denounce the situation, maintaining they can no longer fulfil their professional duties.

President Lucie Tremblay says it’s something that has never been seen before.

“There are nurses who are calling us to say they are not able to carry out their professional obligations,” Tremblay said, adding the situation can’t last.

Some nurses have taken to social media to vent their frustrations.

A Facebook post by a young nurse named Emilie Ricard was shared more than 56,000 times after the woman from the Eastern Townships posted a picture of herself in tears, giving a sarcastic thumbs-up after a night shift in which she said she had to care for more than 70 patients alone.

The doctors also pointed out that their patients are coping with reduced services because of budget cuts in the Health Department over the last few years.

Premier Philippe Couillard’s Liberal government recently concluded a deal with the province’s 10,000 specialist doctors that would see their annual remuneration rise to $5.4 billion a year in 2023 from the current $4.7 billion.

They would also be entitled to various retroactive salary increases.

In 2016, the average salary of a specialist doctor in Quebec was $403,000, with radiologists leading the way with close to $700,000.

Last October, the government reached a deal with the province’s general practitioners to give them an increase of roughly 1.8 per cent a year over eight years.

"London sees 20% rise in rape reports in a year, but police admit they 'don't understand' reason",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rape-london-reports-met-police-rise-crime-sexual-assault-a8225821.html,"The number of alleged rapes reported to police in London has risen by almost 20 per cent in a disturbing increase police are struggling to explain.

There were 7,613 reported rapes in the year to January, compared to 6,392 over the previous 12 months, according to figures collated by the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).

Sir Craig Mackey, deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said the rise could not be accounted for simply by more victims feeling able to report abuse or better recording practices.

“It is not as simple as saying this is increased confidence,” he told the London Assembly’s police and come committee.

“Of course that plays a part, and faith in the process, but there is something going on with sexual offending in London that we don’t fully understand.

“We see the end of it but we don’t understand the causes.”

Joanne McCartney, the deputy mayor of London, told the meeting on Wednesday that Sir Craig’s statement was “the first time a senior officer has come to this committee and accepted that the increase in sexual violence may not just be about an increase in reporting and confidence”.

Susan Hall, a Conservative assembly member, called for police to measure the outcome of plans in place to combat violence against women and girls in the capital.

“Figures are really going in the wrong direction,” she added.

Scotland Yard has emphasised that the vast majority of rapes are carried out by attackers known to victims but the statistics emerged following a “stranger rape” in Shoreditch.

Nayed Hoque, 20, of Manor Park, has been charged with rape, attempted rape and robbery following an attack on a woman in her mid-20s in the popular nightspot on Saturday.

MOPAC’s figures showed startling rises in several crime types over 2017, which saw 80 people stabbed to death amid concerns about acid attacks and violent robberies in the capital.

Homicide increased by a third to 137 murders, all knife crimes were up more than a quarter to more than 14,500 incidents that saw 2,000 victims under the age of 25 injured.

Personal robbery increased by 40 per cent, theft from the person a third and Islamophobic hate crime by 39 per cent to 1,678 recorded incidents.

Scotland Yard is among the police forces calling for a blanket increase in Government funding to respond to a nationwide rise in recorded crime, 999 calls and pressures generated by the terror threat.

The Government sparked anger by calling on elected Police and Crime Commissioners to take more money from council tax to fill the gap last year, amid warnings that forces were unable to respond to some crimes because of “significant stress” caused by budget cuts.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has committed to generating an extra £110m for the Metropolitan Police over the next year.

City Hall will be funding 23 per cent of the overall police budget for London following a £700m fall in the Government’s general grant.

Scotland Yard plans to merge local policing in 32 boroughs into 12 “basic command units” – a move hoped to save £353m over the next four years.

The force warned its numbers are due to fall to 30,000 by April, while there are now 114 fewer police station front counters and 120 fewer police buildings than in 2010."
Kevin Smith survives 'massive heart attack' after being rushed to hospital,http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/kevin-smith-heart-attack-hospital-clerks-twitter-chasing-amy-director-a8228556.html,"American filmmaker Kevin Smith — best known for helming Clerks and Chasing Amy — has revealed he survived a “massive heart attack” over the weekend.

The 47-year-old Tweeted a picture of himself from a hospital bed covered with tubes on Monday (26 February) morning. Smith had performed a stand-up show the evening prior, and was due to perform again but cancelled the second show.

“After the first show this evening, I had a massive heart attack,” he wrote on social media alongside the picture.

“The Doctor who saved my life told me I had 100 per cent blockage of my LAD artery (aka “the Widow-Maker”). If I hadn’t canceled show two to go to the hospital, I would’ve died tonight. But for now, I’m still above ground!”

Fans were quick to respond on social media, including Guardians of the Galaxy actor Chris Pratt, who wrote: “Kevin we don’t know each other too good but I have loved you since Clerks and I’m praying my ass off for you cause I believe in the healing power of prayer.”

Writer Sean Francis posted to Twitter: “I keep reading this in shock. Damn. It’s an understatement to say, but myself and so many others are glad you cancelled and are recovering. Sending love to you and yours.”

Smith had performed a stand-up show at 6pm PT at the Alex Theater in Glendale, California, and was due to perform once again at 9pm.

The comic book writer and filmmaker posted the photo from hospital 21 minutes after midnight, local time.

Smith later posted a lengthy message to Facebook, explaining what had happened: ""I was trying to do a killer stand-up special this evening but I might’ve gone too far,"" the post reads.

""After the first show, I felt kinda nauseous. I threw up a little but it didn’t seem to help. Then I started sweating buckets and my chest felt heavy. Turns out I had a massive heart attack. The Doctor who saved my life at the Glendale hospital told me I had 100 per cent blockage of my LAD artery (also known as “the Widow-Maker” because when it goes, you’re a goner).

""If I hadn’t canceled the second show to go to the hospital, the Doc said I would’ve died tonight. For now, I’m still above ground! But this is what I learned about myself during this crisis: death was always the thing I was most terrified of in life. When the time came, I never imagined I’d ever be able to die with dignity - I assumed I’d die screaming, like my Dad (who lost his life to a massive heart attack). But even as they cut into my groin to slip a stent into the lethal Widow-Maker, I was filled with a sense of calm.

""I’ve had a great life: loved by parents who raised me to become the individual I am. I’ve had a weird, wonderful career in all sorts of media, amazing friends, the best wife in the world and an incredible daughter who made me a Dad. But as I stared into the infinite, I realized I was relatively content. Yes, I’d miss life as it moved on without me - and I was bummed we weren’t gonna get to make Jay and Silent Bob reboot before I shuffled loose the mortal coil. But generally speaking, I was okay with the end, if this was gonna be it.

""I’ve gotten to do so many cool things and I’ve had so many adventures - how could I be shitty about finally paying the tab. But the good folks at the Glendale hospital had other plans and the expertise to mend me. Total strangers saved my life tonight (as well as my friends Jordan Monsanto and Mily Dawn, who called the ambulance)."
"Taiwan to ban single-use plastic drinking straws, plastic bags, disposable utensils entirely by 2030",https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/02/22/taiwan-ban-single-use-plastic-drinking-straws-plastic-bags-disposable-utensils-entirely-2030/,"Taiwan is set to ban single-use plastic drinking straws in several phases, starting with the food and beverage industry next year. The Environmental Protection Administration announced the plan last Tuesday.

As of next year, food and beverage stores such as fast food chains must stop providing plastic straws for in-store use. From 2020, free plastic straws will be banned from all food and beverage outlets. From 2025, the public will have to pay for takeaway plastic straws, and a blanket ban is to be imposed in 2030.

Free plastic shopping bags, disposable food containers and disposable utensils will also be banned in 2020 from all retail stores that issue uniform invoices – widely used in Taiwan. Additional fees will also be imposed in 2025.

Minister Lee Ying-yuan said a blanket ban is set to be introduced in 2030 on all plastic bags, disposable utensils, and disposable beverage cups.

“You can use steel products, or edible straws – or maybe you just don’t need to use straws at all,” he said. “There is no inconvenience caused at all.”

Lee said that the future prices for such disposable plastic items in stores will not necessarily be based on the price of such items in Europe, but will be based on prices in Taiwan.

He added that the reduction in the use of plastic is the responsibility of all members of the public rather than just his agency. The drive will create a better environment for future generations, he said.

According to new polls the right-wing AFD is now germanies second-strongest political party,https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article173741409/Insa-Umfrage-AfD-erstmals-vor-der-SPD.html,"Anzeige

Zum Auftakt des SPD-Mitgliederentscheides über eine große Koalition sind die Sozialdemokraten erstmals in einer bundesweiten Umfrage hinter die AfD zurückgefallen. Das ergab der neue Insa-Meinungstrend für die „Bild“-Zeitung. Wenn am nächsten Sonntag Bundestagswahl wäre, käme die SPD demnach auf 15,5 Prozent. Das ist ein Punkt weniger als in der Vorwoche und der schlechteste Wert für die Partei überhaupt in der Umfrage, die seit 2012 erhoben wird. Die AfD hingegen gewinnt einen Punkt hinzu und liegt jetzt bei 16 Prozent. Damit wäre sie zweitstärkste Kraft.

Die Union verbessert sich der Erhebung zufolge in dieser Woche um 2,5 Punkte auf 32 Prozent. Damit sind CDU und CSU mehr als doppelt so stark wie die SPD. „Die Union ist derzeit die einzige Volkspartei. Die Erneuerungszusage scheint zu wirken“, zitiert die „Bild“-Zeitung Insa-Chef Hermann Binkert.

Die Grünen verharren demnach bei 13 Prozent. Die Linke verliert einen halben Punkt und liegt jetzt bei elf Prozent. Auch die FDP sinkt in der Wählergunst: Sie kommt in dieser Woche auf neun Prozent (minus 1,5 Punkte).

Union und SPD würden der Umfrage zufolge im Bundestag mit zusammen 47,5 Prozent nicht mehr über eine parlamentarische Mehrheit verfügen. Möglich wäre dagegen weiterhin ein Jamaika-Bündnis aus CDU/CSU, Grünen und FDP mit zusammen 54 Prozent.

Schwierige Wochen für die SPD

Das Meinungsforschungsinstitut Insa befragte vom 16. bis zum 19. Februar insgesamt 2040 Wahlberechtigte. Die statistische Fehlertoleranz liegt in der Regel bei 2,5 Prozentpunkten.

Für die SPD war es in der Insa-Umfrage in den vergangenen Wochen kontinuierlich abwärtsgegangen. Seit Mitte Dezember 2017 hat die Partei 6,5 Prozentpunkte verloren. Bei der Bundestagswahl im September 2017 hatte die SPD mit 20,5 Prozent ihr schlechtestes Nachkriegsergebnis erzielt. Die AfD hatte 12,6 Prozent der Stimmen erhalten.

Die SPD stimmt in diesen Tagen über den zunächst nicht gewollten Gang in eine erneute große Koalition ab, die rund 463.000 Mitglieder müssen bis spätestens 2. März ihre Abstimmungsbriefe zurückgeschickt haben. Viele warnten angesichts der schlechten Umfragen bei Mitgliederkonferenzen vor Neuwahlen – daher könnte die Angst vor einem Überrunden durch die AfD sogar die Zustimmung zur großen Koalition erhöhen.

Hinter der SPD liegen schwierige Wochen, nachdem die Parteispitze nun doch in die große Koalition eintreten will. Martin Schulz ist inzwischen als Parteichef zurückgetreten und hat auch von seinem Vorhaben Abstand genommen, Außenminister werden zu wollen. Beim Sonderparteitag am 22. April soll Andrea Nahles zur neuen Vorsitzenden gewählt werden.

Forsa sieht SPD vor AfD

In einer ebenfalls am Montag veröffentlichten Umfrage liegen die Sozialdemokraten allerdings noch vor der AfD. Im RTL/n-tv-„Trendbarometer“ von Forsa fiel die SPD um einen Punkt auf 16 Prozent. Das ist der niedrigste Wert, den Forsa in 25 Jahren je für die Sozialdemokraten ermittelt hat. Das Meinungsforschungsinstitut sieht die AfD um drei Punkte schwächer als Insa: Die Partei verharrt hier bei 13 Prozent.

Die SPD verliere im Vergleich zur Wahl im September jeden fünften ihrer Wähler, sagte Forsa-Chef Manfred Güllner. Von den SPD-Wählern, die sich nicht mehr für die Sozialdemokraten entscheiden würden, würde ein Drittel (34 Prozent) gar nicht mehr wählen. 24 Prozent würden zu den Grünen abwandern, 20 Prozent zu den Unionsparteien, elf Prozent zur Linkspartei, sechs Prozent zur FDP, vier Prozent zur AfD und ein Prozent zu einer sonstigen Partei.

Enger beieinander sah die Parteien in der vergangenen Woche der ARD-„Deutschlandtrend“ von Infratest Dimap. Hier kam die SPD auf 16 Prozent, die AfD auf 15 Prozent."
Lindsay woman finds her mental health improving with basic income,http://lindsayadvocate.ca/lindsay-woman-finds-mental-health-improving-basic-income/,"A Lindsay woman who has been receiving a basic income for the past three months says her life has taken a turn for the better – including her mental health.

Barb Munro was on the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) for depression and mental illness, before deciding to apply for basic income a few months ago under the new pilot set up by the Province.

Since her acceptance into the program, it has doubled her income to just over $1,800 a month.

“Even mentally I feel better,” says Munro, “because I know I still have some money in my bank account” later in the month.

“Before it was a constant battle of what do I pay first and what do I let go. Sometimes I didn’t have enough food, so I’ve had to use the food bank quite often,” she says.

Munro, who has lived in Lindsay for 26 years, says basic income has had a “tremendous impact” on her life.

“I’m now able to pay my rent and bills in full, and on time.”

Her daughter, one of four grown children of Munro’s, was also able to receive basic income and now gets an extra $700 a month to help her meet her needs.

Munro says it used to be “so hard” to take care of all the bills, from hydro to heat. She would have to make arrangements to pay small amounts and then it was difficult to catch up.

This was also the first year she was able to buy Christmas gifts for her children and grandchildren in recent memory.

“And when I shop for groceries, now I can buy fresh produce for the first time. I’m still cheap when I shop, but it’s nice to have a few more options,” she says.

“I’m very careful with the money now,” she adds, and puts any additional funds in the bank.

The whole idea of having enough money to meet her needs is still “really new” to her right now.

For instance, she hadn’t bought any clothes in many years, and rarely could afford something extra like a haircut.

Just recently she decided to get curtains for her windows – just two $10 panels, but that was an extra luxury she wouldn’t dare have chosen before getting basic income.

“It might sound silly, but I couldn’t do it before.”

Employment

Munro isn’t content to sit at home and do nothing. She works part-time at a local grocery store about 15 hours a week. She did that while she was on ODSP, too.

“I prefer to work. For one thing, I work to get me out of the house, and it’s a little bit of extra income during the week,” she says, since they pay weekly.

“Then I’ve got some each week to live off of. Plus, I don’t believe in taking anything for free. I feel better for working because I contribute to myself and it helps with my depression to get out.”

On ODSP, Munro was able to make $200 a month before they took half.

With basic income, nothing is taken out of her monthly cheques. Once next year’s tax time rolls around, anything earned beyond the basic income is decreased by 50 cents for every dollar an individual earns through work.

People are eligible for basic income if they are living on a low income, which is under $34,000 per year for singles or under $48,000 per year for a couple.

Munro also volunteers for the local humane society on Saturday mornings, sometimes going to Pet Smart to try and get some of the animals adopted.

She thought about retraining for school now that she’s feeling more secure, but she’s just not sure what she would want to do.

“I can now do pretty much anything I need to do. That’s a very different way to live for me, and it feels really good.”

The government pilot wants to test how a basic income might help people living on low incomes better meet their basic needs, while hoping to see improvements in:

food security

stress and anxiety

mental health

health and healthcare usage

housing stability

education and training

employment and labour market participation

There’s still time to sign up for basic income. Just visit the Ontario Basic Income Pilot website and register for an in-person session."
Survivors Of The Florida Shooting Just Announced A Nationwide March For Our Lives To End School Shootings,https://www.buzzfeed.com/nidhiprakash/florida-teen-survivors-demand-gun-control,"""My message for the people in office is: You’re either with us or against us.

"Leatherback turtle found washed up in Nova Scotia, Canada encased in ice.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/leatherback-turtle-bras-d-or-maclean-dfo-1.4534762,"A creature that co-existed with the dinosaurs has washed up dead near shore in Islandview, Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia.

Ron MacLean spotted the rare, endangered leatherback turtle along the Bras d'Or Lake. The 360-kilogram carcass has been taken to the Atlantic Veterinary College in Charlottetown, P.E.I. for analysis.

""They'll check and see what they think happened, and we'll wait and see. [Turtles are] supposed to be in the Caribbean about now, see, laying eggs, not ... they don't ski.""

The Department of Fisheries and Oceans told MacLean that although there have been some anecdotal reports of sightings, this is the first recorded sighting of a leatherback turtle in the Bras d'Or.

A makeshift ramp was used to bring the carcass out of the water. (Sue MacLean/Facebook)

""On Thursday, I was out walking on the shore in front of my place and it looked like there was a small overturned boat on the shore, in the ice. And I went to look and it was a leatherback turtle,"" he told CBC's Information Morning Cape Breton.

""When I touched it it was floating a bit, so it wasn't moving, so I knew it was dead, but it was in good condition. It didn't look like it was there that long, but that would be because, with the ice and the cold and such.""

MacLean tried without success to reach DFO for a few days, finally sending an email on Sunday to the Canadian Sea Turtle Network.

That stirred some interest.

""I got a call from pretty well everybody on Monday morning,"" said MacLean.

When DFO officials saw MacLean's pictures of the turtle, ""they wanted it,"" he said.

Hauling a 360-kilogram carcass out of the water was no easy task. (Sue MacLean/Facebook)

By Tuesday, the turtle was being removed from the ice with the help of some sturdy wooden ramps and heavy machinery.

""We got it under the turtle and we pulled it out onto the ice,"" MacLean said, ""and then we dragged it over where we could get it up close to the shore and I pulled it onto a pallet, and with the tractor, I put some forks on it and we lifted it up and brought it up.""

MacLean said the carcass measures about two metres from tip to tail and the shell, from side to side, is about a metre wide.

The 360-kilogram carcass is now on its way to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans lab in Charlottetown for analysis. (Sue MacLean/Facebook)

The leatherback turtle is listed as an endangered species in Canada.

One of the world's largest reptiles, leatherback turtles can reach more than two metres in length and weigh more than 900 kilograms. They're known to swim up to 12,000 kilometres a year and dive to depths of up to 1.2 kilometres, according to DFO.

The turtles usually only ever come ashore to nest on warm tropical and subtropical beaches so it's a bit of a mystery as to why the turtle ended up so far north in winter and so close to land in Cape Breton's inland sea.

""The ice has been in quite a while and it wasn't here before, so I don't know if it washed up or it had gotten that far,"" said MacLean.

""But you could tell on the shell — it was cracked in the centre — so the weight of the ice was on it when the water level come down."""
'The anti-Trump': New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern earns nickname from Vogue | World news | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/15/the-anti-trump-new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-vogue?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"The fashion bible hails the fledgling leader’s ‘fearlessness’ in a gushing profile backed up by a high-fashion photo shoot

The prime minister of New Zealand may have a new nickname on the international stage – “the anti-Trump”.

Jacinda Ardern: 'I'm not going to leave any room for doubt that I can do this' Read more

That’s according to the fashion bible Vogue, which profiled 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern for its March issue, shooting the prime minister on a windswept North Island beach wearing clothes by New Zealand designers in a picture that is being described as “beautiful” and high fashion.

“New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, Is Young, Forward-Looking, and Unabashedly Liberal,” the magazine’s headline read. “Call Her the Anti-Trump.”

“She’s the real deal,” tweeted the writer of the piece, Amelia Lester, who interviewed Ardern in her modest Auckland home, which she prefers over the cavernous Premier House in Wellington.

“We’re small,” Ardern says of New Zealand’s standing on the global stage. “But we do our bit by standing up for what we believe in.”

Vogue interrogated Ardern about her relationship with US president Donald Trump, but found the new leader “circumspect” on the topic, after previous off-hand comments about Trump mistaking her for Justin Trudeau’s wife at the Apec summit found their way on to the world stage.

“But we’ll work with anyone!” Ardern quipped to Vogue, regarding Trump.

Describing Ardern’s political style as “a blend of Bernie Sanders’s bluntness and Elizabeth Warren’s fearlessness”, the interview touches on a number of issues close to Ardern’s heart, including climate change (“We’re surrounded by island nations who will feel the brunt of climate change. So I see us as having a responsibility.”), her pregnancy (“Clarke and I just laughed about it because there was now literally nothing that could happen to me that would make this year bigger”) and a childhood aspiration to be a clown – which Ardern compares to politics.

“I didn’t think I would be prime minister, because I didn’t consider it. But that’s the power of saying yes, because there will be a moment when someone asks you to do something beyond your comfort zone. I am not unique.”

Although still known as the leading global fashion and beauty magazine, Vogue has increasingly shifted towards profiling political figures since the 2008 Obama election. American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is an outspoken critic of Trump.

Other politicians or political spouses profiled by US Vogue include Hillary Clinton (six times), Ivanka Trump, Melania Trump, Michelle Obama, Sarah Palin, Jill Biden and Cindy McCain.

Chris Knutsen, a former senior editor at Vogue, told Politico the trend towards featuring more politicians and their spouses was spearheaded by Wintour.

“Anna has broadened the magazine’s interests. Vogue has always had a lot to say about the arts and culture, but its increased coverage of politics in particular – you can attribute that to Anna. Historically, it was mostly just profiles of the first ladies, but she’s also interested in members of the cabinet and the Senate. It’s taking a much wider view now.”

The Vogue article was widely shared and discussed in New Zealand. Ardern is the first prime minister to be featured in the magazine and chose two New Zealand designers for the shoot – including a pair of Herriot pants and a trench coat from Harman Grubiša – and a New Zealand photographer.

“Yes, we believe in globalisation and trade, but we also believe in you being able to benefit from that more,” Ardern told the magazine. “For too long, we progressives have seemed like part of the system. We need to start thinking about whether or not it’s delivering for us now.”"
Israeli Draft refusers prepare for jail: 'We are part of a movement for change',https://972mag.com/draft-refusers-prepare-for-jail-we-are-part-of-a-movement-for-change/133073/,"Saar Yahalom and Matan Helman will serve time in prison for refusing to enlist in the army because of the occupation.

By Yael Marom

Dozens of supporters joined two Israeli conscientious objectors as they heaed to the IDF induction base Sunday to declare their refusal to join the Israeli army. Saar Yahalom, 18, from Be’erotayim, and Matan Helman, 20, from Kibbutz HaOgen, say that they will not enlist due to their opposition to the occupation. They are expected to be sentenced and imprisoned on Sunday.

For Yahalom, this is his first declaration of intent to refuse to serve in the army; he is expected to serve an extended sentence. Helman, on the other hand, has already served 50 days in three separate periods of detention. He is expected to be jailed again.

Yahalom sounded confident during a short phone conversation before he entered the induction base. “I feel calm and at peace with my decision. I feel like [my decision] can help in social struggles and in the struggle against the occupation,” he said. “I am very moved by the presence of friends who came to support me — Jews and Arabs and social activists.”

Yahalom emphasized that he had never faced pressure to refuse, and that doing so was a personal decision. “I am part of the movement for change in Israel. The struggle against the occupation, against the deportations, social struggles — they’re all part of the struggle for social justice and peace. I’m doing my part, which I chose to do. Even when I’m in prison, I trust my friends to continue the struggle, because the reality is what’s outside.”

“Most of my friends from school and work don’t agree with me,” Yahalom continued, “but they understand that my decision does not come from a desire not to contribute [to society] but rather from a principled struggle, and that I’m ready to pay a personal price for it.” Our conversation was cut short by his friends calling Yahalom to help sing The Internationale.

Among the demonstrators were MK Aida Touma-Suleiman (The Joint List, Hadash), who said, “The conscientious objectors made a difficult choice, yet the heavy price they will pay is far smaller than the price involved with participating in the oppression of another nation. A clear statement was heard on the northern border, in the south, and in the center of the country. We strongly oppose the continuation of the war, the cycle of bloodshed, and we oppose the oppression of and military control over another nation. We came here today to say that there is another path. There is the path of peace, equality, and social justice. And we chose this path.”

Helman and Yahalom, who have been supported by the Mesarvot refusers network, are among the more than 100 young people who have signed the “Seniors letter,” addressed to the prime minister, IDF Chief of Staff, and education and defense ministers, respectively. The signatories will refuse to serve in the army due to their opposition to the occupation: “To improve the lives of all of us living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, we must end the occupation and achieve peace. For 50 years, this ‘temporary’ arrangement has continued, and we refuse to participate in prolonging it.”

In his declaration of refusal, Helman wrote: “Even the most ethical personal in the world cannot turn the occupation into something just. There is no justification for [military] rule over civilians, and there is no ethical occupation. The law requiring enlistment to an army that oppresses another nation and controls them is not a moral law. We must not be a society that blindly follows its leaders and laws when they violate our conscience and human morality. The army is a branch of the state that allows for the continuation of class and race oppression and violence. Therefore, I see it as my social contribution and moral obligation to refuse to take part in the army.”

Yahalom, in his declaration of refusal, wrote: “After 50 years of occupation, the army has become a mechanism around which everything revolves. My opposition is not to individual crimes that happen in the occupied territories, but to the occupation itself, which cannot exist without those extreme incidents. The policies of checkpoints, home demolitions, settlements, persecution of political movements, arrests, and arbitrary detentions. I am refusing because I oppose sending people of my age to serve as a colonial police force against Palestinians my age, all in the service of the pro-capitalist [neoliberal] government and the settlements.”"
140km Long human chain formed in India to protest open defecation,https://m.timesofindia.com/city/varanasi/140-km-long-human-chain-formed-in-ups-sonbhadra-against-open-defecation/articleshow/62757596.cms,"VARANASI: Beating the record of Nadia district of West Bengal, people in UP's Sonbhadra formed a 140-km long human chain to create awareness against open defecation on Friday. About three lakh people took part in this campaign of Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural). Earlier, the Nadia district of West Bengal made a place in Limca Book of Records by making a 122.3-km long human chain on Feb 21, 2015.

“We had planned for a 130-km long human chain in the district to spread the message of cleanliness and create awareness against open defecation, but the huge participation of people made it about 140 km,” the Sonbhadra district magistrate PK Upadhyaya told TOI over phone. He said that the recordings and other relevant documents will be sent to Limca for entry in record book. However, the representatives of India Book of Records were present in the district to see the great feat, he added.

UP minister Archana Pandey also took part in the human chain programme. She was apprised of the fact that so far 370 out of 1379 villages of Sonbhadra district have been declared open defecation free (ODF), and it has been targeted to make all villages ODF by March next.

Beginning from Khaliari the human chain ended Obra crossing covering Robertsganj, Hinduari, Karma, Imlipur, Saranga, Jogini, Ghorawal, Markundi, Salkhan, Chopan, Baghwanala and other places. Besides local residents, school children also took part in it in large numbers. Elaborate security arrangements were made along the way during the formation of human chain.

"French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to shut all of his country's coal-fired power plants by 2021. ?We've also decided to make France a model in the fight against climate change?, Mr Macron said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-coal-power-station-emmanuel-macron-davos-shut-2021-a8176796.html,"French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to shut all of his country’s coal-fired power plants by 2021.

“We've also decided to make France a model in the fight against climate change”, Mr Macron said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

In a speech stressing the economic benefits of innovation, Mr Macron called the commitment “a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness”.

“We should stop opposing on one side productivity, on the other side climate change issues,” he said.

The 2021 goal sets a more aggressive target than the timeline advanced by Mr Macron’s predecessor, Francois Hollande, who sought to shut down the country’s coal-powered plants by 2023.

France only produces around 1 per cent of its energy from coal-fired stations, but the commitment is a signal that the country is determined to lead on climate issues.

As Mr Macron has embraced moving France away from coal, the Trump administration has committed to going in the opposite direction.

"Millennials Are Getting Their Financial Houses in Order, Despite What They and Others May Think",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123005817/en/Millennials-Financial-Houses-Order,"CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Millennials are proving that they are just as good as or better than older generations when it comes to money management habits like saving and budgeting, according to the Better Money Habits® Millennial Report released today. Millennials (ages 23 to 37) are saving (63 percent), and they are more likely to say they have a savings goal (57 percent) than members of Gen X (42 percent) and baby boomers (42 percent). It’s not all talk, either: the majority of millennials who have a savings goal meet it (67 percent).

Despite that, saving enough remains a top source of financial stress for young adults, and 73 percent say they worry about money often/sometimes. They’re just as worried about finances as they were when surveyed in 2014, when three-quarters said they worried similarly about money.

This stress is compounded by a misperception that millennials aren’t savvy money managers. Roughly three quarters of Americans surveyed (age 18 to 71) say that millennials overspend on indulgences and will have trouble meeting long-term goals. Even millennials themselves think so: the majority (73 percent) agree with this characterization.

“ Young adults deserve more credit – from others and themselves – for the way they are handling their finances,” said Andrew Plepler, global head of Environmental, Social and Governance at Bank of America. “ They’re on par with or even better than older generations, which defies common stereotypes. As they continue to take on more financial responsibility and set new goals, Better Money Habits offers them resources and tools, like our Spending and Budgeting tool, to achieve them.”

The data additionally shows that young adults’ attention to savings and budgeting is growing:

Forty-seven percent of millennials have $15,000 or more in savings, and 16 percent have $100,000 or more in savings. This is an improvement over just a few years ago: when surveyed in 2015, only 33 percent had $15,000 or more saved, and only 8 percent had $100,000 or more.

Millennials are just as likely to budget as older generations. Fifty-four percent of all millennials plan and manage a budget, compared to 54 percent of Gen Xers and 57 percent of baby boomers. Roughly three-quarters of millennials who budget stick to it.

Firmly part of a gig economy, millennials more likely to ask for raises – and get them

As they build their careers, approximately one in four millennials consider themselves to be part of the gig economy (taking on short-term contracts or freelance work) and expect to have eight or more jobs in their lifetime. While they are known as job-hoppers, that’s not necessarily by choice. Twenty-six percent of millennials report they have been laid off.

Perhaps as a result, more so than older generations, young adults advocate for themselves at work. Forty-six percent have asked for a raise in the past two years. Just 36 percent of Gen X and 39 percent of baby boomers have done the same. They’re largely successful, too. Eighty percent of millennials who asked for a raise in the past two years got one.

At home, shared finances less common among millennial couples

While millennials are likely to bring up the topic of salary at work, that’s not always the case at home. Nearly one in five millennials don't know how much their spouse/partner makes. Millennial couples are more likely than older generations to keep their finances separate – 28 percent of millennial couples keep their finances separate compared to 11 percent of Gen Xers and 13 percent of baby boomers.

As parents, millennials are more likely to consider finances an important factor when thinking about having children. Thirty percent of millennial parents say financial considerations played a major role in their decision to start a family, versus 22 percent of Gen Xers and 9 percent of baby boomers. More than a quarter of older millennials are already saving for their children’s education.

While millennials are mindful of their finances both in their home and work lives, there is always room for improvement. And, importantly, millennials have time to make changes that can better their financial futures. That’s why Bank of America created Better Money Habits®, a free financial education platform with easy-to-understand information and tools to navigate personal finances, including:

Savings and Budgeting resources, which offer strategies and tips to better manage your money for yourself or your family.

The Spending and Budgeting tool, which helps people track spending, set up budgets and identify ways to save money.

The Goal-Setting Tool, which began rolling out in September, will enable people to create personalized savings goals with names, pictures and target amounts so they can watch their progress along the way and prioritize funds accordingly.

In addition to these personal finance resources, BetterMoneyHabits.com features a Careers and Personal Finance video series from partner and education leader Khan Academy. The videos feature young adults discussing how they are navigating their working world and the financial considerations that come with it. This content is designed to empower young adults – through the voices of their peers – to make informed decisions about the interplay between their income and their life priorities.

Combined, these resources help people understand their money and take action to change their financial lives for the better.

Report methodology

Bank of America commissioned a survey of 1,500 respondents, ages 18 to 71, to explore their views on personal financial matters. The survey was conducted online in English and Spanish during the period of September 22–October 16, 2017. Interviews were conducted by GfK Public Communications and Social Science, using GfK’s KnowledgePanel®, a statistically representative sample source used to yield results that are projectable to the American population. The margin of sampling error for national data is +/- 3.1 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level. An augment sample of approximately 2,025 additional interviews was also included to bring the millennials found in the national sample up to 300 completes each in six DMA markets including Austin, Texas; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; San Diego, Calif.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Denver, Colo.; and Seattle, Wash. Margin of error for the DMA augments are higher than that of the national sample.

Note: Millennials were defined as ages 18 to 34 in the 2014 and 2015 reports and as ages 23 to 37 in the 2017 report.

Man clears his name 40 years later after googling corrupt police officer who framed him,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/stephen-simmons-clears-name-43-years-mailbag-theft-clapham-google-corrupt-police-a8164661.html,"A man found guilty of stealing mailbags in London in the 1970s has had his name cleared, 43 years later.

Businessman Stephen Simmons, 62, from Dorking, Surrey, was 19 when he was convicted of the theft of the mailbags from Clapham Goods Yard in South London in 1976.

After being found guilty he served eight months in a youth detention centre.

But Mr Simmons always maintained his innocence.

After taking legal advice from a radio phone-in show five years ago, Mr Simmons Googled the name of the policeman who’d arrested him and discovered the officer had later been convicted for stealing Royal Mail bags and framing people for it.

His case returned to court when the the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the matter to the Appeal Court last year.

Seaking to the BBC last year, Mr Simmons said he was “100 per cent confident” that he would clear his name.

“I am bitter, absolutely bitter against him.

“I want to let it go, but I can't. Now I'm going to court and can have my day.”

Iraqi soldier disarms 7-year-old boy after ISIS strap him with suicide belt / Photos,http://en.abna24.com/news/middle-east/soldier-disarms-7-year-old-boy-after-isis-strap-him-with-suicide-belt-photos_877620.html,"A video showing a soldier removing a suicide belt from a terrified seven-year-old boy has emerged and it’s incredibly moving.

(AhlulBayt News Agency) - A video showing a soldier removing a suicide belt from a terrified seven-year-old boy has emerged and it’s incredibly moving.

The video which has been released by the Iraqi army shows a courageous soldier in Mosul, Syria, ordering a frightened child to raise his arms while he disarms the lethal bomb.

The moving footage shows the soldier taking off the shaken boy’s t-shirt and asking him to hold still, while he tackles the suicide belt.

After advising the boy to ‘keep your arms up son’ the soldier unravels a bandage which is wrapped around the little boy’s waist, to reveal the set of explosives strapped to his torso.

The boy who is clearly terrified, exclaims ‘no, no uncle,’ as the soldier reveals the detonator attached to the child’s body.

Remaining calm and focused in a fraught situation, the soldier tries to calm the stricken boy down.

He says:

Don’t worry son. I will not harm you.

He then clips the wire, safely disarming the bomb before it could kill the young boy and potentially many others.

ISIS strapped explosives around this little boys (7) waist. Iraqi soldiers disarmed him after he fled from Mosul. — Brenda StoterBoscolo (@BrendaStoter) March 23, 2017

The clip ends with the soldier unfastening the remainder of the boy’s belt and gingerly laying it on the ground away from the affected child.

It is thought the boy was found with a group of refugees, standing alone and clutching his stomach in fright.

An incredible act of bravery from the Iraqi army’s part and thank god they got to the boy in time.

British supermarket chickens show record levels of antibiotic-resistant superbugs - Food Standards Agency reports 'significant increase' of harmful pathogen campylobacter in British-farmed chickens,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/15/british-supermarket-chickens-show-record-levels-of-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs,"Chickens for sale in Britain’s supermarkets are showing record levels of superbugs resistant to some of the strongest antibiotics, new research from the government has found.

The results are concerning because resistance to antibiotics among livestock can easily affect resistance among humans, rendering vital medicines ineffective against serious diseases.

The Food Standards Agency, which tested a large sample of fresh whole chickens from retailers, reported “significantly higher proportions” in the last 10 years in instances of campylobacter, a harmful pathogen, that were found to be resistant to the antibiotics commonly used to treat it.

The agency warned: “This survey provides evidence that AMR [anti-microbial resistant] campylobacter are to be found on whole fresh chickens sold at retail in the UK. It is therefore important to handle chicken hygienically and cook thoroughly to reduce the risk to public health.”

In 2014, the Guardian revealed high levels of campylobacter infection in UK chicken meat, amid hygiene and safety breaches in processing plants. The Guardian has also revealed the presence of the superbug MRSA – another superbug spread through infected meat – in UK pork products.

The FSA has also noted that the proportion of campylobacter-infected chickens which showed resistance to key antibiotics, in this case ciprofloxacin, “has increased significantly” compared with a previous survey of chickens sold at retail 10 years ago. More than 4,000 samples were tested, then samples of smaller numbers exhibiting campylobacter infections retested to detect whether they carried bacteria resistant to the key antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin resistance was identified in more than half of the samples of one form of campylobacter tested, 237 out of 437 tests on Campylobacter jejuni, and in nearly half (52 out of 108) of another strain, Campylobacter coli.

The results were taken by experts to show that the use of antibiotics to treat farm animals is giving rise to the spread of resistant bacteria, which can have major effects on human health because one of the main methods of transmission to many strains of resistant bacteria is through contact with livestock in the food chain. While proper hygiene practices and thorough cooking can kill the bugs, any lapses can result in serious infection.

Cóilín Nunan, scientific adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, told the Guardian: “It is scandalous that [government rules] still allow for poultry to be mass-medicated with fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Twenty years ago, a House of Lords report said this should be stopped. Even the US banned the practice over 10 years ago because of the strength of the scientific evidence. So why are British and European authorities still refusing to take action?”

Campylobacter can cause serious food poisoning and in severe cases death. Strains that are resistant to the antibiotics used against them are even more harmful, because their spread means more people – and potentially livestock – must be treated with antibiotics of last resort.

Doctors fear that using these final remaining weapons in the armoury of medicine will render them ineffective too, leaving us defenceless against germs that had previously been defeated. As a result, the emphasis in human medicine in most developed countries has moved in the last decade to preventing the spread of such diseases.

However, more than half of antibiotics used worldwide are administered to livestock, often to whole flocks or herds regardless of the number infected, and in some countries they are given out routinely to promote growth. This has led many scientists to conclude that farm animals are a leading cause of antibiotic resistance, a finding that appeared to be confirmed by the FSA study.

Efforts to reduce the use of antibiotics on farms, which have been strongly urged by the World Health Organisation and others, have been slow to take effect, while the problem appears to be growing.

More than a year ago, for instance, in response to separate data on the spread of campylobacter among chickens, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the European Food Safety Authority, advised: “Given the high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones in broilers [chickens bred for meat], and the assessment that a large proportion of human campylobacteriosis infections comes from the handling, preparation and consumption of broiler meat, this is a compelling example of how antimicrobial resistance in food and animals may impact the availability of effective antimicrobial agents for treating severe human campylobacter infections.”

However, no action has been taken to ban or restrict the use of these powerful drugs on farms. Farmers are reluctant to accept restrictions, because the best alternative may be to cull infected animals."

WASHINGTON — President Trump signed a bill Monday to expand the Rev. Martin Luther King's birthplace in Atlanta into a national historical park — the first such park in Georgia.

Trump signed Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act of 2017 aboard Air Force One after touching down in Marietta, Ga., to attend the college football national championship game between the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia.

Alveda King, niece of the slain civil rights leader, joined Trump for a small, private bill-signing ceremony aboard Air Force One.

""Through his life and work, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made America more just and free,"" White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters aboard the plane. ""This important historical park tells his story, and this bill will help ensure that the park continues to tell Dr. King’s story for generations to come.""

The national historical site in Atlanta already includes King's birthplace, the church where he was baptized, and his burial place. The legislation Trump signed Monday upgrades the designation to a national historical park, and expands the boundaries to include the Prince Hall Masonic Temple.

The temple served as the headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil rights group King co-founded.

The bill was sponsored by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who said the change would significantly improve the way the National Park Service preserves, shares and presents King's legacy to visitors.

The nation will celebrate a federal holiday named for King on Monday.

Earlier Monday, Trump signed a related bill, the African American Civil Rights Network Act of 2017, which requires the National Park Service to link various historical sites related to the civil rights movement.

He also signed the 400 Years of African-American History Commission Act to commemorate the arrival of the first Africans in the English colonies at Point Comfort, Va., in 1619.

"After beating cable lobby, Colorado city moves ahead with muni broadband: Fort Collins plans universal broadband, net neutrality, and gigabit speeds.",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/colorado-city-to-build-fiber-broadband-network-with-net-neutrality/,"The city council in Fort Collins, Colorado, last night voted to move ahead with a municipal fiber broadband network providing gigabit speeds, two months after the cable industry failed to stop the project.

Last night's city council vote came after residents of Fort Collins approved a ballot question that authorized the city to build a broadband network. The ballot question, passed in November, didn't guarantee that the network would be built because city council approval was still required, but that hurdle is now cleared. Residents approved the ballot question despite an anti-municipal broadband lobbying campaign backed by groups funded by Comcast and CenturyLink.

The Fort Collins City Council voted 7-0 to approve the broadband-related measures, a city government spokesperson confirmed to Ars today.

""Last night's three unanimous votes begin the process of building our city's own broadband network,"" Glen Akins, a resident who helped lead the pro-municipal broadband campaign, told Ars today. ""We're extremely pleased the entire city council voted to support the network after the voters' hard fought election victory late last year. The municipal broadband network will make Fort Collins an even more incredible place to live.""

Net neutrality and privacy

While the Federal Communications Commission has voted to eliminate the nation's net neutrality rules, the municipal broadband network will be neutral and without data caps.

""The network will deliver a 'net-neutral' competitive unfettered data offering that does not impose caps or usage limits on one use of data over another (i.e., does not limit streaming or charge rates based on type of use),"" a new planning document says. ""All application providers (data, voice, video, cloud services) are equally able to provide their services, and consumers' access to advanced data opens up the marketplace.""

The city will also be developing policies to protect consumers' privacy. FCC privacy rules that would have protected all Americans were eliminated by the Republican-controlled Congress last year.

The items approved last night (detailed here and here) provide a $1.8 million loan from the city's general fund to the electric utility for first-year start-up costs related to building telecommunications facilities and services. Later, bonds will be ""issued to support the total broadband build out,"" the measure says.

The city intends to provide gigabit service for $70 a month or less and a cheaper Internet tier. Underground wiring for improved reliability and ""universal coverage"" are two of the key goals listed in the measure.

Building a citywide network is a lengthy process—the city says its goal is to be done in ""less than five years.""

Telecom lobby failure

The telecom industry-led campaign against the project spent more than $900,000, most of which was supplied by the Colorado Cable Telecommunications Association. Comcast is a member of that lobby group.

Fort Collins Mayor Wade Troxell criticized incumbent ISPs and the local Chamber of Commerce for spreading ""misinformation"" to voters, The Coloradoan reported at the time.

The pro-municipal broadband effort led by community members won despite spending just $15,000. More than 57 percent of voters approved the measure.

""We're incredibly excited about the voting results from last night,"" Colin Garfield, who led the residents' pro-broadband effort, told Ars today. ""The tireless work our committee performed and the voice of the voters have been rewarded."""

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) – An East Tennessee woman delivered the longest-frozen embryo to successfully come to birth, according to the University of Tennessee Preston Medical Library.

The National Embryo Donation Center (NEDC) says baby Emma Wren was born Nov. 25 to Benjamin and Tina Gibson.

Emma was cryopreserved in 1992 before being transferred to Tina’s uterus earlier this year through frozen embryo transfer. Emma was conceived around eighteen months after Tina, 26, was born.

“Emma is such a sweet miracle,” said Benjamin. “I think she looks pretty perfect to have been frozen all those years ago.”

NEDC Medical Director Dr. Jeffrey Kennan hopes the story will lead to more couples who have embryos in long-term storage to consider donation to help more families.

The center’s embryo adoption program has led to around 700 pregnancies. The center works to protect the lives of frozen embryos.

“It is deeply moving and highly rewarding to see that embryos frozen 24.5 years ago using the old, early cryopreservation techniques of slow freezing on day one of development at the pronuclear stage can result in 100 percent survival of the embryos with a 100 percent continued proper development to the day-3 embryo stage.” said NEDC Lab Director Carol Sommerfelt.

“I will always remember what the Gibsons said when presented with the picture of their embryos at the time of transfer; ‘These embryos could have been my best friends,’ as Tina herself was only 25 at the time of transfer,” Sommerfelt continued.Join the discussion on Facebook:"
"Norway on Wednesday completed its transition to digital radio, becoming the first country in the world to shut down national broadcasts of its FM radio network despite some grumblings",http://www.france24.com/en/20171213-norway-first-country-switch-off-fm-radio,"Advertising Read more

Oslo (AFP)

Norway on Wednesday completed its transition to digital radio, becoming the first country in the world to shut down national broadcasts of its FM radio network despite some grumblings.

As scheduled, the country's most northern regions and the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic switched to Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) in the late morning, said Digitalradio Norge (DRN) which groups Norway's public and commercial radio.

The transition, which began on January 11, allows for better sound quality, a greater number of channels and more functions, all at a cost eight times lower than FM radio, according to authorities.

The move has however been met with some criticism linked to technical incidents and claims that there is not sufficient DAB coverage across the country.

In addition, radio users have complained about the cost of having to buy new receivers or adapters, usually priced around 100 to 200 euros ($117 to $235).

Currently, fewer than half of motorists (49 percent) are able to listen to DAB in their cars, according to DRN figures.

According to a study cited by local media, the share of Norwegians who listen to the radio on a daily basis has dropped by 10 percent in one year, and public broadcaster NRK has lost 21 percent of its audience.

""It's a big change and we have to give listeners time to adapt to digital radio,"" the head of DRN, Ole Jorgen Torvmark, said in a statement.

""After each shutdown (in a region), we noticed that the audience first dropped but then rose again,"" he added.

The transition concerns only national radio channels. Most local stations continue to broadcast in FM.

Other countries like Switzerland, Britain and Denmark are due to follow suit in the coming years.

"Scientists hail breakthrough treatments for Huntington's, one of the most devastating brain diseases",https://en.hdbuzz.net/249,"In an announcement likely to stand as one of the biggest breakthroughs in Huntington’s disease since the discovery of the HD gene in 1993, Ionis and Roche today announced that the first human trial of a huntingtin-lowering drug, IONIS-HTTRx, demonstrates that it reduces mutant huntingtin in the nervous system, and is safe and well-tolerated.

What’s this huntingtin-lowering stuff all about?

The therapy we’re most excited about for Huntington’s disease is called huntingtin-lowering. You might also hear this approach called gene silencing, but huntingtin-lowering is more accurate, as we’ll explain.

Ionis pharmaceuticals has licensed IONIS-HTTRx to Roche following this successful Phase 1/2a Study

Everyone has two copies of the HD gene - one they inherited from their mom, and the other from dad. In people destined to develop HD, one of these copies of the HD gene is changed, or mutated in a very specific way.

Right near the beginning of the HD gene is a repetitive sequence that reads, in the code used by scientists to describe DNA, C-A-G. People who won’t develop Huntington’s Disease have around 20 repetitions of this sequence, while in people destined to develop HD, it’s longer, most commonly 40 CAG repeats or more.

Our cells use genes as recipes to build proteins – little molecular machines that do useful stuff in cells. When a cell needs to make more of a certain protein, copies of the instructions are made in a chemical closely related to DNA, called RNA. Scientists call this scratch copy of a gene the messenger RNA because it carries each gene’s information from the DNA to the cells protein building machines.

This means there’s more than one place in the cell where we can find the information in the HD mutation - the abnormally long repeat found in peoples' DNA is also copied into the messenger, RNA. Ultimately, cells use this RNA message as instructions for constructing a protein – the huntingtin protein.

Most research in HD suggests it’s the huntingtin protein, not its gene or messenger, that causes brain cells to malfunction and die in people with HD. But what we know for sure is that every single person with HD has a mutated copy of the HD gene, which acts as the blueprint for the toxic protein. This makes the mutant HD gene enemy number one for those of us working to develop new therapies.

The rapid advancement of science over the last few decades has given scientists a big toolbox for selectively shutting down specific genes. Some techniques, like antisense oligonucleotides have been around for decades. Newer techniques, notably genome editing tools like CRISPR/Cas9 have only been discovered and developed over the last few years.

While the details of the technologies differ, in the HD world, they all have an exciting potential application - to reduce the amount of the huntingtin protein. In numerous animal trials, using a wide range of these silencing tools, when researchers shut down the abnormal huntingtin gene, animal models of HD get better, or never get sick in the first place.

That’s cool science, but nobody really cares about curing Huntington’s disease in a mouse, or a fruit fly or a worm. We want to cure HD in the species that matters most to us – humans with HD.

Reminder: what’s the history of this drug and trial?

Amongst all the huntingtin-lowering technologies that exist, the most developed approach is called antisense oligonucleotides or ASOs. These are short, custom-built, chemically-modified pieces of DNA that can freely enter cells. Once inside, they locate and help destroy a specific messenger RNA - in this case, the one instructing cells how to make the huntingtin protein.

Ionis Pharmaceuticals, in Carlsbad California, has been developing ASOs for a range of diseases for decades. Years ago, they realized that HD was a perfect fit for their technology, because we know that if, in animals, we reduce the levels of the huntingtin protein in the brain, we improve their HD-like symptoms.

“ In the Phase 1/2a study, dose-dependent reductions of muntant huntingtin were observed among patients treated with IONIS-HTTRx ”

Last year Ionis had a massive success with an ASO for another brain disease called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Those trials tested whether an ASO delivered to the spinal fluid could help improve the condition of babies born with this horrible fatal illness. Same basic technology, but targeting a different gene.

Kids in the Ionis SMA trial did so well that regulators asked them to halt the trial early, so that every kid in the study, including those getting the placebo, could receive the drug. Basically, if the disease had taken its normal course, the kids would have gotten progressively weaker and died. But many of the kids treated with the drug were getting stronger and living much longer.

Ionis’ SMA drug was subsequently approved in the US, EU and many other countries, and is now being given to children with SMA around the world.

So, what about HD?

Ionis has been working on antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for HD since the early 2000s, first in simple cells and then moving into several different animal species. The effects they were seeing were promising, and testing in humans became a real possibility. Anticipation built in 2013 when pharmaceutical giant Roche announced a partnership with Ionis to develop the ASO drug for HD, which they call *IONIS-HTT Rx *. This brought huge resources and experience at Roche to bear on the problem of Huntington’s disease.

In July 2015, the most exciting drug trial so far in Huntington’s disease began - one in which an ASO designed to reduce production of huntingtin protein was actually delivered to people with HD. The trial was designed to test the safety of the drug and whether or not the drug could do what it was designed to do - reduce the production of the huntingtin protein. We were really excited about this trial starting, and wrote about the trial launch here.

In any drug development effort, the first goal has to be ensuring the drug doesn’t have toxic side effects. History provides us with many examples of drugs that seemed like a good idea, but had unexpected side effects when given to people.

With this in mind, Ionis and Roche designed a study whose main aim was determining whether the drug is safe when administered to people, which has to be the first step in the drug development process.

This first study enrolled 46 people with early HD symptoms in Germany, Canada and the UK. The trial began in July 2015 and was planned to end in November, 2017. As you’ll see, the whole trial happened right on schedule, which doesn’t always happen!

Before we talk about results, there are a few important details for people to keep in mind. First, ASO drugs do not get into the brain if swallowed in a pill form. As a consequence, ASO drugs for brain diseases are delivered by injecting them at the base of the spine, using a technique called lumbar puncture. It sounds a little scary, but it’s actually a very common procedure, done thousands of times per day in hospitals around the world.

Second, this study included a placebo arm. That means that some of the participants went through all the steps, but received injections without drugs. This is an absolutely critical component of trials - if we don’t have a group of people without drug, how can we be sure that changes we observe are due to the drug, and not some other factor?

Dose-dependent reductions of mutant huntingtin protein were seen in the spinal fluid from patients who received the drug

Finally, dose. Any time researchers give a drug to people for the first time, they start with a very low dose. In a trial like this, formally called a multiple ascending dose study, the first participants receive a low dose and then participants who join later receive higher doses of the drug. This enables doctors to carefully monitor people on each new dose, so any negative effects of treatment are caught early.

What has happened now?

On Monday, December 11th, Ionis put out a press release describing the main results of the first study of IONIS-HTTRx. The headline was: “Ionis pharmaceuticals licenses IONIS-HTTRx to partner following SUCCESSFUL Phase 1/2a Study in patients with Huntington’s Disease”. It also said: “Dose-dependent Reductions of Mutant Huntington Protein Observed”.

If you’re wondering how excited you should be about this - both HDBuzz editors indulged in a little bit of happy dancing when they saw the press release. It’s really big news!

We’ll explain why this is so exciting soon, but there’s a few things to keep in mind.

First - safety. Ionis and Roche very carefully monitored the subjects in the trial to look for any signs that the drug is not safe. In the press release, Ionis reports: “the safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-HTTRx observed in the Phase 1/2a study supports continued development”. That means there were no significant safety issues observed in the participants, so the first hurdle for this drug in HD has been cleared and we can move on to the next steps.

Remember – this trial was not designed to prove that IONIS-HTTRx helps with HD symptoms or progression. The primary goal of this study was to establish that the drug is safe. The first time you put a new drug into someone’s body, you want to expose as few people as possible, in case there are unexpected safety problems.

Also, remember that this study was short - each patient only received 4 months of injections. This is too short a time to look for changes in the rate of HD progression. Even if IONIS-HTTRx turns out to be a wonder drug, the impact on symptoms after only 4 months of treatment could be tiny, and we would not expect to detect them in such a small trial.

So – and this is a really important message – we won’t know yet whether the drug made peoples' HD symptoms better.

However, the trial was able to go beyond safety in one important way. Every time the volunteers in the trial were given a dose of the drug, a sample of their cerebrospinal fluid - which bathes the brain and spinal cord - was collected.

Previous work had demonstrated that the levels of the huntingtin protein can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. It seems that, as cells are becoming sick during the course of HD, some of their contents are spilled into this fluid, which circulates around the brain.

“ The key now is to move quickly to a larger trial to test whether IONIS-HTTRx slows disease progression ”

Since the goal of huntingtin lowering therapies like IONIS-HTTRx is to reduce the amount of the huntingtin protein in vulnerable brain cells, in theory this gives us a great way to tell whether the drug is doing what it’s meant to do. We simply measure levels of huntingtin protein in the cerebrospinal fluid before and after drug treatment.

We think the most exciting news in today’s press release from Ionis is this: “In the Phase 1/2a study, dose-dependent reductions of muntant huntingtin were observed among patients treated with IONIS-HTTRx”. Frank Bennett, Ionis' chief scientist, went as far as to state that the reductions seen “substantially exceeded our expectations”.

This means that patients treated with IONIS-HTTRx have reductions in the huntingtin protein in their cerebrospinal fluid. Based on this result, it looks like the drug is doing what it’s meant to do, and that huntingtin lowering has been achieved!

The dose-dependent bit means that higher doses of the drug lead to lower levels of huntingtin in their spinal fluid. That’s really nice evidence that the effect observed is really due to the drug, and not some other aspect of the treatment.

Now what?

This is big, and everyone in the HD community should be thankful to the brave volunteers who signed up for a demanding trial, as well as their families and caregivers. We should also be thankful to Roche, and particularly Ionis, who believed in this approach and worked for many years to get to this point.

But we’re not done yet! What’s next?

First, we have to conduct a trial with sufficient numbers of people, and a long enough treatment, to impact the course of HD symptoms. The success of this first trial sets the stage for a larger study in hundreds of HD patients, as soon as possible.

The researchers involved in this study know how urgent the need for the next trial is. In the press release, the primary investigator of the study, Professor Sarah Tabrizi, said: “the key now is to move quickly to a larger trial to test whether IONIS-HTTRx slows disease progression”. Roche’s firm opt-in, announced today, is a great sign that such a trial can be expected soon. As soon as details are released, you’ll read about them on HDBuzz.

This is a great day in the HD community, and it sets us on the path to even more exciting work in 2018. For the first time in history, HD patients are being treated with drugs known to reduce the amount of huntingtin protein in their brain. Until we conduct the next trial, we won’t know if this reduces the impact of HD. And while we know the drug is safe in the short term, we will also have to watch carefully for any long-term adverse effects. But we’re facing this problem with renewed excitement and hope. It’s the best early Christmas present we could have hoped for."

Airliners And F-15s Involved In Bizarre Encounter With Mystery Aircraft Over Oregon,http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/16079/airliners-and-f-15s-involved-in-bizzare-encounter-with-mystery-aircraft-over-oregon,"Something quite out of the ordinary occurred in the skies over Oregon on October 25th, 2017. A mystery aircraft was flying in daylight hours among the steady stream of airliners that traverse from south to north, between locales in California and Nevada and cities like Portland and Seattle and beyond. The incident began, at least as best we can tell, around 4:30pm near the California-Oregon border and resulted in multiple pilot eyewitnesses, recorded air traffic control audio, and eventual confirmations from both the FAA and North American Aerospace Command (NORAD) that it did indeed occur. Author's note: We have posted an update to this story linked here that not only has full radio communications from the event but also all the FAA phone conversations that took place during and after the incident occurred. Read this post in full first and then go to the update for full context. The first inklings of the story came to me shortly after the incident occurred from friends of mine in the aviation world. Sparse on details at the time, it sounded like it was probably just another one of the often misconstrued incidents that happen in the skies around the US everyday—ones where aircraft with inoperable radios or transponders stray into areas they shouldn't. And sometimes these occurrences result in local fighter jets paying the wayward aircraft a visit at the direction of NORAD. But days after initially blowing off the incident, it later began to seem that there was indeed more to the story than just than another ""NORDO"" private aircraft or lackadaisical pilot.

I came upon one Reddit thread that was of particular interest that seemed to not only corroborate the strange account, it also added critical details. The post was supposedly penned by a pilot who says they were in the sky over the Northwest in the early evening when the incident occurred, with the post coming shortly after the incident. The entry by Reddit user ""Duprass"" reads:

""Just landed in Seattle coming from the bay area. Beginning over Southern Oregon we kept overhearing Seattle Center attempting to track an airplane with no transponder who wasn't talking. A handful of crews were able to track it visually, best they could tell it was between FL350-370 [35,000-37,000 feet], northbound. Nobody close enough to see the type. Last we heard it was over the Willamette valley northbound and some fighters, perhaps out of PDX [Portland International Airport], were scrambled to go take a peek. Center had trouble tracking it on primary radar. Strange! My theory is they were running drugs to Canada. No news yet, not that I could find. **Update 0500z. Called SEA ARTCC. The gentleman I spoke with said that they initially got alerted to the aircraft from Oakland Center who was painting it on primary [illuminating it with radar, but without transponder information]. For whatever reason they couldn't track it themselves on primary, and that's when I overheard them using airline aircraft to track it visually. The last airplane to see it had to descend into Portland and lost sight of it. The fighters were scrambled out of PDX but flew around for a while and did not find it. And that's that.""

Air traffic control audio recorded over at LiveATC.com of Seattle Center Sector 14 is available from the time of the incident and it corroborates much of this information. You can listen to the entire series of exchanges here starting at around the 20 minute mark and through to the first part of the next time interval recording that can be found here. The audio is fantastic as it illustrates that there were many communications between various jet crews and Seattle Center whose controllers tried to track the aircraft as it made its way north towards the Willamette Valley. The aircraft was not able to be tracked on radar nor did it show up on crews' digital traffic collision avoidance systems (TCAS), but it was clearly there, although never quite close enough to positively identify what its exact type was.

Adrian Studer/Getty Images The activity seems to have begun in the far reaches of Northern California, around Mt. Shasta, and continued on into Southern Oregon, past Crater Lake and up through the Willamette Valley (Stock Photo).

The back and forth between air traffic control and various airline pilots lasted for roughly half an hour. Recordings from other Seattle Center Sectors, such as those closer to Portland (namely 42 and 46) are not readily available and it's very possible—if not probable based on other reports—that the incident continued up the Willamette Valley. We did review PDX approach and tower exchanges from a half hour before to two hours after the event occurred and didn't find anything that stood out, although it was unlikely we would have as aircraft have descended when using those frequencies. After reading this account and listening to the audio it was clear that the incident was worth looking into on a much deeper level, and that's what we did, inquiring with the 142nd Fighter Wing based at Portland International Airport, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and the FAA about the odd ordeal. NORAD's reply was quick and clear. An incident involving multiple airline crews, air traffic control, and F-15Cs from the 142nd Fighter Wing based out of Portland did occur. According to the limited information NORAD supplied, airliner pilots were asked by FAA air traffic controllers to help track and possibly identify a ""white aircraft"" traveling in the flightlevels nearby—roughly between 35,000 and 40,000 feet based on the radio recordings. NORAD also said that the incident did result in F-15s from Portland being scrambled to investigate, but by the time they got up and ""looked around"" the mystery aircraft couldn't be found.

Seattle ARTCC Seattle Center sector map.

A quick note on the fighter jet aspect of this story—the 142nd Fighter Wing operates F-15Cs upgraded with the most capable air-to-air radar set in the world (AN/APG-63V3) and Sniper advanced targeting pods for long-rang visual identification. Their pilots are some of the best in the world and are highly trained in the homeland air defense mission. The fact that they ""didn't find anything"" is surprising to say the least. Maybe this was due to the nature of the aircraft being searched for, or the possibility that they launched long after it was first sighted, or that we simply aren't being told the whole story. As for the F-15's launch time, it seems that this mystery aircraft was moving fairly fast—at least at the same speed of the airliners around it or greater. It's also worth noting that Oakland Center, which controls airspace to the south of Seattle Center's responsibilities, could have been trying to track the aircraft before the communications began on Seattle Center's frequencies if the object emanated from farther south. We have reviewed the PDX air traffic control audio up to two hours after the first radio traffic began regarding the mystery aircraft between Seattle Center and airliner pilots and we did not readily hear the tower clear the F-15s for launch. As such it's not clear when exactly the fighters took to the skies in search of this unidentified aircraft or why they were launched so late if that was the case. It is also possible, albeit somewhat unlikely, that a fighter patrol could have been diverted if they were already airborne. Also, once in the air the F-15s are capable of traversing the entire state of Oregon in just a matter of minutes if need be, so if they were launched promptly it seems unlikely they wouldn't have been able to intercept the aircraft being pointed out by commercial pilots over Southern Oregon. The FAA wasn't as forthcoming as NORAD, taking nearly a week and multiple emails to respond to our initial inquiry, only to say simply that they have nothing further to add to the description of events I provided to them. As such, they did acknowledge that the events occurred, but did not expand upon them. The 142nd Fighter Wing did not respond to our inquiries. Clearly there had to be some level of after-action investigation into this event. Having an unidentified aircraft that doesn't show up on radar flying among civilian air traffic in the flight levels for extended periods of time isn't something you just brush off, especially considering the current global security situation and the circumstances that have existed since 9/11.

Washington Military Department Western Air Defense Sector (WADS), which goes by the callsign ""Bigfoot,"" keeps a close watch on airspace over the Northwest and directs alert fighters and fighter patrols to targets of interest on short notice.

One of the Reddit posters with the handle ""The Flying Beard"" from the same thread, who supposedly is an air traffic controller, claims to have some inside knowledge of the event, stating:

""...Was just going to post about this actually. I was working an adjacent sector and was helping to coordinate some of the military stuff. They ended up launching F15s off of PDX to try and find it but no joy... [posts one of the audio clips linked above]... The crazy thing is, we didn't have a primary target or a mode C intruder, and it was out running 737s abeam it. Also, (cue conspiracy theory) our QA department was working on this today, and got a call from the commander of the 142FW at PDX and was basically told to knock it off, and we know nothing. A couple guys at work seem to think it may have have been this plane [unlikely, and that's an article I wrote] based of the description, and also the 'lack' of military interest. FWIW, I think the FAA is pursing this at higher levels. From a safety standpoint, if the military is running super secret test stuff in the NAS [National Airspace], that's bad. If I were one of the pilots that had a sighting, I'd definitely be filing a NASA form and any other official reports that you can... ...If the ‘aircraft’ continued on its presumed heading/course altitude, the F15s were sent the wrong way. The last known position was around the EUG area heading North around 750kts and the fighters went South when they launched ~25-30 min after the first report in the Shasta area... ...The time of day made it hard. All the guys on the east side couldn’t see it due to the setting sun and the North bound traffic on the west side was pretty sparse. I guess ZOA [Oakland Center] had a good primary/mode C on the guy for a bit in the RBL [Red Bluff Municipal Airport] area. It was initially heading SW and it made a pretty sharp turn to the North. Way harder/faster than what a commercial aircraft could handle at that speed/altitude without ripping the wings off.""

We have no way of confirming this poster's information, although based on past Reddit posts their occupation description seems accurate, and their account certainly does add to the story if true. We have filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the FAA and NORAD, as well as other federal parties involved in the incident. Hopefully we will find out more eventually as to what really went on that day so we can provide a more complete picture for our readers.

Tyler Rogoway/author An F-15C belonging to the 142nd Fighter Wing blasts out of Portland International Airport on a typical rainy day in the Northwest. Portland Air National Guard Base (PANG), which is co-located across from PDX's passenger terminals, is seen in the background. The 142nd's Eagles cover the airspace from northern California to the northern tip of Washington State and sometimes beyond. Two primary fully armed jets are always on quick reaction alert (QRA) and can launch within a few minutes of the klaxon howling. An armed spare jet is also usually available as well as one armed with a full magazine of 940 20mm cannon shells.

In the meantime, I would suggest reading the Reddit thread related to the event after listening to the air traffic control audio yourself. In it, some say it could have been a smuggling aircraft or even a secret military airframe. It seems odd that a smuggler would fly in broad daylight in an area they know they will be spotted, not to mention the question of how they stayed off the FAA radar scopes. When it comes to a secret military aircraft, flying such an asset among jetliner traffic in daylight, albeit it was around sunset time, certainly seems like an odd choice for a secretive program, but that doesn't make it impossible. There are vast and remote training ranges that could be taken advantage of in Alaska for clandestine aircraft programs, and it is a long flight to get there. Still, the idea that U.S. military would willingly fly an aircraft through a major air traffic route at common jet operating altitudes without radio, transponder, or even radar contact would be highly concerning if true. Amongst all the questions that remain, one thing is certain, an unidentified white aircraft was indeed flying over Oregon on that day in October, and the USAF and the FAA are both willing to admit that the event occurred. In the Air Force's case, the fact that they are even willing to tell us that they couldn't catch or even find the unidentified aircraft with their sensor-packed and fast F-15s is interesting to say the least. On the other hand they may not be sharing the entire story with us. Whatever the case, we'll keep you updated on this white flying mystery machine of sorts and the circumstances surrounding its presence over Oregon when, or should I say if, new information becomes available.

"World's richest 1% have as much wealth as bottom 50%, study finds | Inequality",https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/14/worlds-richest-wealth-credit-suisse,"The globe’s richest 1% own half the world’s wealth, according to a new report highlighting the growing gap between the super-rich and everyone else.

The world’s richest people have seen their share of the globe’s total wealth increase from 42.5% at the height of the 2008 financial crisis to 50.1% in 2017, or $140tn (£106tn), according to Credit Suisse’s global wealth report published on Tuesday.

“The share of the top 1% has been on an upward path ever since [the crisis], passing the 2000 level in 2013 and achieving new peaks every year thereafter,” the annual report said. The bank said “global wealth inequality has certainly been high and rising in the post-crisis period”.

The increase in wealth among the already very rich led to the creation of 2.3 million new dollar millionaires over the past year, taking the total to 36 million. “The number of millionaires, which fell in 2008, recovered fast after the financial crisis, and is now nearly three times the 2000 figure,” Credit Suisse said.

These millionaires – who account for 0.7% of the world’s adult population – control 46% of total global wealth that now stands at $280tn.

At the other end of the spectrum, the world’s 3.5 billion poorest adults each have assets of less than $10,000 (£7,600). Collectively these people, who account for 70% of the world’s working age population, account for just 2.7% of global wealth.

The report said the poor are mostly found in developing countries, with more than 90% of adults in India and Africa having less than $10,000. “In some low-income countries in Africa, the percentage of the population in this wealth group is close to 100%,” the report said. “For many residents of low-income countries, life membership of the base tier is the norm rather than the exception.”

Meanwhile at the top of what Credit Suisse calls the “global wealth pyramid”, the 36 million people with at least $1m of wealth are collectively worth $128.7tn. More than two-fifths of the world’s millionaires live in the US, followed by Japan with 7% and the UK with 6%.

However, the collapse in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote meant the total number of dollar millionaires in the UK fell by 34,000 to 2.19 million. Just over half of the UK’s 51 million adults have wealth in excess of $100,000. The mean average wealth of a UK adult is $278,038, but the median is $102,641.

While the global population of millionaires has grown considerably, the number of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) – those with a net worth of $50m or more – has increased even faster. “The number of millionaires has increased by 170% [since 2000], while the number of UHNWIs has risen five-fold, making them by far the fastest-growing group of wealth-holders,” the report said.

Most of the new UHNWIs have been created in the US, but 22% come from emerging economies, notably China.

The biggest losers, the report says, are young people who should not expect to become as rich as their parents. “Those with low wealth tend to be disproportionately found among the younger age groups, who have had little chance to accumulate assets,” Urs Rohner, Credit Suisse’s chairman, said. “But we find that millennials face particularly challenging circumstances.”

Feeling the pinch? The super-rich certainly aren’t Read more

Rohner, who is paid SFr4m (£3m), said millennials have been dealt a series of blows including high unemployment, tighter mortgage rules, increased income inequality and reduced pensions. “With baby boomers occupying most of the top jobs and much of the housing, millennials are doing less well than their parents at the same age, especially in relation to income, home ownership and other dimensions of well-being assessed in this report.”

He said that millennials are much more educated than their parents. But he added: “We expect only a minority of high achievers and those in high demand sectors such a s technology or finance to effectively overcome the ‘millennial disadvantage’.”

Oxfam said Credit Suisse’s research showed that politicians need to do more to tackle the “huge gulf between the haves and the have-nots”.

“In the UK, the wealthiest 1% have seen their share increase to nearly a quarter of all the country’s wealth, while the poorest half have less than 5%,” Oxfam’s head of advocacy, Katy Chakrabortty, said. “This divide matters hugely at a time when millions of people across the UK face a daily struggle to make ends meet and the numbers living in poverty are the highest for almost 20 years.

“The recent Paradise Papers revelations laid bare one of the main drivers of inequality – tax-dodging by rich individuals and multinationals. Governments should act to tackle extreme inequality that is undermining economies around the world, dividing societies and making it harder than ever for the poorest to improve their lives.

“In the UK, the chancellor should use next week’s budget to prioritise tough action to tackle tax avoidance to help provide funds to fight poverty in both the UK and developing countries.”

Ferry McFerryface to be name of new Sydney ferry after public vote,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-13/sydney-ferry-will-actually-be-called-ferry-mcferryface/9146446,"Run a competition asking Sydney to name a new ferry, expect the outright silliest name to win.

Ferry McFerryface is now officially the name of the last ferry in a new fleet of inner harbour vessels.

The name was voted on by hundreds of Sydneysiders in a competition which allowed the public to be part of maritime history.

However, the most votes actually went to the name Boaty McBoatface, the notable title Brits voted to call a new research vessel last year.

But Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Andrew Constance said they wanted to avoid a double up.

""Given Boaty was already taken by another vessel, we've gone with the next most popular name nominated by Sydneysiders,"" Mr Constance said.

""Ferry McFerryface will be the harbour's newest icon, and I hope it brings a smile to the faces of visitors and locals alike.

""This one is for the kids.""

More than 15,000 suggestions were made in the Name Your Ferry competition and three of the six new ferries have already been picked by voters: Victor Chang (Australian heart surgeon), Fred Hollows (ophthalmologist) and Catherine Hamlin (obstetrician).

The suggested names were considered by a four-person panel comprising of Australian National Maritime Museum director and chief executive Kevin Sumption, former NSW Volunteer of the Year Patrick Dodd, NSW Young Australian of the Year Melissa Abu-Gazaleh and Australian Museum director and chief executive Kim McKay.

When voting opened Mr Constance urged the public: ""Let's really generate some of the best names possible.""

The new fleet has capacity for about 400 customers, improved accessibility for people with disabilities, wi-fi access, luggage and bicycle storage areas and charging stations for electronic devices.

The Boaty McBoatface legacy has spread worldwide, with an express train in Sweden named Trainy McTrainface earlier this year and a team at Sydney's Warwick Farm racecourse naming their horse Horsey McHorseface last year.

Smacking children to be banned in Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/19/smacking-children-to-be-banned-in-scotland,"The children’s commissioners of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland are calling for a UK-wide change in the law after the Scottish government confirmed its support for a ban on smacking children.

Scotland is to become the first part of the UK to introduce an outright ban on the physical punishment of children, after the Scottish government said it would ensure that a member’s bill became law.

John Finnie, the justice spokesperson for the Scottish Greens, has proposed removing the defence of “justifiable assault” from Scottish law, giving children the same legal protection as adults.

Along with leading children’s charities, the children’s commissioners for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have welcomed the development but expressed concern that legal protection from assault could now vary depending on a young person’s location.

Calling for the law to be changed at UK level, Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, said: “The current legislation in England, which grants an exemption from the law on common assault to allow the physical punishment of children, is outdated. It should be updated to reflect what the vast majority of parents believe: that hitting children is wrong and that there are better and more effective ways of disciplining children and encouraging positive behaviour.”

The UK is one of only four EU countries that have not committed to legal reform over the physical punishment of children. According to section 58 of the Children Act 2004, it is illegal for a parent or carer to smack their own child, except where it amounts to “reasonable chastisement”. Corporal punishment in schools was banned by the Westminster parliament in 1986.

Sally Holland, the children’s commissioner for Wales, expressed her disappointment that a legal defence for hitting children still existed throughout the UK. The defence of “reasonable chastisement”, which applies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, mirrors the Scottish principle of “justifiable assault”. The Labour party in Wales made the removal of the defence a manifesto pledge in May’s Welsh assembly elections.

Holland said: “I’m delighted to hear today’s announcement from the Scottish government. I’m very pleased that the Welsh government has also committed to removing the defence; something that I think will accelerate a cultural change and will make more parents aware of the long-term damage of smacking.”

Koulla Yiasouma, Northern Ireland’s commissioner for children and young people, said: “Assaults on children have never been right, and it is certainly not right now that protection from assault as a child may depend on where you live in the UK.”

She added: “I am confident that while Scotland may be the first in the UK to ban this, it most certainly won’t be the last. I will be doing everything in my power to make sure Northern Ireland follows suit in due course and combines legal reform with improved support for parents.”

Describing the current legal defence as “untenable”, Bruce Adamson, the children’s and young people’s commissioner for Scotland, said: “Across the political spectrum, there is recognition that this is not only an obligation in human rights law and the right thing to do, but it is something we should have done many years ago.

“Scotland has the potential to be the first country in the UK to bring about the legal change necessary to provide children with equal protection from assault. If we pride ourselves on being a progressive country, a country which values children and is committed to offering them the best outcomes in life, then we need to make sure that this legislative change happens at the very earliest opportunity.”

The NSPCC, which has long campaigned for a change in the law, also made the case for a UK-wide ban. A spokeswoman said: “Closing this loophole would bring Scotland in line with dozens of other countries and give children there equal protection under the law. We urge governments across the UK to do likewise, including in Westminster.”



Explaining the decision to support the member’s bill to give children equal protection from assault, a Scottish government spokesperson said: “Mr Finnie’s proposals are not a Scottish government bill; however, we will ensure the proposals become law. We believe physical punishment can have negative effects on children, which can last long after the physical pain has died away. We support positive parenting through, for example, funding for family support services.”

A three-month public consultation on Finnie’s proposed bill, which took place over the summer, received an overwhelmingly positive response from organisations and individuals, including the Scottish Police Federation, Unicef UK and the NSPCC.

The bill received a further boost as Scottish Labour said supporting it was “the right thing to do”. The party’s education spokesman, Iain Gray, said: “Labour MSPs have discussed John Finnie’s bill and do believe that the time has come to provide children with the same protection as adults under the law.”

A Scottish Conservative spokesman said the party would “consider the bill very carefully”, but added: “In general terms, however, we believe the current legislation which permits reasonable chastisement has worked well and that remains our current position.”"
German City Bans Migrants From Moving In,http://dailycaller.com/2017/10/13/german-city-bans-migrants-from-moving-in/,"A German city will no longer allow refugees to settle there as it feels overwhelmed with the “exceptionally high immigration” in recent years.

Salzgitter in the state of Lower Saxony is home to 106,000 people and a few thousand migrants. The city was granted permission to ban refugees from settling there Thursday by the state’s interior ministry. Authorities cited “reasons of integration” in its decision.

“This is an exceptional measure aimed at preventing the social and societal exclusion of immigrant refugees,” the decree reads, according to The Local.

The town’s mayor said 5,800 migrants live in the community, with a majority arriving over the past year.

“At the moment we are overwhelmed,” Frank Klingebiel told Focus Online in an interview published Friday.

The ban is not a meant to make refugees feel unwelcome, but rather give the existing refugee population a chance to integrate, according to Klingebiel.

“We urgently need a pause to integrate the refugees already living in Salzgitter in the long term and to secure the social peace,” Klingebiel said.

Two other cities in Lower Saxony, Wilhelmshaven and Delmenhorst, have asked for a similar decree to curb immigration levels. The state has invested 10 million euros ($11.82 million) to help communities integrate migrants.

'Our minds can be hijacked': the tech insiders who fear a smartphone dystopia | Technology,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia,"Justin Rosenstein had tweaked his laptop’s operating system to block Reddit, banned himself from Snapchat, which he compares to heroin, and imposed limits on his use of Facebook. But even that wasn’t enough. In August, the 34-year-old tech executive took a more radical step to restrict his use of social media and other addictive technologies.

Rosenstein purchased a new iPhone and instructed his assistant to set up a parental-control feature to prevent him from downloading any apps.

He was particularly aware of the allure of Facebook “likes”, which he describes as “bright dings of pseudo-pleasure” that can be as hollow as they are seductive. And Rosenstein should know: he was the Facebook engineer who created the “like” button in the first place.

A decade after he stayed up all night coding a prototype of what was then called an “awesome” button, Rosenstein belongs to a small but growing band of Silicon Valley heretics who complain about the rise of the so-called “attention economy”: an internet shaped around the demands of an advertising economy.

These refuseniks are rarely founders or chief executives, who have little incentive to deviate from the mantra that their companies are making the world a better place. Instead, they tend to have worked a rung or two down the corporate ladder: designers, engineers and product managers who, like Rosenstein, several years ago put in place the building blocks of a digital world from which they are now trying to disentangle themselves. “It is very common,” Rosenstein says, “for humans to develop things with the best of intentions and for them to have unintended, negative consequences.”

Rosenstein, who also helped create Gchat during a stint at Google, and now leads a San Francisco-based company that improves office productivity, appears most concerned about the psychological effects on people who, research shows, touch, swipe or tap their phone 2,617 times a day.

There is growing concern that as well as addicting users, technology is contributing toward so-called “continuous partial attention”, severely limiting people’s ability to focus, and possibly lowering IQ. One recent study showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.”

It is very common for humans to develop things with the best of intentions that have unintended, negative consequences Justin Rosenstein, creator of the 'like' button

But those concerns are trivial compared with the devastating impact upon the political system that some of Rosenstein’s peers believe can be attributed to the rise of social media and the attention-based market that drives it.

Drawing a straight line between addiction to social media and political earthquakes like Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, they contend that digital forces have completely upended the political system and, left unchecked, could even render democracy as we know it obsolete.

In 2007, Rosenstein was one of a small group of Facebook employees who decided to create a path of least resistance – a single click – to “send little bits of positivity” across the platform. Facebook’s “like” feature was, Rosenstein says, “wildly” successful: engagement soared as people enjoyed the short-term boost they got from giving or receiving social affirmation, while Facebook harvested valuable data about the preferences of users that could be sold to advertisers. The idea was soon copied by Twitter, with its heart-shaped “likes” (previously star-shaped “favourites”), Instagram, and countless other apps and websites.

It was Rosenstein’s colleague, Leah Pearlman, then a product manager at Facebook and on the team that created the Facebook “like”, who announced the feature in a 2009 blogpost. Now 35 and an illustrator, Pearlman confirmed via email that she, too, has grown disaffected with Facebook “likes” and other addictive feedback loops. She has installed a web browser plug-in to eradicate her Facebook news feed, and hired a social media manager to monitor her Facebook page so that she doesn’t have to.

“One reason I think it is particularly important for us to talk about this now is that we may be the last generation that can remember life before,” Rosenstein says. It may or may not be relevant that Rosenstein, Pearlman and most of the tech insiders questioning today’s attention economy are in their 30s, members of the last generation that can remember a world in which telephones were plugged into walls.

It is revealing that many of these younger technologists are weaning themselves off their own products, sending their children to elite Silicon Valley schools where iPhones, iPads and even laptops are banned. They appear to be abiding by a Biggie Smalls lyric from their own youth about the perils of dealing crack cocaine: never get high on your own supply.

•••

One morning in April this year, designers, programmers and tech entrepreneurs from across the world gathered at a conference centre on the shore of the San Francisco Bay. They had each paid up to $1,700 to learn how to manipulate people into habitual use of their products, on a course curated by conference organiser Nir Eyal.

Eyal, 39, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has spent several years consulting for the tech industry, teaching techniques he developed by closely studying how the Silicon Valley giants operate.

“The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions,” Eyal writes. “It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later.” None of this is an accident, he writes. It is all “just as their designers intended”.

He explains the subtle psychological tricks that can be used to make people develop habits, such as varying the rewards people receive to create “a craving”, or exploiting negative emotions that can act as “triggers”. “Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation,” Eyal writes.

Attendees of the 2017 Habit Summit might have been surprised when Eyal walked on stage to announce that this year’s keynote speech was about “something a little different”. He wanted to address the growing concern that technological manipulation was somehow harmful or immoral. He told his audience that they should be careful not to abuse persuasive design, and wary of crossing a line into coercion.

But he was defensive of the techniques he teaches, and dismissive of those who compare tech addiction to drugs. “We’re not freebasing Facebook and injecting Instagram here,” he said. He flashed up a slide of a shelf filled with sugary baked goods. “Just as we shouldn’t blame the baker for making such delicious treats, we can’t blame tech makers for making their products so good we want to use them,” he said. “Of course that’s what tech companies will do. And frankly: do we want it any other way?”

We’re not freebasing Facebook and injecting Instagram here Nir Eyal, tech consultant

Without irony, Eyal finished his talk with some personal tips for resisting the lure of technology. He told his audience he uses a Chrome extension, called DF YouTube, “which scrubs out a lot of those external triggers” he writes about in his book, and recommended an app called Pocket Points that “rewards you for staying off your phone when you need to focus”.

Finally, Eyal confided the lengths he goes to protect his own family. He has installed in his house an outlet timer connected to a router that cuts off access to the internet at a set time every day. “The idea is to remember that we are not powerless,” he said. “We are in control.”

But are we? If the people who built these technologies are taking such radical steps to wean themselves free, can the rest of us reasonably be expected to exercise our free will?

Not according to Tristan Harris, a 33-year-old former Google employee turned vocal critic of the tech industry. “All of us are jacked into this system,” he says. “All of our minds can be hijacked. Our choices are not as free as we think they are.”

Harris, who has been branded “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”, insists that billions of people have little choice over whether they use these now ubiquitous technologies, and are largely unaware of the invisible ways in which a small number of people in Silicon Valley are shaping their lives.

A graduate of Stanford University, Harris studied under BJ Fogg, a behavioural psychologist revered in tech circles for mastering the ways technological design can be used to persuade people. Many of his students, including Eyal, have gone on to prosperous careers in Silicon Valley.

Harris is the student who went rogue; a whistleblower of sorts, he is lifting the curtain on the vast powers accumulated by technology companies and the ways they are using that influence. “A handful of people, working at a handful of technology companies, through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today,” he said at a recent TED talk in Vancouver.

“I don’t know a more urgent problem than this,” Harris says. “It’s changing our democracy, and it’s changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships that we want with each other.” Harris went public – giving talks, writing papers, meeting lawmakers and campaigning for reform after three years struggling to effect change inside Google’s Mountain View headquarters.

It all began in 2013, when he was working as a product manager at Google, and circulated a thought-provoking memo, A Call To Minimise Distraction & Respect Users’ Attention, to 10 close colleagues. It struck a chord, spreading to some 5,000 Google employees, including senior executives who rewarded Harris with an impressive-sounding new job: he was to be Google’s in-house design ethicist and product philosopher.

Looking back, Harris sees that he was promoted into a marginal role. “I didn’t have a social support structure at all,” he says. Still, he adds: “I got to sit in a corner and think and read and understand.”

He explored how LinkedIn exploits a need for social reciprocity to widen its network; how YouTube and Netflix autoplay videos and next episodes, depriving users of a choice about whether or not they want to keep watching; how Snapchat created its addictive Snapstreaks feature, encouraging near-constant communication between its mostly teenage users.

I have two kids and I regret every minute that I’m not paying attention to them because my smartphone has sucked me in Loren Brichter, app designer

The techniques these companies use are not always generic: they can be algorithmically tailored to each person. An internal Facebook report leaked this year, for example, revealed that the company can identify when teens feel “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. Such granular information, Harris adds, is “a perfect model of what buttons you can push in a particular person”.

Tech companies can exploit such vulnerabilities to keep people hooked; manipulating, for example, when people receive “likes” for their posts, ensuring they arrive when an individual is likely to feel vulnerable, or in need of approval, or maybe just bored. And the very same techniques can be sold to the highest bidder. “There’s no ethics,” he says. A company paying Facebook to use its levers of persuasion could be a car business targeting tailored advertisements to different types of users who want a new vehicle. Or it could be a Moscow-based troll farm seeking to turn voters in a swing county in Wisconsin.

Harris believes that tech companies never deliberately set out to make their products addictive. They were responding to the incentives of an advertising economy, experimenting with techniques that might capture people’s attention, even stumbling across highly effective design by accident.

A friend at Facebook told Harris that designers initially decided the notification icon, which alerts people to new activity such as “friend requests” or “likes”, should be blue. It fit Facebook’s style and, the thinking went, would appear “subtle and innocuous”. “But no one used it,” Harris says. “Then they switched it to red and of course everyone used it.”

That red icon is now everywhere. When smartphone users glance at their phones, dozens or hundreds of times a day, they are confronted with small red dots beside their apps, pleading to be tapped. “Red is a trigger colour,” Harris says. “That’s why it is used as an alarm signal.”

The most seductive design, Harris explains, exploits the same psychological susceptibility that makes gambling so compulsive: variable rewards. When we tap those apps with red icons, we don’t know whether we’ll discover an interesting email, an avalanche of “likes”, or nothing at all. It is the possibility of disappointment that makes it so compulsive.



It’s this that explains how the pull-to-refresh mechanism, whereby users swipe down, pause and wait to see what content appears, rapidly became one of the most addictive and ubiquitous design features in modern technology. “Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” Harris says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.”



•••

The designer who created the pull-to-refresh mechanism, first used to update Twitter feeds, is Loren Brichter, widely admired in the app-building community for his sleek and intuitive designs.

Now 32, Brichter says he never intended the design to be addictive – but would not dispute the slot machine comparison. “I agree 100%,” he says. “I have two kids now and I regret every minute that I’m not paying attention to them because my smartphone has sucked me in.”

Brichter created the feature in 2009 for Tweetie, his startup, mainly because he could not find anywhere to fit the “refresh” button on his app. Holding and dragging down the feed to update seemed at the time nothing more than a “cute and clever” fix. Twitter acquired Tweetie the following year, integrating pull-to-refresh into its own app.

Since then the design has become one of the most widely emulated features in apps; the downward-pull action is, for hundreds of millions of people, as intuitive as scratching an itch.

Brichter says he is puzzled by the longevity of the feature. In an era of push notification technology, apps can automatically update content without being nudged by the user. “It could easily retire,” he says. Instead it appears to serve a psychological function: after all, slot machines would be far less addictive if gamblers didn’t get to pull the lever themselves. Brichter prefers another comparison: that it is like the redundant “close door” button in some elevators with automatically closing doors. “People just like to push it.”

All of which has left Brichter, who has put his design work on the backburner while he focuses on building a house in New Jersey, questioning his legacy. “I’ve spent many hours and weeks and months and years thinking about whether anything I’ve done has made a net positive impact on society or humanity at all,” he says. He has blocked certain websites, turned off push notifications, restricted his use of the Telegram app to message only with his wife and two close friends, and tried to wean himself off Twitter. “I still waste time on it,” he confesses, “just reading stupid news I already know about.” He charges his phone in the kitchen, plugging it in at 7pm and not touching it until the next morning.

“Smartphones are useful tools,” he says. “But they’re addictive. Pull-to-refresh is addictive. Twitter is addictive. These are not good things. When I was working on them, it was not something I was mature enough to think about. I’m not saying I’m mature now, but I’m a little bit more mature, and I regret the downsides.”

Not everyone in his field appears racked with guilt. The two inventors listed on Apple’s patent for “managing notification connections and displaying icon badges” are Justin Santamaria and Chris Marcellino. Both were in their early 20s when they were hired by Apple to work on the iPhone. As engineers, they worked on the behind-the-scenes plumbing for push-notification technology, introduced in 2009 to enable real-time alerts and updates to hundreds of thousands of third-party app developers. It was a revolutionary change, providing the infrastructure for so many experiences that now form a part of people’s daily lives, from ordering an Uber to making a Skype call to receiving breaking news updates.

But notification technology also enabled a hundred unsolicited interruptions into millions of lives, accelerating the arms race for people’s attention. Santamaria, 36, who now runs a startup after a stint as the head of mobile at Airbnb, says the technology he developed at Apple was not “inherently good or bad”. “This is a larger discussion for society,” he says. “Is it OK to shut off my phone when I leave work? Is it OK if I don’t get right back to you? Is it OK that I’m not ‘liking’ everything that goes through my Instagram screen?”

His then colleague, Marcellino, agrees. “Honestly, at no point was I sitting there thinking: let’s hook people,” he says. “It was all about the positives: these apps connect people, they have all these uses – ESPN telling you the game has ended, or WhatsApp giving you a message for free from your family member in Iran who doesn’t have a message plan.”

A few years ago Marcellino, 33, left the Bay Area, and is now in the final stages of retraining to be a neurosurgeon. He stresses he is no expert on addiction, but says he has picked up enough in his medical training to know that technologies can affect the same neurological pathways as gambling and drug use. “These are the same circuits that make people seek out food, comfort, heat, sex,” he says.

All of it, he says, is reward-based behaviour that activates the brain’s dopamine pathways. He sometimes finds himself clicking on the red icons beside his apps “to make them go away”, but is conflicted about the ethics of exploiting people’s psychological vulnerabilities. “It is not inherently evil to bring people back to your product,” he says. “It’s capitalism.”

That, perhaps, is the problem. Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist who benefited from hugely profitable investments in Google and Facebook, has grown disenchanted with both companies, arguing that their early missions have been distorted by the fortunes they have been able to earn through advertising.

It’s changing our democracy, and it's changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships we want Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google

He identifies the advent of the smartphone as a turning point, raising the stakes in an arms race for people’s attention. “Facebook and Google assert with merit that they are giving users what they want,” McNamee says. “The same can be said about tobacco companies and drug dealers.”

That would be a remarkable assertion for any early investor in Silicon Valley’s most profitable behemoths. But McNamee, 61, is more than an arms-length money man. Once an adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, 10 years ago McNamee introduced the Facebook CEO to his friend, Sheryl Sandberg, then a Google executive who had overseen the company’s advertising efforts. Sandberg, of course, became chief operating officer at Facebook, transforming the social network into another advertising heavyweight.

McNamee chooses his words carefully. “The people who run Facebook and Google are good people, whose well-intentioned strategies have led to horrific unintended consequences,” he says. “The problem is that there is nothing the companies can do to address the harm unless they abandon their current advertising models.”

But how can Google and Facebook be forced to abandon the business models that have transformed them into two of the most profitable companies on the planet?

McNamee believes the companies he invested in should be subjected to greater regulation, including new anti-monopoly rules. In Washington, there is growing appetite, on both sides of the political divide, to rein in Silicon Valley. But McNamee worries the behemoths he helped build may already be too big to curtail. “The EU recently penalised Google $2.42bn for anti-monopoly violations, and Google’s shareholders just shrugged,” he says.

Rosenstein, the Facebook “like” co-creator, believes there may be a case for state regulation of “psychologically manipulative advertising”, saying the moral impetus is comparable to taking action against fossil fuel or tobacco companies. “If we only care about profit maximisation,” he says, “we will go rapidly into dystopia.”



•••

James Williams does not believe talk of dystopia is far-fetched. The ex-Google strategist who built the metrics system for the company’s global search advertising business, he has had a front-row view of an industry he describes as the “largest, most standardised and most centralised form of attentional control in human history”.

Williams, 35, left Google last year, and is on the cusp of completing a PhD at Oxford University exploring the ethics of persuasive design. It is a journey that has led him to question whether democracy can survive the new technological age.

He says his epiphany came a few years ago, when he noticed he was surrounded by technology that was inhibiting him from concentrating on the things he wanted to focus on. “It was that kind of individual, existential realisation: what’s going on?” he says. “Isn’t technology supposed to be doing the complete opposite of this?”



That discomfort was compounded during a moment at work, when he glanced at one of Google’s dashboards, a multicoloured display showing how much of people’s attention the company had commandeered for advertisers. “I realised: this is literally a million people that we’ve sort of nudged or persuaded to do this thing that they weren’t going to otherwise do,” he recalls.

He embarked on several years of independent research, much of it conducted while working part-time at Google. About 18 months in, he saw the Google memo circulated by Harris and the pair became allies, struggling to bring about change from within.

It is not inherently evil to bring people back to your product. It’s capitalism Chris Marcellino, former Apple engineer

Williams and Harris left Google around the same time, and co-founded an advocacy group, Time Well Spent, that seeks to build public momentum for a change in the way big tech companies think about design. Williams finds it hard to comprehend why this issue is not “on the front page of every newspaper every day.

“Eighty-seven percent of people wake up and go to sleep with their smartphones,” he says. The entire world now has a new prism through which to understand politics, and Williams worries the consequences are profound.

The same forces that led tech firms to hook users with design tricks, he says, also encourage those companies to depict the world in a way that makes for compulsive, irresistible viewing. “The attention economy incentivises the design of technologies that grab our attention,” he says. “In so doing, it privileges our impulses over our intentions.”

That means privileging what is sensational over what is nuanced, appealing to emotion, anger and outrage. The news media is increasingly working in service to tech companies, Williams adds, and must play by the rules of the attention economy to “sensationalise, bait and entertain in order to survive”.

In the wake of Donald Trump’s stunning electoral victory, many were quick to question the role of so-called “fake news” on Facebook, Russian-created Twitter bots or the data-centric targeting efforts that companies such as Cambridge Analytica used to sway voters. But Williams sees those factors as symptoms of a deeper problem.

It is not just shady or bad actors who were exploiting the internet to change public opinion. The attention economy itself is set up to promote a phenomenon like Trump, who is masterly at grabbing and retaining the attention of supporters and critics alike, often by exploiting or creating outrage.

Williams was making this case before the president was elected. In a blog published a month before the US election, Williams sounded the alarm bell on an issue he argued was a “far more consequential question” than whether Trump reached the White House. The reality TV star’s campaign, he said, had heralded a watershed in which “the new, digitally supercharged dynamics of the attention economy have finally crossed a threshold and become manifest in the political realm”.

Williams saw a similar dynamic unfold months earlier, during the Brexit campaign, when the attention economy appeared to him biased in favour of the emotional, identity-based case for the UK leaving the European Union. He stresses these dynamics are by no means isolated to the political right: they also play a role, he believes, in the unexpected popularity of leftwing politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, and the frequent outbreaks of internet outrage over issues that ignite fury among progressives.

All of which, Williams says, is not only distorting the way we view politics but, over time, may be changing the way we think, making us less rational and more impulsive. “We’ve habituated ourselves into a perpetual cognitive style of outrage, by internalising the dynamics of the medium,” he says.



It is against this political backdrop that Williams argues the fixation in recent years with the surveillance state fictionalised by George Orwell may have been misplaced. It was another English science fiction writer, Aldous Huxley, who provided the more prescient observation when he warned that Orwellian-style coercion was less of a threat to democracy than the more subtle power of psychological manipulation, and “man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions”.

Since the US election, Williams has explored another dimension to today’s brave new world. If the attention economy erodes our ability to remember, to reason, to make decisions for ourselves – faculties that are essential to self-governance – what hope is there for democracy itself?

“The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will,” he says. “If politics is an expression of our human will, on individual and collective levels, then the attention economy is directly undermining the assumptions that democracy rests on.” If Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat are gradually chipping away at our ability to control our own minds, could there come a point, I ask, at which democracy no longer functions?

“Will we be able to recognise it, if and when it happens?” Williams replies. “And if we can’t, then how do we know it hasn’t happened already?”"
State of emergency in Florida as tropical storm approaches,http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11930154&ref=rss,"Tropical storm Nate is expected to affect Florida this weekend. Photo / NOAA

A state of emergency has been declared in Florida as tropical storm Nate heads towards the state.

Governor Rick Scott has today declared a state of emergency in 29 counties within Florida.

Scott said he was ensuring local governments had ample time, resources and flexibility to get prepared for this storm and were not hindered, delayed or prevented from taking all necessary actions to keep communities safe.

""Tropical Storm Nate is headed north toward our state and Florida must be prepared. I have continued to be briefed by the Florida Division of Emergency Management on Tropical Storm Nate and while current forecast models have the storm's centre west of Florida, we must be vigilant and get prepared,"" Scott said.

""Today, given these forecasts, I have declared a state of emergency for 29 counties in Florida to make certain that state, federal and local governments are able to work together and ensure resources are dispersed to local communities.

""By declaring an emergency in these counties, we can also ensure that there is no hindrance in the transportation of supplies and assets.""

He urged residents to remain vigilant, stay alert and be prepared.

""We will keep monitoring and issuing updates on Tropical Storm Nate as it approaches the Gulf Coast,"" he said.

The counties under the state of emergency are Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Holmes, Washington, Bay, Jackson, Calhoun, Gulf, Gadsden, Liberty, Franklin, Leon, Wakulla, Jefferson, Madison, Taylor, Hamilton, Suwannee, Lafayette, Dixie, Columbia, Gilchrist, Levy, Baker, Union, Bradford, and Alachua counties.

This comes just weeks after Hurricane Irma hit the state leaving a trail of destruction in its wake."
"Vast animal-feed crops to satisfy our meat needs are destroying planet | Intensive and industrial animal farming also results in less nutritious food, it reveals, highlighting that six intensively reared chickens today have the same amount of omega-3 as found in just one chicken in the 1970s.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/vast-animal-feed-crops-meat-needs-destroying-planet,"WWF report finds 60% of global biodiversity loss is down to meat-based diets which put huge strain on Earth’s resources

The ongoing global appetite for meat is having a devastating impact on the environment driven by the production of crop-based feed for animals, a new report has warned.

The vast scale of growing crops such as soy to rear chickens, pigs and other animals puts an enormous strain on natural resources leading to the wide-scale loss of land and species, according to the study from the conservation charity WWF.

Intensive and industrial animal farming also results in less nutritious food, it reveals, highlighting that six intensively reared chickens today have the same amount of omega-3 as found in just one chicken in the 1970s.

Why factory farming is not just cruel – but also a threat to all life on the planet Read more

The study entitled Appetite for Destruction launches on Thursday at the 2017 Extinction and Livestock Conference in London, in conjunction with Compassion in World Farming (CIFW), and warns of the vast amount of land needed to grow the crops used for animal feed and cites some of the world’s most vulnerable areas such as the Amazon, Congo Basin and the Himalayas.

The report and conference come against a backdrop of alarming revelations of industrial farming. Last week a Guardian/ITV investigation showed chicken factory staff in the UK changing crucial food safety information.

Protein-rich soy is now produced in such huge quantities that the average European consumes approximately 61kg each year, largely indirectly by eating animal products such as chicken, pork, salmon, cheese, milk and eggs.



In 2010, the British livestock industry needed an area the size of Yorkshire to produce the soy used in feed. But if global demand for meat grows as expected, the report says, soy production would need to increase by nearly 80% by 2050.



“The world is consuming more animal protein than it needs and this is having a devastating effect on wildlife,” said Duncan Williamson, WWF food policy manager. “A staggering 60% of global biodiversity loss is down to the food we eat. We know a lot of people are aware that a meat-based diet has an impact on water and land, as well as causing greenhouse gas emissions, but few know the biggest issue of all comes from the crop-based feed the animals eat.”

With 23bn chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks and guinea fowl on the planet – more than three per person – the biggest user of crop-based feed globally is poultry. The second largest, with 30% of the world’s feed in 2009, is the pig industry.

In the UK, pork is the second favourite meat after chicken, with each person eating on average 25kg a year in 2015 – nearly the whole recommended yearly intake for all meats. UK nutritional guidelines recommend 45-55g of protein per day, but the average UK consumption is 64-88g, of which 37% is meat and meat products."
Active shooter at Mandalay Bay Casino in Las Vegas,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/las-vegas-police-investigating-shooting-mandalay-bay-n806461,"A lone gunman unleashed a rapid-fire barrage of bullets from the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas hotel late Sunday, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than 500 others attending a country music festival below, officials said.

It was the worst mass shooting in modern American history, and Stephen Craig Paddock was ""solely responsible for this heinous act,"" Assistant Clark County Sheriff Todd Fasulo told reporters Monday night.

Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada, fired shot after shot from his room at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino down on the crowd of about 22,000, sending terrified concertgoers running for their lives.

""We heard what sounded like firecrackers going off. Then all of a sudden we heard what sounded like a machine gun. People started screaming that they were hit,"" witness Meghan Kearney told MSNBC. ""When we started running out, there were probably a couple hundred [people] on the ground.""

She added: ""People kept dropping and dropping. ... People were getting shot one foot away from us. People were trying to save their friends. There were gunshots everywhere. Helping them would've meant that we got shot, too.""

The Latest:

59 people were killed and at least 527 others were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Authorities identified the gunman as Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada. They said he acted alone.

Investigators found 23 firearms in Paddock's room at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and 19 more at his home.

President Donald Trump, who will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, called the shooting ""an act of pure evil.""

Police responded to reports of the shooting just after 10 p.m. (1 a.m. ET). Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters Monday that authorities believe Paddock killed himself before police entered his room. Officials had said earlier that police fatally shot Paddock.

Authorities were digging into Paddock's history. Other than a citation he received several years ago that was ""handled as a normal practice"" by the courts, he had no criminal background, Lombardo said.

Paddock is believed to have checked into the hotel on Thursday, Lombardo said. Fasulo said that he had 23 firearms in his room and that investigators found 19 more at his home.

It wasn't clear whether Paddock had specifically requested a room on a high floor that overlooked the concert venue. Hotel employees had been in his room before the shooting and didn't notice anything unusual, according to Lombardo.

Two broken windows could be seen from the 32nd floor of the hotel, curtains billowing out. Law enforcement officials said Paddock had connecting rooms or a suite and ran between the windows, firing out of both, either to get a different vantage point or to avoid return fire.

They believe he smashed the windows with a something like a hammer before he started firing.

The shooting started while performer Jason Aldean was onstage. Witnesses described a chaotic scene of back-to-back bullets raining down from above, lasting for up to 10 minutes.

Fellow performer Jake Owen said he was standing about 50 feet from Aldean when the shots started.

""It got faster and faster, almost like it was an automatic rifle,"" Owen said. ""At that point, everyone on stage started running everywhere.""

Owen dashed by victims covered in blood and eventually found shelter in his bus. The gunfire still hadn't stopped by the time he got there, he said.

""It wasn't something that was quick. It was chaos for a pure seven to 10 minutes,"" he said.

Flags at the White House and the U.S. Capitol were lowered at half-staff on Monday. President Donald Trump, who said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, called the shooting ""an act of pure evil.""

""Hundreds of our fellow citizens are now mourning the loss of a loved one,"" Trump said at a news conference. ""We cannot fathom their pain. We cannot imagine their loss. To the families of the victims, we are praying for you, and we are here for you.""

The shooting isn't believed to be connected to international terrorism. Authorities haven't said what kinds of weapons were found.

A former Clark County sheriff, Bill Young, said his 22-year-old daughter was at the concert. Young told MSNBC that his daughter said that the weapon ""sounded like a machine gun"" and that she and her friends took cover under a desk.

""I picked up the phone, my cellphone, and she was screaming and yelling, 'Dad, dad, dad, dad, somebody's shooting at us, and I don't know what to do.' She was hysterical, and I tried to just calm her down,"" Young said.

""She could hear the gunshots — sounded like a machine gun, she said — and they didn't know where they were coming from,"" Young said. ""She had nowhere to take cover, so I told her just to run as fast as she could, as quick as she could, out of the arena. Get as far away from it as she could where she thought the line of fire might be.""

At least one off-duty Las Vegas police officer was shot, Lombardo said. Several other off-duty police officers are believed to be among the dead and injured.

The massacre put the normally bustling Strip at a standstill. Flights in and out of the Las Vegas airport were temporarily halted.

Police found Paddock's roommate, Marilou Danley, 62, and don't think she was involved, Lombardo said, adding that the investigation is ongoing.

Police searched their home in Mesquite, about 80 miles from Las Vegas.

The suspect's brother Eric Paddock, of Orlando, Florida, told NBC News that he was ""dumbfounded"" by the shooting.

""He was just a guy,"" Eric Paddock said of his brother. ""He lives in Mesquite, he went to the hotels, he gambled, he went to shows.""

""We are completely at a loss,"" he added.

Senior law enforcement officials and a Las Vegas casino executive said Stephen Paddock had made several large gambling transactions in recent weeks, including some of more than $30,000 a day. It wasn't known whether they were losses or wins.

In 2012, Paddock sued the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas for a slip and fall. Martin Kravitz, the lead attorney for the hotel, described him Monday as ""bizarre"" and said ""he dressed slovenly to the deposition.""

""His answers were vague, not very thoughtful,"" Kravitz said. ""He wasn't angry. ... This is not a guy who would have really stood out in your mind.""

He added that Paddock was wearing ""crappy flip-flops.""

""You wonder what a guy like this is doing at the Cosmo,"" he said.

Aldean, who was named the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year in April, was performing on the final night of the three-day Route 91 Harvest festival at the Las Vegas Village when the shots started. He later said via Instagram that he and his band were safe.

""I still don't know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that Me and my Crew are safe. My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight,"" he wrote.

Vice President Mike Pence tweeted his condolences after the ""senseless violence.""

""The hearts and prayers of the American people are with you. You have our condolences and sympathies,"" he wrote. ""To the courageous first responders, thank you for your acts of bravery.""

Hillary Clinton also expressed her grief in a tweet: ""The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.""

She added: ""Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.""

Police urged families looking to locate missing loved ones to call 1-866-535-5654.

'Whoever leads in AI will rule the world': Putin to Russian children on Knowledge Day,https://www.rt.com/news/401731-ai-rule-world-putin/,"Vladimir Putin spoke with students about science in an open lesson on September 1, the start of the school year in Russia. He told them that “the future belongs to artificial intelligence,” and whoever masters it first will rule the world.

“Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said.

However, the president said he would not like to see anyone “monopolize” the field.

“If we become leaders in this area, we will share this know-how with entire world, the same way we share our nuclear technologies today,” he told students from across Russia via satellite link-up, speaking from the Yaroslavl region.

During the 45-minute open lesson (the standard academic hour in Russia), Putin also discussed space, medicine, and the capabilities of the human brain, pointing out the importance of cognitive science.

“The movement of the eyes can be used to operate various systems, and also there are possibilities to analyze human behavior in extreme situations, including in space,” Putin said, adding that he believes these studies provide unlimited opportunities.

Activists from the anti-fascist movement known as antifa have recently come under fire because some - but not all - employ militant tactics and use violence as a means of getting their message across.

But now some of the group - a loose coalition of left-wing groups who oppose fascism, racism and sexism - are reportedly assisting with search and rescue and first aid.

Others claim to have established shelters in poorer neighbourhoods and areas that may be overlooked by larger organisations.

“When real disaster strikes, people put aside what they think about the world and begin to help each other directly,” a relief worker, identified as Scott Crow, told the Revere Press website.

""Gonzo journalist"" and self declared anti-fascist, Kit O'Connell also said members of the group were helping with the relief effort.

""Even though we’re not wearing our masks, antifa in Texas are in the streets, saving lives, feeding folks and organising,"" he wrote in an article for the Medium website.

Transgender YouTubers had their videos grabbed to train facial recognition software,https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16180080/transgender-youtubers-ai-facial-recognition-dataset,"About five or six years ago, one of Karl Ricanek’s students showed him a video on YouTube. It was a time lapse of a person undergoing hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, in order to transition genders. “At the time, we were working on facial recognition,” Ricanek, a professor of computer science at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, tells The Verge. He says he and his students were always trying to find ways to break the systems they worked on, and that this video seemed like a particularly tricky challenge. “We were like, ‘Wow there’s no way the current technology could recognize this person [after they transitioned].’”

Ricanek turned to YouTube to find images of transgender people

To tackle the problem, Ricanek did what all good scientists do: he started collecting data. Like all AI systems, facial recognition software requires stacks of information to train on, and although there are a number of sizable and freely available face databases available (ranging in size from thousands to millions of images), there was nothing documenting faces before and after HRT. So, Ricanek turned to the internet — a decision that would later prove to be controversial.

On YouTube, he found a treasure trove. Individuals undergoing HRT often document their progress and post the results online, sometimes keeping regular diaries, and sometimes making time-lapse videos of the entire process. “I shared my videos because I wanted other trans people to see my transition,” says Danielle, who posted her transition video on YouTube years ago. “These types of transition montages were helpful to me, so I wanted to pay it forward,” she tells The Verge.

The videos also happen to be gold for AI researchers, as each contains dozens of varied, true-to-life photos. As Ricanek wrote on a webpage for the dataset he would compile from the videos: “[It] includes an average of 278 images per subject that are taken under real-world conditions, and hence, include variations in pose, illumination, expression, and occlusion.”

But the problem is: do the people in these videos know or care that the personal journey they shared to help others is being used to improve facial recognition software?

“How is this even legal?”

Adam Harvey, an artist and researcher whose work examines privacy and technology, tells The Verge over email that this sort of data-scraping is “beyond common.” It was Harvey who found the HRT Transgender Dataset during research for an upcoming project examining exactly this sort of AI-training practice. He shared it on Twitter, where reactions were not good. “How is this even legal?” asked one user. “Not okay,” said another.

Ricanek wasn’t aware that his work was being discussed in this way when we reached out to him. He did, however, want to clarify a number of things about the research. First, that the dataset itself was just a set of links to YouTube videos, rather than the videos themselves; second, that he never shared it with anyone for commercial purposes (“Our job is just to illuminate what problem areas exist.”); and third, that he stopped giving access to it altogether three years ago.

“The reason for that is that it felt a little uncomfortable in the current climate to provide those things out there,” he told The Verge. “I have no inclination to distribute even the links any longer, for political reasons. People can use this for harm, and that was not my intent.” He says his team did try to contact individuals whose videos he listed and ask their permission “as a courtesy,” but admitted that if someone didn’t respond, they might have been included anyway.

Individuals were included in the dataset without their consent

Danielle, who is featured in the dataset and whose transition pictures appear in scientific papers because of it, says she was never contacted about her inclusion. “I by no means ‘hide’ my identity,” she told The Verge using an online messaging service. “But this feels like a violation of privacy.” She said she was gratified to know that there are limits on the use of the dataset (especially that it wasn’t sold to companies), but said this sort of biometric collection had “all sorts of implications for the trans community.”

“Someone who works in ‘identity sciences’ should understand the implications of identifying people, particularly those whose identity may make them a target (i.e., trans people in the military who may not be out),” she said. “Within the trans community, there's a non-trivial segment of people terrified by YouTube videos or other content that helps people figure out how to ‘spot the trans person.’”

For Harvey, this story is not surprising. “The lack of public discourse around data collection ethics has allowed researchers to continue amassing vast troves of biometric data from social media sources, namely Flickr and YouTube,” he says. These images can be given a Creative Commons (CC) license by default, allowing them to be downloaded freely and used to train facial-recognition systems even when the research is funded by for-profit companies.

And compared to other datasets, Ricanek’s is a minnow. The MegaFace dataset compiled by the University of Washington, for example, contains 4.7 million images of roughly 627,000 individuals — all taken from Flickr users. The project’s sponsors include Samsung, Intel, and Google, and the data itself is used by researchers from all over the world, whose work almost certainly feeds into paid products.

Harvey says that putting aside issues of legality and consent, there are “deeper ethical questions about the actual content in these datasets.” He points out that the two most common categories of images in MegaFace are “family” and “wedding.” Which makes sense, as who do we like to takes pictures of more than our loved ones? A look inside the database, says Harvey, “reveals countless personal photos of people's homes, weddings, picnics, beach trips, selfies, and even photos of children. Most, if not all, people in these photos are unaware that biometric companies around the world are honing facial recognition algorithms on their friends, family, and children.”

Law enforcement and national security agencies are also interested in this data. Ricanek’s research is partly funded by the FBI and the Army (although he says the transgender dataset was never shared with any government agencies nor was it funded by them). Ricanek justified the research as a solution to a fantastical border threat. But a system using this kind of research could exacerbate the harassment and humiliation that transgender people already face at travel checkpoints.

“As academics, we see great challenges ... but behind those challenges are real people.”

“What kind of harm can a terrorist do if they understand that taking this hormone can increase their chances of crossing over into a border that’s protected by face recognition? That was the problem that I was really investigating,” he says. “I’m deeply apologetic for any type of pain this may have caused any people in these videos. That’s certainly not where I’m coming from. As academics, we see great challenges and we want to work on them, but behind those challenges are real people, who may be impacted in ways we have not comprehended.”

Harvey says there’s currently “little debate” about the ethics of this sort of data collection. It’s a complex topic, and although individuals might be outraged that their image is being used without permission, there’s little they can do about it.

There is pushback in some instances (like when a researcher scraped 40,000 selfies from Tinder without permission and posted the dataset online), but in the debate about what is the right and the wrong way to go about acquiring data, the loudest voices are those of big companies. This leads to situations like in the UK, where Google’s AI subsidiary DeepMind made an illegal deal to access medical records belonging to 1.6 million individuals.

In a way, we’re used to this deal. It’s the bargain that underpins so much of the modern internet: you give away information about your life, and in return you get free services. But in the age of AI, as the data gathered becomes more and more personal — not just your anonymized browsing habits, but pictures of you, your family, your personal moments — and the systems it creates are more and more controlling, it’s perhaps time to ask ourselves, once again, are we giving away too much?"
World's Largest Meat Company Profits Drop 80%,http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Industry-Markets/JBS-net-income-drops-in-second-quarter,"In the 13 weeks to 30 June, the company’s net income was R$309.8 million (m), down from R$1,536.2m in the second quarter of 2016.

JBS’ net revenue for the period was R$41.7 billion (bn) down 4.6% from the same period last year.

Its gross profit for the second quarter was R$6.2bn, with gross margin growing from 12.1% in 2016 to 14.8% in 2017, while the EBITDA was R$3.8bn, up 29.9% on the second quarter of the previous year.

The company’s expenses rose due to currency fluctuations over the period.

Its Brazil-based Seara and Mercosul divisions both saw year-on-year drops in net revenue, with the former seeing a 6.1% decline and the latter a 14.2% drop, which CEO Wesley Batista described as “challenging”.

JBS was embroiled in the rotten meat scandal, which challenged Brazilian processors and led to a reshuffling of its management team, with Joesley Batista resigning from his position as chairman.

The company’s US and European operations experienced growth in net revenue over the period. JBS USA Beef (+5.9%), JBS USA Pork (+11.8%), Pilgrims Pride (+11%) and JBS Europe – Moy Park (+7.4%) all saw growth in the quarter.

Wesley Batista, global CEO of JBS, said: “Our operations performed very well during the second quarter of 2017. Seara posted an EBITDA improvement when compared with the first quarter, which shows that this business unit is turning back to historical levels in terms of operating results.​

“Beef operations in Brazil also registered a recovery in EBITDA in relation to the first quarter of this year, in spite of a more challenging scenario during the period. Our beef operations in the US, which include Australia and Canada, performed quite positively, clearly indicating an excellent perspective for upcoming periods. Poultry operations in North America (Pilgrim’s) registered an excellent performance, with an EBITDA margin of 18.7%. Finally, our pork operations in the US and Moy Park in Europe continued to deliver solid and consistent results.​

“JBS’ performance for the period is a clear demonstration of the quality of our business units around the globe and of the extraordinary team that we have.”​"

Emmanuel Macron's popularity falls faster than any French president ever,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-poll-100-days-unpopular-hollande-approval-rating-worse-a7892366.html,"Emmanuel Macron’s popularity has dropped faster than any previous French president, according to a landmark poll after his first 100 days in office.

Mr Macron is now more unpopular than his predecessor Francois Hollande – himself very unpopular – was after the same length of time in office.

The French President’s first months have been dogged with allegations of financial irregularities among members of his government, as well as rows over planned cuts to housing support for people on low-incomes.

Just 36 per cent of the French public said they were satisfied with the President’s performance, with 64 per cent saying they were not, according to the latest Ifop poll.

At the same stage in Mr Hollande’s presidency the socialist was satisfying 46 per cent of the French public and lost the support of 54 per cent of them.

According to the same series of polls Mr Macron’s rating was as high as 64 per cent in late June and 54 per cent in late July – meaning the biggest falls in his popularity have come most recently.

Christophe Castaner, a secretary of state in Mr Macron’s government, said on the 100 day anniversary that Mr Macron’s government was “not exempt from difficulties”.

He however said the President had seen “a hundred useful days, undoubtedly, a hundred days of action which have laid the foundations for a profound transformation of our country”.

The Conservative-leading Le Figaro newspaper, which commissioned the poll, said the French were “falling out of love” with Mr Macron.

Jérôme Fourquet, the director of polling company Ifop, told Le Figaro that Mr Macron had lost his “state of grace” with the French electorate and that the figures were “serious alert” for the President.

However Mr Macron’s satisfaction rate is still higher than the proportion of people who voted for him in the first round of the French presidential election.

"Saudi Arabia exports extremism to many countries - including Germany: A British study has found that Saudi Arabia plays a key role in the radicalization of Muslims. The Wahhabi influence, fueled by oil money, can be seen in Germany as well, says researcher Susanne Schr?ter.",http://www.dw.com/en/saudi-arabia-exports-extremism-to-many-countries-including-germany-study-says/a-39618920,"DW: After the bloody terror attacks in Great Britain, there are an increasing number of studies being conducted on the cause of radicalization. Britain's Henry Jackson Society, a think tank, has published a report on foreign funding for extremist branches of Islam in Great Britain. Saudi Arabia has been clearly named as one of the greatest supporters. In the past 50 years, Riyadh has invested at least 76 billion euros ($86 billion) in Wahhabi extremism, the ideological basis of extremist and jihadist movements throughout the world. Are you surprised about these findings?

Susanne Schröter: The findings do not surprise me at all. It has long been known that Saudi Arabia has been exporting Wahhabist ideology - largely similar to the ideology of the so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS). Propaganda material and organizational expertise are being sent along with money. People are being hired to build mosques, educational institutions, cultural centers and similar organizations, so that Wahhabist theology can reach the public – with great success.

Susanne Schröter, director of the Frankfurter Research Center for Global Islam (FFGI)

Where is this extremism, that is fueled by oil money, most obvious?

The export of Wahhabism got off the ground after the Islamic revolution in Iran. The revolution had dramatically shaken the Saudis. When Iran started exporting its Shiite ideology, the Saudis felt threatened by it. Around that time, in 1979, hardliners seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The Saudis launched an ideological offensive and said, ""Now we are exporting our own ideology. We will show the hardliners in our own country what we are capable of achieving."" Then, they started promoting Wahhabism through intermediaries and organizations like the World Muslim League in different countries throughout Asia, Africa and parts of Europe – for example, in former Yugoslavia where Muslims and Christians fought against each other in the civil war. Wahhabists saw it as a gateway, where money was needed since the Muslim population was ready for a new and radical ideology.

The result is that, in many parts of the world, a radical form of Islam is gaining the upper hand. I have experienced this first hand in Southeast Asia. In southern Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and sometimes Malaysia, it was always said that a special form of Islam was practiced, a much more open, much more tolerant version. There has been a dramatic development towards radicalism over the past three decades. It is perfectly clear that this development has been encouraged by Saudi money. Moreover, young intellectuals have been recruited with generous scholarships at Saudi universities. These people return to their homes after having studied at Saudi universities and suddenly carry out Wahhabi missionary work in all their home countries.

Salafist preacher, Pierre Vogel, was given a Saudi scholarship to study in Mecca

Pierre Vogel, perhaps the most well-known German Salafist preacher, studied on a Saudi scholarship in Mecca. Saudi Arabia has apparently influenced the radicalization process of Muslims in Germany. German media made such claims in December 2016, citing intelligence sources. It was said that religious foundations from the Gulf States, especially Saudi Arabia, supported local Salafist groups in Germany with the approval of their governments. To what extent does this correspond to your research findings?

This is absolutely consistent with our findings. In some cases, state-owned Saudi institutions were massively involved. There was once a Saudi attache in Berlin, Mohamed Fakihi. He had connections to the terrorist cell in Hamburg that carried out the attack on the World Trade Center in New York in 2001. Fakihi also was well connected to Berlin's Al-Nur Mosque, which often attracts attention for being a Salafist hotspot. The attache is now no longer there but back then, it was the first time people became aware of this.

We have seen that Saudi foundations are operating everywhere - partly underground and partly through intermediaries, like Nadeem Elias. Until 2006, he was chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. This is one of the most important Muslim associations that constantly maintain inauspicious ties with Saudi foundations, including the Muslim World League or the World Assembly of Muslim Youth.

There is also another high-ranking official in the Central Council of Muslims: Ibrahim El-Zayat. Zayat was chairman of the Islamic Community of Germany from 2002 to 2010. We have only scratched the surface. And when people are asked questions, they are always evasive. But it is clear that there are organizations and individuals in Germany who take the Wahhabization of German Muslims seriously.

These women were attending a sermon given by Pierre Vogel

According to latest report published by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, a German domestic intelligence agency, the Salafist scene in Germany has now grown to include over 10,000 members. There must be other reasons apart from Saudi support, right?

Of course. Firstly, not only do the Saudis bankroll extremists. Now attention has been drawn to Qatar for doing this. And yes, it is true that Qatar provides funds and Kuwait provides funds. There are also other players in the Gulf Region who support radical tendencies here in Germany - including Iran. Iran has set up an institute in Berlin, where it works as a missionary. I assume that if you observe where money flows, you will be amazed. Germany is generally a place where foreign extremist organizations are active.

Jeremy Corbyn Wants to Requisition Homes of the Rich for Fire Survivors ? Like Churchill Did in WW2,https://theintercept.com/2017/06/20/jeremy-corbyn-grenfell-fire-luxury-apartments-world-war-ii-churchill/,"British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has a bold proposal to house the survivors of a devastating fire at London’s Grenfell Tower apartment complex in empty luxury homes.

YouGov polling found that Corbyn’s idea is popular among the British public, with 59 percent supporting it. Yet there has been a harsh backlash from the U.K.’s right-wing government and press, which equated his plan with a Marxist plot. “Suggesting requisitioning empty properties when empty student accommodation is available locally is completely in line with his Marxist belief that all private property should belong to the state,” Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said.

But Corbyn’s plan has historical roots not in Marxist literature or state-run economies, but in his country’s own past.

During the Second World War, Great Britain faced one of the most powerful war machines in human history in a conflict with Nazi Germany. Its government responded by asking all of its citizens to contribute to the war effort in different ways.

For some, this included giving up their property. To help bear the brunt of the Nazi war machine, the British government requisitioned both industrial and residential properties to accommodate soldiers and evacuees, run makeshift schools and hospitals, and train the military, among other uses. As the U.K.’s National Archives website notes, “14.5 million acres of land, 25 million square feet of industrial and storage premises and 113,350 non-industrial premises were requisitioned during the Second World War. The War Office alone requisitioned 580,847 acres between 1939 and 1946.”

Architectural historian John Martin Robinson documented much of this requisition process in his book “Requisitioned: The British Country House in the Second World War,” which looked at how large country estates were used to house military personnel and evacuees, the latter mostly being children. Some of the properties that ended up being used to house soldiers or civilians were among the grandest in the country — they included castles, palaces, and abbeys owned by some of the country’s richest citizens.

Residents of one of these large homes requisitioned for the war effort, Spetchley House, are interviewed in the documentary “Stately Homes at War.” The house was originally planned to be a fallback shelter for Prime Minister Winston Churchill in case of a German invasion, but ended up being used as a place for recuperation for American Air Force pilots. The two residents of Spetchley House interviewed were just children at the time, but they understood housing the American soldiers as a patriotic duty.

“There’s no question that those young men did go to hell and back,” Juliet Berkeley, who was just 9 years old when the war began, said of housing the American soldiers."
Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull mimics Trump in humorous speech to press ball,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/15/malcolm-turnbull-mimicks-donald-trump-in-humorous-speech-to-press-ball?CMP=soc_567,"Prime minister recorded making jokes about US president’s alleged links to Russia, his views on fake news and poor poll ratings

The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has been recorded mimicking Donald Trump and joking about his poll numbers, his attacks on fake news and his alleged links to Russia.

Leaked video and audio of Turnbull’s off-the-record speech – which was also self-deprecating about his own poor opinion poll ratings – shows him impersonating the US president’s unique oratorical style.

Thigh splits and political whips at Canberra's Midwinter Ball – in pictures Read more

In his speech to the Canberra press gallery’s Midwinter Ball, the Australian equivalent of the White House correspondents’ dinner, Turnbull says: “The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls. We are winning so much, we are winning, we are winning like we have never won before. We are winning in the polls. We are, we are. Not the fake polls. Not the fake polls. They’re the ones we’re not winning in.

“We’re winning in the real polls.

“You know, the online polls. They are so easy to win. I know that. Did you know that? I kind of know that. They are so easy to win. I have this Russian guy.

“Believe me it’s true, it’s true.”

Speeches at the press gallery Midwinter Ball are intended to be light-hearted. For a decade, the speeches made at the dinner have been widely regarded as being off-the-record. However, the most senior press gallery journalist, Channel Nine’s Laurie Oakes, routinely refuses to attend the ball and has consistently said he is not bound by the off-the-record convention.

He played leaked audio, and a small snippet of video uploaded on social media, in a news piece on Thursday.

Turnbull and Trump had a famously difficult phone call after the president entered the White House. A furious president ended a call early, angry over a deal struck by the Obama administration for America to resettle refugees from Australia’s offshore detention islands. The US president reportedly told Turnbull he’d spoken with four other world leaders – including the Russian president, Vladimir Putin – and said “this was the worst call by far”.

In May the two men met for an apparently convivial meeting at a dinner on the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier in New York to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Impersonating Trump at the press dinner, Turnbull joked: “It was beautiful. It was the most beautiful putting-me-at-ease ever.”

Speaking in a 3AW radio interview shortly after the speech was leaked, Turnbull said the speech was light-hearted and affectionate.

“Well it [the ball] is a great tradition, it’s a big charity fundraiser … and it is a good-humoured sort of roast really. The PM and the opposition leader give a speech and poke fun at themselves and often other politicians.



“My speech was light-hearted, affectionately light-hearted.”

Turnbull said he was disappointed elements of the speech had been leaked, given the convention that it is not reported. “I guess what this means is at the Midwinter Ball next year, I will read selected passages from budget paper No 2.

“It’s a breach of protocol and a breach of faith and all of those things but it’s light-hearted, affectionate and good-natured. And the butt of my jokes was myself.”

The prime minister said he wasn’t mocking the president. “It was more good-natured than that … It’s a stressful business politics, you’ve got to have fun.”

The US embassy in Canberra issued a statement, reiterating Turnbull’s position that the speech was not intended to mock. “We understand that last night’s event is equivalent to our own White House correspondents’ dinner. We take this with the good humour that was intended.”

Theresa May's chief of staff 'sat on' report warning high-rise blocks like Grenfell Tower were vulnerable to fire - Mirror Online,http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/theresa-mays-chief-staff-sat-10620357.amp,"Theresa May’s new chief of staff was one of a series of housing ministers who “sat on” a report warning high-rise blocks like Grenfell Tower were vulnerable to fire for four years.

A former Chief Fire Officer and secretary of a parliamentary group on fire safety today revealed successive ministers had had damning evidence on their desks since 2013 and nothing had happened.

And the Labour MP who chairs the group said ministers had “sat on” the recommendations for almost four years.

Gavin Barwell, who was housing minister until losing his seat in last week’s election, promised to review part B of the Building Regulations 2010, which relate to fire safety, but the review never materialised.

A coroner’s investigation into the blaze at Lakanal House in South London in 2009, which claimed six lives, found panels on the exterior of the block had not provided the required fire resistance and insufficient fire risk assessments had been made.

The coroner made a series of recommendation following the tragedy, but while some have been taken up, a full review of building regulations has yet to take place.

The Mirror approached Number 10 and the Department for Communities and Local Government for comment.

Ronnie King, honorary administrative secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fire Safety and Rescue and a former Chief Fire Officer, told LBC Radio this morning they had “strongly recommended” installing fire suppression systems and sprinklers in 4,000 similar tower blocks across the country.

He said: “We were strongly recommending this because the fire at Lakanal House spread within four minutes and came into the flat above and then went on to kill six people, regrettably.”

Mr King said it was likely similar failings existed in West London’s Grenfell House, which erupted in flames in the early hours of this morning.

He said: “I wouldn’t have expected fire to spread like that if there had been automatic fire sprinklers installed.”

London Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick, who was a firefighter for more than 20 years, said this morning the government had resisted calls to install sprinkler systems in tower blocks.

Mr Fitzpatrick, who chairs the All-Party Group, said the Lakanal House fire should have been a “wake-up call”.

He said: “Four years later, we’re still trying to get the government to undertake that review.”

He said successive ministers had said they were “looking at it”, adding the delay had been worsened by responsibility for building regulations being split between three ministers.

He added: “You’d have to ask them why they’ve sat on it for four years.”

Mr King said: “It’s nearly 11 years since it was reviewed, and successive ministers since 2013 have actually said ‘we’re still looking at it.’”

He said said Mr Barwell said he was “still looking whether or not to undertake a review” as recently as this year.

“He was still looking at it,” he said. “And he was prepared to meet the All-Party Group” to discuss it further. And that’s when the election was called, and we never had the meeting.”

Mr Barwell had been housing minister for a year when the election was called.

And he said James Wharton, who was previously the minister responsible for building regulations, had also met with the group.

Mr King said: “He said he would make a statement. That statement has never been made, and it’s continued.

“So we’ve been waiting since 2013 actually, since this was requested to be done.”

He added: “When you’ve got this sort of evidence, you really should be reviewing it.”

Lib Dem Stephen Williams, then a junior DCLG minister, promised in March 2015 that the building regulations would be reviewed in the 2016-17 parliament.

During a debate on Fire Safety, he told MPs: ""Following the Lakanal house fire, to which my hon. Friend referred, the coroner called on the Government to simplify the guidance in approved document B of the building regulations.

""My Department’s Secretary of State committed to a review, which will deliver a revised document in 2016-17; the intention is to simplify the guidance where possible and update and revise the technical content at the same time.

And he specifically responded to calls for sprinklers to be installed in vulnerable blocks.

He said: ""They are recognised as a highly effective fire protection measure. It is too early to say how they will fit into the revised approved document, but he should rest assured that the potential benefits will not be ignored.""

In October last year, Mr Barwell told MPs the government had ""publicly committed"" to reviewing part B of the fire regulations following the Lakanal House fire.

He said: ""We have not set out any formal plans to review the building regulations as a whole, but we have publicly committed ourselves to reviewing part B following the Lakanal House fire."""
Connecticut transgender sprinter Andraya Yearwood wins two state titles,http://usatodayhss.com/2017/connecticut-transgender-sprinter-andraya-yearwood-wins-two-state-titles-amidst-controversy,"The sentiment is universal: Everyone agrees that Andraya Yearwood should be allowed to compete in her chosen races as a girl. After all, she identifies as a girl, trains alongside fellow females and plans to eventually undergo hormone therapy to complete a transition from her male birth gender to female.

RELATED: Transgender freshman in Conn. competes with girls track team for first time

What is much harder to determine, as outlined beautifully in this Hartford Courant piece by Jeff Jacobs, is whether her competing as a girl in the Class M state track and field meet was fair.

Yearwood is a freshman star on the track for Cromwell High School, less than a 30 minute drive from Hartford. More than a week ago she blazed to a double state title victory in the 100 and 200 meters. In the process she vanquished the 200 meter winner from 2016, Stonington junior Sarah Hall, who had to deal with the repercussions of a year of improvement on the track and a step back in her final result relative to other competitors.

“I can’t really say what I want to say, but there’s not much I can do about it,” Hall told Jacobs. “You can’t blame anyone. Her times were slowing during the season. If I ran my best race, I could have won. I didn’t. I hadn’t felt good the last three days, but there are no excuses.

“From what I know she is really nice and that’s all that matters. She’s not rude and obnoxious.”

Befitting that assessment, both Yearwood and her father — an elementary school math teacher and former college football player — have taken the high road whenever they have come under fire for Yearwood’s gender, all while putting Andraya’s on-track success in perspective relative to her life.

“Obviously, I’ve gotten some negative attention but I don’t worry about it much,” Andraya Yearwood told the Courant. “I’ve gotten a lot of good attention for who I am, which is really nice; it helps me with my race.”

Added her father, Rahsaan Yearwood:

“In terms of the fairness aspect, I don’t think about that as a father. I only think about, is my daughter happy, healthy and able to participate in what she wants to do? I don’t care if she wins or loses. I don’t care if she wins and gives the medals back. She got to compete as a girl where she feels she should compete. That’s all that matters to me. … “I think anyone who makes a 15-year-old running in Class M in Connecticut into a bigger story than it needs to be — this is not someone that transitioned as a senior trying to get a scholarship to college,” he said. “This is someone who has been working toward this her whole life. There is a bigger story that has nothing to do with competitive track.”

We can’t encourage you enough to read Jacobs’ entire piece, and to think about it’s larger implications. The state of Connecticut is clearly stuck in a delicate tap dance, and perhaps the most significant takeaway is how well everyone seems to be putting an awkward and potentially explosive situation into broader perspective."
How Russia Targets the U.S. Military,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/12/how-russia-targets-the-us-military-215247,"Ben Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.

In the fall of 2013, Veterans Today, a fringe American news site that also offers former service members help finding jobs and paying medical bills, struck up a new partnership. It began posting content from New Eastern Outlook, a geopolitical journal published by the government-chartered Russian Academy of Sciences, and running headlines like “Ukraine’s Ku Klux Klan — NATO’s New Ally.” As the United States confronted Russian ally Bashar Assad for using chemical weapons against Syrian children this spring, the site trumpeted, “Proof: Turkey Did 2013 Sarin Attack and Did This One Too” and “Exclusive: Trump Apologized to Russia for Syria Attack.”

In recent years, intelligence experts say, Russia has dramatically increased its “active measures” — a form of political warfare that includes disinformation, propaganda and compromising leaders with bribes and blackmail — against the United States. Thus far, congressional committees, law enforcement investigations and press scrutiny have focused on Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin’s successful efforts to disrupt the American political process. But a review of the available evidence and the accounts of Kremlin watchers make clear that the Russian government is using the same playbook against other pillars of American society, foremost among them the military. Experts warn that effort, which has received far less attention, has the potential to hobble the ability of the armed forces to clearly assess Putin’s intentions and effectively counter future Russian aggression.

In addition to propaganda designed to influence service members and veterans, Russian state actors are friending service members on Facebook while posing as attractive young women to gather intelligence and targeting the Twitter accounts of Defense Department employees with highly customized “phishing” attacks. The same Russian military hacking group that breached the Democratic National Committee, “Fancy Bear,” was also responsible for publicly posting stolen Army data online while posing as supporters of the Islamic State in 2015, according to the findings of one cybersecurity firm. And the hacking group’s most common target for phishing attacks in the West has been military personnel, with service members’ spouses making up another prominent target demographic, according to another cybersecurity firm.

While the military and its contractors have long been the targets of cyberattacks from hostile foreign powers, the Russian campaign is noteworthy for its heightened intensity, especially since the imposition of Western economic sanctions following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and for the novel tactics it is employing online. All of it amounts to a new kind of low-intensity or “hybrid” warfare that Western governments are still struggling to effectively counter.

“We are focused on the azalea bushes at the edge of a redwood forest,” said retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, who stepped down last June after three years as supreme allied commander of NATO, where he witnessed a surge in Russian active measures against Baltic states and in efforts to spread negative disinformation about the alliance’s soldiers stationed in Europe.

The active measures campaign has followed Breedlove home and into retirement. In July, emails hacked from his Gmail account were published on the Russian front site DC Leaks, and Breedlove said he was recently targeted with a series of more than a dozen sophisticated phishing emails purporting to come from his bank. Breedlove declined to name his bank but said it is used by the majority of his fellow officers, leading him to conclude the motives of the phishing attack were political rather than financial. “What Russia is doing across the gamut from our internal audiences to military audiences and others,” he said, “is quite astronomical.”

In the 20th century, intelligence agencies looking to build ties with foreign soldiers might have gone through the trouble of sending agents out to watering holes near military bases, waiting for servicemen to show up and gaining their trust one drink at a time.

Now, social media makes it cheap and easy to target soldiers and veterans in their virtual hangouts for intelligence gathering and influence campaigns.

John Bambenek, a threat intelligence manager at Fidelis Cybersecurity, whose work has included investigating the DNC breach, said Russia is one of several foreign powers using social media lures to gather intelligence on the U.S. military. “Some are quite unsophisticated (attractive women sending friend requests), some get more complicated,” he wrote in an email. “Spies understand that a great deal can be discerned about what militaries are up to based on the unclassified behavior of soldiers.”

Forming connections on social media could help foreign states directly communicate with groups of American soldiers, a tactic employed in recent conflicts by both Russia and the U.S. During the first days of the annexation of Crimea, Ukrainian soldiers were bombarded with demoralizing text messages such as, “Soldier you are just a raw meat for your commanders.” Ahead of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. military emailed Iraqi soldiers en masse, encouraging them to surrender, according to Richard Clarke’s 2010 book, “Cyber War.”

The Pentagon is clearly worried. Defense Department spokeswoman Linda Rojas declined to comment on specific activities, but said new technologies have made the military more vulnerable in cyberspace. “The proliferation of internet-based communications and social media applications has elevated the potential for nefarious use that could affect our personnel,” she wrote in an email. Rojas also said the military was working to address the mounting threats posed by hacking and online influence operations. “We make every effort to educate and inform DoD personnel of these threats, while bolstering our network defense capabilities to protect IT infrastructure from outside intrusions,” she wrote.

Becoming Facebook friends with American soldiers also gives foreign agents the ability to post propaganda that will show up on their news feeds.

Serena Moring, a former military contractor from a military family, said she first became concerned about pro-Russian sentiment among soldiers on social media last spring, when an unverified report purporting to relate the story of a Russian soldier who died heroically while fighting ISIS in Syria began circulating among American service members on social media.

“All of the response from the military guys was like, ‘That is awesome. That’s an epic way to die,’” recounted Moring, 39. “It was a very soldier-to-soldier bond that was created through social media.”

Moring said she has become further alarmed as friends of hers in the military, including military intelligence, have become avowed admirers of Putin, and that she now expends considerable effort arguing about Russia on Instagram and Facebook channels geared to military audiences.

In the Wild West of social media, it is difficult to sort out pro-Russian sentiment that is organic—Putin’s approval rating has surged among U.S. Republicans since 2015, and he is often the subject of positive coverage in right-leaning outlets like Fox News—from that which is manufactured. But Breedlove said much of the sentiment is being generated by a concerted Kremlin influence campaign. “People popping up on veterans’ sites and singing the praises of Putin, you can guarantee those are trolls and part of the army that’s sitting over there attacking us every day,” he said.

Putin has made the creation of a pro-Russian “alternative media ecosystem” to, in his words, smash “the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on the information stream” a top priority of his foreign policy. A significant prong of those operations is aimed at the American military community, and the Russian activity has ramped up in recent years as tensions have increased over sanctions, the annexation of Crimea and the expansion of NATO.

Veterans Today is a homegrown American site that was founded in 2003 in opposition to the invasion of Iraq and soon began publishing wild conspiracy theories. Before it partnered with Russia’s New Eastern Outlook in 2013, it had forged ties with Iran’s state-backed PressTV and counted among its editorial board of directors a former head of Pakistan’s intelligence services, publishing headlines like, “Israeli death squads involved in Sandy Hook bloodbath” and “Water Terrorism by India to Overawe Pakistan . ”

New Eastern Outlook “chose to work with VT after following us for a while and seeing us for the unique platform that we are,” Veterans Today managing editor Jim Dean explained in an article about the arrangement. He described it as a “marriage made in heaven.”

A Veterans Today bio for Dean lists several relatives and ancestors who served in the military and describes his membership in several military-themed groups but does not indicate he himself has served. The site’s chairman, Gordon Duff, served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam and began contributing to the site in 2008. In one 2012 interview, he stated, “About 30% of what’s written on Veterans Today, is patently false. About 40% of what I write, is at least purposely, partially false, because if I didn’t write false information I wouldn’t be alive.”

Veterans Today is the flagship property of the “Veterans Today Network,” which includes a jobs board, a cancer foundation and a sister site, Veterans News Now, which describes itself as “an independent online journal representing the positions and providing news for members of the military and veteran community.” The network is also affiliated with the Veterans Housing & Education Foundation, which has the stated goal of raising $500 million in five years.

A form on VeteransTodayCancerFoundation.org, which as of this writing was down for maintenance, invited veterans in need to request help by filling out a form that asked them to submit personal details, including the handles for their social media accounts.

An administrator for the Veterans Today Network who asked that his name not be used said that the jobs board, HireVeterans.com, currently has 35,000 active résumés in its system and that it has partnered with “major companies in the U.S. in helping them find veterans for employment.” The jobs board lists dozens of featured employers — including Bank of America, Merck, Geico and Westinghouse — that according to the administrator have purchased premium annual memberships. A 2011 article by Fox Business recommends the jobs board to employers.

The administrator said that though Veterans Today and the jobs board were both owned by Success Spear, there would be no way for foreign states to access veterans’ personal information via their partnerships with Veterans Today. The administrator said the cancer foundation had not yet fully launched.

In October 2013, at the same time that Veterans Today began publishing content from New Eastern Outlook, its sister site Veterans News Now began publishing content from the Strategic Culture Foundation, a Moscow think tank run by Yuri Profokiev, a former head of Moscow’s Communist Party and member of the Soviet Politburo.

In October 2015, Veterans Today also partnered with a slickly designed, anonymously authored military affairs website called South Front that had been registered in Moscow that April just as Russia was ramping up its influence operations in response to Western sanctions.

Since then, the site has consistently published articles that push the Kremlin party line, both from its Russian partner and its own contributors. Now, in addition to learning about “The Coming Shift to Cosmic Fascism,” readers who cruise to Veterans Today — which has 45,000 Facebook followers and claims more than 900,000 unique visitors per month — to catch up on the news or to check out the free services offered to veterans can read headlines like “Pravda: Ukraine indignant at 80% of Jews in power” and “Trump Humiliated: Syria Shoots Down 34 of 59 Cruise Missiles, Russia to Upgrade System Soon.” Recent contributions from South Front include “U.S. Suffers Reverses as Trump’s Plan to Aid Terrorists is Realized by Russia” and “The Political Uses Of Russophobia.” And recent contributions from New Eastern Outlook include, “If NATO wants peace and stability it should stay home” and “Brussels, NATO and the Globalists in Total Disarray.”

In late 2014, Duff and Dean attended a counterterrorism conference in Damascus at which Duff proclaimed to delegates from Russia, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon his theory that “the U.S. government is subservient to a worldwide criminal organization.” This March, the Veterans Today chairman attended a “VT Reception” in Damascus at which attendees gave speeches flanked by over-sized portraits of Assad and Putin, according to video he published on YouTube. Duff did not respond to a question about whether any foreign entities had been involved in funding his travel to Syria.

A State Department expert in Russian influence campaigns who was not authorized to speak on the record said he had taken note of Veterans Today’s partnership with New Eastern Outlook and that Southfront appears to be a Russian front that deliberately obscures its origins. The expert also described the Strategic Culture Foundation as a part of the Kremlin’s influence apparatus and noted that Russia has long sought to amplify the voices of Western conspiracy theorists.

Kate Starbird, a professor at the University of Washington who has studied the role of Veterans Today in the Russia-aligned “alternative media ecosystem,” described the website as an “active partner” in the dissemination of Russian propaganda.

Despite the often far-fetched claims and clunky feel of Veterans Today and other outlets used by Russian propagandists, Starbird said she has come to consider them potentially potent vehicles for disinformation. “I used to think it, and others like it, were quite fringe,” she said. “But the intentional targeting of U.S. military, active and retired, seems to be a strategy of information war. I have anecdotes from friends, family members and now strangers who tell me about their family members who are deeply engrossed in this information ecosystem.”

Joel Harding, a former Army intelligence officer who now works as independent researcher, describes Veterans Today, Veterans News Now and South Front as “Russian proxy sites.” Harding said that in combination with other components of Russian influence efforts, the sites could successfully influence the military community over the long term. “Veterans Today and Veterans News Now will not cause soldiers, Marines, airmen, or seamen to defect or become pro-Russian, not by themselves,” he said. “But if someone regards them as a reliable source of truthful information, does not recognize that they are pushing Russian propaganda or information with a pro-Russian perspective, over time they will change.”

In an email, representatives of South Front who did not provide their names said the site has no links to the Russian government. They suggested that identifying South Front as part of the Kremlin’s influence apparatus would run contrary to the principles of freedom of speech and be discriminatory against Russians (one common tactic of Russian influence operations is to invoke Western values in their efforts to undermine Western societies). The Strategic Culture Foundation did not respond to messages requesting comment and emails sent to the contact address provided by New Eastern Outlook were rejected by the journal’s web servers.

Dean said he was not aware that researchers had identified Veterans Today as a vehicle for Russian propaganda. “We appreciate the publicity,” he wrote in an email. “Please ask them to keep up the good work.” He did not address a question about whether the site received funding from foreign entities. Debbie Menon, the Dubai-based, recently departed editor-in-chief of Veterans News Now did not respond to an email seeking comment.

In addition to influence operations, military personnel and veterans have been the subject of a disproportionate share of hacking attempts in Russia’s active measures campaign against the United States.

In fact, the Russian military hackers who breached the DNC appear to expend as much effort on current and former military personnel as on political targets. A security oversight by the hacking group, most commonly known as “Fancy Bear,” gave researchers a public window into the targets of thousands of its phishing attempts between March and September of 2015. Of the people targeted by Fancy Bear outside of the former Soviet Union, 41 percent were current or former members of the military, according to a report by cybersecurity firm SecureWorks. Authors and journalists made up 22 percent of Fancy Bear’s targets; NGOs, 10 percent; political activists, 4 percent; and government personnel, 8 percent. Of the journalists and authors targeted, more than one-fifth were spouses of military members who blog about military life.

The posting of hacked data, a novel tactic used in Russia’s assault on the American political system, has also been a component of the country’s active measures against the American military. Last summer, Russian hackers leaked emails stolen from Breedlove in an effort to embarrass NATO. And in 2015, a group calling itself Cyber Caliphate hijacked the Twitter account of the United States Central Command, directing the account’s followers to a site where the group had posted data stolen from the military. Cyber Caliphate purported to be supporters of ISIS, but in fact, this was a “false flag” designed to obscure the true identity of the perpetrator, which was Fancy Bear, according to a report by the Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro that said French authorities confirmed the firm’s own analysis fingering the Russian hacking group.

As Washington comes to terms with the scope of Russian active measures, the hacking campaign against the military continues. Last month, Time reported that American counterintelligence officials concluded in March that Russian hackers were targeting 10,000 Department of Defense employees with highly targeted messages on Twitter designed to trick them into downloading malware that could compromise their Twitter accounts, computers and phones.

While there is no expectation of a “Red Dawn”-style Russian invasion of the United States, the Kremlin’s active measures campaign has the potential to blunt the military’s ability and weaken its resolve to counter future Russian military aggression elsewhere.

The active measures are not targeting the military and political system in isolation, but as part of a broader effort to subvert Western institutions including the news media, financial markets and intelligence agencies. Because of its multidimensional nature and use of unconventional tactics, the U.S. government has struggled to effectively combat the effort. “This is obviously a really difficult challenge and a lot of people are worried that our response to date hasn’t been effective,” said one expert on active measures who recently testified on the issue before Congress.

And rather than abating after the presidential election, these campaigns have only continued to get more brazen, according to Strategic Cyber Ventures CEO Tom Kellermann, who has watched them closely.

In May and June of 2015, Kellermann, who was then the chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, said the firm warned the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that Kremlin hackers had drawn up a list of 2,300 people, comprising the most powerful leaders in Washington and New York along with their spouses and lovers to target with a concerted hacking campaign. Kellermann said he does not know whether the government acted on the tip, which warned that the hackers had the ability to turn on microphones and cameras on the personal devices of their targets to obtain sensitive information about their personal lives. But he believes the campaign has successfully compromised American leaders, emboldening the Kremlin. “When you wonder why certain people act certain ways,” he said, “You have to remember these people have been warned that their dirty laundry could be aired.” (Spokespeople for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI declined to comment.)

Kellermann cited the activities of the Shadow Brokers, a hacking group believed to be Kremlin-backed that began publishing data stolen from the NSA last summer and most recently published a leak in April. The upticks in online attacks are harbingers of armed aggression, said Kellermann, who predicted that conflict between the United States and Russia was most likely to break out in the Baltic region.

“I’m very, very concerned,” he said. “Cyberspace is always the precursor to kinetic reality.”

NYU Accidentally Exposed Military Code-breaking Computer Project to Entire Internet. ?WindsorGreen? was almost certainly intended for use by the Defense Department's signals intelligence wing & the NSA.,https://theintercept.com/2017/05/11/nyu-accidentally-exposed-military-code-breaking-computer-project-to-entire-internet/,"In early December 2016, Adam was doing what he’s always doing, somewhere between hobby and profession: looking for things that are on the internet that shouldn’t be. That week, he came across a server inside New York University’s famed Institute for Mathematics and Advanced Supercomputing, headed by the brilliant Chudnovsky brothers, David and Gregory. The server appeared to be an internet-connected backup drive. But instead of being filled with family photos and spreadsheets, this drive held confidential information on an advanced code-breaking machine that had never before been described in public. Dozens of documents spanning hundreds of pages detailed the project, a joint supercomputing initiative administered by NYU, the Department of Defense, and IBM. And they were available for the entire world to download. The supercomputer described in the trove, “WindsorGreen,” was a system designed to excel at the sort of complex mathematics that underlies encryption, the technology that keeps data private, and almost certainly intended for use by the Defense Department’s signals intelligence wing, the National Security Agency. WindsorGreen was the successor to another password-cracking machine used by the NSA, “WindsorBlue,” which was also documented in the material leaked from NYU and which had been previously described in the Norwegian press thanks to a document provided by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. Both systems were intended for use by the Pentagon and a select few other Western governments, including Canada and Norway. Adam, an American digital security researcher, requested that his real name not be published out of fear of losing his day job. Although he deals constantly with digital carelessness, Adam was nonetheless stunned by what NYU had made available to the world. “The fact that this software, these spec sheets, and all the manuals to go with it were sitting out in the open for anyone to copy is just simply mind blowing,” he said. He described to The Intercept how easy it would have been for someone to obtain the material, which was marked with warnings like “DISTRIBUTION LIMITED TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ONLY,” “REQUESTS FOR THIS DOCUMENT MUST BE REFERRED TO AND APPROVED BY THE DOD,” and “IBM Confidential.” At the time of his discovery, Adam wrote to me in an email: All of this leaky data is courtesy of what I can only assume are misconfigurations in the IMAS (Institute for Mathematics and Advanced Supercomputing) department at NYU. Not even a single username or password separates these files from the public internet right now. It’s absolute insanity. The files were taken down after Adam notified NYU. Intelligence agencies like the NSA hide code-breaking advances like WindsorGreen because their disclosure might accelerate what has become a cryptographic arms race. Encrypting information on a computer used to be a dark art shared between militaries and mathematicians. But advances in cryptography, and rapidly swelling interest in privacy in the wake of Snowden, have helped make encryption tech an effortless, everyday commodity for consumers. Web connections are increasingly shielded using the HTTPS protocol, end-to-end encryption has come to popular chat platforms like WhatsApp, and secure phone calls can now be enabled simply by downloading some software to your device. The average person viewing their checking account online or chatting on iMessage might not realize the mathematical complexity that’s gone into making eavesdropping impractical. The spread of encryption is a good thing — unless you’re the one trying to eavesdrop. Spy shops like the NSA can sometimes thwart encryption by going around it, finding flaws in the way programmers build their apps or taking advantage of improperly configured devices. When that fails, they may try and deduce encryption keys through extraordinarily complex math or repeated guessing. This is where specialized systems like WindsorGreen can give the NSA an edge, particularly when the agency’s targets aren’t aware of just how much code-breaking computing power they’re up against. Adam declined to comment on the specifics of any conversations he might have had with the Department of Defense or IBM. He added that NYU, at the very least, expressed its gratitude to him for notifying it of the leak by mailing him a poster. While he was trying to figure out who exactly the Windsor files belonged to and just how they’d wound up on a completely naked folder on the internet, Adam called David Chudnovsky, the world-renowned mathematician and IMAS co-director at NYU. Reaching Chudnovsky was a cinch, because his entire email outbox, including correspondence with active members of the U.S. military, was for some reason stored on the NYU drive and made publicly available alongside the Windsor documents. According to Adam, Chudnovsky confirmed his knowledge of and the university’s involvement in the supercomputing project; The Intercept was unable to reach Chudnovsky directly to confirm this. The school’s association is also strongly indicated by the fact that David’s brother Gregory, himself an eminent mathematician and professor at NYU, is listed as an author of a 164-page document from the cache describing the capabilities of WindsorGreen in great detail. Although the brothers clearly have ties to WindsorGreen, there is no indication they were responsible for the leak. Indeed, the identity of the person or persons responsible for putting a box filled with military secrets on the public internet remains utterly unclear. An NYU spokesperson would not comment on the university’s relationship with the Department of Defense, IBM, or the Windsor programs in general. When The Intercept initially asked about WindsorGreen the spokesperson seemed unfamiliar with the project, saying they were “unable to find anything that meets your description.” This same spokesperson later added that “no NYU or NYU Tandon system was breached,” referring to the Tandon School of Engineering, which houses the IMAS. This statement is something of a non sequitur, since, according to Adam, the files leaked simply by being exposed to the open internet — none of the material was protected by a username, password, or firewall of any kind, so no “breach” would have been necessary. You can’t kick down a wide open door.

The documents, replete with intricate processor diagrams, lengthy mathematical proofs, and other exhaustive technical schematics, are dated from 2005 to 2012, when WindsorGreen appears to have been in development. Some documents are clearly marked as drafts, with notes that they were to be reviewed again in 2013. Project progress estimates suggest the computer wouldn’t have been ready for use until 2014 at the earliest. All of the documents appear to be proprietary to IBM and not classified by any government agency, although some are stamped with the aforementioned warnings restricting distribution to within the U.S. government. According to one WindsorGreen document, work on the project was restricted to American citizens, with some positions requiring a top-secret security clearance — which as Adam explains, makes the NYU hard drive an even greater blunder: Let’s, just for hypotheticals, say that China found the same exposed NYU lab server that I did and downloaded all the stuff I downloaded. That simple act alone, to a large degree, negates a humongous competitive advantage we thought the U.S. had over other countries when it comes to supercomputing. The only tool Adam used to find the NYU trove was Shodan.io, a website that’s roughly equivalent to Google for internet-connected, and typically unsecured, computers and appliances around the world, famous for turning up everything from baby monitors to farming equipment. Shodan has plenty of constructive technical uses but also serves as a constant reminder that we really ought to stop plugging things into the internet that have no business being there. The WindsorGreen documents are mostly inscrutable to anyone without a Ph.D. in a related field, but they make clear that the computer is the successor to WindsorBlue, a next generation of specialized IBM hardware that would excel at cracking encryption, whose known customers are the U.S. government and its partners. Experts who reviewed the IBM documents said WindsorGreen possesses substantially greater computing power than WindsorBlue, making it particularly adept at compromising encryption and passwords. In an overview of WindsorGreen, the computer is described as a “redesign” centered around an improved version of its processor, known as an “application specific integrated circuit,” or ASIC, a type of chip built to do one task, like mining bitcoin, extremely well, as opposed to being relatively good at accomplishing the wide range of tasks that, say, a typical MacBook would handle. One of the upgrades was to switch the processor to smaller transistors, allowing more circuitry to be crammed into the same area, a change quantified by measuring the reduction in nanometers (nm) between certain chip features. The overview states: The WindsorGreen ASIC is a second-generation redesign of the WindsorBlue ASIC that moves from 90 nm to 32 nm ASIC technology and incorporates performance enhancements based on our experience with WindsorBlue. We expect to achieve at least twice the performance of the WindsorBlue ASIC with half the area, reduced cost, and an objective of half the power. We also expect our system development cost to be only a small fraction of the WindsorBlue development cost because we carry forward intact much of the WindsorBlue infrastructure.

Çetin Kaya Koç is the director of the Koç Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara, which conducts cryptographic research. Koç reviewed the Windsor documents and told The Intercept that he has “not seen anything like [WindsorGreen],” and that “it is beyond what is commercially or academically available.” He added that outside of computational biology applications like complex gene sequencing (which it’s probably safe to say the NSA is not involved in), the only other purpose for such a machine would be code-breaking: “Probably no other problem deserves this much attention to design an expensive computer like this.” Andrew “Bunnie” Huang, a hacker and computer hardware researcher who reviewed the documents at The Intercept’s request, said that WindsorGreen would surpass many of the most powerful code-breaking systems in the world: “My guess is this thing, compared to the TOP500 supercomputers at the time (and probably even today) pretty much wipes the floor with them for anything crypto-related.” Conducting a “cursory inspection of power and performance metrics,” according to Huang, puts WindsorGreen “heads and shoulders above any publicly disclosed capability” on the TOP500, a global ranking of supercomputers. Like all computers that use specialized processors, or ASICs, WindsorGreen appears to be a niche computer that excels at one kind of task but performs miserably at anything else. Still, when it comes to crypto-breaking, Huang believes WindsorGreen would be “many orders of magnitude … ahead of the fastest machines I previously knew of.” But even with expert analysis, no one beyond those who built the thing can be entirely certain of how exactly an agency like the NSA might use WindsorGreen. To get a better sense of why a spy agency would do business with IBM, and how WindsorGreen might evolve into WindsorOrange (or whatever the next generation may be called), it helps to look at documents provided by Snowden that show how WindsorBlue was viewed in the intelligence community. Internal memos from Government Communications Headquarters, the NSA’s British counterpart, show that the agency was interested in purchasing WindsorBlue as part of its High Performance Computing initiative, which sought to help with a major problem: People around the world were getting too good at keeping unwanted eyes out of their data. Under the header “what is it, and why,” one 2012 HPC document explains, “Over the past 18 months, the Password Recovery Service has seen rapidly increasing volumes of encrypted traffic … the use of much greater range of encryption techniques by our targets, and improved sophistication of both the techniques themselves and the passwords targets are using (due to improved OPSec awareness).” Accordingly, GCHQ had begun to “investigate the acquisition of WINDSORBLUE … and, subject to project board approval, the procurement of the infrastructure required to host the a [sic] WINDSORBLUE system at Benhall,” where the organization is headquartered."
Yemeni doctor becomes first-ever winner of women's medical prize,https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/blog/2017/4/21/yemeni-doctor-becomes-first-ever-winner-of-womens-medical-prize,"A Yemeni doctor has won an international medical award for her efforts in combatting neglected tropical diseases in war-torn Yemen.

Forty-nine year-old Dr Dhekra Annuzaili was named as the first-ever winner of the Women in Focus Exceptional Service Award during a ceremony in the Swiss city of Geneva.



She was awarded the prize at the Women in Focus Awards, a celebration of the crucial role played by women in the fight against tropical diseases in Yemen.

""I am thrilled to be the first recipient of this award and I am collecting it on behalf of all of the women working hard to fight NTDs in Yemen. My main aim is to reach children and contribute to the improvement of their overall health,"" Dr Annuzaili said.



""It might sound strange, but I believe I'm lucky to be working in such a difficult field, under difficult conditions. It's completely worth it to see positive improvements in the health of children, students and the community as a whole.""

Having graduated from medical school in 1991, Dr Annuzaili applied her skills to maternal and child health development in Yemen and worked to improve health and nutritional programmes across the country.

She moved on to the field on neglected tropical diseases in 2009.

Hailing from Yemen - the Middle East's most impoverished country and with one of the world's lowest rankings of gender equality - Dr Annuzaili overcame numerous hurdles throughout her career.

Her support has allowed Yemen's National Schistosomiasis Control Program to edge closer to controlling schistosomiasis and intestinal worms.



She also works as an advisor on health and development issues for the United Nations, USAID, World Bank and local NGOs in Yemen."

Meanwhile, another of the king's sons, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, was given one of Saudi Arabia's most important positions, becoming state minister for energy affairs on Sunday.



Eight princes were also given deputy governor posts for cities or regions in Saudi Arabia including Mecca, Medina and Riyadh.



Young blood



Saudi Arabia's ruling al-Saud family have dominated the country's political system since the establishment of the third al-Saud state, with only a few senior roles given to non-royals.





Saudi Arabia has announced that benefits for military personnel and civil servants will be reinstated, as King Salman unveiled a series of royal decree on Sunday.The measures came after Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reviewed the cuts, part of government efforts to curb spending when oil prices tanked in 2014.Mohammed bin Salman reasoned that the overall fiscal situation for Saudi Arabia looks better after two years of austerity and that Riyadh can ease off on some of its austerity measures.""The royal order returns all allowances, financial benefits, and bonuses to civil servants and military staff,"" said the decree, according to Reuters.Riyadh's experiment with austerity saw economic growth slow, after the price of oil went below the $30 a barrel mark early last year.Since then, the price of a barrel has stabilised to around $50 but economists argue that the days of plenty could be over for Saudi Arabia with oil will unlikely to rise significantly in the coming years.Saudi Arabia has unveiled an ambitious diversification programme called Saudi Vision 2030, which Riyadh hopes will see growth in other non-oil sectors.Part of this mission is to see Saudi youth take a bigger role in government and running the economy, while the puritanical vigor of the ulama will be kept in check.This was seen with the announcement of a cabinet shake-up and new roles for young princes in diplomacy and government.One of King Salman's sons, fighter pilot"
Dortmund bus terror arrest: German-Russian man 'carried out attack to affect share price then blamed Muslims',http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/dortmund-bus-terror-arrest-german-russian-share-price-blamed-muslims-islamists-islamic-put-latest-a7694216.html,"Police arrested a German-Russian citizen on Friday morning on suspicion of carrying out the attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus last Tuesday, with prosecutors alleging that the bombing was motivated by financial greed.

The Dortmund team bus was targeted with three bombs after it left a hotel to travel to the Westfalenstadion for the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Monaco. Defender Marc Bartra and a policeman were injured in the blasts, which saw the match postponed until the next day.

Investigators found a letter close to the crime scene that appeared to claim responsibility in the name of Islamist extremists, but German police doubted the authenticity of the note.

Police confirmed on Friday morning that a police tactical response unit had arrested a man named only as 'Sergej W' in the Tuebingen area, 30km south of the city of Stuttgart and 450km south of Dortmund.

He has been charged with attempted murder, causing an explosion and serious bodily harm, police said.

After dismissing the Islamist extremist link, prosecutors accused the man of carrying out the attack in order to gain financially.

The suspect took out a loan of ""several tens of thousands of euros"" days before the attack and bought a large number of so-called put options for shares in Borussia Dortmund.

This would have entitled him to sell the shares at a pre-determined price, even if they fell dramatically in the event of an attack.

""A significant share price drop could have been expected if a player had been seriously injured or even killed as a result of the attack,"" prosecutors said.

It was also confirmed that the suspect had booked into the same hotel as the team, and placed three explosives that were packed with shrapnel along the expected route that the bus would take to Dortmund’s home stadium."
India plans to mine Helium-3 from Moon by 2030 to help meet energy needs.,http://www.livemint.com/Science/W5WjJCdqqxXYpHvrB2TTHP/Isro-plans-to-mine-energy-from-Moon-by-2030-to-help-meet-Ind.html,"New Delhi: From launching 104 satellites at one go, enabling commercial roll out of lithium-ion batteries, to taking the lead in providing energy security, the Indian Space Research Organization (Isro) is firing on all cylinders.

Apart from planning for manned missions to Moon, Mars and even aircraft development, Isro is now working on a plan to help India meet its energy needs from the Moon by 2030.

The premier space agency, credited with launching 225 satellites till date, plans to mine Helium-3 rich lunar dust, generate energy and transport it back to Earth.

This comes in the backdrop of successful testing of lithium-ion batteries developed by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre by the Automotive Research Association of India (Arai). This is expected to provide a fillip to India’s electric vehicles (EV) push. The government is now planning to transfer the technology to companies for commercial production of these batteries, reported Mint.

Isro’s lunar dust mine plans were revealed by Dr Sivathanu Pillai, professor at the space agency, in February.

Speaking at a conference in New Delhi, Pillai, former chief of BrahMos Aerospace, said that mining lunar dust was a priority programme for his organisation.

In a written reply to the Lok Sabha on 29 March, minister of state in charge of atomic energy and space Jitendra Singh said, “Technology is ready for transfer to Indian industries for undertaking the production of Li-ion batteries. BHEL has expressed interest in the transfer of technology.""

This lunar dust mining plan comes in the backdrop of India’s plan to cut down import dependence in hydrocarbons by 10 percentage points by 2022. India’s energy demand growth is expected to outpace that of the other Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries, according to the latest BP Energy Outlook.

Isro’s success on this front will also help reduce pollutants and India’s fuel imports. This assumes significance given India’s energy import bill of around $150 billion, which is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements. India imported 202 million tonnes of oil in 2015-16.

"British Prime Minister Wants Election Now, Before Cost of Brexit Becomes Clear",https://theintercept.com/2017/04/18/british-prime-minister-wants-election-now-cost-brexit-becomes-clear/,"Prime Minister Theresa May , who was actually against Brexit before she was for it, made another dramatic U-turn on Tuesday, declaring that Britain needs to elect a new Parliament in June, three years ahead of schedule, despite her clear promise not to call an election when she campaigned to succeed David Cameron last year.

Her decision to subject Britons to a third national election campaign in just over two years — after the 2015 general election and the referendum on exiting the European Union ten months ago — was met with something less than enthusiasm by many voters.

In her address to the nation, May claimed that a fresh election was necessary to keep opposition parties from obstructing her Conservative government during negotiations over Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. That argument rang hollow, however, given that the opposition Labour Party had just voted for the government’s bill to begin the process of leaving the E.U. and is not campaigning to overturn the results of last year’s referendum.

Separatist leader vows to crack down on opposition ""endangering security of millions"" as vote could boost regime with sweeping new powers — Philip Oltermann (@philipoltermann) April 18, 2017

To most political observers, it was clear that May’s decision was driven by something else: a desire to capitalize on the unprecedented weakness of the Labour Party, which is divided over Brexit, and its own leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and has trailed the Conservatives by up to 21 points in recent polls.

As the writer Robert Harris and the broadcaster James O’Brien suggested, it might also be in May’s own self-interest, and that of her party, to ask the nation for a five-year term now, before the costs of Brexit become apparent.

Although even many die-hard Labour supporters seemed resigned to defeat, some on the left welcomed the chance to vote against what they see as the potentially disastrous policy of a complete break with Europe.

People saying there’s no-one they can vote for. That's what Tories want. Vote for whoever has best chance of defeating the Tory candidate. — David Schneider (@davidschneider) April 18, 2017

Paul Mason, a journalist and filmmaker, suggested that Labour should accept that under Britain’s current electoral system, it can no longer win power alone and should form “a progressive alliance” with other center-left parties, including the Greens, Scottish and Welsh nationalists and, perhaps, Liberal Democrats.

Yes please, Theresa May: call an election now so majority who do not want hard Brexit can stop it. Labour: Progressive Alliance now! — Paul Mason (@paulmasonnews) April 18, 2017

This idea was described in detail last year by Jeremy Gilbert, a professor at the University of East London, who argued that it was nearly impossible to see “Labour winning a parliamentary majority without first completely selling out,” as it had under Tony Blair. “In practice, Gilbert explained on the website Open Democracy, such an alliance “would mean coming to some kind of arrangement with other parties — especially Greens and Liberal Democrats — according to which they and Labour would stand down their candidates in key marginal constituencies in order to give whichever party had the best chance a clear run at beating the Tories.” “Significantly, such a pragmatist strategy would probably mean accepting that Labour is finished in Scotland, and coming to some kind of arrangement with the SNP,” he added. “For now, most Scots don’t want independence — they want radical federalism. But they also want to be represented both in Holyrood and in Westminster by an unambiguously social democratic party. They do not trust Labour to be that party.” While such a strategy seemed in line with the first remarks on the election released by the leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon, it seemed significant that the Labour leader’s statement made no mention of opposing Brexit, the Conservative government’s signature issue and the specter haunting the nation.

Despite the confidence of the bookmakers and pollsters in predicting a Conservative victory in June, not everyone was convinced it would be a rout.

Scientists say the Great Barrier Reef is officially dying,https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-04-18/scientists-say-great-barrier-reef-officially-dying,"In recent years, things have been overwhelmingly bad for the Great Barrier Reef.

Scientists say that one of our world's greatest natural treasures is now truly ""terminal."" This news comes after sequential, massive bleaching events — which is what happens when ocean temperatures rise beyond levels that coral reefs can survive.

Climate change is the primary culprit, and while it's long been suspected that reefs would be devastated by ocean warming, scientists were not expecting this much destruction for another 30 years.

What does this mean for our oceans and the environment? Fabien Cousteau, an aquanaut, environmental advocate and founder of the Fabien Cousteau Ocean Learning Center — and grandson of famed explorer and conservationist Jacques Cousteau — says that the climate-change-related destruction of coral reefs functions as a “canary in the coal mine” for the rest of the planet. (To learn more about the plight of the oceans, check out The Takeaway's related series, ""Trashing the High Seas."")

“They have taken quite a beating, as we’ve seen lately in the news, and unfortunately, that’s not going to stop,” Fabien Cousteau says. “It’s highly alarming.”

The Great Barrier Reef, the only living structure visible from outer space, took hundreds of thousands of years to develop and is home to one of Earth’s most complex ecosystems.

“The stony corals, which is what everyone is focusing on right now, has been quite badly battered and damaged, and there are hundreds of species of hard corals within that ecosystem, some of which resist better than others to climate change,” Cousteau says. “Many of them bleach, unfortunately, for various reasons, including the temperature variations, and that’s what we’re seeing right now.”

Though the Great Barrier Reef is going through an extreme stress event, Cousteau offers cautious hope for the future of this natural wonder.

“Nature is a phenomenal thing,” he says. “Nature has three general rules that it lives by, and adaptation is one of them. Of course, when there are vacancies within those coral reefs, other critters, other organisms, fill those gaps typically. Not necessarily the ones that we’re used [to] or the ones that a coral reef can thrive on, but it is one of those things where space is a premium and a coral reef, being an underwater city, has vacancies, and therefore, other creatures go in there. So, you’ll see a morphing over the years from different species and different colors, but it’s not going to be as complex and rich an ecosystem.”

With the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef and others like it, Cousteau says the world loses “knowledge that we never even had a chance to get to.” However, technology may offer a partial solution for the ocean’s threatened ecosystems: Experimental installations of 3-D printed reefs are now being introduced in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf and Australia.

“Coral is a complex colony, if you will, of animals,” says Cousteau. “Basically, there are two components — the hard structure, and then the residents, which are the zooxanthellae, and those are the polyps; those are what give the coral color. When they’re disrupted, they eject themselves, and that’s when you get the coral bleaching. [With 3-D printing], we’re creating structure, we’re creating the buildings, the infrastructure or the housing, if you will, for those zooxanthellae to come back.”

Additionally, Cousteau says that scientists and conservations are also using hybridization techniques to help coral adapt to the effects of manmade climate change. However, he argues, this isn’t a permanent solution.

“The ‘problem’ of climate change is a very complex one — it comes from a lot of different sources, and most importantly, from our everyday bad habits,” he says. “Doing 3-D coral printing happens to be just a drop in the bucket in addressing a very large global problem. We know where we’re headed if we don’t do anything, so I’m charging full on into it, and I encourage everybody on this planet to do the same so that we can hope for a better world.”

Whistleblower uncovers London police hacking of journalists and protestors,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/04/15/hack-a15.html,"The existence of a secretive unit within London’s Metropolitan Police that uses hacking to illegally access the emails of hundreds of political campaigners and journalists has been revealed. At least two of the journalists work for the Guardian.

Green Party representative in the British House of Lords, Jenny Jones, exposed the unit’s existence in an opinion piece in the Guardian. The facts she revealed are based on a letter written to her by a whistleblower.

The letter reveals that through the hacking, Scotland Yard has illegally accessed the email accounts of activists for many years, and this was possible due to help from “counterparts in India.” The letter alleged that the Metropolitan Police had asked police in India to obtain passwords on their behalf—a job that the Indian police subcontracted out to groups of hackers in India.

The Indian hackers sent back the passwords obtained, which were then used illegally by the unit within the Met to gather information from the emails of those targeted.

The letter was published in part in the Guardian, with its anonymous author writing, “For a number of years the unit had been illegally accessing the email accounts of activists.

“This has largely been accomplished because of the contact that one of the officers had developed with counterparts in India who in turn were using hackers to obtain email passwords.”

The letter continued, “Over the years, the unit had evolved into an organisation that had little respect for the law, no regard for personal privacy, encouraged highly immoral activity and, I believe, is a disgrace.”

As proof of its validity, the letter contained “a list of ten people and the passwords to their email accounts.” As proof that the hacking was directed against spying on political groups and activists, the letter states that four of the ten people work for the environmental group Greenpeace, with one of them in a senior position.

The Bindmans LLP law firm, acting on behalf of Jones, contacted six of those listed to verify their passwords (the others could not be traced). In response, five of the six gave passwords that matched those given in the letter, and the sixth was nearly a match. The BBC noted that one of the 10 activists said “their password may have still been in use as recently as late 2015 or early 2016.”

The Met has claimed such activities were solely aimed at tracking down criminals, even though any evidence obtained through hacking—which is illegal—would not have been admissible in court. Rather, such claims are a cover for a hidden agenda.

Jones writes of the police acting “with impunity.” Exposing her own close relations with the state—while at the same time showing how widespread and intrusive police spying is—Jones writes the following: “The police put me on the domestic extremism database during the decade when I was on the Metropolitan Police Authority signing off their budgets and working closely with officers on the ground to fight crimes such as road crime and illegal trafficking. If someone in my position—no criminal record and on semi-friendly terms with the Met commissioner—can end up on the database, then you can too.”

The Guardian failed to point out in its report that new legislation proposed by the Law Commission would make the author of the anonymous letter, Jones herself, and the journalists at the Guardian, liable for prosecution—with up to 14 years in jail.

The intention to uncover criminal activity by the police could not be used as a defense. It is the aim of the Law Commission’s proposals to prevent whistleblowing activities that reveal the extent of mass surveillance becoming known.

The existence of a group acting illegally within the Metropolitan Police raises several questions that have not been broached by the media:

• When and on whose orders was this group set up? What was the remit of the group?

• Who authorized its use of hackers in India?

• How many people were targeted and for how long? How many of these were journalists?

• Is the group still in operation?

Under existing legislation, hacking—as described by the whistleblower—is unlawful if personal communications were intercepted for any other reason other than to combat major crime or terrorism. The home secretary must approve any such monitoring of personal communications.

The use of illegal hacking by Scotland Yard makes a mockery of the claims made by both the government and the Labour Party that judicial safeguards in the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) can ensure that the police and spy agencies will not misuse the new powers it gives them.

Jones states in her Guardian piece, “Please don’t fall for the old establishment lie that the problem is a few rotten apples. This alleged criminality is the result of a deliberate government policy of using the police and security services to suppress dissent and protest in order to protect company profits and the status quo.”

While true, it is not simply the case that the police and security services are just being used by the government. In fact, the police and security services are becoming emboldened to take a more independent role as direct agencies of the ruling elite, overriding other bodies.

The National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit (NDEDIU), which tracks political activists, illegally shredded documents they had been ordered to preserve over a number of days in May 2014.

This was revealed by another whistleblowing letter to Jones last year, which stated that the shredding began only two months after Theresa May, then Home Secretary, announced the intention to hold the now Pitchford Inquiry into undercover policing.

As a result of the revelation on shredding, in May 2016 the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was called in to investigate. Almost a year later, nothing has been made public by the IPCC of the results of this investigation, other than to confirm that “a large number of documents were shredded over a period of days in May 2014.”

The more recent letter to Jones confirms that shredding had been taking place “for some time… on a far greater scale than the IPCC seems to be aware of.” The police had destroyed the documents because they “reveal[ed] officers were engaged in illegal activities to obtain intelligence on protest groups.”

This illegal hacking and shredding by the police is part of a pattern. It follows the shooting of innocent man Jean Charles de Menezes by an armed police unit in the aftermath 2007 London bombings, the use of undercover officers who took on the names of dead children and formed long-term relationships with people when they were already married, and the use of a plethora of illegal spying methods against millions of people—as exposed by former US National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The law was then changed. The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 put on the statute book the mass surveillance of the UK’s population, previously carried out illegally.

The media in Britain has recently followed the lead of the US media by subjecting people to a daily barrage of propaganda on alleged “Russian hacking,” based on no evidence other than assertions by the intelligence agencies.

Their response, however, to real hacking by the British police, backed up by concrete evidence, has been virtual radio silence, with only two newspapers and the BBC giving the story any coverage at all, which they then dropped from their coverage immediately.

"Theresa May scheduled the general election to distract from expenses scandal, say MPs",http://independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-general-election-expenses-scandal-distract-schedule-mps-tory-party-paul-nuttall-david-a7690106.html?g,"The snap general election Theresa May has called for is a distraction from the Tory expenses scandal, several MPs have claimed.

The allegation comes as Channel 4 News reports that the CPS is considering charges against over 30 individuals.

A string of Conservative MPs and officials could face prosecution over allegations of breaching spending limits in the 2015 general election.

MPs have said Ms May's U-turn decision to call for a general election on 8 June may have been influenced by the scandal.

Several Labour MPs said it could be a factor in why Ms May chose to hold an early election, as any charges would have to be made before the date of the general election.

Ukip leader Paul Nuttall suggested Ms May's election announcement may have been motivated in part to avoid ""the prospect of a slew of Tory-held by-elections caused by the seeming systematic breach of electoral law at the last election, predominantly in places where Ukip were pressing the Conservatives hard"".

However, a Crown Prosecution Service spokesman told the Press Association that the announcement of the snap general election would have no impact on the timing of decisions on whether to press charges.

"A new species of Plesiosaur has been discovered, great success.",http://sci-news.com/paleontology/jucha-squalea-08985.html,"A new genus and species of elasmosaurid plesiosaur has been identified by an international team of paleontologists led by Dr. Valentin Fischer from the Evolution & Diversity Dynamics Lab at the Université de Liège.

Jucha squalea swam the world’s oceans during the Early Cretaceous epoch, approximately 130 million years ago.

This marine reptile belongs to Elasmosauridae, a family of plesiosaurs characterized by extremely long necks and slim bodies.

“Plesiosaurian marine reptiles evolved a wide range of body shapes during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, including long-necked forms,” Dr. Fischer and colleagues wrote in their paper.

“Many Late Cretaceous members of the Elasmosauridae clade epitomized this part of the plesiosaurian morphological spectrum by evolving extremely long necks through somitogenesis (resulting in an increase in the number of cervical centra) and differential growth (resulting in the elongation of cervical centra).”

“However, the early evolution of elasmosaurids remains poorly understood because of a generally poor Lower Cretaceous fossil record.”

The partial skeleton of a mature individual of Jucha squalea was unearthed in 2007 in the vicinity of the Slantsevy Rudnik village near Ulyanovsk in Eastern Europe.

“Jucha squalea represents one of the geologically oldest occurrences of elasmosaurids,” the paleontologists wrote.

“It lacks a series of features that otherwise characterize the group, such as the pectoral bar and the heart-shaped intercoracoid fenestra, and thus documents some of the earliest stages of the elasmosaurid radiation.”

“Jucha squalea marks an early attempt at cervical elongation in elasmosaurids via differential growth, possessing anterior cervical centra that are much more elongated than those of other early xenopsarians,” they added.

“The cervical shape values we gathered suggest that elasmosaurids underwent multiple episodes of cervical shortening, notably during the Early Cretaceous.”

The team’s paper was published online in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.

"Watching nature on TV can boost wellbeing, finds new study. Watching high quality nature programmes on TV can uplift people's moods, reduce negative emotions, and help alleviate the kind of boredom associated with being isolated indoors, according to a new study.",http://exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_821333_en.html,"Watching nature on TV can boost wellbeing, finds new study

Watching high quality nature programmes on TV can uplift people’s moods, reduce negative emotions, and help alleviate the kind of boredom associated with being isolated indoors, according to a new study published today in the Journal of Environmental Psychology.

The research has also shown that experiencing nature in virtual reality could have even larger benefits, boosting positive feelings and increasing people’s connection to the natural world.

Under laboratory conditions, researchers from the University of Exeter first induced feelings of boredom in 96 participants by asking them to watch a video in which a person describes their work at an office supply company. They then experienced scenes of an underwater coral reef in one of three different ways: on TV; in a VR headset using 360o video; and in a VR headset using computer generated interactive graphics.

The team found that all viewing methods minimised negative feelings such as sadness, as well as significantly reducing boredom. However, only the interactive virtual reality experience led to increases in positive feelings, such as happiness, and strengthened how connected people felt to nature.

Nicky Yeo, lead researcher on the study, believes the findings could have important implications for populations facing extended periods at home. She said:

“Our results show that simply watching nature on TV can help to lift people’s mood and combat boredom. With people around the world facing limited access to outdoor environments because of COVID-19 quarantines, this study suggests that nature programmes might offer an accessible way for populations to benefit from a ‘dose’ of digital nature.”

The team worked with the BBC Natural History Unit to create their experimental conditions, which featured several scenes from the Blue Planet II series, including unseen 360o footage. Their findings support initiatives seeking to bring the therapeutic potential of nature to people at home, such as BBC Four’s recent Mindful Escapes series.

Dr Mathew White, co-author of the study, said:

“We’re particularly excited by the additional benefits immersive experiences of nature might provide. Virtual reality could help us to boost the wellbeing of people who can’t readily access the natural world, such as those in hospital or in long term care. But it might also help to encourage a deeper connection to nature in healthy populations, a mechanism which can foster more pro-environmental behaviours and prompt people to protect and preserve nature in the real world.”

A Turtle With a Permanent Smile Was Brought Back From Near Extinction,http://nyti.ms/350whjK,"Conservationists are not known for delivering a lot of good news. But in the Burmese roofed turtle — a giant Asian river turtle whose bug-eyed face is naturally set in a goofy grin — they have cause for celebration. Just 20 years ago, the species was presumed extinct. But after rediscovering a handful of surviving animals, scientists have grown the population to nearly 1,000 animals in captivity, some of which have been successfully released into the wild in Myanmar over the past five years.

“We came so close to losing them,” said Steven G. Platt, a herpetologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society. “If we didn’t intervene when we did, this turtle would have just been gone.”

Turtles and tortoises face one of the highest extinction risks of any animal group, with more than half the planet’s 360 species listed as threatened. The crisis is most acute for Asian species, which are pummeled by both habitat loss and high levels of hunting for food, medicine and the pet trade.

The Burmese roofed turtle is among the species that has faced this toll. The turtles once basked in the hundreds at the mouth of the Irrawaddy river south of Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, with a range stretching all the way to Bhamo in the country’s north. Females — which grow significantly larger than males — can exceed the size of a steering wheel, while males undergo a dramatic breeding-season color transformation that causes their usually green heads to turn a bright chartreuse-yellow with bold black markings."

Max Verstappen wins 70th Anniversary GP. Max Verstappen wins 70th Anniversary Grand Prix for Red Bull ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton,https://bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/53714557,"Red Bull's Max Verstappen took a sensational surprise victory in the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix to bring Mercedes' domination to an end.

Verstappen's win was founded on his car being kinder to its tyres than the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas and the Dutchman capitalised brilliantly.

Hamilton fought back from early struggles to catch and pass Bottas for second place with two laps to go.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was outstanding in taking fourth on a one-stop strategy.

It was an unexpectedly thrilling race, a fitting testament to the occasion as F1 celebrated 70 years since the F1 championship started at Silverstone in 1950.

Verstappen's victory was a major upset and it was helped by a decision to use the hard tyres for the start of the race.

But the fact was that their car was simply faster than the Mercedes for the first time this season in the specific conditions created by the deliberate supply of a soft tyre range on a warm day around one of the most demanding tracks on the calendar.

""I didn't see that coming,"" Verstappen said afterwards.

How did Verstappen do it?

Verstappen told his engineer he was not going to sit back behind the Mercedes ""like a grandma""

The Mercedes had produced their usual dominant performance in qualifying, a second clear of the field, but Verstappen, choosing the hardest tyre for the start of the race, found he was able to follow them comfortably after he passed Racing Point's Nico Hulkenberg at the start from his fourth place on the grid.

Bottas led Hamilton away from pole and, while Verstappen tracked the Mercedes, the black cars, on the softer 'medium' tyres at the start, began to struggle.

By 10 laps into the race, the Red Bull was on Hamilton's tail and it was clear the Mercedes had a real race on their hands.

Bottas and Hamilton stopped within a lap of each other on laps 13 and 14, and fitted the hard tyres, but they continued to struggle.

Verstappen motored on out front and, surprisingly, despite older tyres, extended his lead as the Mercedes ran into problems with tyre blistering.

Verstappen pitted on lap 26 for medium tyres, rejoining right behind Bottas, whom he passed immediately around the outside of Luffield corner.

Once back in the lead, Verstappen was again able to hold the Mercedes, with Bottas about two seconds behind.

Red Bull's call to start Verstappen on the hard tyres paid off

Verstappen then stopped again six laps later to switch back to the hard tyre, and Bottas followed him in, the Finn's hopes of victory now over.

Hamilton, though, stayed out for another nine laps. His tyres were blistered badly but he drove well to maintain a gap of around 10 seconds over Verstappen and Bottas.

That meant when he finally came in on lap 41, with 11 to go, he had an abundance of grip compared to the cars in front.

He quickly passed Leclerc and then closed in on Bottas, passing him into Brooklands corner with two laps to go.

The result, with fastest lap for Hamilton, means he extends his championship lead over Bottas to 34 points, and Verstappen has slipped ahead of the Finn into second place, 30 behind the leader.

How about that from Leclerc?

Leclerc took a superb third in the uncompetitive Ferrari last weekend at the British Grand Prix and he continued his excellent form this weekend.

Qualifying did not go so well for the 22-year-old - he could manage only eighth on the grid compared to fourth last time, but his race drive was every bit as good.

The Ferrari was running low downforce to try to off-set its straight-line speed disadvantage, so to make a one-stop strategy work was a remarkable achievement.

In contrast to Leclerc's race, Vettel was sent spinning across the track on the opening lap after hitting the curb

His team-mate Sebastian Vettel had a difficult day, almost losing control of his car at the first corner and lucky not to be tagged as he fish-tailed left and right in yet another unforced error from the German, and struggling to 12th place.

Red Bull's Alex Albon drove well to take fifth, a drive that featured a number of bold overtaking moves, ahead of the Racing Points of Lance Stroll and Hulkenberg.

Renault's Daniel Ricciardo faded after a strong qualifying in fifth place, not helped by a spin between Turns Three and Four while battling with McLaren's Carlos Sainz, and ended up 14th.

Lando Norris took ninth for McLaren, while George Russell was 18th in the Williams.

Driver of the day

A tie between Verstappen and Leclerc, each outstanding in their way, the two emerging as the defining talents of the new generation behind Hamilton

What happens next?

Another weekend, another race. This time in Spain, despite the rise in coronavirus cases there. A hot summer in Barcelona. Could Mercedes struggle again?

What they said

Max Verstappen: ""I didn't see it coming, but after the first stint we seemed really good on tyres and we didn't have many tyres issues at all. It is a great result to win here and I am incredibly happy. We have not had an opportunity to push them so far this season. We need to use soft tyres - that seems to suit our car.""

Lewis Hamilton: ""It was a massive challenge today but congrats to Red Bull and Max, they didn't have the problems we had. Unexpected to have blistering as hardcore as we experienced. I was managing the tyres like you couldn't believe. In the middle stint, one half was bald and the other half was OK. I was afraid it was going to explode.""

Valtteri Bottas: ""It was very frustrating - starting on pole and finishing third. As a team we were sleeping at some points, Red Bull's strategy was far better and we have to look at this. There was a chance to keep up with Max, but as soon as I pushed the tyres fall apart. When you have those blisters, you lose cornering grip.""

Mercedes had won all four of the opening races before Verstappen's 70th Anniversary GP victory

Israel vs. Covid-19: Part one

Israel had reason to approach the Covid-19 crisis with a certain amount of optimism. For one, it is a small country with less than 10 million citizens. It is also a youthful country, with a median citizen age of 30.5 years. Israel is also vastly experienced in emergencies. It has a world-class public health system, despite a below-average number of doctors, nurses, and beds.

It is an island — not geographically, but practically — mostly surrounded by countries that hold no diplomatic relations with it and offer no form of passage. Israel’s only entrance gate is one international airport: Ben-Gurion in Tel-Aviv. This one entrance is relatively easy to control.

The Israeli government recognized the danger of Covid-19 early on. In late January, Israel initiated an entry ban to Chinese citizens, a move that the Chinese ambassador compared to the rejection of Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. During late February and the beginning of March, the virus reached Israel by way of citizens who reentered the country from abroad. Swift action was taken to curb this impact. Every person entering the country was put in mandatory quarantine for 14 days.

Later, the government even financed and repurposed hotels into designated quarantine zones for Israeli citizens returning home. Each diagnosed person was numbered and a full report as to their whereabouts was published. Israelis even joked that one should pay close attention to the places one visits in case it all becomes public due to a positive test result.

For a moment, it appeared that Israel’s fight against Covid-19 might end with a clear victory.

There was one place where the Israeli government notably hesitated. While banning entry to many foreigners, the choice to ban U.S. citizens was debated and delayed. Those in favor of such a ban were concerned this move might harm Israel’s political and economic ties with the U.S. Eventually, it was decided to ban all foreigners from entering Israel. It was later reported that much of the virus spreading in Israel was likely due to Americans coming into the country.

The warnings by Israeli experts and health officials as to the dire risks of Covid-19 were harsh. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even went so far as to say that 10,000 Israelis might die, and 1 million could get sick. Officials regularly warned Israelis of reaching the same situation as seen in Italy, Spain, New York, and Brazil.

From mid-March onward, shops and schools were closed, all cultural events were canceled, and people weren’t allowed to move more than 100 meters (328 feet) from their homes. More ventilators were purchased, and special coronavirus units were established in the hospitals. During the major holidays, Passover and independence day, a total lockdown was announced. The Israeli government even made the tough and emotionally complex decision to ask families of fallen soldiers not to visit the graves of their loved ones on Memorial Day.

While there were a few glitches and mistakes along the way, Israel largely handled the pandemic well. The number of new daily cases started dwindling and then dropping steadily from early April through late May. Source: Our World in Data

For a moment, it appeared that Israel’s fight against Covid-19 might end with a clear victory. Prime Minister Netanyahu was invited to take part in an online conference with six other leaders of countries who managed to control the outbreak. Israel was proclaimed a success story of international proportions.

The “Preemptive Medicine Paradox” in action

At its peak, Israel saw hundreds of new cases every day — yet this did not translate to a flood of hospital admissions, critical patients, or deaths. In mid-May, Israel reported 268 confirmed deaths from Covid-19, one of the lowest deaths per 100,000 population ratios in the world. The number of recoveries was constantly outpacing the number of new cases. The number of critically ill who needed respiratory support was, at that time, fewer than 30.

There is no doubt, or at least there shouldn’t be, that the extreme measures taken by the Israeli government were at least somewhat responsible for the initial behavior of the virus. Yet, some claim otherwise. Most notably, Professor Yoram Lass, a former director of the Israeli health ministry, said at a very early stage of the outbreak that “Covid-19 is nothing but a publicized flu.” There were others like him. Once the peak was over, and numbers did not match the initial alarming predictions, Lass’ view increased in popularity. Israel’s win over Covid-19 was so impressive, so clear, and unequivocal — the logic went — that people started believing the disease wasn’t all it was alleged to be.

Israelis saw what the virus had done to other countries, but those who held the belief that the response to Covid-19 was more a matter of hysteria than a true need rationalized it with a few theories. Among the theories was that the virus has a natural expiry date. Some concluded that the virus impacted the Middle East differently and that we shouldn’t compare Israel to European countries. Some experts said that the lockdown was unnecessary and that the Israeli health system could have handled an outbreak. As the effects of the lockdown became more and more apparent, and people started to realize the huge economic implications, more Israelis tended to agree that the cost was higher than the gain.

Problems with politics

The Covid-19 response has not been a solely health-centered debate in Israel. It quickly turned political as well. The international crisis emerged during an unprecedented Israeli political crisis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the midst of a rivalry with Benny Gantz, the former IDF chief and a newcomer to the Israeli political scene. Two election campaigns couldn’t bring about a decisive vote, and neither of the two men managed to form a government. The third election cycle in the same year was held at the peak of the outbreak.

The leadership situation has turned Israel into a politically divided country. During the first wave of the pandemic, Netanyahu led the country as the head of a transition government. Without a clear mandate, with a pending corruption trial, and a growing protest, the political debate about whether or not he is even morally entitled to lead the crisis started to overshadow the pandemic, which was by then shrinking.

The fact that the Israeli president, the PM, some ministers, and members of Parliament, were caught acting against lockdown rules didn’t help build the public’s trust. Furthermore, the financial aid measures offered to business owners and workers were slim compared to other countries, and so many Israelis started pressuring the government to remove lockdown restrictions.

Finally, due to the major health and financial crisis, Netanyahu and Gantz agreed to form a unity government and created the largest, most expensive government Israel had ever seen. Seeing that the emergency unity government was dealing more with politics than health or economic issues, the public’s trust and willingness to cooperate with its representatives came crashing down.

The political climate, the extreme protection measures, the relatively low rates of morbidity, and a few experts claiming the reaction to the outbreak was mainly a form of hysteria, all made Israelis doubt the true severity of the situation.

Israel’s win over Covid-19 was so impressive, so clear, and unequivocal — the logic went — that people started believing the disease wasn’t all it was alleged to be.

Israel vs. Covid-19: Part two

At the beginning of May, the two crises Israel was facing came to a simultaneous end. The political tangle ended with the new unity government, and so did the first Covid-19 wave. A press conference held by the prime minister felt more like a victory celebration, and many Israelis got the wrong impression that the risk of the pandemic was a thing of the past.

A few weeks later, Israel officially reopened. Most of the restrictions were lifted; schools were opened and shops, restaurants, and bars resumed services. “We received a lot of joyful news today,” said Prime Minister Netanyahu. “Drink a cup of coffee and a beer too. Go out and have fun.”

The preemptive action paradox appeared to be coloring the perspective of Israel’s leadership, as they fell prey to the idea that the relatively good outcome now meant the initial preventive measures were not needed then.

During the two months of lockdown, and the decrease in morbidity, no major long-term Covid-19 plan was formulated. Moreover, no useful test and trace method was organized. Lately, Israel has resorted again to the highly controversial tracing services of the national internal security agency, a measure usually operated to fight terrorism.

Today, Israel is performing many Covid-19 tests. It has one of the highest tests per 1 million population rates in the world, and yet the diagnostics process is too slow — sometimes requiring four to five days to obtain results. No real epidemiologic inquiry center has been created. Currently, 27 nurses who specialize in epidemiology and 200 “regular” nurses are responsible for tracing the behavior of those infected, noting their movements, and informing potential at-risk people who came in close contact with those infected. At present, the prevention and education efforts are too few, and they aren’t working.

The situation appears to now be out of hand. On July 18, 1,906 new daily cases were diagnosed, the second-highest figure since the beginning of the outbreak. Just a few days earlier, on July 13, 1,962 cases were diagnosed. It is true that Israel is testing more — including people who do not show symptoms. However, the geographical spread of the infected, the percentage of positive results, and the fact that it is currently impossible to identify the source of many infections have made health officials declare the situation out of control. The number of critical cases is gradually rising, and the number of dead is slowly climbing too. Israel is now considered a “red country” in the EU, meaning its citizens are barred from free entry. With numbers still on the rise, the Israeli government introduced a new round of old restrictions including the closure of bars, event halls, and gyms. High ranking officials, among them Netanyahu himself, are publicly warning of another full lockdown.

The case of Israel should be a lesson to all. The coronavirus is a tough opponent. Ultimate victory is not achieved by a knockout. This fight is long and complicated with many wins and losses. Sometimes the predictions are alarming, and sometimes they do not fully come true. And yet, this doesn’t mean that the threat isn’t real — or that we can go on living as we did before."
This article actually made me feel better about the situation in the US. The fact that he was released and able to report as to what happened gives me hope reason will prevail. I guess we'll find out soon.,http://independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/journalist-arrest-seattle-chaz-protest-police-prison-black-lives-matter-a9606846.html,"Seattle’s protest in support of Black Lives Matter was established just days after the killing of George Floyd. To the participants and their supporters, the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) was a living experiment in how a community might exist without police. To their detractors, most vocally Donald Trump, who denounced them as anarchists and terrorists, the protesters and the six city blocks they had been ceded were proof of liberals gone mad. It was quirky and it was controversial.

For a month, as demonstrators marched in cities around the world, demanding racial justice and the defunding of police departments, Seattle’s protesters existed in an uneasy half-life, partly tolerated by a mayor keen to avoid more violence, and despised by those who thought the police had been wrong to abandon the area.

Then, on July 1, the city decided the experiment was over. It was time to clear the protesters.

How badly did Seattle need to retake those streets? Enough to arrest a journalist covering the operation?

Were the authorities so deaf to what protesters had been saying about police overreach and use of excessive force they were prepared to shackle that reporter, charge him with “failure to disperse” and then assault him?

Were they so oblivious to how jails across the nation had become hotspots for coronavirus they would put that person in a dirty, overcrowded cell where efforts to counter the disease were minimal?

Apparently so.

As police swept through Cal Anderson Park and the streets around it, officers with long sticks, backed up by armoured vehicles, were retaking the buildings of the East Precinct. They arrested dozens of people. I was among them.

“Enough is enough,” Seattle Police Department (SPD) chief Carmen Best said later that day. “Our job is to protect and to serve the community, our job is to support peaceful demonstrations, but what has happened here… is lawless and… brutal.”

City officials may have had good cause to retake the area “ceded” last month by mayor Jenny Durkan in an attempt to defuse protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd. While days in the zone had been overwhelmingly peaceful, at night there had been a number of criminal incidents, including six shootings, two of them fatal, with one of those deaths being of a 16-year-old. But the way the officers went about it, wielding sticks and mace, pressing people’s faces into the streets as they forced their hands into handcuffs, appeared heavy-handed at least.

Given how police from Washington DC to Minneapolis had dealt with protesters this spring, with tear gas, riot shields and rubber bullets, it may have been naive to think Seattle would be different. In comparison to the police in other cities, perhaps the SPD went easy.

It did not feel that way. Five minutes after having arrived in the park, dispatched by my editors to cover the police operation and speak to protesters, I was arrested at its northern edge by an officer standing on a slight rise and behind black and yellow tape that read “Police line – Do not cross”. I was the other side of that tape. I did not cross it. At no point did I try to cross the police line.

The officer told me the park was out of bounds, and I needed to step back. I held up my State Department-issued press badge and told him I wanted to get some photographs of what was happening.

The officer again told me to retreat and said he was going to arrest me if I did not. I again told him I was a member of the media and intended to stay and do my work. He then grabbed me and marched me towards several of his colleagues, who pinned my hands behind my back.

All the officers were armed, one with an automatic rifle, a detail that may shock readers from nations whose police forces are not kitted out routinely with such a degree of weaponry, but not anyone in the US, where police departments are massively militarised.

The officers took my phone, and told me I was under arrest. I requested several times that they tell me what I was being charged with, and read me my rights. They told me I had the “right to remain silent”, but were unable or unwilling to tell me the charge.

They then handcuffed me, shackled my ankles and loaded me into a van. The police van set off to the West Precinct, stopping to collect arrested protesters. One man spent the journey shouting “Black Lives Matter”; a woman sobbed.

At the precinct, I again informed people I was a journalist, and asked to call my lawyer, my editor and the British embassy. I asked them to contact my local congresswoman. They took my photograph and told me I was being charged with “failure to disperse”, a Seattle municipal code that requires the accused to have been part of a group of four or more. I had been standing by myself.

The maximum penalty is 364 days in jail and a fine of $5,000. Journalists are largely exempt from the law. “No such order shall apply to a news reporter or other person observing or recording the events on behalf of the public press or other news media, unless he is physically obstructing lawful efforts by such officer to disperse the group,” says the code.

After an hour in a holding cell, the handcuffs still on, somebody again put leg irons around my ankles, and connected the two with a piece of chain pulled tight around my stomach. Were we heading to Guantanamo Bay? A woman also under arrest kept saying she did not speak English and requested a Navajo translator. “I think you speak English just fine,” mocked one officer.

In the van, the woman insisted on lying lengthways in the compartment she was in. I was squeezed into a tiny, claustrophobic section, perched on a narrow bench, trying not to slip off as the van sped through the city’s boarded-up downtown, towards the jail. By this point, the so-called “belly chain” had become so tight I could not fully exhale. It felt obscene and preposterous to have to inform the officers I could not properly breathe, that phrase having become weighted with such power and resonance during the Black Lives Matter movement, echoing the gut-wrenching final words of George Floyd. But that was the situation. I could not properly breathe.

One of the officers responded: “If you can speak, you can breathe.”

More prisoners than any other nation

The United States arrests and incarcerates more people than any other country.

The Brennan Centre’s Lauren-Brooke Eisen said while it accounts for 5 per cent of the world’s population, America is home to 25 per cent of those incarcerated, around 2.2 million. Around 95 per cent are in jail for non-violent offences.

There are more than 6,000 jails and prisons, at local, state and federal level, along with immigration detention facilities. People of colour are vastly over-represented, accounting for 32 per cent of the population but 56 per cent of prisoners. (My presence contributed to the white population of jails.)

Many say the system is broken. Others suggest the system may be in need of reform but that it does precisely what it was intended to do – namely to repress black and brown Americans, and the poor. Historians such as Carol Anderson, professor of African American studies at Emory University and author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, trace a direct line through the end of slavery to the establishment of the Jim Crow era and the current criminal justice system.

In her book, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, Michelle Alexander says today’s system, large parts of it privatised, overtly targets black men and decimates black communities. “In each generation, new tactics have been used for achieving the same goals – goals shared by the founding fathers,” she writes. “Denying African Americans citizenship was deemed essential to the formation of the original union. Hundreds of years later, America is still not an egalitarian democracy.”

He just yanked you down and threw you back in your cell

Both the SPD and King County, which operates the Seattle jail where I found myself, have long been a part of that system. As recently as 2011, the Department of Justice accused the SPD of racial bias and use of excessive force. The appointment of Carmen Best, who is African American, as its chief in 2018 was part of an undertaking to reform.

King County, which has its own police force, has a similar record of disproportionate arrest and detention of black and indigenous people. One issue repeatedly pointed out by activists is the large number black and brown youths locked up. A report from 2016 showed half of youths in detention were black, whereas the black population of the county was 13 per cent.

‘Get back in the cell. You’ve lost your chance’

Seattle’s jail is located on 5th Avenue, a short distance from the waters of Elliott Bay. The area is known as the first place occupied by white settlers, in 1850, though for many centuries before it was home to indigenous Duwamish people.

By the time I arrived, the processing area was crowded with protesters rounded up that morning. I assumed that once jail officials had been informed I was a reporter, I’d simply be let go. At the West Precinct station I spotted several FBI officers who appeared to have been part of the operation. I yelled to them that I was a reporter. The First Amendment, guaranteeing the freedom of the press, is, after all, a federal issue, a constitutional right. I could not hear their entire response but they seemed to indicate the SPD were handling matters.

Momentarily, it appeared the situation was about to improve. The shackles and handcuffs were removed, but only so I could be ordered to remove all my clothes, and put on a blood-red prison “uniform” of trousers and jacket, and orange flip-flops. I protested this and protested too the demand I hand over my wedding ring. (One official said it could be stolen from me by another prisoner.)

In the end, I was permitted to keep the ring, but forced to wear the red outfit. Its impact was startling; immediately I felt out of place, disorientated and disempowered. It even started to make me feel guilty, as if I had done something wrong.

This, surely, was the purpose of treating the protesters in much the same manner as if they had been charged with armed robbery. The aggression displayed by police and prison guards was surely intentional, part punishment and part deterrent, even for individuals charged with minor crimes, and none of them yet tried or found guilty. Also disorientating was the absence of clocks, just as in casinos, and surely equally intended so that people lose track of time.

Before being allowed to use the phone, an officer needed to re-enter my details. I was called out of the holding cell, told to stand before a desk and spell my name. The officer could not hear me, so I explained it may have been my accent (I am British). For reasons that were unclear, the woman took offence. “Get back in the cell. You’ve lost your chance. You’re being condescending.”

Seattle police clear 'CHOP' protest zone

I tried again to spell my name but they were having none of it. Out of nowhere, a male prison guard leapt at me from behind, yanked hard on the collar of my jacket, pulling it with sufficient force into my throat to make me gasp. He then manhandled me into the cell. I made a note of the man’s name, along with several officers who witnessed what he did.

A 53-year-old protester, Gina Hicks, saw what happened. “There was no attempt to have a conversation with you,” she later told me. “He just yanked you down and threw you back in the cell.”

‘Just keep your mask on and you’ll be fine’

Pasted on to the glass of every cell was information issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on how best to avoid contracting coronavirus. It talked about social distancing, frequent washing of hands with soap, and wearing a mask.

The only option to wash my hands during the six or seven hours I spent in the jail was to use the drinking fountain, situated above the toilet, itself located behind a low brick wall that offered no privacy. The toilet was filthy, the room stank, one protester became ill and vomited in it. I requested some soap, and asked one of the officers what was the capacity for the cell.

What did I mean? Well, you know, you have signs about avoiding the coronavirus and yet there are 10 men in here, barely a foot apart. What is the capacity?

I had a similar conversation with a nurse from King County health department, an agency that has performed dogged work to counter the spread of coronavirus in Washington state, where the first case of Covid-19 in the US was reported in late January. The nurses were required to perform a basic medical on each of the people arrested.

She asked if I felt suicidal. Mental health is a major problem here, she said. I said I was most concerned about becoming dehydrated, having been told the only drinking water available was from that tap, from which I refused to drink, and getting infected with Covid. (She let me drink as many cups of water as I needed from the far more sanitary sink in the medical room.)

The fear of being infected is not paranoia. Eric Reinhart, a social anthropologist who teaches at Harvard, has studied how the constant arresting and processing of people for minor charges has acted to further spread the disease. Many jails, including Rikers Island in New York, and San Quentin in San Francisco, have been hotspots.

In 30 years as a journalist, this was the third time I had been detained. The first was in Cuba, the second in Pakistan, outside Bin Laden’s compound

Like many experts, he has called for the release of offenders charged with minor crimes, as a short-term fix.

Examining data from Chicago’s Cook County jail, which started testing new arrivals earlier this spring, Reinhart found one in six of all cases of Covid-19 in Chicago and the state of Illinois was linked to people jailed and released from this one establishment. He and a colleague, Daniel Chen, calculated that for each person cycled through the jail, an additional 2.1 infections were reported in that individual’s neighbourhood within a month. Around 60 per cent were in black-majority ZIP codes.

“This association between jail cycling and community spread of Covid-19 is particularly strong in communities of colour,” he told me.

Yet, Reinhart said, the focus on the overcrowded and unsanitary nature of prisons distracted from a broader truth about the racist underpinnings of the criminal justice system.

“There’s no other country that believes it’s necessary to arrest and incarcerate as many people as the US does. And it’s clear this does not produce more effective deterrence,” he said. He estimated the high arrest rate had added thousands of Covid deaths to the total of more than 130,000.

He said there was “an exceptional historical opportunity to make clear to Americans who may have been resistant to recognising the problems in their criminal justice system”.

‘Take your hands out or I will punch you in the head’

After several hours, my feelings of bewilderment and anger were replaced by journalistic curiosity. Without intending to, Seattle’s law enforcement machine had provided with me with a rare insight into its workings. It was a brief, partial window into a criminal justice system seemingly bereft of humanity or equity: not for one second do I think what happened to me is comparable to the abuses enacted in this nation every moment on people without my white-skinned, press-badge privilege. Yet had I been allowed to remain in Cal Anderson Park and cover the police operation, I would not have seen or experienced what I did.

There was a tiny piece of pencil in the cell and I used it to make copious notes on scraps of paper. Among those in the cell was a young African American man called Kai. He had been at the protest site for 30 days and was arrested that morning. He said officers had kneeled on his back as they did so.

He also said he had been threatened by a female jail official, who told him to take his hands out of his trousers or she would “punch him in the head”.

When she came into our cell, another protester asked her if it was true she had threatened Kai. “That’s right, I did,” she replied. They asked for her badge number. A moment later she reappeared with a Post-It note, on which she had written her name and badge number with a smiley face. It felt like a flagrant display of swagger. Here, take my badge number. There’s nothing you can do to me.

Like everyone else, Kai had been charged with a minor offence, failure to disperse. Another man, Josh, 29, had not even been at the protest but was detained when he set off to get food from a local restaurant and turned the wrong corner.

25% of people incarcerated globally are in the US

He was charged with “pedestrian obstruction”. Another man, Daniel, who had been chanting “Black Lives Matter” in the prison van, was arrested in his car and charged with “vehicular obstruction”.

All were minor offences, so-called misdemeanours, for which bail was available, especially if you had no criminal history. The most serious charge I heard of that day was one handed to a man known as Trumpeter, whom I had seen at the protests a month earlier playing a guitar. He had been charged with “malicious mischief”, a more serious charge, for which he had been told he could not receive bail. Police claimed he had snipped through their “Do not cross” tape.

In 30 years as journalist, this was the third time I had been detained by the authorities. The first was in Cuba in 2006, while covering the announcement by Fidel Castro that he was standing aside. The second was in 2011 in Pakistan, while taking photographs outside Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, six months after he had been killed by US Special Forces.

My encounter with Seattle police was the first time I had been arrested. I had no criminal record. As a result, I was released at 6pm after signing a piece of paper saying I would show up for court.

Among the 30-odd people discharged with me that evening was a young African American man who said he had spent an entire year in jail after being charged with resisting arrest. He said he had been unable to make bail. He was far from alone. Campaigners say hundreds of thousands of people, not actually convicted of a crime, are sitting in America’s jails because they do not have the means to pay a bond agency.

Journalism is not a crime

Seattle’s Cal Anderson Park was established 100 years ago but given its current name in 2003 to honour Washington state’s first openly gay legislator, who died from Aids in 1995. In the years since, it has become a place for both protests and celebrations, along with simply sitting in the sun enjoying a picnic. Most years, July 4th will see it packed with people watching fireworks.

On Saturday, my wrists still sore from the handcuffs and my throat tender after having the jacket tugged down hard on it, I donned a face mask and cycled around the park’s perimeter, shut off with tape. At each entrance was a small group of police officers. At the East Precinct building, workmen were repairing damage caused during the protests. A few Black Lives Matter logos appeared from various shop windows, but the protesters were gone, a small number that day marching outside the West Precinct.

The night before I’d watched Donald Trump deliver what was widely perceived as a divisive speech against the backdrop of Mount Rushmore, where among other things he accused the media of promoting a “new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance”.

Trump vowed to honour the “heroes” carved in stone, which he used for his backdrop. Among them were presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, two founding fathers of the nation, who were also slave owners. Indigenous protesters said the land was theirs and demanded Trump call off the event.

On Saturday, the president reinforced his sentiments at the White House. “And we will defend, protect and preserve the American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America,” he said.

This time, he was met with more protesters, some pointing to the organised killing of countless thousands of indigenous people that was also central to the nation’s development. According to reports some chanted: “Slavery, genocide and war – America was never great.” In Baltimore, a statue of Columbus was pulled down and thrown into the harbour.

On my circuit around the park, I intentionally did not stop to speak to anybody. Since being released from jail, I have become increasingly sick. Headaches, a cough, exhaustion. On Monday I got a Covid test. Two days later, I was relieved when it came back negative.

I am also expecting a letter from the court, with a time and date to attend; while the mayor said last week she hoped prosecutors would drop the charges against the protesters, I have received no such message.

The SPD said it had forwarded details of my arrest to the Office of Police Accountability for review, and King County sheriff’s department said it was looking into my assertion I was assaulted by one of its officers, that a female officer threatened a protester, and that its facilities to address coronavirus were inadequate. It said it had been SPD officers who had taken me to the jail in a “belly chain”. The SPD did not not immediately respond to questions about this.

Asked to comment on my interaction with FBI officers, bureau spokesperson Steve Bernd said: “I would not be able to speculate or provide a comment regarding the incident you describe and would refer you to the Seattle Police Department.”

The park has a reflecting pool, where people sit and read, or think or listen to music. It was also off-limits, but I did not need to spend time there to be certain that if I am charged, I will be pleading not guilty. Journalism is not a crime.

At the same time I will be trying to explain why, supported by the right afforded by the First Amendment of the Constitution, I stood my ground.

In Trump’s America, where the media is routinely cast as evil and dishonest and where an African American reporter for CNN can be arrested live on air, the need to defend journalism and its centrality to an informed democracy has never been greater. And the foundational act for journalists is to show up, either literally or else in spirt and commitment and focus.

Whether we’re covering the actions of a city council, the workings of Wall Street, or the faltering, long-overdue attempt of a nation to confront the racial inequities that underpin its creation, the most important thing is to pledge ourselves to the task of doing so, and then get on with it.

Our job is not to disperse. Our job is to be present."
"Acai Benefits for Heart, the Immune System, and More",http://alissonkalel.com/acai-benefits/,"The acai berry is a fruit that grows on palm trees in the Amazon region of South America, which are currently being considered as a superfood due to being a source of calories, it is rich in antioxidants and nutrients with the power of an anti-inflammatory. This result is similar to that of the grape, the color purple, and the scientific name is Euterpe oleracea.

The acai berry is rich in polyphenols, and anthocyanins, some studies have indicated that it has a higher amount of antioxidants than in blueberries, the frequent consumption of the acai berry in combination with a well-balanced diet can provide many health benefits such as preventing premature aging and strengthen the immune system.

This fruit is used to make beverages, jellies, candies, and ice-creams can be purchased in the form of fruit, frozen or nutritional supplements in a grocery or health-food store or by shopping online.

Benefits of Acai

The acai berry prevents cancer, premature aging, and strengthens the immune system

The first point is positive with respect to acai berry is that it is rich in vitamins A, C, and E, which act as strong antioxidants. But what does this mean to you? Well, as the name implies, these molecules are responsible for preventing oxidation of the cells, and this is done by combating the free radicals that when in excess in our bodies that affect the cell wall.

It is important to point out that this is the kind of problem that can affect many things in our body, and among them is the possible development of cancer since the disease starts in the cells from oxidation. But it doesn’t stop there. Because they are not healthy, they end up wearing them more, which leads to premature aging. This is not to mention that, in general, the agents of the antioxidant, strengthens the immune system, leaving the body free of illness and disease.

Rich in fiber

Another great benefit that is related to the intake of the acai berry is that this fruit is rich in fiber. This means that it gives you a feeling of fullness. It is for this reason that a lot of people replace a meal and a large glass of acai berry. But, the fibers have another advantage: they help to regulate the bowel, preventing both constipation and diarrhea. As a result, the nutrients are better absorbed by the body, making sure that it continues to work well.

The acai berry is good for the heart

A lot of people don’t know it, but the acai berry is also a great ally of the heart. This is because it has a good amount of anthocyanin, which is responsible for the coloring of the purple. This substance that prevents cell degeneration, which is, in itself, prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease. But in addition to this, the acai berry is a concentration of polyphenols, which will in turn increase the blood flow to the heart, allowing it to keep healthy and strong.

The fruit helps to treat the disorders

In a study conducted by researchers from Brazil and Canada, respectively, from the Federal University of Santa Maria, and at the University of Toronto shows that the acai berry can also fight the bipolar disorder. The analysis came to the conclusion that it is the extract of the fruit can are unable to resolve a malfunction, that happens inside the cell, the area responsible for the production of energy for the brain. In addition to this, the research has shown that the acai berry is shown to the nervous system in general, since it also prevents the development of other disorders, as well as reducing the pain in the neck.

Acai berry is a great energy

Do you know that stereotype that says that if you eat acai berry is also good for the workout? This is because the people who do exercises that are supportive of the use of the fruit because it gives more energy to the body. Just reminding you that it has a lot of calories, which is great for those who enjoy sports, but you need to control if you want to lose weight. If you fall in the second case, it is best to go easy on the amount ingested on a daily basis.

It makes it easier for the menstrual cycle

The acai berry is a fruit that is rich in mineral salts, with, for example, it has good amounts of iron and phosphorus. But it is the calcium in that it reduces the problems of women during their menstrual cycle. This is because it prevents the feeling uncomfortable, like cramps and bloating. But in addition to that, all your other nutrients to prevent problems, such as anemia, irritability, depression, and even irregular heartbeat.

The acai berry make me gain weight?

They are not as described, the side-effects related to the intake of the acai berry, however, as it has a lot of calories and fat, excessive consumption of acai berry can be weight gain. In this way, the acai berry should be avoided by those who are overweight or obese, and this is the only contra-indication for the consumption of the fruit.

How to prepare acai berry

To prepare the acai in a healthy way, it can be mixed in a blender with 100g of the pulp of the acai berry with natural, in 1 cup of water, and a little bit of honey. Then, you can also add granola, oats, almonds toasted, or other nuts.

The acai berry powder can be found in some health-food stores and online and can be used to complement the powers of the fruit in these drinks, or for adding to ice cream, or plain yogurt with honey, for example.

The consumption of the fruit of the acai berry straight from the tree, it should be avoided, as there is a risk of contracting diseases, such as Chagas disease. The acai berry has a very acrid taste, and the pulp is pure, it is very difficult to be used, therefore a lot of people have a tendency to mix it with other products such as condensed milk, milk powder, chocolate, among others, and by doing that, the acai berry is more calories and less healthy.

For this reason, it is important to consider the nutritional composition of the pulp of the acai berries to see what the ingredients are since the idea is that it does not contain any other products are mixed as a syrup, guarana, or any other added sugars, as this doubles the number of calories in the acai berry. Here’s what’s on the nutritional composition of the acai berry.

The coronavirus quarantine has changed us and it's not all bad,http://vox.com/future-perfect/2020/6/9/21279258/coronavirus-pandemic-new-quarantine-habits,"Cities are reopening. Lockdowns are lifting. And some people are starting to feel they can glimpse a return, however slow and partial, to “normal.”

But the pandemic has changed us. Although being on lockdown has been pretty grueling on balance, the surprise is that many of us have realized there are some things about quarantine life that are worth preserving. We’re questioning the very fundamentals of the “normal” we’d all come to unthinkingly accept — and realizing we don’t want to go back, not to that.

For some, going back isn’t even an option. Those who are grieving the loss of loved ones, for example, have suffered a tragic and irrevocable loss. Millions who’ve lost their jobs don’t have any work to go back to, and many essential workers have been working through the pandemic without much choice. Older and immunocompromised people are still advised to stay home.

At the same time, living in quarantine for months has offered some — mostly the privileged among us — a rare opportunity to reflect on our lives and, potentially, to reset them.

Workers whose jobs defined their lives are now asking what all that productivity was for, and whether we really want to measure our self-worth by the yardstick of hypercompetitive capitalism. Many are finding that the things that made them look “successful” actually also made them feel miserable, or precarious, or physically unwell.

Quarantine has allowed them to experiment with new habits and new lifestyles. And they want to keep some of these things going, even in a post-lockdown world.

I asked Vox readers to tell me which specific changes they want to maintain as they emerge from quarantine and stumble their way to a new normal. More than 100 people responded across the globe, from the United States to the United Arab Emirates and from Portugal to Pakistan. Some broad trends leaped out in the responses. Below are the eight most common.

1) Reducing consumerism

This was by far the most popular response. Many told me they want to spend less money shopping for new material goods like gadgets and clothes. A long period of being shut in and not spending as much has led to the realization that so much of our consumer behavior is about instant gratification, not lasting happiness.

Several people also noted that they plan to eat out less often at restaurants. Eating in during the lockdown has enabled them to save money, and some have discovered a taste for home-cooked meals.

A few said they’ll look to “mend and make do” more often. In situations where that’s not possible and they’ll have to buy something new, respondents told me they want to be more mindful of where they spend their money.

“I think I will be more inclined to direct my consumption toward small local businesses,” said Nora Zeid, a 23-year-old illustrator and designer in the United Arab Emirates. “It breaks my heart how much they have suffered lately and how, unlike big corporations, they are less likely to survive.”

2) Slowing down and putting less pressure on ourselves

Being stuck in our houses has made many of us realize that we’ve spent years rushing through life, pressuring ourselves to get the “right” jobs and attend the “right” events, even if all that status-chasing was making us miserable.

“Quarantine has forced me to slow down in ways I haven’t since I was a kid. From high school and college, through my 20s and a master’s program, I have been on the go constantly for half my life. I always said I was one who liked to be busy, but the last two months of forced slowdown has really called on me to think about what I want my life to look like moving forward,” said one Vox reader in the US who preferred to remain anonymous. “I’m trying to figure out what it would look like to intentionally build in space in my life to breathe, reflect, and focus on the most important aspects of life — the people around you who make it all worth it.”

Some younger respondents told me they want to put less career pressure on themselves because they now realize work is not what matters most in life. A couple of older adults told me they’d been considering retiring before Covid-19 came around; the pandemic pushed them to finally do it. And even for some who were already retired, the slower pace of life created by the lockdown has come as a relief.

Post-pandemic, the goal will be to “not fill every waking moment with a commitment of some kind,” said Patricia Murray, who lives in Savannah, Georgia. “Even retired persons, like myself, need leisure time. I seem to work as much as a volunteer as I did in paid jobs; slowing down is the biggest change I’ve made and it feels good.”

Again, it’s worth noting that the ability to slow down entails a great deal of privilege. Millions who’ve been pushed out of the workforce wish they could be working more, not less. And some older and immunocompromised people have had to go back to work, even if they don’t feel safe doing so yet, because they need the income and the employer-provided health insurance.

3) Prioritizing family and friends

When the chips are down, you see who really shows up for you. Several people told me they’ve come to appreciate the family members and friends who’ve been there for them during this tough time, and that long after the coronavirus dies down, it’s this group that they want to re-up their investment in.

“Quarantine has reinforced the necessity of telling people how you feel about them,” said Andrew Goldberg, a recent graduate from Syracuse University. “With social distancing and stay-at-home orders in place, it is easier than ever to feel isolated from the world. But as the days stretch into weeks, I’ve decided that the only way I’ll be able to keep my spirits up is by making sure the people I care about know exactly how I feel about them.”

Others emphasized that the bizarre, unprecedented nature of this global pandemic has allowed them to reach out to people they haven’t spoken to in ages. Suddenly they’ve found themselves on Zoom with estranged family members or old college roommates halfway around the world.

“I’ve talked with my older nephews more in the last few weeks than I’ve talked with them in years,” said Nancy Skinner Ringier, a retired speech-language pathologist, adding that they now share recipes and jokes.

4) Ethical action and activism in our highly interconnected world

This was perhaps the most encouraging set of responses: People told me that the global health crisis has shown them how interconnected we all are, and that they want to keep doing more for others after the pandemic ends. They’re donating more to charitable causes, trying harder to reduce their carbon footprint, and engaging in more political activism.

“I’d like to keep my home a headquarters for the three different county mutual aid coalitions I’m affiliated with,” said Erin Brown of Tazewell County, Illinois. “I currently have donations stored here that delivery volunteers and folks in need come to collect. My landline, which is part of my internet package, was never used before but is now a mutual aid contact number. I’m in a good location, near all three of those counties, and I suspect mutual aid will be vital for some time to come.”

The protests against police brutality have also galvanized millions to fight for racial justice.

“For the longest time, I did not keep up with current news. It’s not hard to see why — our world is a shitshow, and my mental health is bad enough as is,” said Adrian DeRoy, a 27-year-old reader in the US. “But the black community rising up yet again to face their challenges made me look, and seeing the world slowly but surely start to fall in step with the protests here, the voices crying out as one ... it gives me some small semblance of hope. Hope that maybe we will get through all this, and come out better than we were before.”

5) Exercising daily

This was another very common response. Many people who weren’t previously into fitness have been getting into running, yoga, and other activities as a way to cope with lockdown. And they’ve been astounded at how much daily exercise can improve life.

“Desperate for any excuse to leave the house, I’ve finally been able to keep up a daily exercise routine. It’s incredible how much difference even a short jog every morning makes!” Katie Reynolds, a Vox reader in the US, told me. “My sleep is better, my brain feels clearer, my mood is improved, and it feels easier to keep up other good habits. Definitely will be keeping this habit, at least until there’s ice on the ground again.”

6) Baking, vegetarian cooking, and growing herbs

Yes, the sourdough obsession is real. Several people wrote to me in glowing terms about their starters.

“I believe I’ll be keeping my sourdough starter. It’s like another family pet at this point,” said Matthew Schreiber, who lives in New Orleans.

In addition to baking bread, people also mentioned that they plan to keep fermenting things like sauerkraut and generally cooking more of their own meals so they can eat less processed food.

Specifically, people want to cook more vegetarian meals and lean away from meat-eating. The impulse seems to be coming not only from the fact that there are meat shortages in some US grocery stores, but also from the knowledge that a live-animal market in China may have given rise to the coronavirus and that the giant factory farms that supply 99 percent of America’s meat are a pandemic risk, too.

Many also told me they’re enjoying growing herbs like mint and cilantro on their patios, or growing vegetables like celery and scallions in little glasses on their windowsills.

It’s not really surprising that the coronavirus crisis has prompted this reaction. It’s reminiscent of World War I and II, when Americans grew their own fruits and vegetables in “victory gardens.” The back-to-nature impulse offers psychological comfort at a time of great uncertainty, as well as a practical safeguard against supply-chain problems: If the stores run out of food, at least we’ll have our vegetables!

7) Spending more time in nature

Getting outdoors has been, for many of us, a crucial way to maintain our sanity during lockdown. In particular, parents have wanted to give their cooped-up kids a chance to run around and release some energy (which, frankly, is probably as crucial for the parents’ mental health as for the children’s).

“I have developed a morning routine that involves ‘quiet listening’ on the porch with the kids. It’s a great way to start out calm with my wild little ones,” said Sharon Lapin, a painter in Atlanta.

Others are simply enjoying the chance to reconnect to the natural world. Its rhythms and resilience can help to calm our anxious minds.

“I want to stay in this less distracted zone and enjoy the time I have with my husband by taking advantage of the natural world (hiking, kayaking) and taking trips in our camper,” said Camille Costa Nerney of upstate New York.

8) Working from home, if possible

Lockdowns across the globe led to millions of people suddenly working from home — and guess what? It turns out we can do many jobs just as well in the comfort of our own homes (and sweatpants) as in our offices.

Of course, for many people, this is not an option. It’s a privilege to be able to work from home. That said, the myth that remote work isn’t as practical as a 9-to-5 office job has been proven to be just that: a myth. Some are finding that working from home actually offers unique benefits.

“I’m a counseling psychologist, and I have been doing client work remotely. I think I will keep doing it remotely! It’s quite convenient,” said Raphael Doval-Santos. “My practice also gets to be more global, and my new clients are not just within my city anymore.”

Several respondents said they love no longer having to commute to work. It means no pollution, more sleep, and less stress.

“I actually like this now; it’s better this way,” said Hermee Sorneo, a 36-year-old customer service team leader for a data management company in the Philippines. “There’s so much benefit in working from home, and I think the world should do this voluntarily, with or without pandemic, at least once every 10 years for at least three months.”

The “with or without pandemic” point brings up a key question. Lots of us say we want to maintain our new habits in a post-pandemic world, but will we, really?

As anyone who’s ever tried a New Year’s resolution knows, maintaining new habits is hard. But psychologists who specialize in behavior change say there are things you can do now to make it more likely that you’ll succeed down the line. For instance, you can prime your environment, whether by setting up an automatically recurring monthly donation or putting running shoes by your bed to nudge you to go for that morning run. It’s also good to reward yourself each time you engage in the target behavior — but make it an intrinsic reward, not an extrinsic one. So instead of reaching for a smoothie after every run, pause to savor the extra energy and strength you feel.

Finally, it’s important to note that if you don’t emerge from this pandemic with any great new habits, that is absolutely all right. Sometimes surviving is an accomplishment in itself.

“With my quarantine, good habits came of it. But I want others to know it’s okay if good, bad, or nothing came out of this quarantine,” said Farishta Saifi, a 23-year-old home health aide. “The world is a scary place right now, and just you living another day is excellent enough.”

"30 Years Later, ITER Fusion Reactor Is Almost Ready to Turn On",http://news.yahoo.com/30-years-later-big-boy-160400033.html,"Photo credit: ITER

From Popular Mechanics

The international ITER tokamak has begun construction and plans to start turning on in 2025.

Bringing in parts for the 25,000-ton reactor required building a special heavy-duty road.

ITER is the biggest tokamak fusion reactor project, but far from the only one.

Could nuclear fusion finally be right around the corner ... in 2035?

The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, is a 30-year-old project started by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. With tens of billions of dollars on the line, this experimental tokamak fusion reactor—a nuclear fusion plasma reactor where extremely hot, charged plasma spins and generates virtually limitless energy—is one of a handful of extremely costly “miniature suns” around the world.

These reactors take years to get up to temperatures hot enough to induce nuclear fusion. Will they ever get there? In July 2019, Scientific American covered the unveiling of the base of the reactor setup: “The section recently installed—the cryostat base and lower cylinder—paves the way for the installation of the tokamak, the technology design chosen to house the powerful magnetic field that will encase the ultra-hot plasma fusion core.”

Over time, ITER will install more and more parts, including some by a specially installed heavy roadway that stretches about 65 miles from the Mediterranean Sea to ITER’s campus in Saint-Paul-lès-Durance in Provence, France. ITER says it’s still on track to switch on the tokamak in 2025, meaning all the parts will be installed and fully integrated and the reactor will begin to accumulate temperature at that time.

It will then take another 10 years, barring incident, for the reactor to reach fusion. Ultimately, ITER’s adherents say it will take in exterior energy and produce 10 times as much energy output. Until now, the closest fusion has come is about two-thirds of input energy and with much lower overall quantities at play.

Story continues

“To get the atoms whipping around the inner chamber of the Russian-nesting-doll-like machine, a magnet will drive 15 million amperes of electricity through them,” Wired reports . “They'll also be zapped by 24 microwave generators and three semitruck-sized particle guns, until they reach 270 million degrees F and, avec optimisme, crash into each other, releasing heaps of energy.”

At the heart of the ITER tokamak is deuterium and tritium, positively charged ions that must be heated to unfathomably extreme temperatures and smashed together. “Fusion is the process by which light nuclei such as deuterium (2H) and tritium (3H) come together to make helium (4He) and a neutron,” physicist and tokamak consultant Colin Windsor explains . This reaction, at sun-hot temperatures, is what 25,000 tons of ITER equipment will foster.

Even in that explainer, Windsor says solar and wind have both fallen in cost much faster than he and other fusion experts predicted. The argument that these methods only work on “intermittent days” is more and more flabby as energy storage technology springs up around the world. Fusion energy via tokamak, too, is fragile and can be intermittent.

Projects in many countries are in different stages of development, and while ITER is wildly ambitious and has the support of dozens of countries, it’s also a Spruce Goose of sorts in the energy world. Where does ITER fit into a landscape of smaller tokamaks around the world? We have 15 years to find out.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

Finland has topped the annual global survey on happiness for the third year running, an accolade Prime Minister Sanna Marin said was all the more appreciated at a time when the coronavirus epidemic is testing the values and institutions of all nations.

The survey also ranked Helsinki, the Finnish capital, as the happiest city in the world, in an additional boost for the Nordic nation of 5.5 million people best known for its lakes, saunas and long, cold winters.

“In essence this index says that the Finnish welfare state gives everyone an opportunity for well-being in life,” she told a news conference on Friday held by video link to help counter the spread of coronavirus.

Asked whether Finland could remain the happiest nation in the face of the epidemic, Marin said: “... I believe Finnish grit will take us through this and together we will build a country which is a good place to be for every child.”

Finland has so far reported 450 cases of coronavirus and no deaths. Marin’s government earlier on Friday announced a 15 billion euro ($16.2 billion) aid package, ranging from loan guarantees to labour market support, as the central bank warned the economy could shrink this year by up to 4%.

SOCIAL TRUST

The U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network’s (SDSN) 2020 World Happiness Report ranked 156 countries according to their scores for things such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, social freedom, generosity and absence of corruption.

The other happiest countries in the top-10, in descending order, were Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand, Luxembourg and Austria.

The United States came in at 18th and Britain was 13th.

“Time and again we see the reasons for wellbeing include good social support networks, social trust, honest governments, safe environments, and healthy lives,” Jeffrey Sachs, director of SDSN and one of the editors of the report, said in a statement.

For the first time since the report began in 2012, it also ranked the happiness of cities around the world based on subjective feelings of well-being. That survey ranked 186 cities worldwide, with Helsinki coming out on top.

The U.N. survey uses a variety of polling organisations, official figures and research methods to calculate the rankings.

“This was happy news this morning,” said Justice Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson.

“We are used to getting through tough times by doing things together. This is the way to weather this crisis too and to be the happiest country next year too.”"
Oldest Polish actor comes out at 100. I don't regret anything. I didn't get married. I was born different.

Tom Brady says thank you and goodbye to New England Patriots,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/17/sport/tom-brady-leave-new-england-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Tom Brady , the six-time Super Bowl winner who is widely regarded as the greatest NFL quarterback in history, has said he will not be re-signing with the New England Patriots, ending one of the most successful partnerships in sports.

The 42-year-old has spent his entire 20-year NFL career with the Patriots, leading the franchise to nine Super Bowls with Brady as quarterback and Bill Belichick as head coach.

""I don't know what my football future holds but it is time for me to open a new stage,"" Brady posted on his social media accounts, in a statement entitled ""Forever a Patriot.""

Brady is expected to agree to terms with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, according to reports from NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Neither the Tampa Bay Buccaneers nor Tom Brady's representation have responded to CNN's request for comment.

Brady, who turns 43 this summer, will become an unrestricted free agent when free agency opens Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET.

Unprecedented success

During his two decades with the Patriots, Brady was coached by the edgy Belichick and together the pair brought unprecedented levels of success to the team. Belichick described him as ""not just a player who bought into our program.""

LOVE YOU PATS NATION pic.twitter.com/lxSQZmnjPL — Tom Brady (@TomBrady) March 17, 2020

""He was one of its original creators,"" the head coach told the Patriots' website. ""Tom lived and perpetuated our culture.

""On a daily basis, he was a tone setter and a bar raiser. He didn't just perform. He didn't just win. He won championships over and over again.

""Sometimes in life, it takes some time to pass before truly appreciating something or someone but that has not been the case with Tom. He is a special person and the greatest quarterback of all-time.""

The 199th pick in the sixth round of the 2000 draft, Brady rose from relative anonymity to become an NFL great.

He has won three NFL Most Valuable Player awards and leaves the Patriots second in the NFL all-time list in passing touchdowns (541) and passing yards (74,571).

Since getting his first chance in 2001, courtesy of an injury to then starter Drew Bledsoe, Brady has gone on to break numerous records, including most Super Bowl victories by a player (six), most Super Bowl MVPs (four) and most regular-season wins by a starting quarterback (219).

In the 2019 season, Brady led the team to the first round of the playoffs with a 12-4 record, and suffered a upset home loss to the Tennessee Titans.

Addressing teammates, coaching staff and Patriots executives, Brady said in Tuesday's statement: ""You all have allowed me to maximize my potential and that is all a player can hope for.

""Everything we have accomplished brings me great joy and the lessons I have learned will carry on with me forever.

""I couldn't be the man I am today without the relationships you have allowed me to build with you.""

Brady, who will be on the open market for the first time in his long career, did not indicate which team he will sign with for the 2020 season.

""I love Tom like a son and I always will,"" Patriots owner Robert Kraft said

""He has brought so much happiness to me personally and to all of our fans. I had hoped this day would never come, but rather that Tom would end his remarkable career in a Patriots uniform after yet another Super Bowl championship.""

A star that pulsates on just one side has been discovered in the Milky Way about 1500 light years from Earth. It is the first of its kind to be found and scientists expect to find many more similar systems as technology to listen inside the beating hearts of stars improves.

""What first caught my attention was the fact it was a chemically peculiar star,"" said co-author Dr. Simon Murphy from the Sydney Institute for Astronomy at the University of Sydney. ""Stars like this are usually fairly rich with metals—but this is metal poor, making it a rare type of hot star.""

Dr. Murphy shared the find with international collaborators to discover others had started to study the star, known as HD74423, which is about 1.7 times the mass of the Sun.

Together they have published their findings today in Nature Astronomy.

""We've known theoretically that stars like this should exist since the 1980s,"" said co-author Professor Don Kurtz from the University of Central Lancashire in Britain.

""I've been looking for a star like this for nearly 40 years and now we have finally found one,"" said Professor Kurtz, who is the inaugural Hunstead Distinguished Visitor at the University of Sydney.

Stars that pulsate have been known in astronomy for a long time. Our own Sun dances to its own rhythms. These rhythmic pulsations of the stellar surface occur in young and in old stars, and can have long or short periods, a wide range of strengths and different causes.

There is however one thing that all these stars had thus far in common: the oscillations were always visible on all sides of the star. Now an international team, including researchers from the University of Sydney, has discovered a star that oscillates largely over one hemisphere.

The scientists have identified the cause of the unusual single-sided pulsation: the star is located in a binary star system with a red dwarf. Its close companion distorts the oscillations with its gravitational pull. The clue that led to its discovery came from citizen scientists poring over public data from NASA's TESS satellite, which is hunting for planets around distant stars.

The orbital period of the binary system, at less than two days, is so short that the larger star is being distorted into a tear-drop shape by the gravitational pull of the companion.

Professor Gerald Handler from the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Centre in Poland and lead author said: ""The exquisite data from the TESS satellite meant that we could observe variations in brightness due to the gravitational distortion of the star as well as the pulsations.""

To their surprise the team observed that the strength of the pulsations depended on the aspect angle under which the star was observed, and the corresponding orientation of the star within the binary. This means the pulsation strength varies with the same period as that of the binary.

""As the binary stars orbit each other we see different parts of the pulsating star,"" said Dr. David Jones at the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias and co-author of the study. ""Sometimes we see the side that points towards the companion star, and sometimes we see the outer face.""

This is how the astronomers could be certain that the pulsations were only found on one side of the star, with the tiny fluctuations in brightness always appearing in their observations when the same hemisphere of the star was pointed towards the telescope.

The discovery of the unusual behaviour of the star was initially made by citizen scientists. These amateur astronomy sleuths painstakingly inspected the enormous amounts of data that TESS regularly supplies, as they search for new and interesting phenomena.

While this is the first such star to be found where only one side is pulsating, the authors believe there must be many more such stars.

On Monday Netanyahu Was Toasting Victory. Now He's Toast.,http://thedailybeast.com/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-was-toasting-victory-now-hes-toast,"JERUSALEM—An elated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu roared, “This is the biggest victory of my life!”—but that was Monday.

By Thursday, his voice hoarse, a tired Netanyahu growled, “We won’t let them steal the election!” In the words of Netanyahu’s centrist rival and Israel’s probable next prime minister, Benny Gantz, “Someone here celebrated too early.”

Then came a remarkable cascade of bad news for Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, and its first to be indicted while in office.

Avigdor Lieberman, his onetime defense minister and now a fearsome nemesis, announced his support for a law proposed by Gantz, a former army chief of staff, which would bar an indicted legislator from being appointed to form the government.

Such a law would eliminate any route to immediate political survival for Netanyahu, whose trial in three separate cases of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust is scheduled to open in Jerusalem District Court on March 17.

In an almost never seen instance of Israeli multi-partisanship that Israeli media call “the anti-Bibi coalition,” this law enjoys the support of 62 members of the 120-member Knesset, from the majority-Arab Joint List through the left-wing Labor Party, and now, unto Lieberman, a hardline secular right-winger.

Further, Lieberman, who holds seven potentially king-making Knesset seats, announced that he would recommend Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin choose Gantz to form the next government.

It is the third election in under a year in which Netanyahu—and Gantz—have failed to secure an operating majority of the Knesset, but for Netanyahu the stakes are higher.

“ Gantz is joining forces with terror supporters! ” — Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu attacking his opponent, a former armed forces chief of staff

Alon Pinkas, Israel’s former consul general in New York and adviser to former prime minister Ehud Barak, noted in an interview with The Daily Beast, that, “For the third time in one year, Netanyahu pushed for an election with one goal in mind: getting a 61-seat majority to grant him an immunity from prosecution over three severe indictments he is facing. For the third time he failed.”

Netanyahu “could not form a government in April 2019, September 2019 and he cannot and will not form a government following the March 2020 election,” said Pinkas. “Cut the electorate however you want, in all three instances a [slim] majority sent a resounding ‘no’ to his anti-democratic, anti-legal, it’s-all-about-me message.”

And Netanyahu was about to receive another blow.

Late Thursday, Moshe Yaalon, another former army chief of staff and the most hardline rightist in the Gantz centrist coalition, agreed to support a minority government led by Gantz, with the support of the Joint List, the Arab-majority party that leaped from 13 Knesset seats to 15 even as Netanyahu intensified his attack on Arab citizens, who form 21 percent of Israel’s population.

“Gantz is joining forces with terror supporters!” Netanyahu declared in a meeting of his coalition members. “Gantz's move undermines the foundations of Israeli democracy and subverts the will of the voter. We’ll stand strong against it.”

Joint List chairman Ayman Odeh, 45, a Haifa attorney and one of the election's biggest winners, replied, “Netanyahu wouldn't recognize what democracy is.”

“Pack your things, Bibi,” Odeh tweeted. “You're going home.""

As the situation unfolded Thursday night, Netanyahu asked his attorney general to “immediately” open a criminal investigation into alleged Lieberman electoral shenanigans a decade ago. Lieberman responded with a press release: seven laughing/crying emojis and not a single word.

“ Pack your things, Bibi. You're going home. ” — Aymen Odeh of the Arab-majority Joint List

By dawn on Friday, an increasingly cornered Netanyahu was accusing Supreme Court Justice Neal Hendel, who chairs Israel’s electoral commission, the body responsible for counting the votes, of criminal malfeasance. Netanyahu promised to petition the supreme court to investigate Hendel’s political affiliations.

The commission condemned any implication of impropriety, and Gantz posted that “counting all the votes, including those of citizens under quarantine due to fears of the coronavirus, is the basis of a democratic country, and one must respect the results and the voters’ choice—and no less the work of the Electoral Commission.”

Former Chief of Staff Yaalon noted darkly that “Netanyahu is refusing to respect the results of the election. His incitement could lead to a political assassination.”

Acknowledging Netanyahu’s “cult following of around 20 or 30 seats that thinks he’s a god-send and indispensable national treasure,” Pinkas said, “a majority thinks perhaps it’s time to go.”

How did this happen?

Relying on exit polls, Monday’s Netanyahu believed that counting his own party’s votes and those of his coalition partners, he had secured 60 out of the Israeli parliament’s 120 seats, and would find a way to squeak by on a narrow majority.

“ There will be no civil war. ” — Benny Gantz, likely the next prime minister of Israel

One route appeared to be poaching wavering opposition legislators. In a television interview on Tuesday, Netanyahu spokesman Yonatan Orich foresaw that “the establishment of a government is a matter of a few days.”

“We’ve already spoken with four to six opposition Knesset members,” he said. But the targeted legislators each denied any chance of their possible defection. “Nonsense. It won’t happen,” tweeted Omer Yankelevich, a young rising star in Gantz’s Blue and White, whom Netanyahu’s Likud party threatened to blackmail by releasing videos of her that were of a “personal nature.”

As Netanyahu increasingly catered in recent years to the demands of religious-right-wing coalition partners who squeezed him for funding and favorable policies in exchange for their support, his base has shrunk from a once loose, big-tent alliance of conservative voters to a smaller clique of true believers.

The Nation-State Law, which he passed in July 2018 to satisfy the ultra-right-wingers in his cabinet, may have lost him the election.

The law has no practical effect, but by declaring that only Jews in Israel have “the right to exercise national self-determination,” and by downgrading Arabic from an official language to one with an undefined “special status,” Netanyahu alienated the last traditional rule-of-law Likud voters while kicking out of the tent conservative Arabs and the Druze, a minority group that traditionally supported the Likud.

Druze voters who once gave the party over 90 percent of their ballots have switched en masse to Gantz, whose first campaign promise was to amend the law. Fewer than 10 percent of Druze votes went to Netanyahu on Monday.

“The Druze vote should be seen as a protest against the Likud and against the right, who betrayed them with the Nation-State Law,” said Amal Asad, a retired Israeli army general and leader of the protest movement against the law told The Daily Beast. “With the cameras rolling, the Blue and White leadership promised us they would fix it. That is what the Druze voted for.”

Meanwhile, votes were being counted. Over two and a half days, the Likud’s coalition slipped from an high of 60 seats to 59 to 58, where it hovered for a day before the pollsters’ disbelieving eyes.

Odeh said his party gained 20,000 new ballots from leftwing Jewish voters ""disgusted” by the right-wing establishment.

A generation of Israelis has known no other prime minister than Netanyahu, who has been in office for close to 12 years. As Israel’s political arena appeared to veer close to the danger zone, Gantz felt he had to reassure Israelis that “there will be no civil war.”"
"Meet the women who scavenge for gold at the top of the world. Eva Chura is one of the magpies of the mountain. Living with their families in shacks in a gold shantytown in the Andes, these women make a living gleaning gold from rubble.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-gold-peru-swiss-women-widerimage/meet-the-women-who-scavenge-for-gold-at-the-top-of-the-world-idUKKBN20T0TS,"LA RINCONADA, Peru (Reuters) - Eva Chura is one of the magpies of the mountain. Living with their families in shacks in a gold shantytown in the Andes, these women make a living gleaning gold from rubble.

They are called “pallaqueras” which roughly translates as ‘gold-pickers.’

Chura came 12 years ago from her hometown of Chupa in the Puno region to La Rinconada, a settlement of around 50,000 which is believed to be the highest in the world. Five of her eight children live with her in her corrugated zinc home.

The eldest is 13-year-old Natalie. Chura is still breastfeeding the youngest, a boy called Alizon, and takes the baby with her when she goes scavenging.

It takes Chura an hour to reach the site where the women work. When they get there, they always sit down and chew coca leaves, light two cigarettes ‘for the saints’ and drink a little anise for luck. “Sometimes there’s gold, other times no. At the moment it’s very low,” she said.

The men of La Rinconada bar all women from the mines dug beneath the rock. The men say the female spirit of the mine, which is located below a glacier called La Bella Durmiente, or The Sleeping Beauty, would be jealous and angry if women were to try to steal her riches.

So instead, the women take turns to scramble up onto piles of black scree that the men have dumped.

Teetering high above the ground, they stoop and flip over the rocks, their keen eyes scanning the lumps for a glimmer of gold. Anything promising they pocket, and take back to process and sell to black-market dealers whose stalls line La Rinconada’s main street.

“In a week sometimes I can get 1 gram or 2 grams of gold,” Chura said. Black market prices vary but on the London market that would fetch $50 or $100. “If I’m lucky it can sometimes be 20 grams, but that’s down to luck.”

The quantities each woman collects are tiny, but thousands of them are looking - some estimates say there are more than 15,000 pallaqueras in Peru.

No-one collects garbage in La Rinconada. Women and men alike risk their lives and subsist in squalor in the mountain’s thin frigid air.

Life is hard, Chura says, but she is better off gold-picking.

“I don’t count my husband, because he is no help as a father or a husband,” she said. “I’m the papa and the mama. ... We don’t want for anything. We have everything.”

She does get troubled – especially by the fact she has no support if ever anyone in the family falls sick.

“It is very sad to live with garbage and dirt, washing in the cold, with water from the mountain. But you tell yourself to get over it. The children give you strength and courage to work.”

She says those of her children who were born in La Rinconada aren’t bothered by the conditions, but when other people visit, they don’t like the smell and the garbage. “It used to be worse. The smell was stronger. Now we have grounds to play football or volleyball.”

To extract gold from the rocks the men and women use mercury, a toxin which they rinse with melted ice from the glacier. The water flows down the mountain into pools, puddles and rivers.

“The water used in mining is just dumped and all the communities downstream ... which are strictly farming areas, receive polluted water to support their livestock and crops,” said Federico Chavarry, environmental crimes prosecutor for the region. “These same waters carry heavy metals directly to Lake Titicaca.”

Titicaca is the largest lake in South America, a vital source of drinking water and fish for the surrounding population. Waste from gold-processing adds to pollution by run-off from surrounding cities and untreated sewage. In 2012 a German non-profit, the Global Nature Fund, named it the world’s most threatened lake of the year.

The fragments of gold these people produce have, at least in the past, made their way into supply chains of firms including phone makers and jewellers. In 2018 a Swiss refinery that had been taking the metal for years stopped after Peruvian prosecutors alleged the company that collected it was a front for organised crime.

Now, Chura and others in La Rinconada say the gold supply is running out in this area. “It’s not like it used to be. That’s why so many ugly things happen,” she said.

Miners have been shot dead in the tunnels; young women are trafficked into brothels; fights are common.

When police or other authorities come to town to try to enforce the law or restrict mining, they have been threatened by miners with the dynamite used to blast open the tunnels. The women join the protests too - some say the men force them to.

Now there is less gold in the mountain, the men drink a lot more, she said. “They spend more time in the bars than working.”

Chura’s daughter Natalie helps her. “She’s like a son,” she says. “But I’m afraid of the things that might happen to her.”"
"It was banned by the Nazis, Stalin and the Vatican. This is the surprising history of the saxophone",http://abc.net.au/news/2020-02-25/saxophone-history-of-musical-instrument-brutal-and-beautiful/11960922,"In its relatively short life, one golden object has courted an incredible amount of controversy.

It has offended ideologues, drawn the ire of dictators, and been outlawed around the world — but it's only grown in strength.

That object is the saxophone, at turns revered and reviled in its lifetime.

And just as two kinds of instruments were combined to create it, there are two sides to its history.

One side is beautiful. The other is brutal.

The controversial new kid on the block

One of the world's most highly regarded saxophonists, 89-year-old jazz legend Sonny Rollins, says the saxophone has always divided people.

""It confounds a lot of people and they've been trying to disgrace it and put it down,"" Rollins says.

Some have described it as a ""demonic instrument"" — a label Rollins rejects.

""People trying to put it down is a disgrace,"" he says.

The saxophone was born in 1841, when young Belgian inventor Adolphe Sax had the radical idea of putting the reed of a woodwind instrument on a brass body.

Sax's hybrid invention had the impressive boom of a trumpet, but the emotional subtlety of a flute.

Military bands loved it — but an established industry of instrument-makers most certainly did not.

When Sax moved to France in 1842, the new kid on the block threatened to take their business.

Sax's furious competitors set about destroying him, stealing his designs, setting fire to his factory and even trying to kill him.

Sax unsuccessfully battled these rivals all his life. He was bankrupted twice and saw out his final days destitute.

""It was pretty vicious business dealings,"" says Richard Ingham, editor of the Cambridge Companion to the Saxophone.

""It was really evil stuff.""

The saxophone as 'degenerate'

When the saxophone was picked up by dance bands of the early 1900s, the instrument became a star. More sold in the mid-to-late-1920s than electric guitars in the 1960s.

But popularity brought with it serious — and seriously powerful — detractors.

By 1933, when the Nazis took power in Germany, the saxophone had become a symbol of jazz music and inextricably intertwined with African-American culture.

The instrument fell under what Nazis referred to as ""Entartete Kunst"", or ""degenerate art"", which saw many artforms banned.

One 1938 poster advertising a ""degenerate music"" exhibition featured a black, monkey-like caricature, wearing a Star of David badge and playing the saxophone.

""The white supremacist concept of the Nazis and the desire to have a pure Aryan culture meant that they didn't want anything to do with jazz because of its African-American history and connotations,"" Ingham says.

""It's pretty revolting.""

It became difficult, and dangerous, to play the saxophone in Germany, with reports of SS soldiers knocking saxophones out of players' mouths.

The instrument has also been banned in churches — starting with the Vatican in 1914 — perhaps for its association with some of the more sexually suggestive dance moves of the early 1900s.

""Ecclesiastical authorities insisted that the saxophone movement be omitted rather than let the instrument's profane voice speak within the sacred building,"" Ingham says.

Trouble didn't end there. In the 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union also persecuted the saxophone.

""The saxophone was the embodiment of jazz, which in turn was the embodiment of bourgeois American imperialist culture, so that would be a good enough reason to ban the saxophone,"" Ingham says.

Orchestras in the Soviet Union were forced to pull their saxophones, saxophonists had to hand over their instruments, and players were arrested, imprisoned and even exiled.

A voice for black Americans

The saxophone symbolised racism in Germany and fear of imperialism in Russia, but in the US, when jazz music arrived, it became a voice for black American liberation.

""Jazz is really a black artform,"" Rollins says.

The saxophone is so central to jazz, he says the instrument ""almost represents"" it.

""If I played jazz, then I was automatically connected with my black roots,"" he says.

Rollins was born in the US in 1930 to family who were slaves on the US-owned Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, before being taken to North America.

He was politicised from an early age, influenced by his activist grandmother, with whom he marched for black civil rights.

""There was a lot of lynchings and … a lot of black people in the south were accused of raping white women and they weren't; they were innocent,"" Rollins says.

""Just like many things in the United States, if there was somebody great that did it that was black, he was shunted aside and made to disappear.""

But through jazz music, which originated in New Orleans in the teens of the 1900s, many black musicians discovered a loud voice.

Between 1913 and 1916 the first all-black jazz bands were featuring the saxophone. The music was powerful and unstoppable.

Rollins, a few decades later, put its power to good use.

WEB Du Bois inspired Sonny Rollins to create music to empower black people. ( Carl Van Vechten, © Van Vechten Trust. Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University )

""I remember that WEB Du Bois, who was a famous black leader here, said that any artist who has gotten famous in the United States had a responsibility to speak about the injustices that black people endured in this country, and they should do that through their art,"" he says.

""So as soon as I got a chance to, [when] I got a little popular ... I composed the Freedom Suite. I said something about it.""

In the original liner notes to his seminal jazz album of 1958, he writes: ""How ironic that the Negro, who more than any other people can claim America's culture as its own, is being persecuted and repressed.""

'The Lisa Simpson effect'

Women, too, have broken new ground on the saxophone.

English saxophonist and composer Charlotte Harding says when the saxophone burst onto the musical scene, its radical newness meant ""everyone could make it what they wanted to make it"".

""I think that's what's so special about the saxophone, is that it has this kind of newness,"" she says.

""Even now we still think of it as a relatively new instrument. So many people then have that mindset of, well, everything's possible with it.""

In 1876, just three decades after the saxophone was invented, touring US saxophonist Etta Morgan, billed as ""the only lady saxophone player in the world"", was succeeding in a male-dominated music industry.

It's reported the first concert saxophone solo by an African-American was performed by a woman, Elsie Hoffman, in 1889, and one of the instrument's first recordings was made by Bessie Mecklem, playing her version of Ave Maria, in 1892.

""I remember seeing that date for the first time and just thinking, 'Oh my goodness.' It's so early on when you think about it,"" Harding says.

More than a century later, women and the saxophone are still strongly connected.

Diana Tolmie, from the Queensland Conservatorium, says when she started teaching saxophone 30 years ago, ""you'd be really hard pressed trying to get girls to play"".

""It was very much a boy's instrument. Girls just wouldn't touch it,"" she says.

Then, in 1989, TV show The Simpsons changed everything.

""I call it 'the Lisa Simpson effect',"" Dr Tolmie says.

She says Lisa was a ""cool character [who] played the baritone"", becoming a role model for other girls.

Loading...

""What we noticed at the Conservatorium was that, where it used to be a 90 per cent male, 10 per cent female ratio, it completely flipped the other way,"" Dr Tolmie says.

""We just had this influx of females coming in and auditioning.""

Dr Tolmie says that popularity has held and, while other instruments ebb and flow, the number of saxophone students in Australia remains consistently strong.

""It's a very accessible instrument to start off with, so that I think aids a lot in avoiding any kind of attrition of numbers,"" she says.

But Rollins has a different explanation for the continued popularity of his instrument.

""As long as people hear the saxophone they will be seduced by it ... To me it is a beautiful sound, which is certainly existing in the heavens,"" he says."

The belief that Bernie Sanders is too left-wing to win a presidential election is an article of faith among journalists, pundits, and political operatives. Most of Sanders’s Democratic rivals also echo that claim either directly or through their surrogates. It is probably the most commonly held and thus damaging argument against a Sanders nomination. And it is this concern that keeps some, perhaps many, Democratic Party voters from fully embracing his campaign. But the “too far left” thesis has no empirical evidence to support it. In fact, all the evidence suggests the opposite — that Sanders is almost certainly the very best shot at beating Trump. In 2016, Sanders routinely fared as well or better than Hillary Clinton in head-to-head match-ups with Trump. And even Michael Bloomberg has recently said that Bernie would have won in 2016 had he been the nominee. The 2020 polling backs that up — Sanders does as well or better (often far better) in match-ups with Trump than all the other Democratic contenders. But the “too far left” conventional wisdom lives on like a zombie among the punditocracy. And it is not going away anytime soon — if anything, it’ll only amp up as Sanders continues to rise. So it demands a thorough debunking. Because not only does all the evidence point to Sanders being the safest choice to beat Trump, it likewise suggests that the nomination of one of his “moderate” rivals could be disastrous.

Bernie the Centrist The conventional wisdom goes like this: American voters can generally be placed on a political spectrum from left to right. The left half is the Democrats, the right half is the Republicans. In the middle are independents. The closer to the center one is, the closer one is to the great majority of American people, and logically, therefore, this is where electoral majorities are found. Hence terms like “centrist” or “moderate” are held in high regard. The further one is from the center, the harder it is to win a majority of the voters, at least at the national level. So a moderate Democrat is closer to the center and will be more appealing to moderate Republicans and independents than, say, a Bernie Sanders who is way out there on the Left. They will also automatically get the votes of progressives to their left, because they are of course superior to any right-wing Republican. The smart thing therefore is to nominate a moderate, appeal to the center, and your chances for success go way up. Nominate a Sanders however and it is George McGovern in 1972 or Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom all over again. The good people in the center will simply not pull the level for those types of extremists. This conventional wisdom may have been true in the final few decades of the twentieth century, when it seemed like the only Democrats who had success in presidential elections were moderate Southerners like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. But it has certainly lost its efficacy as a predictive tool over the past twenty years. Al Gore, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton were right out of the conventional wisdom moderate playbook: pro-business, pro-Pentagon, self-described moderates who all went down in flames against weak opponents. The only victorious democrat, Barack Obama, ran a decidedly more progressive campaign in his triumphant victory in 2008, defeating a popular centrist Republican with a message of fundamental change. But the conventional wisdom has failed to acknowledge that the “center” has changed dramatically over the past two or three decades. For starters, there are two distinct meanings or uses for the terms “centrist” or “moderate,” and these are far from synonymous. On the one hand, “centrist” is meant to imply that a majority feels some way about a particular issue, or set of issues, that exists firmly between the dual polarities of staunch Democrats and staunch Republicans. On the other hand, “moderate” is meant to imply that these same people also favor a “go slow” approach when it comes to dominant economic institutions like capitalism, corporations, and billionaires. Even if they are flawed, the thinking goes, they are basically effective, legitimate, and necessary. Obviously, these are two very different ways to define a moderate or centrist. Perhaps in the 1980s and 1990s the comingling of these terms was defensible, but over the past twenty years the cracks in that facade are now gaping. Indeed, the openness to questioning corporate power and our economy is greater today than it has been for generations. One look at the polling data showing the preference for socialism over capitalism among Americans under thirty makes that clear. When one looks at specific issues today and where the majority public opinion is located, Sanders hardly seems like a fringe candidate. Most Democratic voters, indeed Americans writ large, want Medicare For All, an end to endless wars, an expanded Social Security, a $15 an hour minimum wage, a Green New Deal, progressive taxation, well-funded public education, and on and on. Sanders simply did the unthinkable — he used his national platform to call for these popular programs that were only unpopular among the rich, the media, and the two parties. This in turn forced his rivals to embrace positions that were considered too radical in 2016. He simply made it political suicide not to. If a centrist is someone whose positions represent a majority of all Americans on issue after issue — and a supermajority of Democratic voters — then Bernie is in fact a centrist. But that notion is verboten to the punditry, because it violates the other conventional criteria for being a “moderate”: total subservience to the economic-powers-that-be. This is why bypassing the media has been key to Sanders’s success. When he has a chance to present his ideas directly to people, most voters — including so-called “moderates” — think they make a lot of sense. It’s why Bernie is more popular with voters the more they get to know him. And it explains why he did so well on the Joe Rogan show and the Fox News town hall and why he’s remained so deeply beloved in his home state of Vermont for four decades now.

Independent Voters Are Politically All Over the Map — But They Still Love Sanders The notion that “independent” voters are mostly political moderates and centrists wedged between Joe Manchin and Mitt Romney is another key to the conventional wisdom. Hence the successful politician is the one who can appeal to these swing voters, and, again, that means the best candidate is a moderate establishment Democrat, not someone like Bernie way out there in left field. In fact, while some independents might be wedged between Manchin and Romney, not many of them are. Independents, a larger voting bloc than either Republicans or Democrats, are all over the political spectrum. Many of them simultaneously hold conservative and progressive views. This left-right model does not do justice to their complexity. While independents do share a general antipathy to both parties, they still care deeply about politics. And for decades now, no one has done better with them than Bernie Sanders. It is the basis for his continual landslide victories in Vermont. Independent support explains why he can trail (until very recently) in polls among Democratic primary candidates while trouncing Trump in one-on-one match-ups by bigger margins than his rivals. And the most recent polling data shows Sanders to be the most popular presidential contender with independent voters, including Trump. Why is that? Some of it may be rooted in the fact that he only very recently became a Democrat. Much of it however is likely based in his total authenticity —nothing about Sanders seems staged or phony. But whatever it is, his dominance with independents is a powerful phenomenon, and one that mainstream pundits effectively ignore and cannot explain."
They can now date fingerprints accurately using Ozone.,http://newatlas.com/science/fingerprint-dating/,"Finding a person's fingerprints at a crime scene isn't always enough to convict them, as they can claim that those prints were left before the crime took place. That may be about to change, though, as scientists have now devised a method of dating fingerprints.

Led by Assoc. Prof. Young Jin Lee, a team from Iowa State University recently decided to investigate an existing theory – it suggests that as a fingerprint ages, ozone in the surrounding air reacts with unsaturated triacylglycerols deposited by the fingertip.

The scientists studied multiple prints from three volunteers, which were left on various surfaces over a period of seven days. Utilizing a technique known as mass spectrometry imaging, the researchers were able to reliably determine when each print was left, based on the rate at which its triacylglycerols had degraded.

The examination process didn't harm the fingerprints, so they could still be used for identifying individuals. Additionally, the prints could still be dated even after having been dusted with forensic powder.

It was noted that the rate of degradation varied considerably from person to person, likely because of the differing amounts of lipids in their fingerprints. This means that a print couldn't be dated until police knew who it was from, and had established that person's unique triacylglycerol profile.

A paper on the research was published this week in the journal Analytical Chemistry.

A bubbling star

A new solar telescope in Hawaii has taken its first photo and movie of the Sun. The shots are the highest resolution views of our star yet, showing details on the Sun’s surface as small as about 18 miles in size.The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope is located on the Haleakala volcano on the island of Maui. A primary mirror that's 4 meters (about 13 feet) wide makes this the biggest solar telescope on Earth, and it will be able to resolve smaller details on the Sun than ever before. With the telescope’s sophisticated instruments and high resolution, scientists hope to better understand remaining mysteries about our nearest star.The grainy pattern in the telescope’s “first light” image is the mark of plasma cells on the Sun’s surface. Hot plasma from within the Sun rises to the surface, cools and sinks back down in a process called convection, like bubbling water in a boiling pot.The hotter parts where new plasma has just risen up from below appear bright in the photo, while the places where cooler plasma sinks back down appear dark. The grains in this first image from the telescope are roughly the size of Texas.The bubbling motions of hot plasma in the Sun are tied to some of the greatest remaining mysteries about our star. Because plasma is electrically charged, its motions can create magnetic fields. The Sun’s magnetic fields are responsible for a lot of its most dynamic behavior, like solar storms that can disrupt satellites and power grids on Earth.“Most solar storms originate in places on the Sun where there’s strong magnetism, strong concentrations of magnetic forces,” Rebecca Centano Elliott, a solar scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, tells Astronomy."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Latest on the Grammy Awards, being presented Sunday at Los Angeles’ Staples Center (all times local):

2:15

Hildur Guðnadóttir is taking home a Grammy for music she first thought no one would care to hear.

The female composer won best score soundtrack for the HBO miniseries “Chernobyl” during the pre-telecast ceremony Sunday.

The soundtrack already won her an Emmy late last year. And in January she became the first woman in 19 years to win best original score for “Joker” at the Golden Globes.

“I think it fit really well with the images of the film, and I was happy with how the music worked with the narrative and characters in this series,” she said backstage of the “Chernobyl” soundtrack. “But I never thought anyone would ever listen to the soundtrack record, honestly. I’ve very surprised to be here today.”

She is also up next month for an Academy Award for “Joker.” If she wins an Oscar, she could have three of the four EGOT awards, after her Grammy and Emmy.

Guðnadóttir called the experience “surreal” and an “adventure.” She said she might have plans to go on Broadway, which could present some pressure for her to win a Tony Award.

“Now, I feel a lot of pressure,” she said with a chuckle. “That’ll be the next step. The next project, I guess.”

The Grammy Awards pre-telecast ceremony opened with a moment of silence for Kobe Bryant.

Interim Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. opened the ceremony where dozens of Grammys are handed out before the main show, telling attendees, “As most of you may know, we lost Kobe Bryant in a tragic helicopter accident today.”

“Since we are in his house, I would ask you to join me in a moment of silence,” Mason said.

Artists arriving at the show reacted to Bryant’s death and his influence.

Blues artist and Grammys nominee Keb’ Mo’ called Bryant’s death “a huge loss.”

“He’s just a huge role model,” Keb’ Mo’ said.

British artist Labrinth said: “It was insane news to hear this morning. He’s been part of my life for a very long time. ... I couldn’t believe it.”

Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X are walking into what should be one of the most exciting days of their careers as they attend their first-ever Grammy Awards on Sunday, where they are the top-nominated acts. But 10 days before arguably the biggest night in music, the industry erupted when the Recording Academy announced it had put its recently hired CEO, Deborah Dugan, on administrative leave for misconduct.

Dugan and her lawyers fired back at the academy, claiming that the awards show is rigged. That energy puts a dark cloud over nominees like Lizzo, Eilish and Lil Nas X, breakthrough acts who are competing for top prizes.

The American Dream is much easier to achieve in Canada,http://cnn.com/2020/01/20/business/wef-social-mobility-index/index.html,"London (CNN Business) If you're born in the United States, having wealthy parents matters a great deal to your chances of success, according to a new report.

Individuals born into poorer families have a better chance of owning a home, getting a good education and experiencing a better life than their parents if they are born in Canada than if they are born in the United States. In other words, Canadians have a better shot at the American Dream than Americans do.

That's according to the World Economic Forum's Global Social Mobility Index, which ranks 82 countries on their citizens' ability to fulfill their potential regardless of their socio-economic background.

The report was published Monday to coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where global income inequality is a recurring theme.

The index ranks economies across five dimensions: health, education, technology access, work (in terms of opportunities, conditions and fair wages), and protection and institutions.

Once he placed the item on a nearby chair he noticed a bucket on the other side of the porch filled with snacks and beverages.

Accompanying the snacks was a sign imploring any UPS, USPS, Amazon, and Fedex workers to 'take some goodies to enjoy on your route.'

The note continued: 'Thank you for making holiday shopping easy.'

Reed appeared overjoyed when he discovered the snacks left out for him during his route.

'Oh this is nice,' he says in the video. 'Oh they got some goodies! Oh this is sweet! Oh wow. Get out of here! This is sweet! Well this is so nice!'

He then selected a few snacks and a water bottle before leaving the porch.

But once he stepped off the porch the man, still in the view of the security cameras, performed a little dance with his snacks.

Ouma decided to share the moment on her Facebook page Monday, and it quickly went viral with more than 276,000 shares.

Commmenters commended Ouma for her 'selfless' act by leaving out snacks for delivery drivers. Her post also inspired other people to do a similar gesture at their own homes.

'I'm going to steal your idea! Thank you for doing this,' one commenter wrote.

Another person commented: 'Oh my god this is the BEST video ever, Kathy. You’re one of the most selfless people I know! I absolutely love your heart.'

Ouma said Reed was 'bringing millions of people joy' after his heartwarming reaction to finding the snacks, which is becoming more and more common as the popularity of online shopping grows."

Some good news out of Hong Kong,http://theconversation.com/mosque-clean-up-shows-hong-kong-is-a-city-that-stands-up-for-everyones-rights-126012,"Amid rising violence and vandalism in ongoing protests, the public’s role in cleaning up a mosque sprayed with blue dye last week by the police proves once again the distinctiveness of Hong Kong civil society. The public response to appeals to help with the clean-up show this is a society that voluntarily protects the Muslim community and cherishes the city’s multifaceted ethnic and religious traditions.

On the 20th weekend of protests, a police water cannon truck firing blue dye at the front gates had damaged the city’s largest mosque. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung went to the mosque and apologised in a sign of the sensitivity of the action. They described it as an accident.

But the police defended their use of the water cannon in the name of protecting the mosque from rioters’ vandalism. The blue dye makes it easier for police to identify and arrest protesters.

Immediately after the mosque was sprayed, social media appeals were made to protesters and residents to clean up the front of the blue-stained mosque. The Muslim community was comforted by the many Hong Kong people who volunteered to help. In doing so, they showed they cherish the mosque, defend the rights of Muslims and seek solidarity with the city’s ethnic minorities.

On social media, the Muslim Council in Hong Kong praised the city’s residents.

How did the mosque get caught up in protests?

Since June 9, Hong Kong citizens from all walks for life have been marching in the streets in protest against a Bill of Extradition. Many people fear the Chinese government may use it as a tool to arrest and extradite dissidents from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial.

Though the Hong Kong government formally withdrew the bill last week, the protests are seemingly unstoppable. This is mainly due to protesters’ disappointment at the government’s failure to respond to all of their “five demands”:

complete withdrawal of the Extradition Bill retraction of the labelling of protesters as “rioters” full amnesty for arrested demonstrators an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality universal suffrage for the Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections.

The Hong Kong government had condemned escalating vandalism, and before the Kowloon protest it was speculated Kowloon Mosque could be targeted. A few days earlier pro-democracy activist leader Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit had been brutally attacked by a gang that some reports said were of South Asian descent.

Police had banned a planned protest at Kowloon on Sunday, October 20. Thousands of protesters still turned out. As many had anticipated, it turned into another violent conflict between the police and protesters.

Mosque is an iconic landmark

What made this incident markedly different from other demonstrations in the past few months was that it involved Kowloon Mosque. It’s a treasured Islamic architectural icon that has long been hailed as a heritage landmark. The mosque has served the city’s largely South Asian Muslim community – about 4% of Hong Kong’s population – since the colonial era.

The mosque, the first on Kowloon Peninsula, was built in 1896 for the “Mohammedans of Upper India”. They had arrived in Hong Kong in 1892 to serve in the Hong Kong Regiment of the British Army. The mosque was supported financially by Muslim soldiers in the early 20th century.

After the original mosque was closed due to damage during construction of Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR), a newly built mosque opened at its current site, Tsim Shau Tsui, in 1984.

Kowloon Mosque remains a vibrant place of worship. It is mostly frequented by Muslims who have their roots in the Indian subcontinent. Many of them live in the nearby Chungking Mansions area, home to many ethnic minorities.

The mosque is a vital cultural nexus for ethnic Muslims, a place where they assemble for religious and social life.

City of conscience protects minorities

The history and current role of the mosque explain why the police action risked provoking inter-ethnic tensions. It could stir mistrust between majority non-Muslims and the Muslim minority, potentially and most dangerously inciting Islamophobia. As one Muslim businessman sprayed in front of the mosque, Philip Khan, said:

It is not a personal thing, but they are doing it against my religion, and I am against it.

The increasing violence has stunned the international community. Nobody knows when the government’s measures to end the protests might be effective.

Yet, despite the turmoil of recent months, the civic quality of the ordinary people of Hong Kong shines through. Their actions in protecting the mosque and respecting the long-standing ethnic Islamic tradition distinguish their home as a city of conscience and a unique frontier for protecting the Muslim minority."

"Great expectations, inconvenient truths, and the paradoxes of the dog-owner relationship for owners of brachycephalic dogs",http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219918,"Popularity of brachycephalic (flat-faced) dog breeds is increasing internationally despite well-documented intrinsic health and welfare problems associated with their conformation. Given this apparent paradox, greater understanding of the expectations and reality for brachycephalic dog owners and factors driving the dog-owner bond are needed. This study reports a large-scale online survey with valid responses from 2168 owners of brachycephalic dogs (Pugs: n = 789, median age of dogs 2.5 years; French Bulldog: n = 741, median age 2.0 years; Bulldogs: n = 638, median age 2.5 years). The most common owner-reported disorders in their dogs were allergies, corneal ulcers, skin fold infections and Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS). One-fifth (19.9%) of owners reported that their dog had undergone at least one conformation-related surgery, 36.5% of dogs were reported with a problem with heat regulation, and 17.9% with problems breathing. Despite awareness of their dog’s health issues, 70.9% owners considered their dog to be in very good health or the best health possible. Paradoxically, just 6.8% of owners considered their dog to be less healthy than average for their breed. Dog owner-relationships were extremely strong across all three breeds. Emotional closeness to their dog was highest for owners of Pugs, female owners, and owners with no children in the household. Ownership of brachycephalic dog breeds is a complex phenomenon, characterised by extremely strong dog-owner relationships and unrealistic perceptions of good health set against high levels of disease in relatively young dogs. Perceptual errors in owner beliefs appear to exist between brachycephalic owner perspectives of their own dog’s health versus the health of the rest of their breed, which may be fuelled by cognitive dissonance processes. These novel data improve our understanding of the cognitive processes and relationships that facilitate the rising popularity of breeds that paradoxically are affected by high levels of conformation-related morbidity.

It is clear from the foregoing that deeper understanding is needed of the complexity of the beliefs and perceptions that brachycephalic dog owners hold on both their own dog and also their chosen breed in general. There is a critical need to appreciate the emotional and perceptual factors associated with the strength of bond between dog and owner if the paradoxical popularity of these health-challenged breeds is to be explained. To date, large scale studies of brachycephalic breed health have often focused on epidemiological methods from either first opinion or referral datasets with the aim of exploring quantitative aspects of brachycephalic dog health and to avoid potential biases introduced from owner reporting [ 22 , 23 ]. However, this veterinary-centric approach is also limited by largely ignoring the perspectives and valuable insights of owners living with, and managing the daily husbandry of brachycephalic dogs. Careful analysis of these owner-related factors can greatly enhance the usefulness of the overall scientific evidence base on brachycephalic dog ownership and provide novel insights on why the continuing (or indeed, often increasing) popularity of these breed types persists in the face of rapidly expanding knowledge on their poor health. To start to fill these information gaps, this study aimed to:

Much of the initial attraction from prospective owners towards brachycephalic breeds appears to focus on the ‘cute’ external appearance of these dogs; however, continued appeal during ownership, often in the face of chronic health disorders, suggests strong influences and misalignment of other elements of owner psychology. Unconscious, or indeed conscious, fallacies in owner perceptions of their dog’s true health status may perpetuate owner’s continuing satisfaction with their brachycephalic selection [ 20 ]. Over half of owners of brachycephalic dogs exhibiting clinical signs of BOAS did not recognise that their dog had a specific breathing ‘problem’, instead often justifying these signs as ‘normal for the breed’ [ 20 ]. As such, owner expectations of their dog’s health may be influenced by their choice of breed, with greater levels of morbidity tolerated by some breed owners. In addition, it is possible that owner perceptions of their dog’s health vary based on the strength of the bond that they have with that dog; a study of four small dog breeds in Denmark reported that French Bulldog owners had a stronger attachment to their dogs than Cairn Terrier owners [ 17 ]. The strength of the owner-pet bond has previously been identified as a factor influencing the level of veterinary care received by their pet [ 21 ]. Owners who exhibit strong bonds with their pets seek higher levels of veterinary care, are more likely to follow veterinarian recommendations regardless of cost, visit a veterinarian more frequently, and are more likely to seek preventive care [ 21 ]. As such, from these findings it might be expected that French Bulldog owners, and other brachycephalic dog owners (if strong dog-owner bondedness is a feature across breeds of this type) would be more attuned to their dog’s health status.

The distinctive physical appearance of brachycephalic dogs’ faces, with their large foreheads, large and low‐lying eyes, and bulging cheeks, may also trigger instinctual human attraction to these breeds. These features are part of Lorenz’s ‘baby schema’, infantile facial stimuli that arouse positive emotions and nurturing responses in human adults [ 18 ]. Empirical studies have demonstrated that infantile features in cats, dogs and teddy bears increase their attractiveness, and that women show higher ratings for pets with infant features than men [ 19 ]. Thus, emotional drivers for ownership of brachycephalic breeds are complex, strong and multifactorial but nonetheless clearly highly influential in breed selection.

A variety of drivers have been identified that influence owner decision-making with regards to dog ownership. Physical health was considered an ‘extremely important’ trait of the ideal companion dog by 60.3% of Australian [ 13 ] and 62.7% of Italian dog owners [ 14 ]. However, owners of brachycephalic breeds have previously been demonstrated to be less influenced by breed health and longevity in breed selection compared with non-brachycephalic dog owners [ 15 ]. Indeed, studies of American Kennel Club registration statistics suggest that breed popularity was more associated with the physical appearance of dogs than with factors such as welfare-related breed characteristics (health, longevity), resulting in breeds with increased inherited disorders becoming more popular [ 16 ]. A similar association is also reflected from analyses of the past 28 years of Australian Kennel Club registration statistics, where breeds with a larger cephalic index (skull breadth to length ratio i.e. a flatter face) have become steadily more popular over time [ 3 ]. Several factors have been identified that drive the popularity of brachycephalic breeds, including beliefs about dog behavioural traits (e.g. brachycephalic breeds make good companion dogs and are good breeds for households with children) and conformational traits (breed size suited to lifestyle and appearance) [ 15 ]. The results of a study of Danish dog owners suggested that French Bulldog owners might represent ‘extrinsically motivated’ owners, i.e. those who acquire dogs to obtain status and attention from other people because of the distinctiveness or cuteness of their dog [ 17 ]. In addition, nearly one third of French Bulldog owners from that study planned to acquire a dog of the same breed in the future, more so than owners of any of the other small breeds studied (Chihuahua, Cairn Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) [ 17 ].

There is increasing scientific evidence and international publicity surrounding the health challenges facing brachycephalic dog breeds [ 1 ]. Despite these activities, the popularity of some small to medium sized brachycephalic breeds such as the Pug, French Bulldog and English Bulldog has increased over the past decade both in the United Kingdom (UK) and internationally [ 2 – 4 ]. Brachycephalic breeds are strongly predisposed to a range of disorders intrinsically related to their conformation, including respiratory disease [ 5 , 6 ], eye disease [ 7 , 8 ], dystocia [ 9 ], spinal disease [ 10 ], heat stroke and pneumonia [ 11 ]. Brachycephalic breeds are reported with significantly shorter lifespans (median longevity: 8.6 years, interquartile range [IQR] 2.4–10.8) than moderate and non-brachycephalic dogs (median 12.7 years, IQR 11.1–15.0) [ 5 ]. In addition to disorders directly related to conformation, insurance data indicate that compared with non-brachycephalic dogs, brachycephalic dogs also experience a higher prevalence of health problems thought to be unrelated to conformation such as skin cancer [ 11 ]. Indeed, a 2013 survey of New Zealand-based veterinarians identified the Bulldog, Pug and French Bulldog as having “health and welfare too compromised to continue breeding” [ 12 ].

Following initial cleaning of data in Microsoft Excel 2013, statistical analyses were carried out in IBM SPSS Statistics v24 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Univariable analyses used chi-squared tests for categorical*categorical variables (e.g. disorder diagnosis (0/1) * breed), Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed continuous*categorical data (e.g. MDORS score * breed) and Spearman’s rank for non-normally distributed continuous data (e.g. MDORS score * age of dog). Data distribution was ascertained by visual inspection of histograms. The three MDORS sub-scale scores were analysed as continuous variables. Linear regression was used to determine which factors predicted the three MDORS sub-scale scores. Twenty variables were tested for their association with the three MDORS sub-scale scores using separate linear regression models: canine demographics (breed, age); owner demographics (age, sex, whether they were a first time dog owner (1/0), children in household (1/0); veterinary experiences (vet costs per year (£); vet costs to date (£); number of conformation-related surgeries); health scores (ORB; heat intolerance score; eating difficulty score; sleeping dysfunction score) and owner perceptions of their dog’s health (number of perceived health problems; health compared to the rest of their dog’s breed; overall health rating); and owner expectations of the breed vs. reality of ownership (veterinary costs, exercise levels, overall behaviour, maintenance levels). Factors with liberal associations in univariable tests (P < 0.2) were taken forward for multivariable evaluation in generalised linear mixed models (glmms). Model development used backwards stepwise elimination and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic was used to evaluate model fit. Country was included as a random effect in all models to take into account this potential source of non-independence, and its effects were assessed via its variance and changes in AIC value (with lower values indicating improved model fit). All biologically meaningful pairwise interactions were evaluated and retained, if significant. Final glmm model residuals were tested for model fit using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and graphical analysis of residuals. Results are reported as mean ± standard deviation [SD] for normally distributed variables, and median [IQR] for non-normally distributed data. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

Owners completed the Monash Dog-Owner Relationship Scale (MDORS) which consists of 28 questions divided into three subscales: emotional closeness (EC; 10 questions), dog-owner interactions (DOI; 9 questions) and perceived costs (PC; 9 questions) [ 27 ]. Sub-scale EC focuses on the owner’s perception of the emotional support they derive from their dog and their bondedness with their dog. The DOI focuses on the frequency with which the owner engages with different activities e.g. playing with their dog, and PC focuses on how much owners feel inconvenienced or burdened by their dog. Questions for all three subscales are scored from 1–5 by the owner. What each number represented varied by question within each sub-scale, but most commonly, 1 = Never; 2 = Once a month; 3 = Once a week; 4 = Once every few days; 5 = At least once a day, or 1 = Strongly disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Neither agree nor disagree; 4 = Agree; 5 = Strongly agree. For EC and DOI increasing scores represent rising quality of relationship (i.e. emotionally closer and engaging in more activities together, thus a more positive relationship); whereas for PC, increasing scores represent reducing quality of relationship (i.e. higher perceived costs of owning their dog indicate a less positive relationship).

Owners reported how their expectations had been met or violated for four key areas of ownership: (1) veterinary costs, (2) exercise levels required by the dog, (3) maintenance levels and (4) overall behaviour. Areas 1–3 were scored as less than expected, met expectations or more than expected, and area 4 (behaviour) was scored as worse than expected, met expectations, or better than expected.

Owners reported whether they perceived (yes/no) their dog to have a ‘problem’ with breathing, heat regulation, eating or sleeping. Owners were then asked to score how they perceived their dog’s current health on a seven point ordinal scale from worst health possible, through to best health possible. Finally, owners reported how they perceived their own dog’s current health compared with their belief about the health of the rest of the same breed on a five point scale: much less healthy, less healthy, average, healthier than average, much healthier than average for the breed.

Four health scores captured the severity of common brachycephaly-associated airway impairments: breathing difficulty, heat intolerance, eating difficulties and sleep dysfunction respectively. These health scores were either taken from previous studies [ 6 , 20 ], or devised specifically for the current study. For breathing difficulty, the owner reported breathing score (ORB) captured both breathing difficulty and abnormal respiratory noise in a variety of situations, as a score out of 40 (8 and above being associated with clinically relevant airway obstruction) [ 20 ]. The following scoring systems were devised that combined scores for a number of sub-questions on heat intolerance (3 questions, scores: 0–12), eating difficulties (4 questions, scores: 0–20) and sleep dysfunction (6 questions, scores: 0–30) ( Table 1 ).

Owners reported their dog’s veterinary costs to date (in £), which was used to calculate costs per year of ownership based on age at acquisition and current age. Owners reported which disorders had previously been diagnosed in their dog from a list of disorders affecting the airways, eyes, skin and spinal cord, and whether their dog had undergone conformation-altering surgery from a list common surgical treatments of these disorders. The disorder and surgery lists were generated from published clinical and epidemiological data on brachycephalic disease predisposition. Finally, owners of bitches were asked to report their dog’s whelping history, and any previous dystocia or caesarean section events.

The three most commonly registered brachycephalic breeds with the Kennel Club (KC) are the French Bulldog, Pug and Bulldog [ 24 ]. Owners of these breeds were purposively sampled via breed-specific online forums and social media platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) during June-July 2017. An explanatory letter was sent to the administrators of breed-related social media sites and a flyer containing a link to the questionnaire posted online once permission was granted. Participants were required to be 18 years of age or older and to currently own at least one of the three eligible breeds. Although distributed internationally, the questionnaire was only presented in English and thus a bias towards English speaking respondents was expected. Respondents were informed of the aims of the project and that submission of the survey would constitute their consent to the usage of these data for research purposes. Participants with more than one dog meeting the inclusion criteria were requested to answer the survey with regard to the most recently acquired dog. Recency effects have a strong influence on memory whereby more recent events are more readily recalled that older events [ 25 ], For this reason, dogs that were acquired more recently were more likely to have health events that were more recent and therefore owner recollection of such health events were likely to be less affected by recall bias [ 26 ]. The survey was granted approval by the Human Ethical Review Committee (HERC) at the R(D)SVS, University of Edinburgh.

Data are presented from three linear models, the outcome measure of each being one of the three subscales. Red arrows indicate a negative association and green arrows a positive association with the outcome variable. The reference category for categorical variables is stated in italics with the variable name; significant sub-categories are presented on the schematic. Country is included as a random effect in all models to take into account this potential source of non-independence.

Six factors were associated with dog-owner interactions (DOI); owners with no children in the household reported higher levels of DOI while owners with older dogs reported lower levels of DOI. Owners of dogs with moderately poor health reported lower levels of DOI compared to those with the ‘best health possible’. Owner expectations of owning their chosen breed also influenced their DOI, with owners of dogs that behaved worse than expected or had less maintenance than expected reporting lower levels of DOI.

Six factors were associated with perceived costs (PC) of ownership; Bulldog and French Bulldog owners exhibited lower PC than Pug owners, and first time dog owners reported higher PC than previous dog owners. Owners of dogs with a worse health rating than the ‘best health possible’ reported higher PC. Owner expectations of owning their chosen breed influenced their perceived costs of ownership; owners whose dogs behaved worse than expected, experienced maintenance levels higher than expected or whose veterinary costs were more than expected reported higher PC.

Expectations of owning a brachycephalic dog were violated for around one third of owners with regard to veterinary costs, exercise levels and their dog’s overall behaviour, and for one fifth of owners with regard to their maintenance levels ( Table 7 ). One in five owners (21.7%) found their dog’s veterinary costs to be more than expected, while one in ten (9.4%) found their dog’s maintenance levels to be higher than expected. Bulldog owners were most likely to report their dog’s maintenance levels as being higher than expected compared to Pug and French Bulldog owners ( Table 7 ).

Overall, 70.9% of owners reported that they currently perceived that their dog was in either the ‘best health possible’ (30.0%) or ‘very good health’ (40.9%) ( Fig 4 ). Compared with their perception of the health of the general population of their own dog’s breed, 63.1% of owners considered their own dog was either ‘much healthier than average’ (22.7%) or ‘healthier than average’ (40.4%) ( Fig 5 ). Only 6.8% of owners considered their dog as either ‘less’ (5.3%) or ‘much less’ (1.5%) healthy than average for their breed.

Owners were most likely to perceive that their dog had a problem with heat regulation (36.5%), followed by breathing (17.9%), eating (5.1%) and sleeping (2.7%). Bulldog owners were more likely to report a problem with eating than other breeds (7.2% vs. 4.1% French Bulldog, 4.2% Pug, p = 0.006), while French Bulldog owners were more likely to report a problem with sleeping than other breeds (3.9% vs. 2.4% Bulldog, 1.9% Pug, p = 0.043). Owners who perceived their dog to have a problem in any of these four areas also recorded correspondingly higher impairment scores (p<0.001) ( Fig 3 ).

The median ORB score across all breeds was 6.0 out of 40 (IQR 3.0–11.0), with 39.1% (n = 847) receiving a score of 8 or above, indicating signs of clinically relevant airway disease [ 20 ]. Across the study population, the highest relative impairment score was for thermoregulation at 3.0 out of 12 (2.0–5.0) ( Fig 2 ). Treating these scores as ordinal variables, ORB scores and sleep dysfunction scores were significantly higher in Bulldogs than French Bulldogs or Pugs (ORB: KW = 14.23, p<0.001; Sleep dysfunction: KW = 28.8, p<0.001), while scores related to difficulty eating were higher in French Bulldogs than Bulldogs or Pugs (KW = 21.33, p<0.001) ( Fig 2 ).

Of the 275 female dogs that had previously been bred from, 61.1% were reported to have free-whelped all of their litters, while 38.9% required either medical or surgical intervention in at least one litter. Caesarean sections (without differentiation between elective and emergency surgeries) were more commonly reported in the Bulldog and French Bulldog than the Pug (p<0.001; Table 6 ).

Overall, 19.9% of owners reported that their dog had undergone one or more conformation-related surgeries. French Bulldogs had the highest prevalence for 4/8 conformation-related surgeries. The most frequently reported conformation-related surgeries were nostril widening (8.2%) and eyelid surgery (8.0%). The three breeds differed in prevalence for 4 of the 8 disorders conformation-related surgeries assessed. Nostril widening was most commonly reported in the French Bulldog (10.7%) and eyelid surgery in the Bulldog (18.0%) ( Table 5 ).

The most common veterinary diagnoses from the options provided to owners were allergies (27.0%), corneal ulcers (15.4%), skin fold infections (15.0%) and BOAS (11.8%). The three breeds differed in prevalence for 7 of the 9 disorders assessed. Allergies and skin fold infections were most common in the Bulldog (33.7% and 22.4% respectively) whereas corneal ulcers were reported most commonly for the Pug (22.9%). BOAS did not substantially differ in owner-reported prevalence across the three breeds ( Table 4 ). Bulldogs had the highest (or equal highest) prevalence for 5/9 conditions.

The median age of study dogs was 2.17 years (0.92–4.33), with the majority of dogs aged under 5 years. In the study population, 58.4% of dogs were male and 42.0% of all dogs were entire. Of the male dogs, 89.7% had never been bred from and their owner had no intention to, 6.2% had not yet been bred from but their owner intended to, and 4.1% had sired at least one litter. Of the female dogs, 62.9% had never been bred from and their owner had no intention to, 6.4% had not yet been bred from but their owner intended to, and 30.7% had whelped at least one litter (1 litter = 23.4%, 2 litters = 5.6%, 3 litters = 1.1%, 4 litters = 0.6%) (data presented by breed: Table 3 ).

In total, 2168 valid responses were received from owners of Pugs (n = 789), French Bulldogs (n = 741) and Bulldogs (n = 638). Respondents were predominantly from the UK (72.0%) followed by USA (13.9%) and Canada (2.4%). The majority of respondents were aged 25–34 years (34.2%), with a minority ≤24 years (11.4%) or ≥55 years (9.0%). Respondents were predominantly female (89.1%). The highest level of education most commonly reached by respondents was an undergraduate degree (34.7%), and the most common household income was £25,000-£49,000 per annum (39.6%). Respondents most commonly lived in a detached (35.7%) or a semi-detached house (29.2%), and the majority had access to a garden (92.1%). Half of respondents lived in a suburban location (50.6%) followed by a rural location (26.4%) or an urban location (23.1%). Around half of households (45.7%) included children (demographics by breed: Table 2 ).

Discussion

This is the largest study to date to capture the ownership experiences, expectations and health perceptions of brachycephalic dog owners, with novel findings shedding light on the relationships that underpin the rising popularity of breeds that paradoxically are affected by high levels of conformation-related morbidity with reduced lifespan.

The owners in this study were predominantly young (mostly aged 25–34 years). This is in line with previous studies utilising online sampling that also reported that brachycephalic dog owners are younger than non-brachycephalic dog owners and speculated that this could be due to this younger age group being more susceptible to social influence that promotes the purchase of popular breeds [15]. Additionally, high levels of brachycephalic-owning households in the current study contained children (40–54%) so breed selection may also be influenced by perceptions that these breeds are good with children [15]. Despite the high levels of disease reported, the dogs in this study were generally young (median age of 2.17 years) as expected for breeds that are rapidly growing in popularity and where the overwhelming proportion of new puppy entrants move the median age of the population downwards. It is likely that the prevalence, spectrum and severity of disorders in these dogs will increase as this currently young population ages [28, 29]. This suggests that even the alarmingly high disease prevalence values reported in the current study may still be an underestimate of the true age-standardised disease prevalence that will be shown by the study dogs over time. It may be that this deteriorating health may affect owner perceptions of disease and weaken the dog-owner bond over time, and as such, future longitudinal studies of dog-owner dyads could supplement the cross-sectional approaches taken in the current study.

Health experiences As discussed above, despite the relatively youthful age of the study population, there was significant morbidity reported across the three breeds. Although this study did not intend to report reliable prevalence estimates of the conditions studied due to the inherent biases of sampling using an online convenience method, much of the health data presented concur with the current gold-standard for collecting such data, VetCompass. VetCompass holds data for nearly 10 million animals from 1,100 UK participating veterinary practices (over 20% of all UK practices). Although the data presented in this study are largely from the UK, over one quarter (28%) of dogs in this sample were from other countries. As reliable prevalence data on the conditions discussed are not yet available from similar systems outside of the UK, VetCompass studies are used for key health comparisons here. Of the disease list assessed, allergies were the most commonly reported disorder in the study population, with over one quarter of all dogs diagnosed, rising to one third for the Bulldog. These data concur with Vetcompass studies of brachycephalic breed health, where skin disorders were the most common group-level disorder in the French Bulldog and Bulldog [28, 30], and second most common in the Pug [29]. In addition to allergic skin disease, skin fold infections were the third most commonly reported disorder in this study at 15.5% overall, but affecting almost one quarter of Bulldogs (22.4%). This owner-reported study prevalence is markedly higher than that of a recent VetCompass study that used first opinion veterinary clinical data to show a 7.8% prevalence [30]. This three-fold difference may be partially explained by selection bias in the current (online) study population towards owners of dogs with disease. The study used a convenience sample, as at present the lack of compulsory register for owners of dogs in most countries internationally makes random sampling, representative of the general dog owning population challenging or impossible. This difference may also be explained by veterinary misclassification bias whereby skin fold disease is under-diagnosed in the first opinion population, or differences in sampling frame between these two studies; owners in the present study were asked to report all diagnoses to date (lifetime disorder prevalence), whereas VetCompass studies focus on diagnoses solely within a single year (one-year disorder prevalence). Either way, it is clear that skin fold disease is a common and important health concern, especially in the Bulldog. Corneal ulceration was the second most commonly reported disorder in this study, affecting 15.1% of dogs overall but nearly one quarter (22.9%) of Pugs. Corneal ulcers have been reported as the second most common disorder in Pugs with a prevalence of 8.7% [29]. This breed predisposition has been suggested to result from their high-risk craniofacial conformation including an extremely flattened face, wide eyes and nasal fold [7, 8]. Finally, the fourth most common disorder in the study population was BOAS, with a prevalence of 11.8% and no difference across the three breeds. Upper respiratory tract disease has been reported in 22% of extreme brachycephalic breeds [31], and is associated with their foreshortened muzzle and thick neck girth [6]. High proportions of owners had bred from their bitches in the current study, with around one third of all bitches having had at least one litter to date. Of these bitches, over one third required medical or surgical intervention to give birth in at least one litter. Caesearean surgeries were most common in Bulldogs (42.5%) and French Bulldogs (43.0%), compared to Pugs (14.7%). Pugs and French Bulldogs have previously been identified as predisposed to requiring caesarean sections to give birth [32], thought to (in part) be due to feto-pelvic disproportion associated with selection for relatively large heads and narrow hips in these breeds. Since 2012, the Kennel Club will not register puppies born by caesarean section from a bitch that has previously had two such surgeries [33]. Consequently, owners may be disinclined to report to the Kennel Club that their bitch had undergone such procedures, highlighting the importance that veterinarians should report caesarean sections that they perform to the Kennel Club [34]. Similarly, veterinarians are urged to also report conformation-altering surgeries that they perform [34]; indeed, in the current study, one fifth of dogs had undergone one or more conformation-related surgeries, the most common being nostril widening.

Airway impairments and owner recognition of these problems in brachycephalic dogs Impacts from partially or fully obstructed airways over a prolonged period are diverse and often highly detrimental to welfare, but studies to date often exclusively focus on breathing difficulties while awake. The current study presents concerning results suggesting that their compromised airways are leading to severely reduced physiological function and ability to cope with the everyday challenges of regular pet dogs. The ability to thermoregulate had the highest impairment score for these three brachycephalic breeds. Over one third of owners perceived that their dog struggled to regulate their body heat and core temperature. In agreement, experimental studies have confirmed that brachycephalic dogs that are exposed to higher temperatures have a decreased capacity for thermoregulation compared with non-brachycephalic dogs [35], and in the real world, a case series of heat stroke in dogs showed that brachycephalic breeds were overrepresented [36].To avoid such situations, owners of vulnerable breeds need to design, modify or avoid husbandry practices that may put dogs at unacceptable risk of overheating e.g. walking in hot temperatures, obesity, limited access to ventilation or shade [37]. Based on owner replies to clinical questions, nearly 40% of dogs reached an ORB score indicative of clinically relevant airway obstruction [20]. In contrast, when asked directly, only 17.9% of owners of these dogs considered their dog to have a breathing problem. These contrasting and paradoxical results support the influence here of the ‘normalisation’ phenomenon whereby owners of brachycephalic dogs may be consciously aware that the dog is struggling to breathe but not consciously accept that this is a specific problem, instead considering it a ‘normal’ and therefore somehow acceptable feature of the breed [6]. In addition to wakeful breathing dysfunction, sleep dysfunction scored as the second highest area of airway impairment in these three breeds, with the Bulldog most severely affected; the Bulldog breed has previously studied as a naturally occurring model of sleep apnoea [38]. However, just 2.7% of owners reported their dog to have a sleeping problem. This contrasts with a previous study of 100 brachycephalic dogs (Pugs and French Bulldogs) referred for the surgical treatment of BOAS (whose owners presumably recognised their dog had a breathing problem), in which 50% of owners reported sleep problems [39]. It is possible that the current study population were markedly less affected by sleep problems; however, it is also likely that many owners do not recognise sleep problems as a welfare issue [40] and may instead interpret signs of sleep-related airway impairment as benign ‘normal’ phenomena. For example, sleeping with a toy in their mouth or in a sitting position (strategies to avoid upper airway obstruction) may be considered as just cute quirks of their dog rather than indicators of true pathology. Finally, eating dysfunction received the lowest score of the four issues assessed, with just 5.1% of owners reported an eating problem in their dog. This again contrasts with a previous study of dogs with BOAS, in which 46% were reported with eating problems [39]. Both of these studies identified breed differences, with more frequent gastrointestinal signs associated with eating in French Bulldogs than the other breeds. GI signs in these breeds are often associated with gastrointestinal tract abnormalities including oesophageal, gastric and duodenal anomalies [41]. These issues may be directly associated with brachycephaly, breed-specific anatomical issues, or may be a combination of both. For all four areas of dysfunction, greater severity of signs was significantly associated with recognition of a problem in that domain, indicating that dogs may need to reach a critical level of clinical severity (a threshold) before owners consciously acknowledge their dog has a ‘problem’ that is somehow worse than just being ‘normal for the breed’. These normalisation and thresholding phenomena are of welfare concern because they may prolong suffering and worsen prognosis in affected dogs. For example, owners may delay seeking veterinary advice and/or intervention until secondary collapse of the airways occurs. Future work could compare the novel results of the clinical scores presented in this paper against veterinarian-assessed clinical signs and/or other objective measures of these traits. However, a clear message from the current study is that specific closed questioning elicits very different responses than simply asking owners whether their dog has a problem or not, which may elicit wishful responses that ‘normalise’ away unpleasant thoughts of ill health in their dog.

Owner perception of health problems The health section of this study relatively reported high levels of disease, even though the study population was relatively young. Despite these high levels of acknowledged disease, the majority of owners in this population paradoxically perceived their dogs summarily to be in the ‘best health possible’ or ‘very good health’. Owners perceptions of their own dog’s health compared with the rest of their breed revealed a concerning trend towards owner overestimation of their own dog’s relative health. Across all three breeds, owners most commonly reported that their dog was ‘healthier than average for the breed’. When all breeds were considered together, just 6.8% of owners considered their dog ‘less’ or ‘much less’ healthy than average for their breed, and this phenomenon was consistent across all three breeds investigated. This deflection phenomenon may be driven by cognitive dissonance, where owners are aware of health problems in their dog’s breed, but find accepting these problems in their own dog as psychologically uncomfortable, instead deflecting the issues to other individuals. This may have led to the skewed distribution seen here, where a large proportion of owners, whose dogs by definition must be less healthy than average for their breed, overestimate their own dog’s health. The commonality across the three study breeds indicates this phenomenon is common to all brachycephalic dog owners and may be linked to deeper psychological conflict associated with owning and loving an individual of a breed with well-known health issues at a breed level.

Expectations of brachycephalic ownership There were two main areas of ownership that violated owner expectation: veterinary costs and exercise levels, with over one fifth of owners underestimating each of these. The substantial disease burden in brachycephalic breeds commonly necessitates high-cost surgical intervention, as demonstrated in this study. Poor planning for such predictable costs may result in undertreatment with consequent welfare impact. In a study of North American small animal veterinarians, 57% of respondents indicated that client economic limitations affected their ability to provide the desired care for their patients on a daily basis [42]. Lack of awareness of the financial implications of pet ownership extends beyond brachycephalic dogs; in a recent PDSA Animal Welfare Report, 69% of dog owners underestimated the monthly cost of owning a dog [43]. The full financial implications of owning a brachycephalic dog should be thoroughly discussed with, and considered by, prospective brachycephalic dog owners. This may result in potential owners either deciding against purchasing these breeds that carry high risk of major costs or may encourage appropriate financial planning (e.g. pet insurance) for those who remain committed to purchasing these breeds. Owners also commonly underestimated the level of exercise their dog required. This may result from wide public perception that brachycephalic dogs require minimal activity, arising due to their restricted exercise tolerance (a core clinical feature of BOAS) [39, 44]. For those brachycephalic dogs either unaffected or only mildly affected by BOAS, exercise levels are therefore likely to be higher than anticipated, particularly in young dogs. Encouraging safe levels of exercise in brachycephalic dogs is important to promote fitness levels and avoid obesity, a risk factor for BOAS [6], and thus these breeds should not be marketed as having low exercise requirements as an inherent, and often appealing, breed attribute."

German synagogue gunman couldn't break down the door. That saved lives,http://edition-m.cnn.com/2019/10/09/us/halle-germany-synagogue-attack-video/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com%2F,"Halle, Germany (CNN) Streaming live from a camera mounted on his helmet , a gunman pushed on the doors of a synagogue, fired several shots at a lock on the door, stuck an explosive in a door jam and lit it.

But he couldn't get in.

The fact that the door held likely spared the lives of the dozens of people inside the synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.

Police say the gunman killed two people Wednesday in the eastern German town of Halle -- one directly outside the synagogue, and one at a nearby kebab shop. Police have arrested the suspected gunman.

A 35-minute video of the apparent attack posted online shows the suspected gunman, who had what appeared to be explosives in his car, trying to break down the synagogue doors, cursing in frustration and driving away.

Watching all this unfold on the synagogue's security cameras were the 51 people barricaded inside at the time, Max Privorozky, the head of Halle's Jewish community, told CNN.

""We were very, very, very afraid,"" Privorozky told CNN. The group could see that ""somebody was killed,"" he added, referring to the body of a woman who was the attacker's first victim.

It took around 10 minutes for police to arrive, said Privorozky. Thankfully, the building had ""good doors"" that were ""better than weapons,"" he added.

'Scandalous' lack of security

The attack has raised serious concerns about the safety of Germany's Jewish community.

It comes amid a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in recent years, and a surge in support for far-right parties in the east of the country where the shooting happened.

Jewish community leaders are now questioning why the synagogue wasn't under police guard.

""The fact that the synagogue in Halle was not protected by the police on a holiday like Yom Kippur is scandalous,"" said Josef Schuster, president of Germany's Central Council of Jews, in a statement.

In Germany's major cities -- like Berlin or Munich -- many Jewish institutions have a police guard to protect them from such attacks.

Not so the synagogue in Halle, a city with a population of more than 230,000.

The head of Germany's police union, Oliver Malchow, cast doubt on the feasibility of that level of protection throughout the country.

""We'd have to guard every synagogue, every church, every mosque, every holy place in Germany around the clock,"" he told Germany's public television, Reuters reported.

""So I don't know if this was a mistake or if this really couldn't have been foreseen.""

Anti-Semitism on the rise

Anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise in Germany. Earlier this year, German Jews were warned by a leading government official not to wear traditional kippahs in all public settings, following a rise in attacks across the country.

Data released by the interior ministry revealed that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose by nearly 20% from 2017-18, while the number of physical attacks against Jews increased from 37 in 2017 to 69 last year.

A far-reaching CNN investigation into anti-Semitism across Europe last year revealed more worrying trends: about one in five people in Germany surveyed said Jews had too much influence in the media.

Meanwhile, the country has seen a surge in support for far-right parties like the Alternative for Germany (AfD), particularly in eastern states where the attack happened.

The anti-immigrant group has been widely criticized for using rhetoric reminiscent of Nazi Germany , with AfD politician Bjoern Hoecke previously calling Berlin's Holocaust memorial a ""monument of shame,"" in comments reported by Reuters.

Hoecke condemned the Halle attacks.

The party was accused of inciting a culture of hatred, by president of the Jewish Community in Munich, Charlotte Knobloch.

""This assassination shows once again how fast extremist words become deeds,"" Knobloch said on Twitter.

Shooting live-streamed

After failing to enter, the gunman drove away and opened fire at a kebab shop less than a half-mile away, killing one person, police said.

The video, which was filmed from the shooter's perspective, bears striking resemblance to the video filmed by the suspect in the March attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand . The suspected gunman in that incident livestreamed a nearly 17-minute video of the attack.

CNN is not showing the video.

A spokesperson for Twitch confirmed to CNN that the video was streamed live on their platform. The site is most commonly used to livestream video games.

""Twitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously,"" the company said in a statement.

This image shared on social media shows the alleged gunman.

In the video, the suspect, who wore dark clothing and gloves, launches into an anti-Semitic rant, claiming the Holocaust ""never happened"" and saying that the Jews are the root of some of the world's problems.

A 27-year-old German suspect, known only as Stephan B., has now been detained following Wednesday's shooting rampage. But a ""long-term solution"" to xenophobia in Germany sorely needs to be addressed, according to survivors.

The country needs ""a change in society, educating people. Anti-semitism doesn't affect just Jews -- it's xenophobia,"" said Christine Feist, originally from Vienna, with Base Berlin, the group of 10 Americans who were inside the synagogue.

""People are lighting candles -- but this is just a small part of society,"" she told CNN."

A Movement to Transform Coal Miners Into Beekeepers Is Great News for the Planet,http://nationswell.com/west-virginia-coal-alternative-beefarming/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=contentshare&utm_campaign=atlasobscura,"As coal mines shutter across West Virginia, a nonprofit is helping unemployed miners and low-income residents make money by raising bees and selling their honey. It’s extra income for them and a big bonus for local ecosystems.

Tucked inside an old gymnasium, hundreds of wooden boxes are stacked along a far wall. The space, formerly home base for a summer camp, is now host to labs and classrooms filled with bright, freshly painted blue boxes.

But children won’t be playing here this summer. Instead, among the boxes and stainless steel vats, displaced coal miners and low-income West Virginians will learn a new trade — beekeeping. It’s part of a program run by the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective, a program for low-income West Virginians to make supplemental income through beekeeping.

While beekeeping may seem like an odd choice for former coal miners, it’s a viable and increasingly popular way for people in rural areas to make money. In West Virginia, where poverty is high and jobs are scarce, a large part of the population is struggling to make ends meet.

Coal mining once bolstered the region, but between 2005 and 2015, employment in the coal industry decreased by about 27 percent, according to research by West Virginia University. Across the nation, states like Kentucky, Wyoming and Pennsylvania have to find jobs to fill the employment gap left by the coal industry.

Enter the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective. The collective operates across 17 counties in southern West Virginia and offers classes in subjects like, Is Beekeeping Right for Me?, bee basics and advanced beekeeping. It’s a branch of the Appalachian Headwaters, a nonprofit formed to develop sustainable economic opportunities across the region.

Interested beekeepers can take Beekeeping 101, which is a five-week course where they learn the basics of beekeeping, bee biology and solutions to common problems. Once the new beekeeper has completed this course, he or she can become a partner in the collective. The partnership offers training, mentorship, equipment and bees for free or at a reduced cost.

But the startup cost to becoming a beekeeper can be a barrier of entry.

This was the case for Jason Young, a resident of White Oak, West Virginia.

Young originally started beekeeping as a hobby but quickly realized it could turn into a small business. “We had decided that we wanted to move forward,” he says. “But it was really the money that was holding us back.”

When Young discovered the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective offered training and equipment at low cost, he leapt at the opportunity.

Young and his daughter enrolled in the free Beekeeping 101 course and received 12 hives from the collective for a reduced price. From there, he formed White Oak Bee Co.

Last spring was their first harvest. It produced enough honey for his family and his honey-roasted coffee, which is White Oak Bee Co.’s signature item. This season, however, he has 14 hives ready to harvest and hopes to make a profit that he can reinvest in the business.

“Beekeeping and our relationship with the collective has really made that possible,” Young says.

The Appalachian Beekeeping Collective successfully trained 35 beekeepers this past year and plans to train another 55 this spring.

When it’s harvest time, the nonprofit will process, market and distribute the honey for its beekeepers for free. That can result in a nice chunk of change. In 2018, the market value for a pound of honey was about $7.33. A single hive can produce 20 to 100 pounds of honey a year, which means a single productive hive could earn its owner over $700 a year. With multiple hives, a beekeeper has the potential to make thousands of dollars every year.

And the bees do more than produce income for their owners. The forests provide nectar for the bees, and in turn, the bees pollinate these key natural habitats and create more plant diversity, says Parry Kietzman, an entomologist and educator at the collective.

Kietzman says she’s noticed people are more aware of the land and plants once they have bees.

“It seems to give people more of a handle on environmental concerns,” she says. “Simply because they’re worried about their bees.”

For others, like Young, it’s a chance to accomplish goals.

“What I feel most thankful for is the opportunity to take some dreams we’ve had for a really long time,” Young said. “And to really see them, kind of, come to be.”"
Technology restoring ability to walk gives me hope for future...,http://cnn.com/2019/10/04/health/paralyzed-man-robotic-suit-intl-scli/index.html,"(CNN) A tetraplegic man has been able to move all four of his paralyzed limbs by using a brain-controlled robotic suit, researchers have said.

The 28-year-old man from Lyon, France, known as Thibault, was paralyzed from the shoulders down after falling 40 feet from a balcony, severing his spinal cord, the AFP news agency reported.

He had some movement in his biceps and left wrist, and was able to operate a wheelchair using a joystick with his left arm.

Over two years, Thibault trained the algorithm to understand his thoughts and progressively increase the movements he could make.

Researchers from the University of Grenoble in France, biomedical research center Clinatec and the CEA research center implanted recording devices on either side of Thibault's head, between the brain and skin, to span the sensorimotor cortex -- the area of the brain that controls motor function and sensation.

The ozone layer is on track to completely repair itself in our lifetime.,http://sbs.com.au/news/article/2019/09/17/ozone-layer-track-completely-repair-itself-our-lifetime,"The world's ozone layer is on track to be completely healed by the 2060s, according to modelling by the UN's environmental agency (UNEP).

In the past 19-years, parts of the ozone layer have recovered at a rate of one to three per cent every ten years, UNEP has found. If this continues, the Northern Hemisphere's ozone layer is set to heal completely by the 2030s, the Southern Hemisphere by the 2050s, and the polar regions in the following decade.

Thanks to the #MontrealProtocol the ozone hole is expected to gradually close, with ozone returning to 1980 values by the 2060s.

""As we rightly focus our energies on tackling climate change, we must be careful not to neglect the ozone layer and stay alert to the threat posed by the illegal use of ozone-depleting gases,"" UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement on Monday.

""The recent detection of emissions of one such gas, CFC-11, reminds us that we need continued monitoring and reporting systems, and improved regulations and enforcement.""

The ozone layer, made up of three types of oxygen atoms, is located approximately 15 kilometres above the earth and helps to protect the planet from ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer, crop damage, eye cataracts and other issues.

But since the late 1970s, the ozone layer had been consistently thinning due to the overuse of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, reaching a crisis point in the 1990s when about 10 per cent of the layer had been eroded.

In 1987, UN members signed a treaty - known as the Montreal Protocol - aimed at phasing out ozone-depleting substances and developed replacements. According to the UNEP, the Montreal Protocol has successfully led to the removal of 99 per cent of chlorofluorocarbons, which previously existed in refrigerators, air-conditioners and other consumer products.

""The Montreal Protocol is both an inspirational example of how humanity is capable of cooperating to address a global challenge and a key instrument for tackling today’s climate crisis,"" Mr Guterres said.

""Under this international treaty, nations have worked for 32 years to slash the use of ozone-depleting chemicals, used largely by the cooling industry. As a result, the ozone layer that shields us from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation is healing.""

The ozone layer is also instrumental in curbing the effects of climate change, with the barrier stopping approximately 135 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere between 1990 to 2010, UNEP said.

Earlier this year, China came under fire for allegedly releasing large quantities of banned chemical Chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) into the atmosphere, in violation of the UN treaty."

"Artificial leaf produces first drugs using sunlight, reports a new study, successfully producing two different drugs: artimensinin, which is effective against malaria, and ascaridole, used against certain parasitic worms. Artificial leaves are perfectly scalable; where there is sun, it works.",http://newatlas.com/science/artificial-leaf-first-drugs-sunlight/,"Many of the problems human engineers face have already been solved by nature, so why not use those as a jumping off point? Making artificial versions of the humble leaf has been an ongoing area of research for decades and in a new breakthrough, researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology (TUE) have fine-tuned their artificial leaf design and used it to produce drugs for the first time.

Natural leaves are clever little machines. They collect sunlight, and that energy is then used by chlorophyll molecules to power a chemical reaction that turns CO2 and water into glucose. The plant uses this glucose for energy, and expels oxygen as a waste product.

Artificial leaves are designed to mimic this process. They’re made of translucent materials that allow sunlight in and direct it towards tiny microfluidic channels running through the material like veins. A certain liquid is flowing through these channels, and the idea is that the energy from the sunlight triggers a chemical reaction in that liquid, turning it into something useful like a drug or fuel.

The new artificial leaf design from TUE builds on the team’s previous prototype, presented in 2016. Back then, the device was made of silicon rubber, but in the new version that’s been replaced with Plexiglas for several reasons.

“This material is cheaper and easy to make in larger quantities,” says Timothy Noël, lead researcher on the team. “It also has a higher refractive index, so that the light stays better confined. But the most important thing is that we can add more types of light-sensitive molecules in (Plexiglas). As a result, in principle all chemical reactions are now possible in this reactor across the entire width of the visible light spectrum.”

The leaf has started to earn its keep, too. The team put it to the test and found that it was able to successfully produce two different drugs: artimensinin, which is effective against malaria, and ascaridole, which is used against certain parasitic worms.

Given its small size and scalability, the team says that the artificial leaf could eventually be used to produce drugs and other molecules right where they’re needed. Malaria drugs, for example, could be made in the tropical regions most at risk of malaria, saving the cost and trouble of transporting medicine long distances. It could even one day be used to help astronauts produce vital medicines on the Moon or Mars.

“Artificial leaves are perfectly scalable; where there is sun, it works,” says Noël. “The reactors can be easily scaled, and its inexpensive and self-powered nature make them ideally suited for the cost-effective production of chemicals with solar light. I am therefore very positive that we should be able to run a commercial trial of this technology within a year.”

The research was published in the journal Angewandte Chemie. An explainer of the artificial leaf can be seen in the video below.

Bernie Sanders supports US taxpayer funding of third-world abortions to combat climate change,http://washingtonexaminer.com/news/sanders-supports-us-taxpayer-funding-of-third-world-abortions-to-combat-climate-change,"Sen. Bernie Sanders threw his support behind U.S. taxpayer-funded abortions in third-world countries when an audience member stressed the importance of curbing the human population because of climate change.

""Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth,"" an audience member said. ""I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it’s crucial to face. Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?""

""The answer is yes and the answer has everything to do with the fact that women — in the United States of America, by the way — have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions,"" Sanders replied.

""And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control, to me is totally absurd. So I think especially in poor countries around the world, where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to the number of kids they have: something I very, very strongly support,"" he said.

Earlier in the evening, an audience member asked former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro if, given the looming climate catastrophe, it was fair ""to expect our children to continue the cycle of family and generation."""
Kindness is needed and appreciated even when you are not looking.,http://yahoo.com/gma/missouri-officer-searching-teen-witnessing-incredible-act-kindness-083318630--abc-news-topstories.html,"Missouri officer searching for teen after witnessing his incredible act of kindness originally appeared on abcnews.go.com

Police in Missouri are searching for a teenage boy who was seen by an officer performing an incredible act of kindness -- helping shield an elderly woman from the driving rain.

Officer Joe Holt of the Independence Police Department took to social media last week in hopes of finding the teen in question so he can reward him for his generosity.

Holt was sitting in his vehicle during a rainstorm when he saw the boy leave the back seat of a vehicle in and approach an elderly white female who was making her way back to her car.

The boy removed his coat and held it over the woman to protect her as she made her way through the parking lot.

""This young black male (teen) exited the backseat of a van he was in while it was pouring rain took his coat off and protected this elderly white female from the environment the best he could all the way to her car. He then walked back to his car all while not saying a word to his Auntie or Mom when he exited or re-entered,"" Holt wrote in a Facebook post for the department that's since gone viral.

Holt said he then followed the teen back to his car and approached the driver, the boy’s mother, to tell her of what he had just seen her son do for the elderly woman.

""His mom had no idea what was happening, because she thought she had done something wrong since I was in uniform,"" Holt said, describing the interaction. ""I told his mom that she has done amazing with him and I hope and pray he goes places. She started tearing up, because I was a cop and took time out of my day to call him out on what I witnessed.""

The officer was so touched by this encounter that he is hoping to get back in touch with the teenager so he can take him out to dinner to thank him for his kindness.

That's amazing.. California State Will Pay 2 Years Of Community College Tuition For First-Time Students,http://theinforadar.com/2019/08/california-state-will-pay-2-years-of.html,"Gavin Newsom Gorvernor of California Source: Getty images

California is the biggest state yet to join a growing nationwide push to pay the first two years of tuition for all first-time community college students.Governor Gavin Newsom will visit East LA College Thursday to talk about the expanded California College Promise program, which will now pay for two years of community college tuition for first-time, full-time college students in California.Free tuition to two-year colleges is an idea that has been gaining traction in California for years. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti launched a program that provided tuition at Los Angeles Community College District Schools for the first year, starting with LAUSD’s class of 2017.State lawmakers also proposed legislation to foot the bill for the first two years of tuition for first-time community college students. The bill estimated the cost at about $46 million a year.Newsom’s first state budget included paying for two years of community college for all first-time, full-time students by expanding the California College Promise program, which already paid for one year of community college tuition. The state’s 2019-2020 budget includes $42.6 million to support a second year of tuition for approximately 33,000 students, according to the governor’s office.“No one can argue with the fact that the full cost of attending institutions of higher learning is still far too high – both in California and across the country,” Newsom said in a statement. “But by offering two years of community college tuition-free, California is taking a meaningful step toward chipping away at the cost of higher learning for students and their families.”California Community Colleges is the largest system of higher education in the U.S., serving about 2.1 million students, roughly one-quarter of community college students in the nation."

"A pair of dead white dwarfs discovered zipping around each other every 7 minutes. The duo is the second-fastest such pair ever found, which means they should be strong emitters of gravitational waves that LISA may one day detect.",http://astronomy.com/news/2019/07/fastest-pair-of-white-dwarfs-ever-found-orbits-every-seven-minutes,"Fast Pair

Astronomers searching the night sky for objects that quickly blink or change have discovered the second-fastest orbiting pair of white dwarfs ever seen. At the end of their normal lives, our Sun and other stars like it become white dwarfs. Their outer layers puff away and leave behind a hot, dense core. And if those stars started life in a binary pair, as most stars do, then then they can end up in a tight, fast orbit, as the stars age and interact.But in the extreme world of binary white dwarfs, this new discovery, called ZTF J1539+5027, is an extreme case. The two tiny stars orbit each other every 6.91 minutes, within a space smaller than the planet Saturn. Researchers led by graduate student Kevin Burdge from the California Institute of Technology published their findings in the journal Nature on Wednesday. They first spotted the fast-changing system using the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory, before following up with the Kitt Peak 2.1-meter telescope in Arizona. The team points out that the system will be a perfect target for the upcoming LISA gravitational wave detector, set to launch in 2034.In their younger days, these stars probably orbited much farther apart. But identical twin stars are rare, and one usually starts off at least a little bigger than the other. This bigger star then races through its life a little quicker. That means that one star reaches its large and puffy phase while the other is still star-like, and they can end up sharing – or stealing – material from each other. In many cases, this trade-off forces the pair to spiral closer together.In this newly-found system, one of the stars is currently slightly larger than Earth but weighs about 60 percent the mass of our Sun. The other dwarf is puffier and a little larger in diameter but weighs only one-third of its companion. Already quite close, the two stars grow 10 inches closer per day, thanks to the energy they radiate away as gravitational waves.Such systems with clear gravitational wave emissions are expected to be common in the universe, but only a few have been positively identified so far. That may change when LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, launches in the 2030s. Like LIGO , which found colliding black holes in 2015, the instrument will hunt for the invisible ripples in space-time caused by gravitational waves. But LISA will hunt smaller prey, like these binary systems. And unlike many of LIGO’s sources, which can only be observed through gravitational waves, binary pairs like J1539 may yield extra information, appearing both through gravitational waves and visible light.While LISA isn’t ready for launch yet, scientists are excited to have a prime observing target already picked out, and know that LISA’s prey is out there, waiting to be observed.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Zwicky Transient Facility was located at Kitt Peak."

Great white shark drags fishing boat around San Francisco Bay for 2 miles: 'Everybody was just amazed',http://abcnews.go.com/US/great-white-shark-drags-fishing-boat-san-francisco/story?id=64339365,"Great white shark drags fishing boat around San Francisco Bay for 2 miles: 'Everybody was just amazed' The shark measured in between 6 and 8 feet.

A group of people sport fishing in the San Francisco Bay over the weekend got the shock of their life when a great white shark snagged their bait and dragged the boat around for two miles.

Joey Gamez, owner and captain of Golden State Sportfishing, told ABC News that he and six others set off Saturday morning with the intent of catching sevengill and soupfin sharks.

The boat was near the infamous Alcatraz island around 11 a.m. when a line that Gamez cast began to pull. The experienced fisherman assumed he was fighting a large sevengill, so the group pulled the anchor up and let the fish pull the 26-foot boat around for a bit while they tried to reel it in, he said.

""Once we got it to the top, we realized what kind of fish it was,"" Gamez said.

The shark dragged the boat for about an hour and two miles before Gamez carefully cut the line, he said.

Gamez estimated the shark to have measured somewhere between 6 to 8 feet.

""I really didn't get a good look at it,"" he said. ""I was kind of worried about getting it off the hook.""

Video posted to Facebook shows a fisherman struggling with the fishing pole for several minutes before the group realized what they had snagged.

""First time I've had to pull an anchor on a shark,"" Gamez said in the video. ""...Not sure what it is, but it's a big one.""

Minutes later, another fisherman took over to try and reel in the behemoth. Once the great white surfaced, they exclaimed in excitement before stating that they had to ""let it go.""

The great white bobbed along the side of the boat for several seconds before Gamez cut the line and it swam away with the bait.

The 42-year-old said he has been fishing in the area since he was a ""little kid"" and has never seen a great white in the bay, he said, adding that the whole group was ""stunned"" at the catch.

""Everybody was just amazed,"" Gamez said.

Last week, the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office issued an alert of great white sharks that were spotted nearby off the coast of Half Moon Bay, ABC San Francisco station KGO reported.

Gamez went back out on the water on Sunday but did not spot any more great whites, he said."

Mental health: How to talk about it with someone who needs help

Warning: Sensitive content

Laila’s arms are beautiful.

They are covered in tattoos — flowers, cherry blossom branches, bees, birds, a realistic baby pig and a calf too. High on her left arm, written in cursive it says: Cruelty Free.

And in this moment, those words seem to have a double meaning.

Underneath the images on the 27-year-old’s skin lies something much darker. From the age of 12 until 19 Laila self-harmed. The intricate tattoos cover those scars.

“I was suffering so much emotionally with things that were going on at home, I just picked up an implement and … that’s kind of how it started”, she recalls.

“I was hurting inside and it’s just what came to my mind to do to feel better.”

“My parents were fighting a lot,” Laila continues, “it was mostly shouting, but a lot of things getting broken, doors slamming. Sometimes it would get so violent the police would come.

“Me and my siblings didn’t feel like we had any control over that. It was just happening around us and it was almost every night. It was very hard.”

At high school, things got worse for Laila. She was bullied by her classmates.

“And then I got depression and it (the self-harm) just sort of spiralled,” she says, “I did it for seven years consecutively. And it was almost every day. I couldn’t wait for the day to be over so I could go home and do it.

“Self-harm is an addiction. Because it felt so relieving, I was addicted to feeling that comfort and escaping my reality,” Laila reflects.

Research from Orygen, the National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health, shows 24.4 per cent of young women and 18.1 per cent of young men aged 20-24 have self-injured in their lifetime. (And despite being a significant predictor of future suicide, it’s a highly stigmatised behaviour.)

For a year — between the ages of 18 and 19 — Laila stopped self-harming: “I was so proud of myself, but then something happened when I was 19 and I cut myself the worst that I ever had and I ended up in emergency.”

That “something” was a terrible breakup. She was full of hurt and guilt and explains that even though she’d been working on strategies to overcome the urge to self-harm, it was almost like “a reflex” when things went wrong. Her darkness was so profound that Laila recollects: “I wasn’t trying to kill myself, but I didn’t care either.”

Today — in 2019 — Laila’s life couldn’t be more different. She’s the smiling and happily-married mother of a gorgeous 17-month-old daughter; she hasn’t self-harmed for eight years.

One of the pivotal moments in her journey towards a better life was when she decided to get the scars on her right arm covered in tattoos in 2011.

“The cherry blossoms represent new life and new beginnings. So, to me, it’s like, ‘This is my new chapter’,” she says.

“I’ve never harmed myself again since I got this.”

Until recently Laila’s left arm — which was far more badly scarred — remained un-inked. In public, the way she was treated by others because of those marks could be especially confronting.

“I have seen parents staring, which obviously makes you uncomfortable because I just want to scream, ‘Hey, I’m a good parent!’” Laila tells me.

A few months ago Laila, who is passionate about animal rights, finally got her left arm covered in tattoos too. (Hence the “Cruelty Free” moniker.) It wasn’t a straightforward task, though. Deeper, rougher scars are harder to cover in ink — and some artists won’t work on that type of skin.

To undertake this tricky task, Laila turned to George and Jan Theodosiou, from Armani Artspace in Canberra. The husband and wife team are passionate about assisting clients who have previously self-harmed.

“We prefer disguising scars of all types with stippling or dot-style artwork (because) the dots take to the scar tissue more effectively than solid lines and shading do,” George explains. “With stippling, the dispersal of the ink over the two different skin surfaces isn’t as noticeable.”

George says with scar camouflage, tattooists aren’t trying to get rid of the damaged skin but rather draw the eye to the artwork. While he acknowledges that not everyone who has self-harmed will want their scars covered up, George wants people to be aware it’s an option. “(You) don’t have to live with this,” he says.

When it comes to tattooing, Jan’s speciality is dot work. Over a number of months, she tattooed the animals and flowers on Laila’s left arm.

“When you’ve got a visual of your pain, like a self-harm scar on your skin and you’re so afraid of being judged and you’ve suffered so much but you’ve moved past that and you want to have a fresh start, it’s very hard,” Jan says. “I felt exceptionally honoured that she trusted me to do this for her and to make this change.”

Jan says that in the process of tattooing Laila and the long hours they spent together, Laila explained she was anxious to go on play dates with her daughter because of the way she could be judged by the other parents. Once both her arms were covered in ink, the young mum was no longer afraid.

This is so profound that suddenly, all of three of us are crying — myself, Jan and Laila. (George is marginally holding it together.)

“People are so damn cliquey,” Jan says, “That just grabbed my heart when Laila told me that.”

For Laila, her metamorphosis was complete. Instead of judging her self-harm scars, strangers now see her tattoos and are curious about them.

“I can’t explain how life-changing it is to be able to wear a T-shirt on a hot day in front of people that you don’t know,” she says, “It is almost like armour because it’s protecting me from other people’s thoughts.”

Laila urges anyone struggling with self-harm to reach out for help.

“Finding somebody to open up to is difficult, and often when we’re battling self-harm and mental illness we either don’t think to ask for help or simply don’t want to,” she says. “But it’s a big step towards recovery, and a brighter future is possible.”

Laila is certainly proof of this.

Extraordinary footage shows manta ray appealing to diver for help,http://telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/12/extraordinary-footage-shows-manta-ray-appealing-diver-help/,"A giant manta ray has been filmed in Western Australia appearing to appeal a diver to help unlodge dangerous fish hooks that have become embedded in her right eye.

The extraordinary footage of the moving encounter between the injured sea creature and human divers was taken by Monty Halls, a British marine biologist who was part of a freediving group exploring Ningaloo Reef off Australia’s north west coast. Mr Halls called it “one of the best things I’ve ever seen underwater.”

The three-metre-wide manta, which is known affectionately to locals as Freckles, is seen swimming up to Jake Wilton, a snorkeling guide, and flipping over in the water, in what seems to be an attempt to show him her plight.

“You could see she trusted us because she was unrolling and showing us the hooks,” said Mr Wilton in the video. “I went down for a few dives to see how she’d react to us being close to her.”

The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company Mr Wilton works for."

The charity has so far trained 4,650 health care staff to use music to treat dementia, and it estimates that its volunteers have reached more than 21,000 people since 2015.

Given the lack of drugs for treating dementia, “our big interest in non-pharmaceutical approaches.” Lowndes told Reuters Health by phone

Through its Music Detective program, the Playlist for Life charity encourages families to speak to their relatives to find out which pieces of music trigger happy memories for them. Ideally, the playlists would be made before family members develop dementia.

A recent article in The Lancet Neurology describes a presentation earlier this year by Lowndes and University of Edinburgh psychiatrist Dr. Tom Russ at the Edinburgh Science Festival.

Founded in 2013, Playlist for Life was established by Scottish broadcaster Sally Magnusson, Lowndes explained in the presentation. When her mother developed dementia, Magnusson found that playing familiar music sparked memories and brought joy, so she created the charity to share the technique with others.

“Although her mother had almost lost the ability to use words, whenever Sally would sing the soundtrack of her life, her mother would still be able to sing the song from start to finish and harmonize beautifully,” Lowndes said. “Fragments of memories were connected to those personally meaningful songs.”

Playlist for Life volunteers aren’t certified music therapists, but they adhere to the 5th edition of the Gerdner protocol developed at Stanford University, according to the article, and they suggest timing the sessions 30 minutes before difficult activities, such as bathing.

To create a playlist, Lowndes recommends three steps.

First, check the top songs when the person was between ages the ages of 10 and 30, when many milestone memories are created. Playlist for Life created ""100 Years: A Century of Song,"" which lists the 100 most popular songs each year between 1915-2015. (bit.ly/2WZ8DMD)

Second, add “inheritance” tracks that stem from childhood memories or were contributed by best friends or former girlfriends or boyfriends.

“One of the songs on my playlist comes from My Fair Lady, which my father would put on every Sunday to see who would wash the dishes to not listen to the music,” Lowndes said with a chuckle.

Third, add “identity” tracks that connect with heritage, nationality and ethnicity. For instance, Lowndes is from Glasgow and wants to remember that heritage, so he added songs he heard as a child while attending church.

“People with dementia have emotions that are alive and can be retrieved, even in late stages, which can counteract the feeling that dementia destroys personality and erases what makes an individual unique,” said Antonio Cherubini of the National Institute of Rest and Care for the Elderly in Ancona, Italy. Cherubini wasn’t involved with the article in Lancet Neurology.

“The majority of patients develop behavioral disturbances, not only agitation and challenging behaviors, but also apathy and depression,” Cherubini told Reuters Health by email. “Drugs aren’t very effective at treating these and have side effects, so non-drug therapies that are effective should be evaluated and implemented.”

FDA Approves New Libido-Boosting Drug for Premenopausal Women,http://medscape.com/viewarticle/914779,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved bremelanotide (Vyleesi, AMAG Pharmaceuticals), a first-in-class melanocortin 4 receptor agonist for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women.

It joins flibanserin (Addyi, Sprout Pharmaceuticals), the only other FDA-approved HSDD treatment for premenopausal women.

The FDA had until June 23 to complete the review of bremelanotide's new drug application (NDA) under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).

HSDD affects approximately 10% of all premenopausal women in the United States, or about 6 million women, said Julie Krop, MD, chief medical officer and executive vice president of medical development and regulatory affairs at AMAG Pharmaceuticals.

""It is largely underrecognized,"" Krop told Medscape Medical News. ""These women have issues with their relationships; they often have issues concentrating at work and image difficulty. The effects extend way beyond the bedroom.""

Women and some physicians typically don't see it as a medical condition that can be treated. The women feel they are somehow ""broken,"" Krop said.

""It's similar to how depression was years ago — stigmatized and not really known to be a physiologic condition,"" she said.

Self-Administered With Autoinjector

Bremelanotide is designed to be self-administered subcutaneously with a disposable autoinjector at least 45 minutes before an anticipated sexual encounter, Krop said. Users don't see the needle and it can be pushed against the abdomen or thigh, she said.

It has a novel mechanism of action that adjusts the balance between the neural pathways that excite and inhibit to restore sexual desire.

Krop said AMAG expects the drug to be available by September, which is National Sexual Health Awareness month.

Bremelanotide was studied in two replicate phase 3 trials with more than 600 patients each, testing for both increase in desire and reduction in distress, the hallmarks of HSDD.

""We saw statistically significant and clinically important improvements in both those parameters,"" Krop said.

The most common adverse events were nausea, flushing, and headache.

Women in the trials tolerated autoinjection very well, Krop said. ""Ninety percent of them said they did not experience any difficulty.""

AMAG Pharmaceuticals licensed bremelanotide from Palatin Technologies, Inc, in February 2017.

More Options Critical

Anita Clayton, MD, chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences, and professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville, said having more options is crucial for women.

She compared bremelanotide with already-approved flibanserin, which is taken every night at bedtime, and acts through specific serotonin receptors (5-HT 1A agonism and 5-HT 2A antagonism) to reduce serotonin inhibition of sexual desire and arousal.

Each of the drugs works in about 50% of premenopausal women with HSDD, she told Medscape Medical News.

Clayton said there's no easy way to determine whether a woman has increased serotonin inhibition, reduced excitatory activity, or both. If her serotonin inhibition is increased, flibanserin may be best, Clayton said, but if excitatory activity has dropped, bremelanotide may be better.

If it's both, ""maybe a combination would be helpful, but it's not yet been studied,"" she said.

""Other medications are being studied, and I hope they also are approved so women have multiple options,"" Clayton added.

Also, some women may prefer daily dosing to have desire consistently (flibanserin), while some may prefer it just around the times when they desire sexual activity (bremelanotide), she noted.

""The side effects are generally well tolerated for both drugs. With flibanserin, the sedation is not a big problem as the drug is taken at bedtime. In fact, some women like the improved sleep,"" she said. ""Neither drug causes weight gain.""

Fred Wyand, director of communications for the American Sexual Health Association/National Cervical Cancer Coalition, told Medscape Medical News, ""We believe women have a right to sexual pleasure and satisfaction and there are few options available for women with sexual difficulties. Society is still conflicted about female sexuality to begin with, and it's gratifying to see some movement to recognize — and act on — issues of sexual functioning, though the pace is a bit slow.""

Krop is chief medical officer and executive vice president of medical development and regulatory affairs at AMAG. Clayton is a consultant to Sprout Pharmaceuticals and AMAG/Palatin Therapeutics. The American Sexual Health Association/National Cervical Cancer Coalition has received support from AMAG for a project on sex and aging.

Happy Ending For Dogs Caught Up In Wild Motor Home Chase Last Month,http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/06/14/happy-ending-for-dogs-caught-up-in-wild-motor-home-chase-last-month/,"WOODLAND HILLS (CBSLA) — The two dogs that broke — and stole — hearts during a harrowing pursuit of a stolen motor home last month, will have a happy ending to their story.

The two dogs escaped with their lives and as CBS2/KCAL9’s Amy Johnson reports, they’re now ready to start new ones.

They are ready to be adopted but there’s a catch. The dogs are going as a tandem.

Johnson explained how you could bring the life-long buddies to your home.

Onyx and Starlet are at a foster home and happily playing together.

They are both doing well and thriving. That wasn’t the cast last month when both got caught up in a live drama playing out on TV. The dogs endured fast speeds, wild turns and several crashes.

During the chase, Starlet could be seen perched up front. And then she jumped from the RV.

“It was horrifying,” says Terri Fox, president of Foxy and the Hounds, “I think we all heard screams around the country because everyone was glued to their televisions and we could not believe she jumped. And she fell on her back. We thought, oh my gosh, her back must be broken.”

Fox is also the founder of Foxy and the Hounds. Her friends and volunteers spent hours looking for the 1-year-old dog and found her with only minor injuries.

Onyx stayed with the suspect until the final crash and even ran with the woman when the chase ended.

“She had a broken paw,” says Fox, “and it was bloodied, as she was following her owner.”

Onyx even sat with the suspect as police took her into custody.

“That was the part that got me the most,” Fox says, “I could not believe this dog, that this woman almost killed, was still by her side running and chasing to just be with her. Dogs are incredible. And loyal to the end.”

Fox recommends that someone with experience handling large dogs apply to adopt them.

“They are incredible,” Fox says, “they are gentle giants. Cane Corsos and Mastiffs, by nature, are a great breed. They are big dogs. So we are very careful who we place them with. And we would like an experienced owner. They are incredible and they are very bonded. And we never separate bonded pairs — ever. So they will stay together forever.”

"Research group finds way to turn plastic waste products into jet fuel: ""We can recover almost 100 percent of the energy from the plastic we tested,"" Lei said. ""The fuel is very good quality, and the byproduct gasses produced are high quality and useful as well.""",http://phys.org/news/2019-06-group-plastic-products-jet-fuel.html,"Dr. Hanwu Lei and his research team in the lab, working to find a use for plastic waste. Credit: Washington State University

A research group led by Washington State University scientists has found a way to turn daily plastic waste products into jet fuel.

In a new paper published in the journal Applied Energy, WSU's Hanwu Lei and colleagues melted plastic waste at high temperature with activated carbon, a processed carbon with increased surface area, to produce jet fuel.

""Waste plastic is a huge problem worldwide,"" said Lei, an associate professor in WSU's Department of Biological System Engineering. ""This is a very good, and relatively simple, way to recycle these plastics.""

How it works

In the experiment, Lei and colleagues tested low-density polyethylene and mixed a variety of waste plastic products, like water bottles, milk bottles, and plastic bags, and ground them down to around three millimeters, or about the size of a grain of rice.

The plastic granules were then placed on top of activated carbon in a tube reactor at a high temperature, ranging from 430 degree Celsius to 571 degrees Celsius. That's 806 to 1,060 Fahrenheit. The carbon is a catalyst, or a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed by the reaction.

""Plastic is hard to break down,"" Lei said. ""You have to add a catalyst to help break the chemical bonds. There is a lot of hydrogen in plastics, which is a key component in fuel.""

Once the carbon catalyst has done its work, it can be separated out and re-used on the next batch of waste plastic conversion. The catalyst can also be regenerated after losing its activity.

After testing several different catalysts at different temperatures, the best result they had produced a mixture of 85 percent jet fuel and 15 percent diesel fuel.

Environmental impact

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, landfills in the U.S. received 26 million tons of plastic in 2015, the most recent year statistics are available. China has recently stopped accepting plastic recycling from the U.S. and Canada. Conservative estimates by scientists say that at least 4.8 million tons of plastic enters the ocean each year worldwide.

Not only would this new process reduce that waste, very little of what is produced is wasted.

""We can recover almost 100 percent of the energy from the plastic we tested,"" Lei said. ""The fuel is very good quality, and the byproduct gasses produced are high quality and useful as well.""

He also said the method for this process is easily scalable. It could work at a large facility or even on farms, where farmers could turn plastic waste into diesel.

""You have to separate the resulting product to get jet fuel,"" Lei said. ""If you don't separate it, then it's all diesel fuel.""

"Defying the years and one of the most fierce onslaughts he has ever faced at Roland Garros, Rafa Nadal won his 12th French Open crown on Sunday, leaving Dominic Thiem crushed and a packed Parisian stadium shaking their heads in wonder.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-frenchopen-nadal/nadal-beats-thiem-to-claim-record-stretching-12th-french-open-title-idUKKCN1TA0MS,"PARIS (Reuters) - Defying the years and one of the most fierce onslaughts he has ever faced at Roland Garros, Rafa Nadal won his 12th French Open crown on Sunday, leaving Dominic Thiem crushed and a packed Parisian stadium shaking their heads in wonder.

The first set had been one for the ages, the second ran it close, but after three hours and one minute all that mattered was that Nadal was once again in familiar pose, flat on his back on the clay, a 6-3 5-7 6-1 6-1 winner to clinch his 18th Grand Slam triumph in total.

Of them all, this was one of his most satisfying.

“Lots of issues with my knee recently... with my foot... too many issues the last few months which makes this last few weeks very, very special,” Nadal smiled to reporters, the large silver trophy at his side. “Physically and mentally I had been down.”

Who could have noticed?

Rarely, if ever, has any opponent played so well against Nadal on the Philippe Chatrier centre court as Thiem did on Sunday.

Rarely, if ever, has Thiem, the best of the young guns, struck the ball so firmly, or played with such purpose and aggression.

But it was not enough. Not nearly enough. Not even before Thiem ultimately ran out of steam.

The 33-year-old Nadal, who becomes the first player to win the same Grand Slam title 12 times, going past Margaret Court’s 11 Australian Opens, now sits two major titles behind his great foe and men’s Grand Slam title record holder, 37-year-old Roger Federer.

“It’s incredible,” Nadal told the crowd. “For me it was a dream to play here in 2005 and I could not imagine I would be back here in 2019. It’s a very special moment for me.”

Afterwards he would not be drawn on his Grand Slam title chase with Federer. “Your neighbour has a nicer house than you... or a bigger TV, or better garden... I don’t see life like this,” he laughed.

MENTAL TOLL

Physically, Thiem had looked strong and resolute but who can say what mental toll his rain-delayed semi-final victory over world number one Novak Djokovic had taken?

The Austrian had had to play on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and now Sunday while Nadal had enjoyed Saturday off, having dispatched Federer on Friday before the rain set in.

Certainly it would have taken a monumental effort to remain mentally positive after playing an opening set as he did, and coming out of it empty handed.

Thiem slammed backhands for all they were worth, cleaned the lines with his forehand, and the sonic boom from his serve resonated around the court.

He grabbed the first break of the match to lead the opener 3-2 but four games later it was all over, 6-3 to Nadal, the Spaniard seemingly another inexorable step towards the crown.

CROWD ERUPTED

It speaks volumes for the world number four Austrian that Thiem came out for the second set in the same fashion -- throwing absolutely everything imaginable at his opponent.

Games passed with no break points in sight, and the tension ratcheted ever higher until the 12th game of the set when it snapped. Nadal rifled a two-fisted backhand just long to hand the levelling set to Thiem.

The French crowd erupted. Thiem clenched his fist. Nadal strode to the sidelines.

Slideshow ( 15 images )

But within a flash Nadal had the upper hand again, winning 16 of the next 17 points to lead 4-0 before Thiem could even register any objection. A blink later the set was over, 6-1.

If Thiem had muttered ‘plus ca change’, he would have been forgiven. So much effort to claw his way back, so little to show for it now.

“I had a little drop and he was coming out in the third set like a rocket... full power,” Thiem later said, as he processed the result.

Few people on the planet can hit a backhand like Thiem, even once. To do it time after time after time is boggling, but that is what it would take to unseat Nadal.

Still the Spaniard rolled on, soaking up Thiem’s best shots, and the cliche beloved of numerous science fiction films and television series seemed appropriate: “Resistance is futile”.

So it proved until Thiem’s final ball drifted long and Nadal was again flat on his back, adopting the pose that will adorn back pages and websites worldwide.

By this stage, Thiem, too, could only look on in admiration.

“You are such a legend in our sport,” he said to Nadal.

Later the Austrian reflected: “It’s obviously the most difficult thing in our sport to win one of the four majors. I’m happy... I gave myself already two opportunities to win one of these.

“Many -- or all — guys fail to (beat Nadal) in Roland Garros finals. Just the numbers are crazy. He won it 12 times. Twelve times the opponents in the finals failed to beat him... so, also me.”"
Jacinda Ardern's 'wellbeing' budget spreads good vibes in New Zealand,http://thestatesman.com/world/jacinda-arderns-wellbeing-budget-spreads-good-vibes-new-zealand-1502760281.html,"New Zealand unveiled its inaugural “wellbeing” budget Thursday in a move set to cement Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s reputation for compassionate leadership in the wake of the Christchurch mosque massacre.

Ardern announced increased spending on mental health, indigenous welfare and child poverty in a budget she described as a world-first attempt to change the way economic progress is measured.

“We said that we would be a government that did things differently, and for this budget, we have done just that,” she said.

“Today we have laid the foundation for not just one wellbeing budget, but a different approach for government decision-making altogether.” While dismissed by critics as marketing spin, Ardern views the budget as a way to deliver the reformist agenda she campaigned on in the 2017 election.

The New Zealand leader, widely praised for her respectful handling of the March shooting in which 51 Muslim worshippers were gunned down, said the budget put people before economic indicators.

On the economic front, it predicts a surplus of NZ$3.5 billion in 2018-19, rising to NZ$6.1 billion by 2022-23.

It optimistically forecasts economic growth will average 2.7 per cent over the same period, with inflation hovering around 2.0 per cent and unemployment slightly over 4.0 per cent.

Wellbeing factors, such as life expectancy, education levels, air quality and “a sense of belonging” were also factored into budget decisions.

The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan first floated the idea of prioritising happiness overgrowth in the early 1970s and introduced a Gross National Happiness Index in 2008.

Many other nations have adopted similar concepts but the New Zealand attempt is being touted as the first time it has been at the core of a government’s spending decisions.

Opposition finance spokeswoman Amy Adams described the approach as a gimmick, calling the budget “all spin and no substance”.

“Apparently it’s about measuring your sun and moon feelings, improving your locus of control, and understanding your ability to be yourself,” she said.

“I have no idea what that means and, outside the Wellington bureaucracy, I’m not sure anyone does,” Ardern argued the wellbeing approach provides real-world benefits, citing reducing child poverty and family violence as a practical example of how it works.

“When our children do better, we all do better,” she said.

“Breaking the cycle of violence saves us costs down the line, but more importantly it makes us a better country and makes children’s lives richer and more fulfilling.” But her feelgood message was almost overshadowed by a bureaucratic bungle that resulted in parts of the budget being released prematurely.

The error resulted in police being called in amid fears the Treasury Department, which is responsible for the budget, had fallen victim to a sophisticated cyber attack.

Initially, Treasury chief Gabriel Makhlouf rejected “absolutely” any suggestion the information had been accidentally posted online.

Makhlouf, who will leave his position next month to become governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, was forced into an embarrassing back down Thursday after police found no evidence that illegal activity was behind the leak.

Instead, the information was released when Treasury prepared a “clone” website ahead of the budget release, not realising that entering specific search terms on it revealed embargoed information.

The opposition National Party, which released the leaked information earlier this week, called for Makhlouf’s resignation, saying he had implied the party was behind an illegal hack.

“Clearly his position is not tenable,” National leader Simon Bridges told reporters.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson, the minister responsible for the budget, expressed disappointment at Treasury’s handling of the matter while Makhlouf did not attend the budget’s unveiling at parliament, contrary to normal practice."

"Improved air quality tied to fewer new childhood asthma cases. (Reuters Health) - Childhood asthma rates appear to be dropping in many communities across southern California, and a new study suggests this may be due at least in part to improved air quality.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-pollution-child-asthma/improved-air-quality-tied-to-fewer-new-childhood-asthma-cases-idUKKCN1SR23I,"(Reuters Health) - Childhood asthma rates appear to be dropping in many communities across southern California, and a new study suggests this may be due at least in part to improved air quality.

Air pollution has long been linked to a variety of respiratory problems and an increased risk of severe asthma attacks for people who already have the breathing disorder. But research to date hasn’t offered as clear a picture of how much reducing levels of toxic chemicals in the air might help stop asthma from developing at all.

For the current study, researchers followed 4,140 kids without asthma for eight years, starting in 1993 when children were in fourth grade and typically around 9 to 10 years old. The study spanned two decades and included three cohorts of children living in one of nine southern California communities with historically poor air quality.

Regional air pollution levels generally declined during the study period, with decreases in nitrogen dioxide, ozone gasses and fine particulate matter, researchers report in JAMA.

Asthma rates also dropped. While 2.7 new asthma cases were diagnosed annually per 100 kids in the first cohort (1993-2001), this dropped to 1.8 cases a year per 100 kids by the last cohort (2006- 2014).

“Exposure to air pollution is a known risk factor for the exacerbation of pre-existing asthma,” said lead study author Erika Garcia, an environmental health researcher at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

“What distinguishes our study is that we are not looking at exacerbation of pre-existing asthma, but at the contribution of air pollution exposure to the development of new cases of asthma in children,” Garcia said by email. “We found that reductions in air pollution, specifically nitrogen dioxide, were related to reduction in rates of new-onset asthma in children.”

The pollutants in the study have long been associated with traffic fumes and smog blanketing Los Angeles and many surrounding communities in southern California.

Researchers examined concentrations of ozone, an unstable form of oxygen produced when various types of traffic and industrial pollution react with sunlight; nitrogen dioxide, a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion that can contribute to smog; so-called PM 2.5, a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter that can include dust, dirt, soot and smoke; and PM 10, a blend of particles and droplets up to 10 micrometers in diameter.

Reductions in levels of the pollutants varied across communities over two decades. But at least half experienced reductions of 4.3 parts per billion (ppb) in annual average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, as well as reductions of 8.9 ppb ozone, 8.1 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air (ug/m3), and 4 ug/m3 of PM10.

Neighborhoods where pollution levels were highest in 1993 experienced the greatest reductions, the study team notes.

They study wasn’t designed to prove whether or how declines in air pollution exposure might directly reduce childhood asthma rates, and it also didn’t look at changes in the frequency or severity of symptoms for kids who did develop asthma.

“I don’t think we have enough data to say that early life exposure increases the risk of severe asthma per se,” said Dr. Steve Georas, an environmental medicine researcher at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.

“But it is clear that acute exposure to poor air quality increases the risk of asthma exacerbations, which is a marker of asthma severity,” Georas, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “It seems logical to speculate that improving the air quality that children with asthma breathe would improve their disease control and possibly lead to a sustained remission of the disease, but we can’t conclude that from this present study.”

A CBD potato is being developed in Idaho - this is our state's best idea since the TV!,http://theboisetimes.com/post/idaho-scientists-develop-first-cbd-potato,"The Idaho based J.R. Simplot Company has announced the successful production of the first ever CBD Potato.

Cannabidiol, the chemical most commonly extracted from Hemp and Marijuana, has now been produced inside of a potato.





The substance, known to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, movement disorders, and pain, has the potential to revolutionize the potato industry.





“This is truly groundbreaking,” said Carl Burbank, Head Scientist of Research at Simplot. “These potatoes are generally easy to grow, they’re quick to mature, and they taste great.”





The potato, developed under the once-secret project Chemically Balanced Dog ""CBD,"" could face legal roadblocks. Traces of THC, the psychoactive substance in Marijuana that produces a high, has been found in the potato.





This may be why it has been named the ‘Mary Jane’ potato.





“We’ve been working ‘round the clock here to get the THC levels below .3 percent,” Burbank said. “Which is the legal maximum allowed in Idaho.”





Under Idaho law any plant containing more than .3 percent THC is illegal.





“It’s taken a lot of persuading to get this project off the ground,” Burbank continued. “When we realized our potatoes were getting our test takers high, we decided to move our operations to Oregon.”





Simplot scientists have been commuting to an undisclosed location in Oregon to continue their research. Burbank has high hopes for the potato plant.





""...potatoes may be able to outproduce Marijuana...""





“Pound for pound, our potatoes may be able to outproduce Marijuana as the largest source of both CBD and THC. If we can get Idaho to legalize, then maybe we can bring our research back to the potato state.”





Simplot hasn’t been shy about the products potential applications. From CBD infused french-fries, mashed potatoes, and hashbrowns, the Mary Jane potato could be consumed with every meal.





Local Boise Chef Marla Pound said she was excited to incorporate the potato into her menu.





“I absolutely love the idea of the Mary Jane potato,” Pound said, during an interview on restaurant row in downtown Boise. “Image having your customers leave your restaurant relaxed and happy. You could give them terrible service, but they’d be so relaxed that the wouldn’t care. Image what that will do for your Yelp reviews?”





Although the Mary Jane potato originated in the potato state, Idaho may be one of the last places where it comes to market. Governor Brad Little and the State Legislature have repeatedly stated that Marijuana and any THC products will remain illegal, even for medicinal use.





“For now, our target market won’t be Idaho,” Burbank said. “But someday, we hope that’ll change.”"
Girl saves best friend from choking the day after learning Heimlich maneuver,http://theweek.com/speedreads/840077/girl-saves-best-friend-from-choking-day-after-learning-heimlich-maneuver,"""This campaign has gone on for an eternity,"" but there are only six days left until the voting stops, Stephen Colbert said on Wednesday's Late Show.

Yes, ""Donald Trump's gonna get your husbands back to work so you can get all your lady chores done — like voting for Joe Biden.""

Meanwhile, the coronavirus is spreading everywhere, fast, hitting ""500,000 new cases in just the past week,"" Colbert said. ""Clearly, we're a long way from ending the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, yesterday a new White House press released announced that one of Trump's biggest accomplishments is 'ending the COVID-19 pandemic.' Now while that is clearly insane, declaring victory prematurely is a proud Republican tradition.""

Colbert also joined the mockery of Kim Kardashian West's private-island birthday party. ""I'm just worried they're gonna give rich people who do whatever they want on a private island a bad name,"" he deadpanned. ""See you soon, Richard Branson!""

""I wonder if anyone told [Kardashian] she's allowed to have a party and not post pictures of it,"" Jimmy Kimmel mused on Kimmel Live. ""People really went nuts on this one. They're saying this could potentially derail Kanye's presidential campaign."" Meanwhile, ""members of Trump's own coronavirus task force are said to be personally offended by a release from the White House yesterday that claimed, among other things, that the president ended the pandemic,"" he said, adding dryly, ""You won't see that on MSDNC.""

Trump claiming he ended the COVID-19 pandemic is ""like the Tampa Bay Rays listing their biggest accomplishment as '2020 World Series Champions,'"" Jimmy Fallon said at The Tonight Show. ""Keep in mind, though, the White House 'Science' office is just Eric and Don Jr. wearing Bill Nye Halloween costumes,"" he added.

The coonhound’s tale of scaring off a man who police say broke into a Waynesboro home to abduct a child has been featured on Fox News, People magazine and Inside Edition, among other national media outlets. He may appear live on CBS This Morning later this week, said Thom Lambert, who along with his wife and three daughters, adopted Edgar from the local humane society last year.

On Wednesday, Edgar won a Heroics Award from PETA, the world’s largest animal rights organization.

""When this dog sensed that his family was in danger, he immediately sounded the alarm and defended them,"" said PETA Vice President Colleen O'Brien in a news release. ""The Lamberts saved Edgar, and he saved them back—and PETA encourages anyone who's inspired by this story to consider providing a dog or cat who's waiting at a local animal shelter with a lifelong home.""

A framed award certificate is being mailed to Edgar, along with a bag of toys and vegan dog treats.

Other swag headed Edgar’s way includes a special doggy cake baked by a local woman who makes canine birthday cakes and a shower of toys and treats from a local Boy Scout Troop that wants to “pay their respects,” Thom Lambert said.

The Lamberts also were invited to be the featured guests at a coonhound-rescue event where 150 coonhounds and their new families gathered to celebrate pet adoption.

The positive attention on Edgar and rescuing homeless animals is the silver lining to a scary crime that could have turned tragic, but for Edgar’s aggressive barking in the middle of the night April 28.

The Lambert family was asleep when Edgar started “losing his mind,” and barking in a way the family had only heard once before.

“It was pure rage,” Thom Lambert said.

Thom Lambert then heard footsteps scrambling down the stairs. When Lambert ran downstairs to see what was going on, he saw his window and kitchen door wide open, when both had been securely closed and locked when they went to bed.

As it turned out, police said Thomas Dewald, 20, had broken into their house to abduct one of the girls, ages 3 to 8. But he told police he heard the dog barking and knew the dog meant business so he fled.

Dewald had abducted a 4-year-old girl just three nights prior, police said, but she had inexplicably escaped from the wooden box where he had locked her at a relative’s home where he was living while he went to work.

Police believe Dewald hit the Lambert’s house to get another child. But Edgar was ready for him.

“It’s almost like he knew the danger,” Thom Lambert said of Edgar’s relentless barking during the break-in. “He was always such a laid-back dog, and he seemed like a big dummy in a lot of ways. But it just shows how much we underestimated his importance to the security and well-being of our home.”

Since the incident, Edgar has been acting protectively of the children, Lambert said. He said he will follow the youngest from the front door to the van each day when she goes to school.

Edgar is enjoying his new “hero” status, Thom Lambert said. He was always a wanderer, visiting various neighbors’ houses when he was outside. The Lamberts couldn’t keep him in their yard. But now when Edgar wanders, he’s less likely to get any dirty looks or complaints. Instead, everyone is really sweet to Edgar, Thom Lambert said, even when he tries to eat a dirty diaper in someone’s back yard.

“Yea, he’s got a hall pass right now,” Thom Lambert said. “Prior to his savior status he was sometimes known as a menace to the neighborhood.”

Personally, Thom Lambert hasn’t minded all the attention and news interviews. While it has forced him to repeatedly retell the story of the near-abduction of one of his children, he finds the additional conversations therapeutic.

With the awards, attention and accolades, the only thing that would make it better would be a call from Ellen DeGeneres to be a guest on her show, one of the Lamberts’ favorite programs.

“That would be a dream,” Thom Lambert said, to be able to introduce Edgar to Ellen.

But she hasn’t called yet."

"Kendrick Ray Castillo, the 18-year-old who sacrificed his life to save other students during a shooting in a suburban Denver high school, loved robotics, helping out the elderly in his community and making people laugh, his friend told Reuters.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-colorado-shooting-victim/kendrick-castillo-selfless-teen-killed-in-colorado-school-shooting-loved-robotics-helping-the-elderly-idUKKCN1SE2MI,"(Reuters) - Kendrick Ray Castillo, the 18-year-old who sacrificed his life to save other students during a shooting in a suburban Denver high school, loved robotics, helping the elderly in his community and making people laugh, his friend told Reuters.

Cece Bedard, who knew Castillo since elementary school, said she broke down in tears when she heard her friend had died but was not surprised at his selfless act.

“There is no doubt in my mind that he would have done anything he thought he could have to help anyone,” Bedard said on Wednesday.

Two teenagers are accused of opening fire on fellow students on Tuesday at the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) School in Highlands Ranch, about 25 miles (40 km) south of Denver, killing Castillo and wounding eight other students.

Witnesses said Castillo, who was due to graduate in three days, charged at one of the shooters.

“Kendrick lunged at him,” senior Nui Giasolli told NBC News, referring to the older of the two shooting suspects, Devon Erickson, 18, who was being held on Wednesday on murder and attempted murder charges.

“He shot Kendrick, giving all of us enough time to get underneath our desks, to get ourselves safe, and to run across the room to escape,” Giasolli said.

Fellow student, Brendan Bialy, a U.S. Marine recruit who also charged the shooter with a third student, described Castillo as an unstoppable bowling ball.

“Basically when he gets moving there’s no stopping him,” Bialy said in an interview with multiple media outlets, including Denver’s Fox News affiliate, late on Wednesday.

Bialy said his friend showed no hesitation.

Bedard said she and Castillo both volunteered with their fathers at the local chapter of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic men’s community service organisation, when they were in middle school.

Castillo loved tagging along with his father to volunteer with the Knights of Columbus, whether it involved carrying heavy crates of fruit for a peach drive or setting up senior lunches. He was especially good at connecting with the elderly people he served, Bedard said.

“He was always there earlier than I was and was always there later than I was,” she said.

His friends remembered Castillo as a goofy jokester, although his humour was never at anyone’s expense, Bedard said. He had a strong sense of self and did not care what other people thought of him, a trait that made him stand out among his peers.

Castillo was also a member of a regional robotics team, another community that was mourning his loss on Wednesday.

“We’re heartbroken by the death of Kendrick Castillo ... Kendrick was a member of @Frc4418, of which his father is Lead Mentor,” FIRST, a national nonprofit organisation dedicated to advancing youth in STEM, said on Twitter.

Bialy said Castillo was not a victim but someone who jumped into action.

“I love that kid,” Bialy said. “He died a trooper. He got his ticket to Valhalla, and I know he will be with me for the rest of my life.”

"Thanks to women, India is on its way to beat all voting records",http://qz.com/india/1611381/voter-turnout-in-indian-election-2019-set-to-break-record/,"India’s 2019 parliamentary election is likely to see the highest voter turnout ever.

After four phases, the voting percentage in the country stood at 67%, almost comparable to 67.6% in the entire 2014 election.

Going by the current numbers, a marginal 1% increase in the voter turnout could see India witness highest-ever voter turnout in its election history, according to a May 02 report released by the economic research department of the State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender.

The report, however, pointed out that in the delayed elections of 1985 in two states, Assam and Punjab, voter turnout stood at 72%. The average turnout for 1984 and 1985, stood at 67.9%.

In fact, going by the current trends, the 2019 edition is proving to be unique in many respects.

States like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, and Karnataka have witnessed the highest ever voter turnouts since 1962. Chhattisgarh has seen a 15-year and Maharashtra a 30-year high.

This proves that extensive and continuous campaigns by multiple stakeholders such as the election commission, government, and the civil society at large have succeeded.

Encouragingly, the report said, women voters—previously missing from electoral process mostly due to various socio-economic reasons—have come out in huge numbers this time. This could be attributed to schemes like Jan-Dhan Mudra (aimed at extending micro-finance to small businesses) and Ujjwala (providing women access to clean source of energy for cooking).

What’s also interesting is that young voters, a segment that is historically seen as a reluctant group, are also out in higher numbers. There is a 3.3% increase in voter turnout in states like Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh (partial), and Rajasthan (partial) where the share of younger voters (aged between 18-25) is more than the national average, according to SBI report.

Yet, the elderly, too, are making their presence felt strongly. In Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala, where the elderly population is higher than the national average, voter turnout is up 1.8%, according to the SBI report.

The states are also voting independent of their socio-economic condition. The SBI report noted that western India, home to states with relatively less poverty, is seeing better voter turnout in 2019 vis-à-vis 2014.

Southern Indian states also have lower levels of deprivation, and with the exception of Tamil Nadu, they have improved their voter turnout. For instance, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala have registered an improvement in voter turnout to the tune of 5.2% and 3.8% respectively from 2014.

In comparison, the performance has fallen for northeastern states like Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Sikkim, and Nagaland, all spread across the spectrum from low-to-high poverty levels. It has increased for Manipur, Meghalaya, Assam, and Mizoram, though.

In Odisha and Chhattisgarh, two states high up on the multi-dimensional poverty index (MPI) scale, turnout has fallen in the first and increased in the second.

Sigourney Weaver surprises students after encore performance of viral 'Alien' play,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sigourney-weaver-surprises-students-encore-performance-viral-alien/story?id=62670197,"Sigourney Weaver surprises students after encore performance of viral 'Alien' play Weaver starred as Ellen Ripley in the 1979 film.

A New Jersey high school was remade into the starship Nostromo one more time Friday night -- and its most famous crew member dropped in for a surprise visit.

'Alien: The Play' returned to the stage at North Bergen High School one month after it took the internet by storm -- thanks to its elaborate costumes, stage design and nostalgia for the original film, released in 1979.

The drama club only had enough money to put the production on for two nights in March, but the director of the film, Ridley Scott, ponied up $5,000 after the performance went viral.

The students chose Friday, to honor the 40th anniversary of the film, for a packed show.

One of those in attendance: Sigourney Weaver, who starred as protagonist Ellen Ripley in the film.

Weaver got a chance to meet the students who put on the play after the performance, and to say they were starstruck is an understatement.

Student Gabriella Delacruz, who played Ripley in the stage version, called it ""unreal.""

""I really can't believe it,"" she told New York ABC station WABC. ""Playing Ripley, honestly, has been such an honor, just considering how monumental her character was in moving forward strong women roles.""

""Our one girl that plays Ripley was just hugging her, she couldn't believe it,"" the play's director, Perfecto Cuervo, said. ""It was great. It was pretty awesome; it's just a great validation of what we did today.""

The New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts offered a surprise of its own after the show. Each of the members of the cast and crew received a $1,000 scholarship to the program's summer camp, while the graduating seniors -- including an almost-literally floored Delacruz -- with a $10,000 scholarship for college.

North Bergen Mayor Nicholas Sacco captured the moment on his Twitter account.

When the original production grabbed the internet's attention a month ago, both Weaver and Scott sent their well wishes.

""My hat comes off to all of your creativity, imagination and determination to produce such an ambitious show,” Scott wrote in a letter to the drama club posted by Cuervo. ""Limitations often produce the best results because imagination and determination can surpass any shortfalls and determine the way forward — ALWAYS.""

Weaver delivered a video message, saying, ""It looked incredible. You put so much heart and soul into that. And the alien, I must say, looked very real.""

""You know the alien might still be around,"" she joked. ""So when you’re opening your locker, just do it very slowly.""

News about global warming can be sobering stuff, and some visual presentations are particularly effective at conveying the bad news. As serious as climate change is, though, it’s important to remember that we have some serious responses. A new way of looking at US wind and solar progress helps make that eminently clear.

Sobering graphic

If you, like me, find yourself at times swinging between a sense of the challenge of climate change on the one hand, and the excitement of clean energy on the other, you might appreciate the need for balance and perspective.

The progression of our effects on the global climate are captured powerfully (and frighteningly) in a viral graphic from UK climate scientist Ed Hawkins that shows variations in global temperatures since 1850. While it varies by month and year, the trend shown in the GIF is really (really) clear: The passing years have brought higher and higher temperatures.

Serious, sobering stuff, given all that comes with that global warming.

So it seems like we need things to counterbalance graphics like that, at least in part—not to take the pressure off, but to remind ourselves of where we’re making important progress, and laying the groundwork for a whole lot more.

Graphical remedy

One option is to take a look at what’s going on with clean energy in the power sector—and wind and solar, in particular, which have been marvels to behold in recent years.

A new graphic does just that, looking at the shared contribution of wind and solar to our nation’s electricity generation, in much the same way as the Hawkins graphic does: month in and month out, as the years roll by. Here it is:

The graphic, from the Union of Concerned Scientists, draws on electric power sector data from the US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA), and includes wind power, large-scale solar, and (importantly, given that it too often gets ignored) the increasingly significant contribution from small-scale/rooftop solar.

And this little GIF has a lot to say. It begins with wind and solar’s humble status early last decade, when wind barely registered, and solar wasn’t a factor at all. From there the spiral sure picks up steam, as each year has brought online more wind turbines (now 58,000 and climbing) and more solar panels (on nearly 2 million American rooftops, and far beyond).

On a monthly basis, the contribution of wind and solar has shot past 3% (2010), past 6% (early 2013), past 12% (April 2018)—where every additional 1% is the equivalent of more than 4 million typical US households’ electricity consumption. And on an annual basis, that progress has translated into the electricity contribution from just those two technologies going from 1 in every 71 kilowatt-hours in 2008 to 1 in every 11 in 2018.

And the graphic clearly conveys the momentum poised to carry solar and wind far beyond. There’s a lot more progress coming, it declares—clean energy milestones to be watching out for (and making happen).

Why it matters

To be clear, the new graphic and all that it represents shouldn’t cause us to lose sight of what really matters: from a climate perspective, what’s happening to overall carbon emissions, and the resulting temperature changes. It’ll take a lot more clean energy—a lot less fossil energy—in our electricity mix to help us deal with climate change.

But the progress on clean energy is really important because of the power sector’s still-substantial contributions to our carbon pollution, and the need for a lot more action. And that progress also matters because the power sector is crucial for cutting carbon pollution from other sectors, through electrification of stuff like transportation (think electric vehicles) and home heating (heat pumps!).

That’s why keeping our eyes on stats like these is key: We need to celebrate the progress we’re making, even as we push for so much more.

Sartorial solar splendor on its way?

Meanwhile, it turns out that the Hawkins graphic in stripe form has gone on to become the basis for a line of must-have clothing and more.

We can hope that the good news about the progress of US solar and wind becomes just as desirable a fashion accessory.

"Massive flare erupts from tiny, ultra-cool star, boosting its brightness by 10,000-fold. Located 250 light-years away, the small star is barely larger than a brown dwarf, yet the flare was 10 times more powerful than the Sun's strongest known flare.",http://astronomy.com/news/2019/04/tiny-star-flares-10-times-brighter-than-the-sun,"On August 13, 2017, the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) telescope spotted an intense solar flare from a tiny star barely bigger than Jupiter. But despite this star’s diminutive size, the flare gave off as much energy as 80 billion megatons of TNT. That’s 10 times as powerful as the strongest flare ever observed on our own Sun. It’s also the coolest star ever observed to give off such a hot flare, and the spectacular outburst is teaching astronomers the power of small stars.

Light it up

The tiny star bears the unwieldly name ULAS J224940.13-011236.9 and sits 250 light-years from Earth. In fact, classified as an L dwarf, it only barely qualifies as a star. “Any lower in mass and it would definitely be a brown dwarf,” said James Jackman, lead author of the discovery paper, in a press release. Brown dwarfs are sub-stars, too big to count as a planet, but too small to sustain the nuclear fusion in their cores that defines a star. Most telescopes, including NGTS, can’t even see dim little ULAS J2249−0112 during normal times. But the flare lit up the star clearly in the data, boosting it to 10,000 times its normal brightness. Jackman and his team published their findings April 17 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters.

Because flares last only a few minutes – this one was visible for 9.5 minutes – it takes luck or a special instrument like NGTS, which looks at wide patches of the sky over quick time intervals, to spot such phenomena."
"A meteor from another solar system may have hit Earth, and the implications are fascinating !!",http://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/17/us/interstellar-meteor-object-harvard-study-scn-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) It could take humanity hundreds, if not thousands, of years to develop the capability to explore interstellar space. Until then, interstellar space can just come to us.

A message in a bottle

Think about it: An object, originating untold miles and millennia away, just plopping into the sea. The implications are as vast and mysterious as the wide open space from which it came.

""Almost all of the objects that hit the Earth originate for the solar system,"" explains Dr. Abraham Loeb, the chair of the Department of Astronomy at Harvard University , and the co-atuhor of the study. ""They are made of the same materials that made the solar system. Those that are interstellar originate from another source. It's sort of like getting a message in a bottle from a distant location. We can actually examine it, just as if we were walking on the beach and looking at the seashells that are swept ashore, we could learn something about the ocean.""

A time capsule

Loeb and his co-author Amir Siraj studied the velocity of objects entering the Earth's atmosphere, which can be used to predict whether the object was traveling in relation to our sun's orbit.

""What we did was take the properties of the meteor and take the velocity at the time of impact and extrapolate whether it was bound to the sun or not,"" Loeb says. Of the three fastest objects on record, the fastest was clearly bound to our sun. The third-fastest couldn't be clearly categorized. But the second-fastest, Loeb says, bore all the hallmarks of being literally out of this solar system.

""At this speed, it takes tens of thousands of years for a object to move from one star to another,"" he says. Since they don't know exactly where it originated, they can't say exactly how old it is, but it could be downright ancient. ""To cross the galaxy it would take hundreds of millions of years.""

A potential sign of life

Of all of the possibilities wrapped up in this relatively small object, perhaps the most exciting is the idea that, theoretically, interstellar objects could carry life from other solar systems.

""Most importantly, there is a possibility that life could be transferred between stars,"" Loeb says. ""In principle, life could survive in the core of a rock. Either bacteria, or tardigrades (a microscopic, water-dwelling animal); they can survive harsh conditions in space and arrive right to us.""

Mindblowing? Just a little bit. And although the object detailed in this paper is the first recorded interstellar meteor to hit Earth, the study estimates such objects enter earth's atmosphere every ten years or so, which means there could be a million different interstellar objects floating around our solar system, just waiting to be examined."
Alex Trebeck Is An Amazing Guy,http://pagesix.com/2019/04/17/jeopardy-host-alex-trebek-gives-health-update-amid-cancer-battle/,"“Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek, who was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in March, gave a postive health update on the last day of taping the current season of the trivia show.

“Some of you may recall that at the beginning of this season, I promised you that we had some surprises for you,” he said in a video message posted Wednesday. “Well, of course, I had no idea at that time that there were some surprises in store for me as well. So here, on the last day of taping for our 35th anniversary season, I wanted once again to thank you for your continuing messages of encouragement and support, particularly the many cards I’ve received from young people. I’m touched beyond words.”

He continued, “I’ve always tried to be straight with you and I’m not going to stop now, so despite what you may have heard, I’m feeling good, I’m continuing with my therapy and we, by we, the staff, is already working on our next season, the 36th year of ‘Jeopardy!'”

He ended the message on a hopeful note, stating, “I look forward to seeing you once again in September with all kinds of good stuff.”

When Trebek, 78, first announced the diagnosis, he pledged to fight the disease.

“Truth told, I have to because under the terms of my contract, I have to host ‘Jeopardy!’ for three more years, so help me. Keep the faith and we will win. We will get it done,” he said at the time."
"California declared drought free after more than 7 years, experiences beautiful super bloom.",http://educateinspirechange.org/nature/california-is-finally-drought-free-after-over-7-years-experiences-most-beautiful-super-bloom/,"Nearly 100 percent of the state has been classified as being free of drought. This has been a result of one of the wettest winters that has replenished lakes, reservoirs throughout the state.

A first in 7 years – California has been officially declared drought-free.

In turn, the most beautiful flora has emerged all because of an unusually abundant winter with heavy rain and snow fall.

According to the U.S. Drought Monitor’s latest survey, “There has been an extraordinary turnaround from the dire and prolonged spells of dry weather that had been the norm in recent years in the state.”

These same dry spells have wreaked absolute havoc on irrigation supplies to farmers and vegetation, causing strict water restrictions throughout households. Along with that came a spate of disastrous wildfires.

Not all of the state have however joined in on the party. A smallish patch of the southernmost region including the majority of San Diego County are still buttoned up and are currently labeled “abnormally dry” on the drought map index. The Oregon border is also still in a threatening state.

This is a first since December 2011 and nearly 100% of the state has been declared drought-free. Additionally, most of California has been declared “normal”. Just a year ago marked 70% of the state as still being moderately to severely under pressure from the drought, so the latest findings have sparked quite an abundance of joy among residents.

The crucial factor in all of this was the last winter season, one of the wettest recorded in the state. All thanks to a few Pacific storms that have successfully replenished lakes and reservoirs. Also, this has left the Sierra Nevada mountain snowpack with a well above normal supply of fresh surface water. The LA Times reported an approximate 580 Billion gallons of water have been added to reservoirs across state.

“Reservoirs are full, lakes are full, streams are flowing and there’s tons of snow,” said jessica Blunden, a climate scientist with the National Climatic Data Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She further confirmed, “All the drought is officially gone.” In fact, the snowpack levels have doubled up in February alone.

3 years ago marked the snowpack reserve being at almost zero.

Jerry Brown, the Governor in 2017 has since rescinded a drought declaration after record breaking rainfall.

Experts agree that these swings in weather patterns are all in the era of climate change. “Dry conditions can easily creep back in,” Jessica Blunden, added.

With the assistance of well above average precipitation this last winter, drought conditions have much been eased throughout the region.

Bare in mind though that will restored snowpacks come potential avalanches.

The resulting widespread bloom and tremendous growth of vegetation is beauty like never seen before. With residents flocking in from all over the state, posting the most beautiful flower filled meadows and rolling hills. Sue Hamel has highlighted on Twitter how after crippling fires and the driest period ever, this blessing of winter rains has led to “a gloriously display of Springtime Wild Flowers.”

Another Twitter handle by the name California Snowflake wrote: “The California drought is officially OVER! CA is free of drought for the first time in more than 7 years and only a small amount of its territory remains dry as a very wet winter winds down, experts are reporting. The California bloom is real. Time to celebrate the new Spring!” A native of California state, Kevin Waggoner‏ also pointed out on Twitter: “If I had one good thing to say about my state (California) it would have to be our rare superbloom.”

He added: “We have just been officially declared drought free and was blessed with a superbloom we only see once every decade in a matter of a few years of the last. Yet another Twitter handle, LUVKHMER‏ wrote: Blooming season is arriving right in the yard of Angkorborie Temple in Central California. Very beautiful when ones observing closer to the flowers.”

Puppy love! Blind 11-year-old golden retriever receives a helping paw from his own seeing-eye dog,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6839809/Puppy-love-Blind-11-year-old-golden-retriever-receives-helping-paw-seeing-eye-dog.html,"An 11-year-old golden retriever who lost his eyes to glaucoma found his very own service animal in his puppy companion.

'Two best buds living life to the fullest,' according to their shared Instagram account, Charlie, the blind older dog, has been receiving aid from the energetic Maverick, a 4-month-old puppy.

Chelsea and Adam Stipe, the owners of the two canines from Mooresville, North Carolina, has had Charlie since he himself was a puppy, when he lose his left eye due to the degenerative disease back in 2016, according to NBC Philadelphia.

'For us it was a no-brainer,' Chelsea Stipe said after Charlie needed to have his other eye removed in 2017. 'Empty our retirement plan to care for this dog because he makes us happy.'

Not long after, Chelsea said she wanted to get another puppy while she was pregnant so that their child would have a dog of their own to grow up with.

Maverick joined the family on New Year's Day of this year, but needed some time to win over the older member of the household. When the puppy did, he noticed his new friend had some differences to accommodate.

According to Chelsea, Maverick would notice that Charlie would lose track of the toy during play time, so the helpful puppy would place it back in front of him to continue the fun.

The duo's heartwarming story went viral after Chelsea sent it to the social media account WeRateDogs, a humorous account that pretends to grade dogs on a scale of one to 10, but ends up rating them higher than 10.

'This is Charlie and Maverick. Charlie had his eyes removed due to glaucoma, but then Maverick came along as his little helper,' the post featured on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram reads. 'Now they're doing amazing. Both 14/10.'

With the post becoming wildly popular, WeRateDogs suggested that the four-legged friends get their own social media presence, and the Stipes made the Instagram account charlieandmav garnering almost 45,000 followers so far.

'Everything has just been so positive and loving and I've even had people reaching out about their dogs who had glaucoma,' Chelsea said.

Kathleen Wynne promises free prescription drugs for seniors,https://torontoobserver.ca/2018/03/22/kathleen-wynne-promises-free-prescription-drugs-for-seniors/,"Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne chose the Leaside Curling Club to make a special announcement affecting all Ontario seniors.

After curling with Leaside seniors on Tuesday, she announced that anyone aged 65 and older will receive free prescription medicine starting August 2019 as an extension to OHIP+.

“If we don’t make these investments now, we will pay a price down the road,” Wynne told reporters. “Our parents, our grandparents… people who built Ontario have told us they want to live independently for as long as possible… that’s something we need to support.”

Wynne said the plan will remove the current deductibles and co-payments under the Ontario Drug Benefit program while maintaining access to all 4,400-plus drugs.

The expansion will save people an average of $240 per year. The province will invest $575 million in the program by 2020-21.

To pay for this, Wynne plans to operate on a “modest deficit, less than one per cent of GDP.”

Dipika Damerla, the Minister of Seniors Affairs, said although people consider healthcare when thinking of seniors, they dismiss affordability.

“Affordability when you’re on a fixed income can be an issue… we don’t want seniors to ever have to worry that they may have to choose or ration their medications,” Dipika said in an interview.

Cathy Windross, 65, called Wynne’s promise a “good thing.”

“There’s a need… I went through it with my mother, and we could’ve had more help,” she said.

The competition Doug Ford, the leader of Ontario’s PC party, wants to improve hospital wait times. Andrea Horwath, leading the Ontario NDP, proposed province-wide dental benefits and a separate ministry for mental health and addiction services. Mike Schreiner, heading the Green party, wants to make nurse-led clinics the primary mode of health care in rural areas of Ontario.

But Andrew D. Gall, CEO of the Ontario Pharmacists Association, wonders why seniors are being forced to wait.

“Why do we have to wait 18 months? Why can’t we make this sooner? It’s teasing people,” Gall said.

He argues that the turnaround for the original OHIP+ plan was much shorter.

Ontario announced OHIP+ on April 27 and implemented it on Jan. 1, providing the same benefits for anyone 25 and younger.

If re-elected June 7, Wynne hopes to create a national pharmacare program to cover people 25-65.

“The reality is that there is still more to do,” Wynne said. “It’s going to mean one less thing people have to worry about and it’s going to deliver real savings to help manage the rising cost of living.”

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union and the U.S. seem to have averted a trade war for now, after the administration of President Donald Trump said Thursday it was ready to exempt the 28-country bloc from tariffs on steel and aluminum.

EU leaders, who had threatened to retaliate to any new U.S. tariffs with restrictions on American goods, gave a cautious welcome to news of the exemption.

“A trade war would have damaged both sides,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted from a summit of leaders in Brussels.

In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Thursday that Trump had decided to “pause” the tariffs for countries that are engaged in trade negotiations with the United States. He said the EU would be exempt, along with Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina and Brazil.

The EU is the world’s biggest trading bloc and it had drawn up a list of dozens of U.S goods — from peanut butter to motorcycles, worth 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in trade annually — upon which it could impose retaliatory tariffs.

Trump had planned to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The sanctions are meant to hit China for flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminum but in practice would have hurt many allies, such as the EU.

European Parliament President Antonio Tajani told reporters that “if official confirmation arrives, then that will certainly be a piece of news that goes in the right direction. The U.S. and Europe are two sides of the same coin and I don’t think we should get involved in a trade war.”

Earlier, Germany’s economy minister said he had found officials in Washington “open to our arguments” when he visited to try and avert the tariffs.

Germany’s Peter Altmaier and EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom both visited Washington this week to seek the exemption.

Altmaier told Germany’s parliament Thursday “it is a question of fundamental significance: whether we all stand for open and fair world markets in the future.”

At the Brussels summit, EU leaders were expected to trumpet their commitment to the world trade order and to press on with free trade deals with the Mercosur countries of South America and Mexico.

Ahead of the summit — in an invitation letter to the leaders — EU Council President Donald Tusk exhorted them to remain an example to the global trading system rather than revert to protectionism.

“As the world’s biggest trading power, the EU’s response will be responsible and reasonable,” he wrote.

The EU rejects Trump’s assertion that the tariffs are needed for national security and sees them as protectionist measures. Most EU countries are U.S. allies in the world’s biggest security organization, NATO.

Russia Secretly Helped Venezuela Launch a Cryptocurrency to Evade U.S. Sanctions,http://time.com/5206835/exclusive-russia-petro-venezuela-cryptocurrency/,"President Donald Trump may not have realized on Monday that his executive order would step on Russia’s toes. Its official target was Venezuela, specifically the country’s plan to create the world’s first state-backed cryptocurrency, the petro, which went on sale Tuesday.

But behind the scenes, the petro was in fact a collaboration—a half-hidden joint venture between Venezuelan and Russian officials and businessmen, whose aim was to erode the power of U.S. sanctions, sources familiar with the effort told TIME.

Trump’s executive order did not mention the petro’s Russian backers, whose role has not previously been reported. Citing economic sanctions that the U.S. imposed against Venezuela in August, the order simply made clear that anyone who buys or uses the new cryptocurrency would be in breach of those sanctions, as would anyone under U.S. jurisdiction who helps Venezuela develop the petro. “Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited,” the document states.

That may be why the Russians involved in this operation have been keen to remain in the shadows, in part through a clumsy online campaign to obscure their role in the project. But a TIME investigation has found Moscow’s fingerprints all over the creation of the petro, a scheme that reveals the range of Russia’s efforts to fight back against U.S. sanctions.

The new cryptocurrency, a form of digital cash that is supposedly linked to the value of Venezuela’s oil reserves, was launched on Feb. 20 during a ceremony in the presidential palace in Caracas. Nicolas Maduro, the socialist leader of Venezuela, declared that it would serve as a kind of “kryptonite” against the power of the U.S government, which he sarcastically referred to as “Superman.” Sitting in the front row at that ceremony were two of Maduro’s Russian advisers, Denis Druzhkov and Fyodor Bogorodsky, whom the President thanked for aiding his fight against American “imperialism.”

Both men have ties to major Russian banks and billionaires close to the Kremlin. But they were not the most senior Russians involved. According to an executive at a Russian state bank who deals with cryptocurrencies, senior advisers to the Kremlin have overseen the effort in Venezuela, and President Vladimir Putin signed off on it last year. “People close to Putin, they told him this is how to avoid the sanctions,” says the executive, who spoke to TIME on condition of anonymity. “This is how the whole thing started.”

The Kremlin did not respond to emailed questions about the petro, and the Finance Ministry in Moscow insisted in a statement to TIME that none of Russia’s financial authorities were involved in the petro’s creation. The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to TIME’s requests for comment.

Rivaling the dollar?

Ever since 2014, when the U.S. and its allies used sanctions to punish Russia for invading parts of Ukraine, the Russian elites have been desperate to get those sanctions lifted and, in the long term, to weaken the West’s ability to impose them in the future. One of the core aims of these efforts, as Putin outlined in a policy paper on global trade that was published in September, is to “overcome the excessive dominance” of Western currencies, and especially the dollar.

Putin’s advisers have been more open about their ultimate aim: “The reign of the dollar must end,” Andrei Kostin, the head of state-controlled VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank, said in a speech last month in Moscow, calling on Russia to promote other currencies for use in international trade. “This whip that the Americans use in the form of the dollar would then, to a great extent, not have such a serious impact on the global financial system.”

While not as ambitious as the Russian attempt in 2016 to influence the U.S. presidential election, the Kremlin’s move into cryptocurrencies reveals another layer of ingenuity in its struggle against what Putin’s advisers have called the U.S. “hegemony” in global affairs. The use of cryptocurrencies could, at least in theory, hurt the U.S. ability to control the flow of money in and out of sanctioned countries, thus chipping away at one of most powerful means of U.S. influence around the world.

There are currently more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies in existence, with a combined value of more than $320 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com, which tracks this market. By far the biggest of them is Bitcoin, which accounts for over 40% of their total value. But new cryptocurrencies can be created and sold without involving the banks and regulators that normally police currency markets. That is partly what makes them attractive to people under U.S. sanctions. By flying under the radar of big financial institutions, cryptocurrencies can help these people move their money around securely, discretely and with less fear of having it seized by U.S. authorities.

In the long term, if more people start using this type of digital cash, and more businesses accept it as a form of payment, trade in cryptocurrencies could ultimately grow large enough to rival major currencies like the dollar. That is what many investors in this field are banking on. “It’s an explosive technology,” German Gref, one of the Russian state bankers closest to Putin, recently said of the innovations that make cryptocurrency possible. “It will turn a lot of spheres upside down.”

U.S. regulators are not so sure. Three of the main architects of the Russia sanctions program, who spoke to TIME for this article, said cryptocurrencies will not save major Russian banks or institutions from its restrictions. “The Russians just love to poke holes wherever they can, and they poke a lot of holes, or they try to,” says one of them, Brian O’Toole, who worked at the U.S. Treasury Department between 2009 and 2017. But with cryptocurrencies, he says, “they can only nibble around the edges,” by allowing some sanctioned officials or businessmen to move their wealth abroad.

Still, U.S. authorities have been watching these efforts closely since last summer, when the Kremlin’s interest in cryptocurrencies intensified. In the words of one of Putin’s top economic advisers, Igor Shuvalov, the President “caught the fever” for this technology after discussing it in June with a range of experts and advisers. He has since endorsed its potential in a series of public pronouncements, and Russian officials, lawmakers and entrepreneurs have rushed to make Moscow a global center for the cryptocurrency market.

The Venezuelan experiment

One of their more ambitious ideas has been to create a digital version of the ruble that would mimic key elements of Bitcoin. The Russian Central Bank has, however, resisted this idea, because it would risk destabilizing Russia’s actual currency, says the executive at the Russian state bank. “For Russia, it’s too dangerous,” he says. “If we say that the only reason we do it is to avoid U.S. sanctions, then the United States is definitely going to be displeased about it.”

So instead of putting the ruble at risk, Russia encouraged its ally in Latin America to run the experiment on itself, the banker says. “Venezuela has nothing to lose. For them it’s the only chance.” Indeed, the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, has been decimated by official mismanagement and the impact of U.S. sanctions, which were imposed last year to punish Maduro for his deepening authoritarianism. The crisis has also made Maduro’s regime deeply dependent on Russia for loans and investments.

“So Russia made its stronghold here in Venezuela,” says Armando Armas, an opposition member of the nation’s parliament, the National Assembly, which has tried in vain to block the creation of the petro. “Now they are using Venezuela as a guinea pig for their experiment,” Armas tells TIME by phone from Caracas.

The job of arranging the details for this experiment has gone to the two Russian businessmen, Druzhkov and Bogorodsky, who met with Maduro on Feb. 20 to discuss the preparations. Toward the end of the hourlong launch ceremony of the petro that day, Bogorodsky stood to give a short speech in Russian, congratulating the “beloved leader” of Venezuela for the “very risky but timely move” he had made.

The Russian connection to this experiment became all the more clear the following day, Feb. 21, when Maduro sent his minister of finance, Simon Zerpa, to inform the Russian government about the results. Zerpa met that day in Moscow with Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and other officials, and he posted photos of the meetings on Twitter. “We deliver to Min. Siluanov updated information about our cryptocurrency,” the Venezuelan minister wrote.

The Russian Finance Ministry was, by comparison, less eager to promote these discussions. There was no mention of them on the ministry’s official website or its social media accounts. (The ministry did, however, take the time to post on Facebook that day about a jewelry fair attended by one of its officials.) In its statement to TIME, the ministry insisted that the Venezuelan cryptocurrency was “not discussed during the meeting or any time later on,” nor did the ministers talk about “any cooperation in this regard.”

It remains to be seen whether Russia drew any lessons from Venezuela’s experiment. But in recent weeks the authorities in Moscow seem to have cooled on the idea of an official cryptoruble. Two days after the creation of the petro, one of Russia’s leading news agencies, Interfax, reported on a letter that Putin had received from Siluanov, his finance minister. The letter advised the President that, under some conditions, the government should allow the creation of a “private Russian cyptocurrency.” But it should avoid backing such projects with state money or resources, as the financial risks are still too high.

At least some of those risks derive from the reaction of the U.S. government, which has taken a hard line on cryptocurrencies under President Trump. “My No. 1 focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC in January. “So in the U.S., our regulations [state that] if you’re a bitcoin wallet, you’re subject to the same regulations as a bank.”

Under the radar

This position might help explain why Maduro’s Russian advisers have not always been keen to play up their involvement—or their connections to powerful business groups in Moscow.

After they met with Maduro on Feb. 20, state media in Venezuela identified these men only as representatives of a company called Aerotrading, which did not have a website at the time. When it appeared online the following day, the site provided no information about the company, apart from a banner that claimed it was “the biggest blockchain consultancy company,” referring to the technology that makes cryptocurrency possible. The company’s Twitter account, also registered on Feb. 21, contains only three posts. The last one reads: “We are pleased to welcome the #Petro cryptocurrency to the #blockchain ecosystem.”

Only after studying company records and speaking to other cryptocurrency investors was TIME able to identify the Russians whom Maduro had so warmly thanked for helping him create the petro.

Druzhkov, the younger of the two, appears to be relatively new to the world of cryptocurrency. He only founded his start-up in this field last fall, an online trading house called the Zeus Exchange. His partner in that venture, a wealthy Russian industrialist and art collector named Sergei Litvin, also seems to have no previous experience in cryptocurrency. But Litvin does sit on the executive board of a conglomerate that has been under U.S. sanctions since 2014. The conglomerate, Stroytransgaz, is controlled by one of Putin’s oldest friends, the billionaire oil trader Gennady Timchenko, who is also under U.S. sanctions.

Speaking to TIME by phone from Maastricht, in the Netherlands, where he was looking to expand his impressive collection of Renaissance art, Litvin said that Russia, like other countries, is watching the Venezuelan experiment closely. “We’re interested in how it will develop. We want to see the weak spots in such a project.” He insisted, however, that he and Druzhkov were only doing “technical analysis” of the petro, and were not involved in building it. Druzhkov, who posed for photos alongside Maduro during the petro’s official launch, declined numerous requests to speak with TIME about his role.

His other Russian partner in this project was more forthcoming. A former executive at several major Russian banks, Bogorodsky moved to Uruguay around 2009 and became an informal ambassador of Russian culture across Latin America. From there he has maintained close business ties with Russia and other former Soviet states, at times partnering with government agencies on tech and infrastructure projects, according to his personal website and local news reports. His involvement with the Venezuelan petro began in December, around the time when Maduro announced his plans for the petro, and when Putin ordered his government to analyze the benefits of a Russian cryptocurrency.

“Russia has been moving in this direction for a while now, trying to draft laws to regulate cryptocurrencies,” Bogorodsky tells TIME by phone from Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital. But this process has become bogged down in bureaucratic details, while Venezuela “wanted to move fast,” he says. “We were ready to help.”

His company, Aerotrading—the one whose barebones website appeared the day after the petro—has served as Venezuela’s “technical partner” on this project, Bogorodsky says. But it has not been involved in the official talks between the Russian and Venezuelan governments, such as the meeting on Feb. 21 between the two countries’ finance ministers: “We have nothing to do with that.”

Venezuela began the official sale of the petro to foreign investors on March 20, and Maduro hopes to raise as much as $6 billion—a massive sum for an economy on the edge of ruin. But it will be hard to verify how much Maduro actually earns, and how that money would be used. Experts have warned that a lot of it could go toward propping up his regime and enriching his allies.

As for the U.S. government’s attempts to ban these investments in Venezuela, Bogorodsky couldn’t care less. “Any citizen of the world can do what he wants,” he said, laughing down the line from Montevideo. “We offer freedom of choice. So I think there will be lots of investors, big and small, from all over the world.”

British woman killed fighting Turkish forces in Syria,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/briton-kurds-anna-campbell-dies-fighting-turkey-syria-afrin,"A British woman fighting alongside Kurdish forces in Afrin, northern Syria, has been killed, her Kurdish commanders have said.

Anna Campbell, from Lewes, East Sussex, was volunteering with the US-backed Kurdish Women’s Protection Units (YPJ) – the all-female affiliate army of the People’s Protection Units (YPG) – in the besieged city of Afrin when the convoy she was travelling in was struck by a Turkish missile on 16 March.

Sources say the 26-year-old initially travelled to Syria to join the Kurdish struggle against Islamic State, but begged her Kurdish commanders to send her to the Afrin front after Turkey launched a ground and air offensive to oust Kurdish forces from its borderlands in January.

“They refused at first, but she was adamant, and even dyed her blonde hair black so as to appear less conspicuous as a westerner,” a YPJ source told the Guardian.

“Finally they gave in and let her go.”

She is not only the first British woman killed fighting alongside Kurdish forces in Syria, but also the first Briton to die there since Turkey launched its incursion into Kurdish-held territory on 20 January.

In a statement to the Guardian on Sunday, YPJ commander and spokesperson Nesrin Abdullah said: “[Campbell’s] martyrdom is a great loss to us because with her international soul, her revolutionary spirit, which demonstrated the power of women, she expressed her will in all her actions … On behalf of the Women’s Defence Units YPJ, we express our deepest condolences to [her] family and we promise to follow the path she took up. We will represent her in the entirety of our struggles.”

Her father, Dirk Campbell, described her as a “beautiful and loving daughter” who “would go to any lengths to create the world that she believed in”.

“Anna was very idealistic, very serious, very wholehearted and wanted to create a better world. She wasn’t fighting when she died, she was engaged in a defensive action against the Turkish incursion.”

In recent months Turkey has shifted its focus from fighting Isis in Syria to preventing the YPG from establishing a foothold along its border, arguing that the YPG is linked to its own insurgent group, the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). The US, EU and Britain, however, do not consider the YPG a terrorist group, which it has supported in its fight against Isis since 2014.



Dirk Campbell said his daughter had dedicated her life to the fight against “unjust power and privilege”.

He said she was a committed human rights and environmental campaigner who would “put herself on the line for what she believed in”.

“It seems a small thing, but I remember when she was 11, she protected a bumblebee from being tormented by other kids at school,” he recalled. “She did it with such strength of will that they ridiculed her. But she didn’t care. She was absolutely single-minded when it came to what she believed in, and she believed what Turkey is doing is wrong.”

He said his daughter’s passion for campaigning was inspired by her mother, Adrienne, who was well-known on the south of England’s activism scene and died of breast cancer five years ago. “Anna was a credit to her mum, my wife, and was carrying on a lot of the kind of work that she was doing,” he added.

Campbell told her father of her plans to travel to northern Syria last May after she heard about the grassroots feminist and socialist revolution that has swept Rojava (the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Syria and heartland of the YPG/J) and inspired the Kurds’ fight against Isis.

“I didn’t try to stop her,” Mr Campbell said. “Because I knew, once she had decided to do something, she was unstoppable. That’s why she went to Rojava: to help build a world of equality and democracy where everyone has a right to representation. When she told me she was going I joked: ‘It’s been nice knowing you.’ I just knew it might be the last time I’d see her.”

Upon arrival in Rojava, Campbell completed the YPJ’s mandatory month-long military training course, in which new recruits learn basic Kurdish, weaponry and battlefield tactics on top of a crash course in the egalitarian and feminist ideology of the YPG/J, and was assigned to an infantry division, comprising a mix of Kurdish and international fighters. There she was given the nom-de-guerre Helîn Qerecox and sent to the front.

YPJ sources said she spent her first months in the country fighting in Deir ez-Zor, Isis’s last major stronghold and scene of the jihadist group’s bitter last stand. But with Isis now on the brink of defeat, foreign fighters within Kurdish ranks have faced a choice: return home or remain in Syria to help the YPG repel Turkey’s attack.

“After the initial attacks on Afrin, comrade Helîn insisted on joining the operation to defend Afrin,” said Abdullah. “Before leaving, she had already received her military training, and, although we wanted to protect her and did not agree with her decision … she incessantly insisted on her wish to leave for Afrin. She even gave us a condition: ‘Either I will go home and abandon the life as a revolutionary or you send me to Afrin. But I would never leave the revolution, so I will go to Afrin’.”

She added: “For us, as the YPJ, comrade Helîn will always be a symbol as a pioneering internationalist woman. We will live up to her hope and beliefs. We will forever pursue her aim to struggle for women, for oppressed communities.”

Mark Campbell, activist and co-chair of the Kurdistan Solidarity Campaign, added: “Anna, by all accounts, was taken deep into the heart of the Kurdish people as she stood side by side with them in their darkest hour. Our thoughts and condolences are with Anna’s family and friends as this time.”

Campbell is believed to be the eighth British citizen killed while serving with Kurdish forces in Syria."
Britain First leader Paul Golding 'beaten up by inmates in prison' days after being jailed,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britain-first-leader-paul-golding-prison-attack-inmates-hmp-elmley-hate-crimes-far-right-a8259076.html,"Police are investigating reports the leader of far-right group Britain First was beaten up in prison – exactly a week after he was jailed for hate crimes.

Paul Golding, 36, was allegedly attacked by two inmates at HMP Elmley, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, according to sources.

The 36-year-old has now been separated from other inmates at the category C prison by being moved to another unit, PA understands.

Kent Police confirmed it was investigating a report of an assault at the prison between 4.15pm and 4.30pm on Wednesday.

The force said it did not confirm the identity of victims but added: “The victim is alleged to have been punched by two other inmates, causing him to suffer minor facial injuries.

“Enquiries into the incident are ongoing.”

A Prison Service spokesman added: “We do not comment on individual prisoners.”

Golding was found guilty on 7 March at Folkestone Magistrates’ Court of religiously-aggravated harassment alongside deputy leader Jayda Fransen which they carried out in Kent in May last year.

The court heard the pair launched a political campaign in which they claimed to be trying to expose Muslim men who were the subject of a rape trial.

Instead they ended up branding innocent people who practised the faith but were associated with the case as paedophiles and rapists.

Golding was handed an 18-week prison term and Fransen, 32, was jailed for 36 weeks. Both will serve half the time in custody and half on licence.

During the sentencing Kevin Smallcombe, defending, raised concerns the pair could be subject to violence in prison.

Judge Justin Barron said the pair’s crimes were “deliberately planned against targeted victims” and their actions and words “demonstrated hostility” towards Muslims.

On Wednesday Facebook said it removed the group’s official page, along with those of the leaders, after the site’s rules on hate speech were repeatedly broken.

Following its suspension from Twitter in December, Mr Golding said the group was looking for new social networks to join and urged supporters to follow."
US troops who repelled Russian mercenaries prepare for more attacks,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-troops-who-repelled-russian-mercenaries-prepare-more-attacks-n855271,"DEIR EZ-ZOR, Syria — Standing on a windswept mound, Brig. Gen. Jonathan Braga pointed to the spot just a mile away from where Russian mercenaries and fighters loyal to the Syrian government fired at his soldiers.

""Those artillery rounds could have landed and killed Americans, and that's why we continue to prepare our defenses,"" said Braga, the director of operations for the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State coalition.

Only steps away sits a sprawling oil and gas refinery that U.S.-backed forces captured from ISIS last year and that is just beginning to hum with life again.

Braga's forces repelled the surprise assault from the pro-Bashar al-Assad fighters and the Russian private military contractors. The Feb. 7 clash was the first time in 50 years that Americans and Russians have engaged in direct combat.

While there were no U.S. casualties, Braga worries that more clashes may follow. The Americans and their allies are fortifying embankments to prepare for potential future confrontations.

A team from NBC News visited the base this week to speak with Braga and other U.S. military personnel on the ground during the attack — the first group of journalists to do so. There are around 2,000 American troops in Syria fighting ISIS, which has been pushed out of much of the territory it once controlled.

While they are opposed to Assad's government, the Americans have not been targeting the regime's soldiers and its allies in the civil war, including Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia.

Braga's men launched punishing airstrikes and artillery fire at the pro-regime fighters and Russian mercenaries. The Pentagon called the attack retaliation for their “unprovoked” incursion into territory controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of Kurds and Syrian rebels.

Between 200 and 300 pro-regime fighters died in the attack. Among them were mercenaries employed by a Russian contracting firm, according to three U.S military officials with direct knowledge of the incident.

An oil and natural gas refinery that is guarded by a U.S. base in Deir ez-Zor, Syria.

That mercenaries working for a Russian company were involved has risked igniting tensions with Moscow, an outcome that the White House and the Kremlin have sought to avoid. Both have downplayed the involvement of Russian fighters.

On the night of the attack, Braga said he was “absolutely concerned” the clash could turn into a larger confrontation with Russia.

The attacking force has since retreated and is now stationed three miles away.

“There is no reason for that amount of combat power to be staring at us this closely,” Braga said. “I don’t think that’s healthy for de-escalation.”

U.S. officials said the Feb. 7 incident was the largest attack that American forces had faced in Syria since they entered the conflict.

The attacking force was likely hoping to capture several oil and natural gas fields held by the U.S. allies, according to multiple U.S. military officials with direct knowledge of the incident.

Brig. Gen. Jonathan Braga speaks to NBC News' Richard Engel.

In the hours leading up to the assault, Braga said U.S. forces noticed “vehicle movements, troop movements, rehearsals like we hadn’t seen before” — followed two hours later by artillery fire.

Braga says he immediately called his Russian counterparts on a ""deconfliction"" phone line and continued to speak with them throughout the confrontation. The Russians, he said, maintained that it was not their force advancing on the U.S. base. He described the conversations as “professional and responsive.”

In public statements after the incident, the administration offered few details about what transpired and omitted any mention of involvement by Russian fighters. When pressed by reporters, Defense Secretary James Mattis and other military officials refused to comment on the composition of the attacking force.

Statements from the Kremlin have been vague and contradictory. At first, the Kremlin said that no Russians were involved and that the attack had not been authorized by or coordinated with the Russian Defense Ministry. One week later — following reports in the Russian news media that Russian private military contractors had been killed — the Kremlin announced that five Russian citizens had indeed died. That figure was later amended to “several dozen” Russians and citizens of the former Soviet Union.

“It’s notable that both Russia and the U.S. tried to downplay it, especially given the casualties involved,” said Noah Bonsey, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. U.S. forces “wanted to send a message that they would defend this ground. By downplaying it, it makes it easier for the other side to downplay it.”

“The U.S. doesn’t see any interest in escalating with Russia,” Bonsey said.

Richard Engel reported from Deir ez-Zor, and Kennett Werner reported from London.

CORRECTION (March 17, 2018, 4:10 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article referred imprecisely to the fighters who died in the attack. Although between 200 and 300 fighters died in the attack, not all of them were mercenaries employed by a Russian contracting firm."
'We will light 17 candles': Dunblane families write to Parkland students | US news,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/we-will-light-17-candles-dunblane-families-write-to-parkland-students,"Families whose children were killed in the Dunblane school shooting in Scotland have sent an open letter in support of survivors of the shooting at Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida in February, on the 22nd anniversary of the massacre.

The letter, signed by 78 survivors and relatives of the victims, offers support to the surviving Parkland students, who have been campaigning for gun control reform in the US.

The letter, first published by Buzzfeed, reads:

Dear Students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas School,

On the most poignant day of the year for us we wanted to reach out and offer our deepest and most heartfelt sympathy to you and your teachers and to all the families and friends of those who died at your school on 14th February. We have watched and listened with tremendous admiration as you have spoken out for what you believe should happen now, a significant change of attitude towards the availability of guns in your country.

‘Tipping point’: Americans organizing more than ever after Florida shooting Read more

Twenty-two years ago today our own lives were devastated when a gunman walked into Dunblane primary school in Scotland and shot dead sixteen 5- and 6-year-old children and their teacher and injured many more. The children who were killed or badly injured were our daughters and sons, our grandchildren, our sisters and brothers, our nieces and nephews, our cousins. The teacher was our wife, our sister, our mother. Five of us are survivors. The gunman owned his four handguns legally, and we knew it had been too easy for him to arm himself with lethal weapons. Like you, we vowed to do something about it. We persuaded British lawmakers not to be swayed by the vested interests of the gun lobby, we asked them to put public safety first and to heed what the majority of the British people wanted. Most politicians listened and acted. Laws were changed, handguns were banned and the level of gun violence in Britain is now one of the lowest in the world. There have been no more school shootings.

We want you to know that change can happen. It won’t be easy, but continue to remind everyone of exactly what happened at your school and of the devastation caused by just one person with one legally-owned gun. Never let anyone forget. There will be attempts to deflect you, to divide you and doubtless to intimidate you, but you’ve already shown great wisdom and strength. We wish you more of that wisdom and strength for this toughest of tasks, one that will be so important in order to spare more of your fellow Americans from having to suffer the way you have. Wherever you march, whenever you protest, however you campaign for a more sensible approach to gun ownership we will be there with you in spirit.

Tonight we will be lighting 17 candles for those who died in Dunblane and will be remembering the 17 who lost their lives in Parkland. Our thoughts will also be with every other victim of gun violence.

We offer you our total support for the March for Our Lives and sincerely hope you achieve success. It can be done. #NeverAgain.

The shooting in Dunblane took place on 13 March 1996. Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children aged five and six, and their 45-year-old teacher, Gwen Mayor. He then shot himself dead.

Survivors of school shootings in the US have organised the March For Our Lives, scheduled for 24 March, demonstrations planned in Washington DC and across the country to demand an end to gun violence and mass shootings in schools."
"Garden bird feeders are contributing to the spread of serious diseases among wild birds, scientists have warned, causing previously rare illnesses to become epidemics in some populations.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/12/garden-bird-feeders-help-spread-disease-among-wild-birds,"Some previously rare illnesses are becoming epidemics in some bird populations, scientists say

Garden bird feeders are contributing to the spread of serious diseases among wild birds, scientists have warned, causing previously rare illnesses to become epidemics in some populations.

Poor garden feeder hygiene, droppings accumulations and stale food are promoting the transmission of illnesses between garden birds as the animals repeatedly congregate in the same location, coming into contact with species they would not usually interact with in the wild.

A study by the Zoological Society of London, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and Fera Science analysed more than 25 years of wild bird health data, including the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch, and found dramatic changes in some British bird populations, which scientists believe could have been caused by disease spread at bird feeding sites.

“We’re calling on everyone who feeds wild birds to be aware of their responsibilities for preventing disease. Simple steps we’d recommend include offering a variety of food from accredited sources; feeding in moderation, so that feeders are typically emptied every one to two days; the regular cleaning of bird feeders; and rotation of feeding sites to avoid accumulation of waste food or bird droppings,” said Kate Risely, from BTO.

The study analysed data on the protozoan parasite responsible for finch trichomonosis, which has caused a 35% drop in the population of breeding greenfinches in the British Isles, falling from 4.3m to 2.8m birds since the disease emerged in 2005.

Gardeners can combat the disease by regularly disinfecting feeders and feeding sites, and rotating the position of feeders in the garden.

Paridae pox and passerine salmonellosis were also analysed by scientists.

The study’s lead author, Becki Lawson from ZSL’s Institute of Zoology, said: “Our study shows how three of the most common diseases that affect British garden birds have changed both dramatically and unpredictably over the past decade, both in terms of the species they affect and their patterns of occurrence.

“Both finch trichomonosis and Paridae pox have emerged recently, causing disease epidemics affecting large numbers of birds, while passerine salmonellosis – previously a common condition – appears to have reduced to a very low level. These conditions have different means of transmission – so deepening our understanding of disease dynamics will help us develop best practice advice to ensure that feeding garden birds also helps to safeguard their health.”"
Pilots soar into history as Manitoba's 1st female Indigenous medevac team,http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/manitoba/medevac-robyn-shlachetla-raven-beardy-missinippi-1.4567270,"They're named after birds, so maybe it's no surprise that Raven Beardy and Robyn Shlachetka fly for a living, but they've reached heights neither expected.

The two women pilots made Manitoba history this week when they became the province's first female Indigenous medevac team.

""It's fantastic. It's proving that women can do anything,"" said Shlachetka, a captain with Missinippi Airways. ""It doesn't matter if being a pilot was a male-dominated career … young Indigenous women can see that this is not impossible.

​""They can do anything they want.""

The 32-year-old has been flying for 15 years but had never met another female Indigenous pilot before Beardy, who started flying five years ago.

On Monday, the pair worked together for the first time. They typically had alternate shifts, and Beardy, 27, was supposed to be off duty but was offered some overtime.

""It was totally by chance that it all happened,"" said Shlachetka.

Recognizing the significance of their shift, the women posed for a photo in the plane's cockpit. Shlachetka then sent it to her mom, not realizing it would get posted on Facebook. By Thursday morning, the photo had been shared nearly 12,000 times.

""I'm overwhelmed. I'm definitely overwhelmed. We didn't expect this kind of reaction,"" Shlachetka said.

""It feels great,"" Beardy said. ""It's super exciting.""

It wasn't until Wednesday that the women heard the photo and their story was going viral on social media. Their 13-hour shifts in remote areas gave them little time or connection to check on anything.

""We've been doing nothing but flying and sleeping, so we had no clue what was going on,"" Shlachetka said.

The women say they are honoured by the attention and hope it encourages others to follow their path.

""Women in aviation — it's a pretty lonely thing. We're pretty sparse in the industry,"" Shlachetka said. ""I really wish there was a lot more.""

'Aviation is a lifeline'

Missinippi, based in The Pas, serves First Nations communities in northern Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Nunavut.

Growing up in one of those remote communities, where access is often only by air, Beardy was fascinated by the planes and admired the pilots who flew them.

""Aviation is a lifeline and I wanted to be part of that,"" she said.

She once required a medical flight out of her community, Shamattawa, not far from Hudson Bay, due to an appendix issue.

For Shlachetka, who grew up in Wabowden, about 570 kilometres north of Winnipeg, there was never any doubt she would fly.

She first set foot on an aircraft at age four, tagging along with her dad, who was a float plane pilot.

""I used to follow him all the time, so I've grown up around the docks and planes and flying,"" she said, adding she would study what he was doing.

""Originally, I was going to be a float pilot, but it's a little hard to maintain that kind of life when we have eight months of winter, so I decided to go all the way with my licence.""

'Be fearless and unapologetic'

When she was finishing flight school, Shlachetka mentioned to her dad that she didn't know of many female pilots, never mind Indigenous ones.

""They hadn't hit the news, they hadn't hit the Internet. I literally heard about no one,"" she said. ""He said, 'Robyn, if you can't find a role model, just become one.' So that's what my goal was.""

He said, ""Robyn, if you can't find a role model, just become one."" So that's what my goal was. - Robyn Shlachetka

Asked what kind of advice she would give to girls and women who want to pursue the same career, Beardy said be strong and determined.

""Go for it. Stay focused. Work hard and don't give up,"" she said. ""Like anyone, you're going to face struggles, but there are people out there, too, who are willing to help out.

""And if anyone wants to talk to me, I'm here for them.""

Shlachetka echoed that, noting that when she was much younger and told people she wanted to be a pilot, they scoffed. They told her it couldn't happen because she was a girl.

But her parents — like Beardy's parents — were her biggest supporters, encouraging her every step along the way. Shlachetka is now trying to do the same for young people she encounters.

She tells her daughters to be whatever they want, to ""be fearless and unapologetic and just do it."""
New Zealand company offers employees $10 a day to cycle to work,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/new-zealand-cycle-cash-10-a-day-employees-work-company?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"A Christchurch company is offering hard cash to employees who bike to work everyday in a bid to energise staff and move the city away from a reliance on cars.

Employees who cycle to and from work will receive $5 a day and if they keep it up for more than half a year that amount will double to $10 a day, paid out as a bonus at the end of year.

“For a while I had been thinking it would be great to incentivise cycling in some way. I’m a really keen cyclist [and] cash is clearly the most obvious incentive,” Tim Chesney from advertising agency Make Collective told Stuff.

“My gut instinct is that it could be something really good for the workplace. I know for myself I show up feeling a lot more energised, my blood is already flowing.”

Chesney said some employees were initially reluctant because the office had no shower facilities, but the offer of potentially hundreds of extra dollars a year was too good to refuse and five of his six employees had joined the scheme.

“The extra money is coming straight out of the businesses profits, but I really believe there will be numerous tangible benefits as a result of people cycling to and from work.”

Developer Elliot Gilmore told Stuff that recovering from his ride to work was “the hardest part”, but the pay-off for his health was better than a gym membership.

“It’s been great so far, I mean, I get to ride through Hagley Park and see people feeding the ducks, reading books and stuff, which is quite different to just waiting for the lights to change while driving.”

According to the council, Christchurch has more cyclists than any other New Zealand city, with 13 major cycle routes running through the wreckage and reconstruction of the city centre.

Associate transport minister Julie Anne Genter said investment in cycleways were a key feature of the ongoing rebuild, with the urban cycleways programme costingNZ$150m.

“Safe cycleways are a key part of making Christchurch a healthy, happy and vibrant city full of people, rather than traffic,” said Genter."

"A Thai businessman caught poaching a rare black leopard plans to build a highway through a pristine forest in Myanmar that is home to endangered leopards and connects two tiger sanctuaries. Conservationists, residents, and an armed ethnic group have all expressed concerns about the project.",http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-05/tycoon-to-build-highway-through-leopard-habitat-in-myanmar/9510034,"A Thai businessman caught poaching a rare black leopard plans to build a highway through a pristine forest in Myanmar that is home to endangered leopards and connects two tiger sanctuaries.

Conservationists, residents, and an armed ethnic group have all expressed concerns about the project.

""The very recent scandal, especially the president himself, caught red-handed poaching in the World Heritage site in Thailand … I think that raised a lot of scepticism about the governance of Italian-Thai,"" said Petch Manopawitr, deputy director of Indo-Burma for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Premchai Karnasuta is the president of Italian-Thai Development (ITD), a huge construction company.

Mr Premchai and three associates were caught camping in Thailand's Thungyai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary with guns, the skin of a black leopard and soup made from the female leopard's tail.

Police laid nine poaching and gun-related charges against Mr Premchai, and last week confirmed four tusks found subsequently at his house were from African elephants, therefore traded illegally.

The case has outraged many Thais, with fresh protests on Sunday in central Bangkok featuring demonstrators wearing black leopard masks demanding justice despite the tycoon's wealth and connections.

The high-profile poaching scandal has also rung alarm bells for conservationists and those effected by a proposed highway between the Thai border and Myanmar's Dawei special economic zone.

""We're really worried about the practice of Premchai … he's not following the law even in his own country, how he will follow the law in Myanmar?"" said Thant Zin, director of the Dawei Development Association, an advocacy group in Myanmar.

Thant Zin says an access road built by Mr Premchai's company has already caused environmental damage.

""They should put the ITD in the blacklist,"" he told the ABC.

Short cut for trade, crossing for animals

The Dawei special economic zone is planned for Myanmar's west coast.

Once a 150km road is built linking it to Thailand, it will form a new trade route that avoids a long shipping journey around Malaysia, as well as a launching pad west to places like Dubai.

But the proposed two-lane highway will cut through Myanmar's Taninthariya forest - home to leopards, clouded leopards and black leopards, as well as Asian elephants, golden cats, marbled cats and bears.

According to WWF the Indochinese black leopard is rare, with about 900 to 2,500 still left in the wild. ( Supplied: Wildlife Conservation Society )

""It's one of the largest intact forest areas in South-East Asia and what's really unique about it is not only the wildlife that lives there but also how it provides a very important connection between the forest in Thailand and the forest in Myanmar,"" the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) Hanna Helsingen told the ABC.

""This allows for species such as tigers and elephants to move on the landscape, to feed and mate, and disperse, which is critical for functioning ecosystems and the survival of these species.""

The Western Forest complex in Thailand has the biggest population of wild tigers outside India and Nepal.

Further south lies another tiger-rich area — the Kaeng Krachan Forest Complex — with a strip of forest along the Myanmar border connecting the two sanctuaries.

""The landscape is one of the most important landscapes for tiger conservation globally,"" IUCN's Petch Manopawitr said.

The planned highway from the yet-to-be-built Dawei special economic zone to the Thai border could act as a barrier between these two tiger zones.

The Myanmar Government is pushing for a stronger environmental impact assessment (EIA) before giving the final green light.

""Biodiversity concerns or lack of mitigation for impacts on biodiversity have been cited as some of the main reasons for the EIA not being approved yet,"" Ms Helsingen said.

The road will also go through rural communities under the control of the Karen National Union (KNU), one of the many armed ethnic groups in Myanmar.

The KNU is demanding consultations with the Myanmar Government, or else risk breaching a 2015 ceasefire agreement.



Tunnels, bridges and canopies for wildlife

Most conservationists are resigned to the idea the highway will eventually be built.

But they said there was still hope of reducing the impact of the east-west road and allowing wildlife to keep using the forest as a ""wild highway"" north-to-south.

Animal scientists have teamed up with landscape architects at the University of Hong Kong to develop detailed plans that might help reduce roadkill, including 12 crossings at spots they think are migration paths.

""We've proposed adapting culverts to allow for wild cats to cross, we've proposed elevating part of the road which would produce an important elephant crossing,"" Mr Helsingen said.

""We've also suggested various barriers for light and noise which are important for birds, and canopy bridges in areas where we know there are primates such as gibbons, who really cannot cross a road by being on the ground, they have to be in the trees.""

Of course, these wildlife-friendly features will cost more money.

However, WWF cites Italian-Thai Development's construction of wildlife overpasses on Thailand's Highway 304 as evidence animals can be worked into major infrastructure planning.

A representative from the ITD sub-company doing the project — the Myan Dawei Industrial Estate company — was not available for comment.

The Dawei project began in 2008 but stalled in 2013, with ITD citing financial difficulty.

Thailand's Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency is currently considering a $180 million soft loan to Myanmar get things back on track.

The Japanese Government has also put money into the Dawei project and road surveys in the past.

""Including these measures from when roads are being built in the first place is always far cheaper than doing it later,"" Ms Helsingen said.

""We also make the argument that impacts of nature and people must be mitigated, so it should be considered part of the cost of building the road, either way.""

With so much attention on Mr Premchai and his leopard poaching, ITD and financiers of the Dawei project face increased pressure to avoid killing more animals."
"Victory for Eurosceptic, populist parties shocks the establishment in Italy election",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/04/italian-election-country-goes-polls-latest-news-results-forecast/,"Italian voters have flocked to anti-establishment, Eurosceptic parties and rejected mainstream, traditional political parties, the latest predictions from the country’s election indicated on Monday.

The populist Five Star Movement, founded by stand-up comedian Beppe Grillo as a bombastic challenge to the established order, emerged as the big winner of the general election, in a result that will be viewed with trepidation in Brussels.

With around half the ballot counted, it looked as though the Five Star Movement had won around a third of all votes, up from 25 per cent in Italy’s last general election in 2013.

The Eurosceptic, anti-immigration League also performed well, according to preliminary calculations.

The numbers suggested that The League and Five Star together attracted 50 per cent of all votes."

"Trump tweets: Trade wars are good, and easy to win",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-trump/trump-tweets-trade-wars-are-good-and-easy-to-win-idUSL8N1QK2Z9,"March 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday, a day after announcing steep tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, that “trade wars are good, and easy to win”.

“When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,” his tweet read. “Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!”

In response to Trump’s Thursday announcement, global markets have dipped on fears of a trade war. (Writing by Kevin Liffey; Editing by Alison Williams)"
"Two become one: two raven lineages merge in 'speciation reversal'. After up to two million years of separate evolution, two types of common raven have been 'caught in the act' of consolidation, say scientists.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/02/two-become-one-two-raven-lineages-merge-in-speciation-reversal,"After up to two million years of separate evolution, two types of common raven have been ‘caught in the act’ of consolidation, say scientists

Speciation, where one species diverges into two, is a well-known concept in the theory of evolution. But a new study based on almost 20 years of research has revealed that “speciation reversal”, the merging of two previously distinct lineages, may also play an important role.

Scientists have discovered that two lineages of common raven that spent between one and two million years evolving separately appear to be in the process of such a consolidation. The findings raise intriguing questions about how science should define species – and whether the boundaries are as clearcut as once thought.

Evermore: ravens can plan for the future, scientists say Read more

“The bottom line is [speciation reversal] is a natural evolutionary process, and it’s probably happened in hundreds, or almost certainly thousands, of lineages all over the planet,” said Kevin Omland, professor of biological sciences at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and co-author of the new study. “One of our biggest goals is to just have people aware of this process.”

Omland first began studying the raven 20 years ago, after he began to suspect that two separate species could have been lumped together. He reported the existence of two lineages: one concentrated in the southwestern United States, dubbed “California,” and another found everywhere else (including Maine, Alaska, Norway and Russia) called “Holarctic”.

The latest paper, published in Nature Communications, provides new intriguing details of the evolutionary history of the two groups. A genetic analysis of 400 birds spanning the geographical range of the two populations suggests that the California and Holarctic lineages diverged between one and two million years ago, but more recently have merged together again and have been hybridising for at least tens of thousands of years. The two populations now comprise pure Holarctic ravens and a group that are hybrids of the two original lineages (the pure California type no longer exists).



“The extensive genetic data reveals one of the best supported examples of speciation reversal of deeply diverged lineages to date,” said Arild Johnsen, professor of zoology and evolutionary biology at University of Oslo and another co-author. “The biggest thing is the degree to which we’ve caught them in the act.”

The genetic analysis also revealed that the mitochondrial DNA of the hybrids and the Holarctics differed by about 4%, which the scientists said was twice as much as would normally be seen for birds to be considered separate species.

Ravens cooperate with friends not foes Read more

Despite being genetically distinct, though, the birds look the same, sound the same and behave the same – although it is possible that they were different before they started to merge into one group.

The paper also notes that a third group of ravens – known as Chihuahuan ravens – which branched off from the California lineage, have remained separate and do not interbreed with the other two groups, despite their geographical ranges overlapping. Scientists are not sure why this is the case.

“The Chihuahuan raven doesn’t want to play,” said Omland. “It stays by itself and doesn’t interbreed with the others.”

The team is now investigating what prompted the merger between the two populations, including whether humans played a role. They are analysing genetic data from ravens that lived in the early 1900s to investigate whether the hybridisation has accelerated since then."
How Russian networks worked to boost the far right in Italy,https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/03/01/inenglish/1519922107_909331.html,"The Russian meddling machine has been focusing on Italy in recent months, conducting a disinformation campaign on the migration situation in order to drum up support for radical parties ahead of the general elections scheduled for Sunday.

According to an analysis of 1,055,774 posts from 98,191 social media profiles to which EL PAÍS has had access, a network of anti-immigration and anti-NGO activists has been sharing links of stories published mostly by Sputnik, a media organization owned by the Russian government and operating in Italian among other languages, in order to propagate a false image of Italy. In this scenario, the country has been invaded by refugees who are to blame for unemployment and inflation, in the midst of a crisis made only worse by the passive attitude of pro-European politicians; ultimately, the European Union itself is held up as a culprit.

A few examples of stories run by Sputnik include: “In 2065, quota immigrants in Italy could exceed 40% of the total population,” and “Migrant chaos, the beginning of a social war.”

Alto Data Analytics, a global company that uses big data and artificial intelligence to analyze public opinion in the media and social sites, showed this newspaper a study of 3,164 sources containing news, blog posts and videos published between February 1 and July 31, 2017.

The conclusion is that Sputnik Italia has been very influential in radicalizing the public debate over the immigration crisis. Of all foreign media operating in Italy, Sputnik was the second-most influential, following the Italian version of The Huffington Post, according to Alto Dato Analytics, whose algorithms rank websites by user numbers and intensity of shares on social media, much like Google’s algorithms.

Increasingly successful radical speech has replaced nuanced debate, which has been conspicuously absent for months

The immigration debate has become the central issue of Italy’s campaign, which has hardly touched on other topics. Surveys show that any party without a clear position on immigration will be left out of the picture on Sunday. This situation is reflected by tension on the streets and on social media, where nuanced debate has been conspicuously absent for months, and replaced with increasingly successful radical speech.

The rise of the League, a party with xenophobic tendencies headed by Matteo Salvini and part of a powerful center-right coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi, or Casa Pound, an openly fascist group that hopes for a spot in parliament, are just two examples.

Sputnik was a key player in the strategy of Italian destabilization, but it was not the only one. There was another network of small websites focusing almost exclusively on anti-immigration messages such as “All the Immigrants’ Crimes,” “The Populist” or “Italy, my homeland.” An indication of activity by automated accounts, or bots, which are used to make content go viral, is that with twice as many members, the pro-immigration community still published less than half as many comments as those posted by anti-immigration users. Within the sample period, anti-immigrant profiles on Twitter created 68% of all comments on the topic.

90% of those who shared Sputnik content were profiles who regularly disseminate anti-immigration messages in Italian

The Russian misinformation networks used the same pattern in this case as in the past: questionable sources, biased experts and sensationalist headlines that were shared by tens of thousands of accounts with the goal of making the content viral and amplifying the perceived problem. The UK parliament is analyzing Russian influence on the Brexit referendum, and the Spanish Congress is doing the same with regard to the secessionist crisis in Catalonia. In the US, a special counsel is investigating Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential elections.

In 2016, when the immigration crisis reached a climax with 181,436 new arrivals (according to Interior Ministry data), Italy was already at a critical juncture. The forecast was that there would be a further rise of 30% in migrant arrivals in 2017, a figure that fueled racist-tinged, populist rhetoric by most political parties. The trend affected the government, which was unable to push forward a fundamental law to grant citizenship to the children of immigrants. Above all, it gave wings to the more radical rhetoric spread by the League, which took control of the discourse and began rising in the polls.

How the immigration debate in Italy was poisoned Sputnik, the Kremlin’s news agency, and the RT television channel are among the 100 most influential media outlets in terms of the anti-immigration narrative, according to an analysis by the company Alto Data Analytics, which took into account 3,100 sources of content. Some of the headlines of the articles published by Sputnik Italia in the last year included the headlines: “Immigration, it is better to live without a heart than to lose your country.” Or: “In 2065 quota immigrants in Italy could exceed 40% of the total population.” And: “The EU as Pontius Pilate. Italy alone to tackle the crossroads of migratory flows.” According to the analysis by Alto, the Italian version of Sputnik is the second-most-influential outlet in the Italian digital debate, only behind the US website The Huffington Post. Taking into account domestic and international media, Sputnik is in the 40th spot in terms of influence, according to an analysis by Alto Data Analytics, which is based on an algorithm similar to that used by Google to rank the relevance of websites. The Alto study reflects the fact that Sputnik achieves a disproportionate influence in the Italian digital conversation, despite having just over 45,000 followers on Facebook and slightly more than 6,300 followers on Twitter. This impact can be explained by the very active participation of a reduced number of influential accounts of anti-immigrant users. Despite the fact that anti-immigrant users in Italy are only 32% on Twitter, their tweets represent more than two-thirds of the conversation, Alto explains. The Italian version of Sputnik is one of the more than 30 versions in different languages from the Russian agency, which also has services in English, Spanish, German, French, Chines and Arabic. The RT channel does not have a version in Italian, but its versions in English and Spanish are followed on Twitter by millions of accounts. With its dissemination of extreme content, Sputnik and RT join a number of new digital media outlets that are contributing to the polarization of the debate, reinforcing local narratives, the Alto analysis concludes. “Sputnik and RT have become just another source for those radicalized voters who look for any excuse to find proof that immigrants are bad,” explains Eleonora Tafuro Ambrosetti, a researcher at the Milan Institute for International Political Studies.

The data analysis shows that 90% of those who shared Sputnik content were profiles who regularly disseminate anti-immigration messages in Italian. According to Alto Data, “messages from this community closely link immigration with insecurity, crime and terrorism, and in some cases, with conspiracy theories such as the one positing that the migration crisis is part of a larger strategy to destabilize the country.”

One of the biggest fears of the current government of Paolo Gentiloni and of the social-democratic Democratic Party (PD) was that the campaign would end up being dominated by the immigration debate. It was fertile territory for the rise of the extreme right and the discourse of the League and Brothers of Italy, the two parties that form the center-right coalition, which today is leading all the polls, nearly with an absolute majority. That was why the interior minister, Marco Minniti, designed a plan with the Libyan government and the army to put a stop to the arrivals. It worked. From July onward, the Coast Guard started to take action, and arrivals fell dramatically.

In the end, the year closed with 119,369 migrant arrivals, and the social tension was notably reduced.

But on February 4, just a month before the elections, an incident saw all of that work go to waste. A 28-year-old man, a candidate for the League in a northern town, fired shots from his car at a number of African immigrants, injuring six of them. In a surprising twist, the League managed to take control of the narrative once more, and blamed the incident on the social tension caused by immigration.

In a habitual practice seen in its interference in other countries such as Germany, Russia has cultivated relationships with parties on both ends of the political spectrum in Italy. Its links with the League and the populist Five Star Movement have been evident for two years. Salvini was seen in March 2017 with Sergei Zheleznyak, in charge of relations with European parties at the Kremlin. That day an agreement that had been months in the making was signed, also via displays of admiration by Salvini for Vladimir Putin and the electoral promise of breaking with the trade embargoes against Russia, which, according to the League leader, have cost Italy €5 billion and have had a particular effect on Italian meat and textile companies.

The text speaks of “cooperation in areas of security, the defense of traditional values and future economic cooperation between Italy and Russia.” It’s an idea that can also be seen in all of the documents signed with the National Front (FN) of Marine Le Pen in France, or with the far-right Austrian Freedom Party. Both, like the League and the Five Star movement, are belligerent with the European Union."

Supreme Court declines Trump administration's request to hear DACA cas,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-declines-trump-administrations-request-hear-daca/story?id=53361210," -- The Supreme Court Monday declined to review a federal judge's order continuing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program — a move that stymies the Trump administration's efforts to quickly end the program.

At the White House, while meeting with the nation's governors, President Donald Trump reacted, saying: ""We tried to get it moved quickly because we'd like to help DACA. I think everybody in this room wants to help with DACA, but the Supreme Court just ruled it has to go through the normal channels. So it's going back in. There won't be any surprise.""

Since its inception, under the Obama-era program, thousands of young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children have been granted protection from deportation. The program has also become a key flash point amid heated debate over immigration reform.

In its previous petition to the high court, the Department of Justice had said ""immediate review is warranted"" adding ""The district court has entered a nationwide injunction that requires DHS to keep in place a policy of non-enforcement that no one contends is required by federal law and that DHS has determined is, in fact, unlawful and should be discontinued.""

Legal experts and the Department of Justice said the Supreme Court's actions were expected as the appeals courts had not yet weighed in on the matter. Hearing the case would have meant bypassing the appellate court, something the Supreme Court very rarely does, said Kate Shaw, an ABC News contributor who also teaches at Cardozo Law School.

In denying the petition, the court wrote: ""It is assumed that the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case.""

""After that happens, the court can consider the case in the ordinary course. I think there's still a very good chance that the court will take the case after the Ninth Circuit has acted (if there's been no movement on DACA in the political branches by then,"" Shaw said.

The Department of Justice said it is watching closely.

“While we were hopeful for a different outcome, the Supreme Court very rarely grants certiorari before judgment, though in our view it was warranted for the extraordinary injunction requiring the Department of Homeland Security to maintain DACA,"" said Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley. ""We will continue to defend DHS’ lawful authority to wind down DACA in an orderly manner.”

In the meantime, injunctions allowing portions of the program — including applications for protected status renewals — to remain in place as the case wends through the courts.

Though so-called ""Dreamers"" whose status was valid through March 5 are allowed to re-apply for extensions, some have lost their status.

The administration has said the onus is on Congress to create a more permanent solution for DACA.

In a statement, White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said: “The DACA program – which provides work permits and myriad government benefits to illegal immigrants en masse – is clearly unlawful. The district judge’s decision to unilaterally re-impose a program that Congress had explicitly and repeatedly rejected is a usurpation of legislative authority.""

""We look forward to having this case expeditiously heard by the appeals court and, if necessary, the Supreme Court, where we fully expect to prevail,” Shah said."

These 'lunar habitats', as scientists call them, will be built by sending robots and 3D printers to the Moon, and by using lunar soil and other material.The project has seen progress with a working model - created using a 3D printer - sitting in the space agency's lunar terrain test facility. Scientists have drawn up five designs of the lunar habitats, and hope their work could contribute to plans of creating outposts on the Moon. Although there's no mission plan yet, Isro wants to have the technology ready for building these structures.Isro Satellite Centre (Isac) director M Annadurai likened the igloos on the Moon to India's outpost in Antarctica. ""We are planning to use the Moon as an outpost - like missions in Antarctica. In the long run, the space station is likely to be scrapped. Many countries, including the US, are considering building more permanent structures on the Moon and working out of there. When that happens, we want India to have contributed,"" he told TOI.According to him, astronauts going to the Earth's satellite in the future will spend more than just a few hours there. ""To keep them safe and help them work from there, we need smart materials, which is what we are focusing on building,"" he said.Annadurai said the space agency has mastered the process of creating lunar simulant (material that approximate the properties of lunar soil), and it has about 60 tonnes of it. Its properties match 99.6% with the samples brought from Moon by Apollo missions."
"Britain and Europe must ban palm oil in biofuel to save forests, EU parliament told",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/23/britain-and-europe-must-ban-palm-oil-in-biofuel-to-save-forests-eu-parliament-told?CMP=share_btn_tw,"If Britain and other European nations are to fulfil forest protection goals, they must tighten oversight of supply chains for palm oil and other products, a delegation of forest peoples told parliamentarians this week.

The call for urgent, concrete action comes amid an increasingly heated diplomatic row over the issue between the EU and the governments of major palm-producing nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Costa Rica.

The European parliament voted last April to prohibit sales of biofuels made from vegetable oils by 2020 in order to meet its climate goals. This was followed by a related vote last month. Whether and how this might be implemented is now being considered by the European Commission and member states.

The pushback has been strong, particularly in south-east Asia, the origin of 90% of the world’s palm oil exports, which is used in hundreds of supermarket products. Palm oil can also be blended with diesel to power engines, which is what the ban would halt.

Influential politicians in these countries, many of whom are closely linked to the industry, accuse the EU of trade protectionism, colonial thinking and undermining poverty reduction efforts. Malaysia’s plantations minister described the proposed ban as “crop apartheid.”





But indigenous and other communities who are negatively affected by the plantations urge the EU to tighten supply chain controls for palm oil and other products to prevent damage to their land, rights and environment.

Franky Samperante, a founder of the indigenous peoples’ organisation Pusaka, said the Indonesian government had granted concessions to more than 50 companies to open plantations on 1.2m hectares of land claimed by local communities. For him, any palm oil from this area should be considered a conflict product and prohibited from sale in Europe.

“There should be sanctions. If not, there is no point,” he said.

Samperante is part of a group of 14 forest peoples representatives from 11 nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America visiting Europe this week to lobby for a new action plan on sustainable supply chains.

The delegation proposed concrete steps, including for European nations to establish sustainable trade ombudsmen to look into reports of human rights and environmental violations, and for companies to adopt binding human rights policies rather than voluntary actions.

Tom Griffiths, the author of a report on rights and deforestation, said lofty goals to protect forests were being undermined by a failure to protect the rights of those who live in them.



“There are so many pledges and commitments by companies and government that sound good on paper, but the reality on the ground is starkly different,” he said. “At the meetings this we, they are all saying close the gap.”



Their recommendations will be presented at a multilateral meeting in Paris in June, when the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to launch his strategy for “deforestation-free trade.”

Separately, there have been calls for the EU to adopt a new action plan on deforestation by a coalition of environmental NGOs including the Forest People’s Programme, Global Witness, Greenpeace, WWF and the Environmental Investigation Agency.



• This article was amended on 27 February 2018. An earlier version said that the forest people’s delegation wanted to ban palm oil in biofuels. The delegations called for an EU Action Plan to tighten supply chains for palm oil and other products, not for a ban.

Amateur astronomer gets 1-in-10-million shot of supernova's first light,http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/02/amateur-astronomer-gets-1-in-10-million-shot-of-supernovas-first-light,"Once Bersten realized that Buso had accidentally witnessed the first optical light from a normal supernova explosion, she contacted an international group of astronomers to plan and carry out additional follow-up observations over the next two months.Using the Shane 3-meter telescope at the University of California’s Lick Observatory, as well as the twin 10-meter telescopes of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Maunakea, Hawaii, Filippenko and his colleagues obtained a series of seven spectra. This allowed them to break down the supernova’s light into its constituent components, much like raindrops separate white light into all the colors of the rainbow.With the spectra, the researchers were able to conclude that SN 2016gkg was a Type IIb supernova, which occurs when a massive star that has lost most of its hydrogen shell explodes.Furthermore, by comparing the data to theoretical models, the team estimates that the mass of the star before it went supernova was about 20 times the mass of the Sun. However, they point out that the star likely lost around 75 percent of that mass to a companion star prior to the explosion.Based on all the available data, the researchers believed that Buso captured the first optical images of a supernova undergoing “shock breakout,” which occurs when a supersonic pressure wave from the star’s rebounding core slams into the gas at the star’s surface. This generates a tremendous amount of heat at the star’s surface, which causes a burst of light that rapidly brightens.The discovery of SN 2016gkg, as well as the results of the follow-up observations, will be published on February 22 in the journal Nature"
Ocean Refuge the Size of Great Britain Announced,https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/seychelles-marine-protected-area-pristine-seas-spd/,"The government of the Seychelles has created two new marine protected areas in the country's remote Indian Ocean archipelago. The sanctioned areas will cover more than 81,000 square miles—a swath of space about the size of Great Britain.

The protected areas will be rolled out in two phases. The first phase will cover 29,000 square miles around the remote Aldabra Group in the country's outer islands, and the second phase will protect 52,000 square miles of deep water. The total acreage will make up 16 percent of the country's ocean territory, and it is part of an ambitious project to protect nearly 160,000 square miles of the country by 2022.

""The Seychelles waters really are some of the finest on Earth and it's a complete delight that the government has protected them,"" says Paul Rose, a National Geographic explorer who led an expedition in Seychelles in 2015.

Results from the Pristine Seas study helped provide the country's government with the scientific proof it needed to establish the marine areas as protected. The Nature Conservancy teamed up with the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and other private funders to refinance the country's debt and help the Seychelles make the marine protected areas possible.

Saving Seychelles

Located nearly 1,000 miles off the coast of East Africa, Seychelles is a thriving ecosystem made up of 115 islands. The biodiverse area houses scores of species, from endangered dugongs and turtles to 100,000 rare giant tortoises that are only found in this region. Tuna and sharks live in the waters off the islands, which also serve as nesting grounds for rare migratory birds.

The newly protected areas will serve as a sanctuary for some of the planet's most endangered marine life while supporting sustainable fisheries and tourism. Since 99 percent of the country is ocean, its 100,000 human residents rely heavily on marine resources for their economy.

With its white beaches and crystal-clear waters, Seychelles may seem like a pristine island nation. But the environment's diverse ecosystem is threatened. Foreign fishing boats often encroach on Seychelles waters to illegally poach loads of sharks and tuna and take them away to outside markets.

""Until this marine protected area had been agreed, foreign fishing boats could just go through these waters and overfish,"" Rose says.

The island nation is also threatened by the warming temperatures and rising sea levels brought on by climate change. Healthy reef ecosystems can help to mitigate climate change and have positive effects on the environment, so establishing marine protected areas will help Seychelles in the long run.

To investigate the hidden threats to the island ecosystem, Rose and the Pristine Seas expedition team completed 260 dives in Seychelles. With information gathered from their fieldwork, they then submitted a scientific report and short film to back up the claim that the marine area needed to be protected.

""It's got to be science-based,"" Rose says. ""And so we agreed to fill those gaps, fill in those missing pieces of the jigsaw, as it were. This helped the Seychelles government to make the decision that they made today. ""

"Debt for dolphins: Seychelles creates huge marine parks in world-first finance scheme | An innovative exchange of sovereign debt for marine conservation, backed by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, could pave the way to saving large swaths of the world's oceans",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/22/debt-for-dolphins-seychelles-create-huge-new-marine-parks-in-world-first-finance-scheme,"An innovative exchange of sovereign debt for marine conservation, backed by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, could pave the way to saving large swaths of the world’s oceans

The tropical island nation of Seychelles is to create two huge new marine parks in return for a large amount of its national debt being written off, in the first scheme of its kind in the world.

The novel financial engineering, effectively swapping debt for dolphins and other marine life, aims to throw a lifeline to corals, tuna and turtles being caught in a storm of overfishing and climate change. If it works, it will also secure the economic future of the nation, which depends entirely on tourism and fishing. With other ocean states lining up to follow, the approach could transform large swaths of the planet’s troubled seas.

The challenge for the Seychelles is clear on the coral reef fringing Curieuse Island, once a leper colony and now a national park. The mass bleaching caused by warming waters in 2016 has left the white limbs of branching corals lying like bones in a ploughed graveyard, with rare flashes of the cobalt-blue coral survivors.

“The biggest changes are climate change,” says David Rowat, a marine scientist and diving school owner for 30 years, who says storms and bleaching events are becoming more frequent. Some clownfish have never returned since the major bleaching in 1998, he says: “The ‘nemos’ all went.” As the reef recovered, the 2016 bleaching was a “kick in the teeth”, Rowat says.

Overfishing, and the killing of dolphins, sharks and turtles as bycatch in tuna nets, is also taking its toll across the Seychelles’ vast ocean territory. The new marine plan bans fishing around biodiversity hotspots, keeping them healthy and better able to resist climate change.

The biodiversity jewel in the Seychelles crown is the Aldabra archipelago, which rivals the Galapagos in ecological importance. Spinner dolphins, manta rays, humpback whales and nurse, lemon and tiger sharks share the waters with hawksbill and green turtles, and seabirds from some of the world’s largest colonies soar above. Dugongs - or sea cows - are the most endangered species in the Indian Ocean and shelter here, while 100,000 rare giant tortoises slowly roam the land.

The new protected area around Aldabra is 74,000 square kilometres - almost the size of Scotland - and bans all extractive uses, from fishing to oil exploitation. The second new protected area is 134,000 sq km, centred on the main Seychelles island of Mahe. It allows controlled activities but is, for example, banning “fish aggregating devices” – rafts that concentrate fish but drive up bycatch.

Together, the parks cover 15% of the Seychelles ocean and the government will double this by 2021, putting it far ahead of an international target of 10% by 2020. The parks resulted from the first ever debt-swap deal for marine protection in which $22m of national debt owed to the UK, France, Belgium and Italy was bought at a discount by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the NGO that has assisted the Seychelles.

TNC also raised $5m from donors to pay off part of the debt and cut the interest rate charged to the Seychelles government on the outstanding loan. This has freed up $12m over the next 20 years to help implement the new marine plan.

“The Seychelles is positioning itself as a world leader in ocean governance,” says environment minister, Didier Dogley. “But we are not doing this because we have such a great ego but because we truly believe these initiatives will create prosperity for our people, conserve critical biodiversity and build resilience against climate change.”

Leonardo DiCaprio, whose foundation donated $1m towards funding the debt swap, said: “These protections mean that all species living in these waters or migrating through them are now far better shielded from overfishing, pollution, and climate change.”

Benoît Bosquet, environment practice manager at the World Bank, which is not involved in the Seychelles marine plan, said: “They are a leader in this field worldwide and may be an example for many other countries.”

However, despite the biggest consultation since the Seychelles nation was founded, some islanders have not welcomed the new plan. On Praslin island, as he unloads his catch of job fish and white spotted snappers onto Grande Anse beach, fisherman Richard Bossy, says: “We are worried. They want to make a lot of regulated areas where we can’t fish. Fishing is already harder and we are going to lose a lot. If there is not enough enforcement, it will never be implemented.”

Leroy Lesperance, who charters glass-bottomed and game-fishing boats to tourists on Praslin, is also sceptical the plan will become a reality: “I am 44 and I have heard this talk since I was at school.”

But others have bought into the idea, including Graham Green, a young fisherman at Baie St Anne on Praslin: “If the fish are protected where they are spawning, I’ve heard they will get bigger. We need to do it if we are going to be catching fish in 20 years.”

Green expects the benefits will take perhaps five-10 years to be realised, but sees it as an investment: “You couldn’t start a business today and be a millionaire tomorrow - if you could everyone would be a millionaire.”

Another challenge to the marine plan is a controversial new military base planned for the island of Assumption, about 20 miles from the Aldabra atoll and to be paid for by India. One well-informed source, who asked for anonymity, told the Guardian: “I am worried that it could damage the biodiversity of Aldabra. We are talking about big ships coming in to berth.” That implies pollution and the dredging of channels, which can cover corals in silt, he says.

“The Assumption saga will certainly test the credibility of the marine spatial plan process,” says Keith Andre, from the Fisherman and Boat Owners Association.

But Seychelles vice-president, Vincent Meriton, says the military base will have to pass environmental assessments and will actually benefit protection, by enabling better surveillance around the isolated Aldabra archipelago: “This facility will allow us to better monitor. It augurs well.”

Meriton also says the Seychelles will need to use new satellite surveillance programmes that use machine learning algorithms to detect the tell-tale movement patterns of fishing boats, already in use in some parts of the Pacific.

Oil exploration is another dilemma for the Seychelles, which could be sitting on “world-class” reserves, according to Patrick Joseph, CEO of PetroSeychelles, a state-owned company. It has given up some high-priority prospects, such as the Wilkes seamount which is now in the Aldabra protection zone.

But, pointing to the revisions to the plan expected every five years, he says: “If the price of oil goes a bit higher, there will be companies drilling here in the Seychelles.” Andre, pointing to the possibility of seismic surveys in the protected zone around Aldabra, says: “The nature and impacts of these activities contradicts the authenticity of the entire process.”

Many of the details of exactly what is allowed in the protected zones could not be finalised until the areas were selected and are still being worked out, meaning many difficult negotiations still lie ahead. “It is a chicken and egg situation,” says Helena Sims, TNC’s project manager in the Seychelles. “But we have built trust from the bottom up and if we keep that and are transparent I am positive our targets can be met.”

The Seychelles debt swap is a vital test case for this new way of funding ocean conservation. Rob Weary at TNC did the deal and expects to close a $60m debt swap deal with Grenada this year and a series of others in the Caribbean in the next couple of years. Mauritius also has serious interest.

Despite the election of Donald Trump scuppering for now planned swaps of US debt for Palau and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, Weary is confident debt swaps for marine conservation are going to grow: “In the next three to five years we could potentially do a billion dollars of these deals. We have a sight line to that.”

“All eyes are on us to see whether it works,” says Sims. The Seychelles, which is 99% ocean, will have gone from 0.04% to 30% protected area in a few years if it does.

Questions, such as oil exploration, remain. But environment minister Dogley says: “We don’t have answers for everything now but the marine spatial plan has started the process of thinking about these things - before we were not. The debt swap triggered everything.”"

'We Want Change': West Boca High Students March To Protest Gun Violence,http://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/02/20/west-boca-high-march-against-gun-violence/,"Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter

PARKLAND (CBSMiami) – “We want change. We want change.”

That was the chant shouted by hundreds of West Boca High School students Tuesday morning as they took part in a solidarity march to protest gun violence.

A large group of students walked out of class to march to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, site of last week’s deadly school massacre, where 17 people were killed.

On Tuesday, they came arm in arm arriving to cheers at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas high school.

Most of them left around 9 a.m., traveling 12 long and hot miles on foot to reach the school – it was a march for a cause.

Chopper 4 flew over the march as students walked along SR 441 to Loxahatchee Road and headed to the school.

“I really think we should have more background checks and how are you gonna give an AR-15 to a 19-year-old? We shouldn’t be giving out military guns,” said West Boca High student Katharine Barbosa.

“I came here because I wanted to support everyone here and I came here also for gun violence,” said West Boca High student Mia Donado.

“I feel like we had our voices heard. I hope Donald Trump and the government hears us and tries to make some changes man,” said West Boca High student Tomas Segnini.

They arrived sweaty and exhausted but, happy they can do something, whether it’s just to support those suffering, honor those who were lost or just say, “Never Again.”

“We just want to show students over here, we care and they’re not alone,” said Segnini.

A spokesman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office said his agency and the Broward Sheriff’s Office were following the students just to ensure their safety and make sure the roads stayed clear.

Students at other area schools also staged walkouts on Tuesday, including Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood McArthur high schools.

Miami Beach Senior High school wants to be next in turning their grief into action. Students met at Miami Beach City Hall Tuesday afternoon to talk business.

“We will continue these walkouts until something happens because we are terrified students and we do not know how to handle this without someone protecting us,” said Mayor Dan Gelber’s daughter Hannah.

“These are young people who are smart, they know what they want, they know what they aren’t getting, they know what they need, and I think they’ve realized the way you express yourself in this country is by words and at the ballot box,” said Mayor Dan Gelber.

We’ve learned through parents that Miami Beach Senior High is one of a few schools where the administration is not supporting the walkout. Parents say they’ll still follow the kids and march.

Hialeah High is reportedly planning a walkout on Wednesday.

Miami-Dade Public Schools said of students on Tuesday,

“They must express their opinion respectfully, without disrupting the educational environment or violating school rules. Students who intend to express their ideas and opinions through demonstration must discuss time, place, duration and restrictions with a sponsor or administrator in advance.”

Broward County Public Schools also responded to the ongoing walkouts saying in part,

“BCPS encourages peaceful and lawful protest only. Any violations of the student code of conduct will be handled by individual schools.”"

Samsung Unveils World's Largest SSD with Whopping 30TB of Storage,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/20/17031256/worlds-largest-ssd-drive-samsung-30-terabyte-pm1643,"Samsung has unveiled the world’s largest solid state drive — an unassuming-looking bit of kit that boasts a whopping 30.72 terabytes of storage. It’s the most storage ever crammed into the 2.5-inch form factor, and is designed for enterprise customers looking to move away from the mechanical parts of your standard disk-based hard drive.

The PM1643 is built from 32 sticks of 1TB NAND flash packages, each of which contains 16 layers of 512Gb V-NAND chips. That’s enough space to hold 5,700 HD movies or roughly 500 days of non-stop video, and offers twice the capacity of the former largest SSD — a 16 terabyte drive also released by Samsung back in March 2016. (Seagate has made a bigger 60 terabyte SSD, but that was in the more spacious 3.5-inch form factor, and was “demonstration technology” that doesn’t seem to have ever gone on sale.)

The new Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) drive offers impressive sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,100MB/s and 1,700 MB/s. That’s about three times as fast as the average SATA SSD you’d find in a consumer desktop or laptop, like Samsung’s own SSD 850 EVO. And the drive is robust too, with Samsung offering a five-year warranty that’s good for one full drive write per day.

When exactly the PM1643 will go on sale and for how much isn’t known, but Samsung says now it’s got this form factor settled it’ll expand its range of SAS SSDs later this year, with 16.36TB, 7.68TB, 3.84TB, 1.92TB, 960GB, and 800GB versions to come. As Samsung executive VP of memory sales Jaesoo Han said in a press statement, the company will “continue to move aggressively in meeting the shifting demand toward SSDs over 10TB.”

Don’t expect to see 30TB SSDs turning up in laptops or desktop PCs anytime soon of course. But new biggest-ever storage components like this are always trailblazers, and create downward pressure on prices in the consumer market. Now if only we could get a terabyte’s worth of storage in our phones."

Ira Greenstein & Jared Kushner's Criminal Deal With Israel Behind U.S. Involvement in Syria,https://medium.com/@zanting/ira-greenstein-jared-kushner-s-criminal-deal-with-israel-behind-u-s-873da65223ce?source=linkShare-5107837e939d-1519055080,"A major conflict of interest looms over the Rose Garden, whether it spells the end of the Trump administration, has yet to be determined.

The Trump administration along with Jared Kushner employed in the White House, a lawyer by the name of Ira Greenstein from Newark, New Jersey, who was by all accounts still acting as President and/or in the interest of his energy corporation when the U.S. bombed Syria.*

Genie Energy.

An energy corporation operating privately in Syrian territory — the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration are inherently subjugated by this paradigm of interests. When commencing with hostile military action against Syria, they did so while having a direct conflict of interest, primarily related to business ties with this corporation. This, along with seemingly ulterior political dealings with the Israeli government, has gone part and parcel to the destabilization of Syria. While benefiting Genie Energy, its backers and involved officials.

Officials such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

This essentially represents extortion against Syria, as part of a behind-the-scenes deal between parties, with Greenstein’s boss, the founder of Genie Energy and top Netanyahu donor Howard Jonas having made billions through a telecommunications deal made possible under the watch of both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Kushner-directed White House Office of American Innovation (OAI) — for which to benefit said parties for their actions.

* The U.S. has since attacked Syria’s government a number of times, furthering the risk of nuclear war or a widened conflict in the Middle East. Ira Greenstein left the White House on March 30th, 2018 following earlier reporting by this author.

U.S. Navy’s USS Porter strikes Syria in April of 2017.

On April 6th, 2017, the U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria. Targeting Shayrat Airbase (FAA LID: OS65), numerous aircraft were destroyed, primarily Mikoyan Mig-23ML and Sukhoi Su-22M3 models. These being the same parent models which had been involved in operations over Daraa, which is a choke point near the Golan Heights, it remains as of this posting as being under the control of hostile actors such as Islamic State (ISIS).*

* Syria has since made strides in retaking this key area.

On April 14th, 2018, about a year later, this act was repeated with U.S.-led military strikes against a large number of targets within Syria — both France and the U.K. participated in this escalation despite the associated risks.

Troop deployments had preceded the airstrikes, with a permanent presence with or without ISIS being touted in 2017, setting U.S. involvement in Syria at an ever increasing rate. Continued or further involvement in Syria by the Trump administration or other U.S.-led actors, as shown below in this article, is illegal.

James Mattis claimed at the time that approximately 20% of the Syrian Arab Air Force (SyAAF) was destroyed; impacting Syria’s military capabilities, this would then continue with further bombings on Syria by the Israeli Air Force. Israel would find herself losing an F-16 this year after Syrian Air Defenses retaliated in self-defense due to these bombings.

More recently, activity has included an increasing amount of U.S. military action against the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) or its pro-government forces, despite inherent conflicts of interest present within the Trump administration.

This type of behavior sits in stark contrast to Iran and Russia having been formally invited by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to participate in Syria‘s affairs militarily.

To get to the very heart of the matter, we have to go back to the presidential transition period, when Newark lawyer Ira Greenstein was a member of ex-Congressman John Sweeney’s “Tiger Team.” While he was still Genie Energy’s acting President.

This made Greenstein an official presidential transition team member for the incoming Trump administration, as some may recall, Jared Kushner was a member of this team as well.

Times Union:

Sweeney is conducting interviews alongside three transition team members, lawyers all: Martin Silverstein, U.S. ambassador to Uruguay under President George W. Bush; Ira Greenstein, president of Genie Energy Ltd.; and financier Anthony Scaramucci, founder and co-managing partner of the hedge fund SkyBridge Capital.

On the presidential transition team at Trump Tower in New York, he directly oversaw government applications including for senior ambassadorial, intelligence and national security positions. Here he interviewed candidates.

Fueled by coffee and chicken salad sandwiches from the Trump Tower’s cafe, Sweeney and three other high-powered Trump partisans have completed more than 300 interviews thus far. They’re conducting 30- to 60-minute interviews of applicants for jobs including senior national security and intelligence positions, ambassadors, undersecretaries and top-ranking officials in nearly every federal agency. They conduct interviews by phone or in person and rank finalists 1 through 5. The final hiring is done by senior Trump aides following background checks.

This also included U.S. State Department and U.N. positions — illuminating Nikki Haley’s position as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. more clearly to the public eye.

“The last two weeks we did a lot of work on State Department and United Nations positions and the pool of applicants is impressive beyond belief,” Sweeney said. “We did 15 phone interviews with ambassadors around the world yesterday, including six current ambassadors looking for extensions.”

As noted, final hiring was done by Trump’s senior aides, which would undoubtedly include Jared Kushner within the Office of the Chief of Staff. This gave an American-Israeli energy corporation a prime directorate in deciding on who to put into power, who would oversee national security policies and ultimately be in a position to pick favorable people to pursue their objectives. This represents a rather grave conflict of interest, as Ira Greenstein was by all accounts also still the President of Genie Energy* when the U.S. attacked Syria and given his role within the White House as a Deputy Assistant and high-level Strategist akin to former Chief Strategist Steve Bannon may have directly contributed to pushing for military action himself.

The White House would’ve been aware of this issue, yet as numerous members of the Trump administration were cut, employment of this individual continued. Why?

Moreover, Greenstein’s position is itself a conflict of interest by default, per 18 U.S.C. § 208. This is in regards to ‘Employees Entering Government,’ because incurred losses in Syria by U.S. military action inherently benefits Genie Energy or its larger parent company IDT Corporation, as only the legal Syrian government can or will dissent to the corporation’s Israeli-backed but nonetheless private activities in occupied Syrian territory. This key issue is also escalated due to Greenstein overseeing national security or other positions with Kushner directly, which invariably affected the decision making process, of whether to attack Syria or not. His relationship through Kushner to Trump must also be taken into consideration.

This subsequently means that future activities by the U.S. military in Syria are also compromised by these personal business interests, with pushes for regime change definitively being tied to them, rather than official reasons.

Operations in conjunction with Israel against Syria also fall under this light.

Ira Greenstein’s position within the Office of the Chief of Staff (OCS).

Greenstein’s notable placement in the upper echelon of the Trump administration seems to demonstrate a deep level of collusion with the Israeli government in domestic as well as international matters and raises many questions regarding the actual intent behind U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2015–2016 campaign run. It should also clarify Jared Kushner’s longtime issue with his ‘security clearance.’

For one, Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the presidential inauguration, around the time Greenstein had filed his 278e with the OGE after receiving a one week extension. Here Netanyahu had asked Trump to recognize the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory, all while the Trump administration has conflicts of interest with Israel’s government through Greenstein’s employment.

This meeting also took place a few weeks before the airstrikes.

Through Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, it was also discovered that General Michael Flynn had sought to benefit Israel at the U.N. by influencing Russia or other nations, during the presidential transition. Russia refused to help them with their scheme at the time — instead voting normally in line with U.S. policy regarding Israeli settlements.

This was done at the behest of Kushner after Netanyahu reached out.

Combined with bringing Greenstein into the White House, this brings into question — for very serious reasons — Kushner’s responsibility overseeing the Middle East, let alone dealing with relations between Israel and Palestine.

Greenstein is or was also President and Treasurer of American Friends of Mosaic United. Mosaic United is an organization spearheaded by the Israeli government’s Naftali Bennett, with it being the flagship project of the Diaspora Affairs Ministry of Israel, Bennett previously called for the world to recognize the Golan Heights as Israeli territory and for a population boom to take place there through new settlements. Bennett also compared the Golan Heights to the West Bank and stated that it is land that must not be given to enemies.

Who do they want us to give the Golan to? To Assad? Today, it’s clear that if we listened to the world we would give up the Golan and ISIS would be swimming in the Sea of Galilee. Enough with the hypocrisy.

Mosaic United, a reincarnation of the Government of Israel World Jewry Initiative, had attracted attention last year when it created a database of Jewish students to micro-target Hasbara toward abroad — before it was suspended.

Bennett has been the Minister of Diaspora Affairs since 2013, more recently a bill proposed by him while Minister of Education has been passed through its first reading, which criminalizes criticism of the Israeli military.

Direct ties to Israel’s own affairs such as these is tantamount to Greenstein essentially working for the Israeli government himself, especially as it relates to their geopolitical goals, such as controlling the Golan Heights. Like Kushner, whose name was removed from the Friends of the IDF (FIDF) website where he was a board member, it is not clear what Greenstein’s continued role in Israeli organizations like Mosaic United still is.

Bennett also stated during Trump’s victory in 2016, that it essentially meant the end of the Palestinian state, which again is an objective reflected in the Trump administration such as recognizing Jerusalem or moving the embassy.

Earlier, a key ally in Netanyahu’s center-right coalition, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, said Tump’s victory means that “the era of a Palestinian state is over.” The Palestinians want a state in lands Israel captured in 1967…

Greenstein is or was also a Director of Regal Bank in Livingston, New Jersey, where Kushner had listed $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 in corporate stock, which he had indicated on his form as still being in the process of being divested.

As well, apparent efforts have been made by the White House to obscure Greenstein’s employment being an issue, with a more recent investigation into the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) filings showing discrepancies.

McClatchy DC:

A year into Donald Trump’s presidency, records show five of his top staffers still have not secured final approval of their financial reports — disclosures that are required by law to assure Americans that these senior officials aren’t personally benefiting from their White House jobs.

Greenstein is one of five staffers that have not been adequately approved.

The delay is likely due to Trump staffers either refusing to disclose mandated information to OGE, failing to resolve a conflict of interest or violating an ethics law or regulation, according to two ethics experts familiar with the long-standing process. But delays can also occur when White House ethics officials don’t force staffers to comply or because OGE is behind on paperwork.

With his employment being a conflict of interest this raises yet more red flags.

Five forms had been certified by the White House counsel’s office but not OGE, according to OGE. They include those from Gorka who left in August; lawyer Ira Greenstein; Keith Kellogg Jr., NSC chief of staff and executive secretary; Daniel Scavino Jr., director of social media; and Amy Swonger, who heads up the White House’s Senate legislative affairs team. Three of the five started in January 2017, one in February and another in March.

Greenstein had been certified internally by the White House Counsel but not the OGE, in conjunction with his being obscured and the fact he was employed or even involved at all — definitively demonstrates underlying intent.

Genie Energy: SEC filings confirm that Ira Greenstein was still the President of Genie Energy while overseeing the presidential transition.

Genie Energy, in stark contrast to Ohr Pharmaceutical, did not issue a press release stating that Greenstein had officially departed the corporation. This contradicts his OGE file where he stated that he had left in January of 2017.

As of this posting the corporation’s management page remains void of an acting President and there are no SEC filings announcing Greenstein’s departure.

Washington Life: Ira Greenstein (Left) with Gary Cohn (Right) at a book party for Lawrence Kudlow in August, 2017.

Greenstein has been consistently employed in the White House, having attended the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) Gala hosted by Morton Klein, where “Kushner confidant” Greenstein was present alongside former White House personnel such as Sebastian Gorka and Steve Bannon.

Flitting about.

Jack Posobiec was also at the ZOA Gala, where he was dining at the same table as Bannon and Gorka were. A source and Trump insider close to this research project disclosed that Posobiec had allegedly met with Greenstein here.

The Daily Beast:

The president spent the weekend in Asia, but a VIP attendee list reviewed by The Daily Beast included Bannon, Spicer, and Gorka, who flitted about with Kushner confidant Ira Greenstein, as well as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a former deputy to disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Some current administration officials, such as Bannon-era White House holdout Julia Hahn, were also present.

Instagram: One social media post shows that Ira Greenstein, not pictured, had also given a tour of the White House on or around March 10th, 2017.

Following U.S. military action on Syria, it was then alluded to that Steve Bannon had lost out to Jared Kushner or others involved in the decision making process, on whether to attack or not. Though given Kushner’s lawyer, Greenstein, having been quite friendly with Bannon at the Gala — his alleged stance must be criticized or questioned.

Greenstein was in contact with Breitbart following conflict with Bannon.

Vanity Fair:

Bannon’s camp had been in touch with Trump Jr. and White House official Ira Greenstein throughout the morning, and they were told the president was preparing for war if Bannon didn’t recant.

No doubt, Greenstein’s direct presence in the White House causes numerous issues with the official story justifying military action, that being a chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun — at the time controlled by an offshoot of al-Nusra Front. This primarily applies to the extent that there are underlying or even ulterior reasons for attacking Syria’s government to benefit private business interests in Israel.

Kushner’s wife, Ivanka [Yael] Trump, reportedly had “convinced” her father to order the attack on Syria along with former Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell. Powell, like former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, is a heavy hitter from Goldman Sachs — one of the primary instigators of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Greenstein’s son, Jonathan Greenstein, is also a lawyer for Goldman Sachs.

Like Bannon, this line of reasoning about alleged causation or factions at the time must be taken with a grain of salt, notably in regards to Michael Wolff’s adjective-laden book “Fire And Fury.”

A disturbing issue arises regarding this situation due to the Golan Heights being — as noted — Syrian territory occupied by Israel, wherein there is precedent that drilling new wells or extorting new resources, which Genie Energy has done after approval from the Israeli government — is against international law. Singapore successfully sued Japan following WWII for this very reason, opening up Israel and the U.S. to future liability.

This means that Greenstein and subsequently Kushner are involved in a still ongoing criminal conspiracy. By extension, U.S. Presidential Donald Trump and his overtly compromised administration are also in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 (S/RES/242).

This also means they would have been risking American lives, while killing numerous Syrians, to further or protect personal business interests which are criminal in nature.

The first airstrikes were said to be justified through the Authorization For Use of Military Force (AUMF), signed on September 14th, 2001 by former U.S. President George Bush immediately following 9/11. This has come under scrutiny, with its use for attacking Syria’s government being deemed unconstitutional.

U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) has since raised this issue but is also pushing for a new AUMF.

At the time of the airstrikes, the attack had been solely ordered by Trump, rather than by receiving approval through U.S. Congress. Despite this, U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) still backed up the airstrikes, as has the GOP.

Historically, the Obama administration also struggled with presenting valid legal arguments for attacking Syria.

To reiterate, this means that Trump attacked Syria while lacking clear legal justification, while having direct; major conflicts of interest in the White House and while violating laws on multiple levels.

Further U.S.-led military action in February of 2018 at the Battle of Khasham would also lead to the death of Russian private military contractors from Wagner, as well as Syrian forces, who suffered a hundred losses.

Ira Greenstein is a rather close associate of the Kushners, described as a longtime family friend, especially to Charles Kushner.

Politico:

Charlie Kushner might be keeping the Trump administration at arm’s length, but he has some old pals working in government under his son with whom he also stays in touch. One example: Ira Greenstein, a former Newark-based executive and longtime Kushner family friend, who quit his job as chairman of IDT Corp. and now works out of the Old Executive Office Building on Kushner’s team as a lawyer working primarily under Liddell and Cordish.

As some will recall, top Democratic donor Kushner was previously sentenced to federal prison for the crimes of “tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations.”

Democratic influence doesn’t end with the Kushners though, as Genie Energy’s “mission” is apolitically-based, much of their progress rests on the work of Democrats — such as former U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA).

Landrieu was key in leading a groundbreaking U.S. energy mission to Israel.

Like former Deputy Assistant Sebastian Gorka, Ira Greenstein is on the high end of the spectrum when it comes to salaries, earning $155,000 at the White House in 2017.

Greenstein does not appear on the 2018 White House Staff Salary report.

Greenstein was also a past President of IDT Corporation, which funneled significant amounts of funds totaling millions of dollars to the Central Fund of Israel (CFI) through the IDT Charitable Foundation, an organization which has supported individuals that advocate for the killing of non-Jewish (Gentile) children on the basis of race.

The Electronic Intifada:

As reported by Akiva Eldar in Haaretz, the CFI supports a yeshiva whose leader, Rabbi Yitzhak Shapira, has tried to justify the killing of gentile babies because of “the future danger that will arise if they are allowed to grow into evil people like their parents.”

IDT, along with its founder’s foundation, donated around $2,000,000 or more over the years.

The IDT Charitable Foundation contributed $870,000 to the CFI since 2005 and the Jonas Foundation — a foundation run by Howard Jonas, the founder and chair of IDT — contributed $1.12 million.

The Central Fund of Israel is involved in development of settlements in occupied territories.

Ira Greenstein held around 100,000 shares in Genie Energy while assuming his position in the administration.

Another issue is the timing regarding donations to Trump’s campaign, Greenstein donated $10,000 to Make America Great Again, in late August of 2015. This could fall under 18 U.S.C. § 211 since he later rose to hold key positions in the presidential transition team and then in the White House itself. Positions which affected foreign policy at the root.

Donations occurred just a few weeks after substantial oil was discovered at the Ness-3 drilling site, in the Golan Heights. This followed earlier findings at Ness-5, in May of 2015, a little over two years into the initial three year exploratory license granted to Afek Oil And Gas.

Genie Energy also exploits other resources in occupied Syrian territory, like water, through its drilling services company Atid Drilling Ltd. — which launched in January of 2017.

The surrounding area supplies a third of water to Israel.

Ira Greenstein previously communicated with Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton, before he was appointed Chairman of the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC).

Reuters:

Clayton also disclosed in his written responses that he communicated with others, including Rebekah Mercer, a Trump donor whose father, Robert Mercer, founded the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies; Genie Energy Ltd President Ira Greenstein; venture capitalist Darren Blanton; Martin Silverstein, a lawyer who is senior counsel with the law firm Greenberg Taurig and who was ambassador to Uruguay for four years under President George W. Bush; Trump’s current chief strategist Steve Bannon; and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, the documents show.

More recently, it has been reported that after meeting with Joshua Harris from Apollo Global Management (AGM), one of two companies that gave Jared Kushner a loan — a SEC investigation targeted at AGM was dropped. This transpired after Greenstein had communicated with the future SEC Chairman, with Greenstein — as noted — working under both Chris Liddell and Reed Cordish overseeing infrastructure policy.

Greenstein appears to provide the missing link to this incident.

A further connection between parties is found through David Blitzer, who is involved with Hillel International, which had partnered with Mosaic United, in projects involving millions spearheading activities for the Israeli government. Blitzer previously made a deal with Harris in a major acquisition of the New Jersey Devils and the Prudential Center arena in Newark. As noted, Greenstein is also the President of Mosaic United and from Newark.

Greenstein is or was also Counsel to Global Risk Advisors (GRA), founded by former U.S. diplomat Kevin Chalker, it is a multi-tiered corporation which had gone to Doha, the capital of Qatar, to register a branch last year. GRA Quantum is involved in cyber-security and has on its Advisory Board members such as Matthew Waxman — Columbia Law School alumni like Greenstein — who is also a member of the Council On Foreign Relations (CFR). GRA Maven is involved in training government, military and police for clandestine operations.

Greenstein provides a direct line from this group to the White House.

The New York-based private security firm Global Risk Advisors (GRA) registered a new subsidiary in Qatar in October. The new entity will handle missions in the Middle East. GRA, which was founded by Kevin Chalker, will be represented in Doha by David Powell, a former member of the Ministry of…

Martin Silverstein, one of the other lawyers that was on the presidential transition team, is an old friend of both the Kushner and Trump families. He had also met with Clayton at the time.

Renaissance Technologies, whose CEO Robert Mercer funds Breitbart with tens of millions of dollars as a major stakeholder, also owns part of Genie Energy as a significant shareholder.

Breitbart has previously defended Rupert Murdoch, owner of The Sun, in regards to U.K. Labour politician Caroline Kolek’s Tweets about Genie Energy and Murdoch’s involvement in it — calling her Tweets “anti-Semitic.”

Jason Greenblatt, another senior White House staffer who was Donald Trump’s lawyer at the Trump Organization as Chief Legal Officer, also has investments in Genie Energy. Greenblatt is Trump’s adviser on Israel, currently serving as an Assistant to the President and as Special Representative For International Negotiations. Like Greenstein, his position in handling affairs abroad directly comes into question due to these shares and his employment represents a secondary conflict of interest.

Where this conflict of interest is most apparent or blatant, is Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt hovering behind Nikki Haley at the U.N. — with her rhetoric about Syria as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. being directly contrasted by her being vetted by Ira Greenstein.

Haley, nor her fellow aides, can be trusted by the public to be impartial.

The CEO as well as Chairman of one of Genie Energy’s largest shareholders, BlackRock, visited the White House just a few days after the airstrikes (April 11th). Laurence Fink and the monolithic firm that he represents — as well as proximal involvement by Goldman Sachs — stand to gain from both lobbying and utilizing the U.S. military for their own self-interest(s). Subsequently, BlackRock’s former [pre-1995] parent company Blackstone and its CEO Stephen Schwarzman also met on the same day.

Schwarzman was also an adviser to then President-elect Donald Trump.

BlackRock is also one of the largest shareholders of Raytheon, the defense contractor that manufactures Tomahawk cruise missiles. The U.S. Navy has requested Raytheon to replace these under a modified contract.

Greenstein also owns shares in Axalta Coating Systems, which paints components and vehicles for Raytheon.

Like the Kushner’s $250,000,000 credit line for Cadre through Soros Fund Management, they have also received funds from Blackstone, for real estate.

Lord Jacob Rothschild sits on the International Advisory Board of Blackstone.

Another point of inherent subjugation within the Trump administration is IDT Corporation’s Michael Glassner, Chief Strategist, including for reelection (2020).

Ballotpedia:

Lewis Eisenberg advisor

From 1998 to 2001, while still informally advising the retired Dole, Glassner moved to New Jersey to work under Lewis Eisenberg, chair of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Glassner was Eisenberg’s chief of staff. In 2001, near the end of Glassner’s time at the Port Authority, he was involved in the deal that privatized the lease of the World Trade Center to the Silverstein Group. In July 2001, Glassner left the staff of the Port Authority to work for IDT Corporation, a global telecommunications company. According to ABC News, “At IDT, Glassner was chief of staff to the company’s CEO, handling external communications as well as government and investor relations.”

With IDT Corporation being the parent company of Genie Energy, as well as being composed of the very same executives or individuals, it presents another angle by which this group retains control of the White House.

This includes influence over future executive actions and policy-making.

In 2014, Glassner joined the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a group that works to strengthen American ties to Israel.

Glassner also joined AIPAC in 2014.

U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) previously met with Genie Energy’s chief scientist, Harold Vinegar, on behalf of the American Israel Educational Foundation — referred to as the “charitable arm of AIPAC.”

Jewish Insider:

Meeting with Dr. Harold Vinegar, chief scientist of Israeli Energy Initiatives at Genie Energy, and Binyamin Zomer of Noble Energy, to discuss the importance of energy to the economies of Israel, the United States, and West Virginia.

Manchin would later be the only Democrat to vote in favor of Jeff Sessions and Steven Mnuchin as well as other key figures.

Genie Energy’s founder, Howard Jonas, donated to U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) just a few days before attacking Syria — as well as only a few days after tightening sanctions on Iran.

Founder of Apollo Global Management Leon Black donated within 24 hours of the airstrikes.

Menendez would later approve of the strikes having been conducted.

This pattern continued with both Manchin and Menendez in turn also voting in favor of U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Friedman has a number of underlying interests in Israel.

Jonas has also donated to the campaigns of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the past, noted as his #2, the telecommunications mogul is heavily intertwined with the affairs of the Israeli government and Netanyahu.

Haaretz:

According to material collected by the State Comptroller’s Office, one of the names, which Netanyahu had ranked “№2,” was of someone with whom the public may not have been familiar until recently: “Howard Jonas, IDT Corporation, New Jersey.” Jonas, who has donated to Netanyahu’s primary campaigns in the past, is the founder and owner of Israel Energy Initiatives, a company established in 2008 to develop oil shale in Israel.

Furthermore, Jonas is a significant contributor to NORPAC, which primarily supports foreign aid to Israel, American-Israeli energy projects, settlement development and tighter sanctions on Iran.

Consequently, they happen to donate to politicians which support Genie Energy’s mission and objectives. Politicians such as Richard Burr, who has also received donations from Jonas.

Jonas continues to donate for the 2018 cycle.

Yeshiva University has also seen Howard Jonas sit on its board in the past, where Jason Greenblatt taught, who as mentioned holds shares in Genie Energy despite being responsible for international negotiations.

Ira Greenstein & Jared Kushner's Criminal Deal With Israel Behind U.S. Involvement in Syria,https://medium.com/@zanting/ira-greenstein-jared-kushner-s-criminal-deal-with-israel-behind-u-s-873da65223ce,"A major conflict of interest looms over the Rose Garden, whether it spells the end of the Trump administration, has yet to be determined.

The Trump administration along with Jared Kushner employed in the White House, a lawyer by the name of Ira Greenstein from Newark, New Jersey, who was by all accounts still acting as President and/or in the interest of his energy corporation when the U.S. bombed Syria.*

Genie Energy.

An energy corporation operating privately in Syrian territory — the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration are inherently subjugated by this paradigm of interests. When commencing with hostile military action against Syria, they did so while having a direct conflict of interest, primarily related to business ties with this corporation. This, along with seemingly ulterior political dealings with the Israeli government, has gone part and parcel to the destabilization of Syria. While benefiting Genie Energy, its backers and involved officials.

Officials such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

This essentially represents extortion against Syria, as part of a behind-the-scenes deal between parties, with Greenstein’s boss, the founder of Genie Energy and top Netanyahu donor Howard Jonas having made billions through a telecommunications deal made possible under the watch of both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Kushner-directed White House Office of American Innovation (OAI) — for which to benefit said parties for their actions.

* The U.S. has since attacked Syria’s government a number of times, furthering the risk of nuclear war or a widened conflict in the Middle East. Ira Greenstein left the White House on March 30th, 2018 following earlier reporting by this author.

U.S. Navy’s USS Porter strikes Syria in April of 2017.

On April 6th, 2017, the U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria. Targeting Shayrat Airbase (FAA LID: OS65), numerous aircraft were destroyed, primarily Mikoyan Mig-23ML and Sukhoi Su-22M3 models. These being the same parent models which had been involved in operations over Daraa, which is a choke point near the Golan Heights, it remains as of this posting as being under the control of hostile actors such as Islamic State (ISIS).*

* Syria has since made strides in retaking this key area.

On April 14th, 2018, about a year later, this act was repeated with U.S.-led military strikes against a large number of targets within Syria — both France and the U.K. participated in this escalation despite the associated risks.

Troop deployments had preceded the airstrikes, with a permanent presence with or without ISIS being touted in 2017, setting U.S. involvement in Syria at an ever increasing rate. Continued or further involvement in Syria by the Trump administration or other U.S.-led actors, as shown below in this article, is illegal.

James Mattis claimed at the time that approximately 20% of the Syrian Arab Air Force (SyAAF) was destroyed; impacting Syria’s military capabilities, this would then continue with further bombings on Syria by the Israeli Air Force. Israel would find herself losing an F-16 this year after Syrian Air Defenses retaliated in self-defense due to these bombings.

More recently, activity has included an increasing amount of U.S. military action against the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) or its pro-government forces, despite inherent conflicts of interest present within the Trump administration.

This type of behavior sits in stark contrast to Iran and Russia having been formally invited by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to participate in Syria‘s affairs militarily.

To get to the very heart of the matter, we have to go back to the presidential transition period, when Newark lawyer Ira Greenstein was a member of ex-Congressman John Sweeney’s “Tiger Team.” While he was still Genie Energy’s acting President.

This made Greenstein an official presidential transition team member for the incoming Trump administration, as some may recall, Jared Kushner was a member of this team as well.

Times Union:

Sweeney is conducting interviews alongside three transition team members, lawyers all: Martin Silverstein, U.S. ambassador to Uruguay under President George W. Bush; Ira Greenstein, president of Genie Energy Ltd.; and financier Anthony Scaramucci, founder and co-managing partner of the hedge fund SkyBridge Capital.

On the presidential transition team at Trump Tower in New York, he directly oversaw government applications including for senior ambassadorial, intelligence and national security positions. Here he interviewed candidates.

Fueled by coffee and chicken salad sandwiches from the Trump Tower’s cafe, Sweeney and three other high-powered Trump partisans have completed more than 300 interviews thus far. They’re conducting 30- to 60-minute interviews of applicants for jobs including senior national security and intelligence positions, ambassadors, undersecretaries and top-ranking officials in nearly every federal agency. They conduct interviews by phone or in person and rank finalists 1 through 5. The final hiring is done by senior Trump aides following background checks.

This also included U.S. State Department and U.N. positions — illuminating Nikki Haley’s position as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. more clearly to the public eye.

“The last two weeks we did a lot of work on State Department and United Nations positions and the pool of applicants is impressive beyond belief,” Sweeney said. “We did 15 phone interviews with ambassadors around the world yesterday, including six current ambassadors looking for extensions.”

As noted, final hiring was done by Trump’s senior aides, which would undoubtedly include Jared Kushner within the Office of the Chief of Staff. This gave an American-Israeli energy corporation a prime directorate in deciding on who to put into power, who would oversee national security policies and ultimately be in a position to pick favorable people to pursue their objectives. This represents a rather grave conflict of interest, as Ira Greenstein was by all accounts also still the President of Genie Energy* when the U.S. attacked Syria and given his role within the White House as a Deputy Assistant and high-level Strategist akin to former Chief Strategist Steve Bannon may have directly contributed to pushing for military action himself.

The White House would’ve been aware of this issue, yet as numerous members of the Trump administration were cut, employment of this individual continued. Why?

Moreover, Greenstein’s position is itself a conflict of interest by default, per 18 U.S.C. § 208. This is in regards to ‘Employees Entering Government,’ because incurred losses in Syria by U.S. military action inherently benefits Genie Energy or its larger parent company IDT Corporation, as only the legal Syrian government can or will dissent to the corporation’s Israeli-backed but nonetheless private activities in occupied Syrian territory. This key issue is also escalated due to Greenstein overseeing national security or other positions with Kushner directly, which invariably affected the decision making process, of whether to attack Syria or not. His relationship through Kushner to Trump must also be taken into consideration.

This subsequently means that future activities by the U.S. military in Syria are also compromised by these personal business interests, with pushes for regime change definitively being tied to them, rather than official reasons.

Operations in conjunction with Israel against Syria also fall under this light.

Ira Greenstein’s position within the Office of the Chief of Staff (OCS).

Greenstein’s notable placement in the upper echelon of the Trump administration seems to demonstrate a deep level of collusion with the Israeli government in domestic as well as international matters and raises many questions regarding the actual intent behind U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2015–2016 campaign run. It should also clarify Jared Kushner’s longtime issue with his ‘security clearance.’

For one, Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the presidential inauguration, around the time Greenstein had filed his 278e with the OGE after receiving a one week extension. Here Netanyahu had asked Trump to recognize the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory, all while the Trump administration has conflicts of interest with Israel’s government through Greenstein’s employment.

This meeting also took place a few weeks before the airstrikes.

Through Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, it was also discovered that General Michael Flynn had sought to benefit Israel at the U.N. by influencing Russia or other nations, during the presidential transition. Russia refused to help them with their scheme at the time — instead voting normally in line with U.S. policy regarding Israeli settlements.

This was done at the behest of Kushner after Netanyahu reached out.

Combined with bringing Greenstein into the White House, this brings into question — for very serious reasons — Kushner’s responsibility overseeing the Middle East, let alone dealing with relations between Israel and Palestine.

Greenstein is or was also President and Treasurer of American Friends of Mosaic United. Mosaic United is an organization spearheaded by the Israeli government’s Naftali Bennett, with it being the flagship project of the Diaspora Affairs Ministry of Israel, Bennett previously called for the world to recognize the Golan Heights as Israeli territory and for a population boom to take place there through new settlements. Bennett also compared the Golan Heights to the West Bank and stated that it is land that must not be given to enemies.

Who do they want us to give the Golan to? To Assad? Today, it’s clear that if we listened to the world we would give up the Golan and ISIS would be swimming in the Sea of Galilee. Enough with the hypocrisy.

Mosaic United, a reincarnation of the Government of Israel World Jewry Initiative, had attracted attention last year when it created a database of Jewish students to micro-target Hasbara toward abroad — before it was suspended.

Bennett has been the Minister of Diaspora Affairs since 2013, more recently a bill proposed by him while Minister of Education has been passed through its first reading, which criminalizes criticism of the Israeli military.

Direct ties to Israel’s own affairs such as these is tantamount to Greenstein essentially working for the Israeli government himself, especially as it relates to their geopolitical goals, such as controlling the Golan Heights. Like Kushner, whose name was removed from the Friends of the IDF (FIDF) website where he was a board member, it is not clear what Greenstein’s continued role in Israeli organizations like Mosaic United still is.

Bennett also stated during Trump’s victory in 2016, that it essentially meant the end of the Palestinian state, which again is an objective reflected in the Trump administration such as recognizing Jerusalem or moving the embassy.

Earlier, a key ally in Netanyahu’s center-right coalition, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, said Tump’s victory means that “the era of a Palestinian state is over.” The Palestinians want a state in lands Israel captured in 1967…

Greenstein is or was also a Director of Regal Bank in Livingston, New Jersey, where Kushner had listed $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 in corporate stock, which he had indicated on his form as still being in the process of being divested.

As well, apparent efforts have been made by the White House to obscure Greenstein’s employment being an issue, with a more recent investigation into the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) filings showing discrepancies.

McClatchy DC:

A year into Donald Trump’s presidency, records show five of his top staffers still have not secured final approval of their financial reports — disclosures that are required by law to assure Americans that these senior officials aren’t personally benefiting from their White House jobs.

Greenstein is one of five staffers that have not been adequately approved.

The delay is likely due to Trump staffers either refusing to disclose mandated information to OGE, failing to resolve a conflict of interest or violating an ethics law or regulation, according to two ethics experts familiar with the long-standing process. But delays can also occur when White House ethics officials don’t force staffers to comply or because OGE is behind on paperwork.

With his employment being a conflict of interest this raises yet more red flags.

Five forms had been certified by the White House counsel’s office but not OGE, according to OGE. They include those from Gorka who left in August; lawyer Ira Greenstein; Keith Kellogg Jr., NSC chief of staff and executive secretary; Daniel Scavino Jr., director of social media; and Amy Swonger, who heads up the White House’s Senate legislative affairs team. Three of the five started in January 2017, one in February and another in March.

Greenstein had been certified internally by the White House Counsel but not the OGE, in conjunction with his being obscured and the fact he was employed or even involved at all — definitively demonstrates underlying intent.

Genie Energy: SEC filings confirm that Ira Greenstein was still the President of Genie Energy while overseeing the presidential transition.

Genie Energy, in stark contrast to Ohr Pharmaceutical, did not issue a press release stating that Greenstein had officially departed the corporation. This contradicts his OGE file where he stated that he had left in January of 2017.

As of this posting the corporation’s management page remains void of an acting President and there are no SEC filings announcing Greenstein’s departure.

Washington Life: Ira Greenstein (Left) with Gary Cohn (Right) at a book party for Lawrence Kudlow in August, 2017.

Greenstein has been consistently employed in the White House, having attended the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) Gala hosted by Morton Klein, where “Kushner confidant” Greenstein was present alongside former White House personnel such as Sebastian Gorka and Steve Bannon.

Flitting about.

Jack Posobiec was also at the ZOA Gala, where he was dining at the same table as Bannon and Gorka were. A source and Trump insider close to this research project disclosed that Posobiec had allegedly met with Greenstein here.

The Daily Beast:

The president spent the weekend in Asia, but a VIP attendee list reviewed by The Daily Beast included Bannon, Spicer, and Gorka, who flitted about with Kushner confidant Ira Greenstein, as well as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a former deputy to disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Some current administration officials, such as Bannon-era White House holdout Julia Hahn, were also present.

Instagram: One social media post shows that Ira Greenstein, not pictured, had also given a tour of the White House on or around March 10th, 2017.

Following U.S. military action on Syria, it was then alluded to that Steve Bannon had lost out to Jared Kushner or others involved in the decision making process, on whether to attack or not. Though given Kushner’s lawyer, Greenstein, having been quite friendly with Bannon at the Gala — his alleged stance must be criticized or questioned.

Greenstein was in contact with Breitbart following conflict with Bannon.

Vanity Fair:

Bannon’s camp had been in touch with Trump Jr. and White House official Ira Greenstein throughout the morning, and they were told the president was preparing for war if Bannon didn’t recant.

No doubt, Greenstein’s direct presence in the White House causes numerous issues with the official story justifying military action, that being a chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun — at the time controlled by an offshoot of al-Nusra Front. This primarily applies to the extent that there are underlying or even ulterior reasons for attacking Syria’s government to benefit private business interests in Israel.

Kushner’s wife, Ivanka [Yael] Trump, reportedly had “convinced” her father to order the attack on Syria along with former Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell. Powell, like former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, is a heavy hitter from Goldman Sachs — one of the primary instigators of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Greenstein’s son, Jonathan Greenstein, is also a lawyer for Goldman Sachs.

Like Bannon, this line of reasoning about alleged causation or factions at the time must be taken with a grain of salt, notably in regards to Michael Wolff’s adjective-laden book “Fire And Fury.”

A disturbing issue arises regarding this situation due to the Golan Heights being — as noted — Syrian territory occupied by Israel, wherein there is precedent that drilling new wells or extorting new resources, which Genie Energy has done after approval from the Israeli government — is against international law. Singapore successfully sued Japan following WWII for this very reason, opening up Israel and the U.S. to future liability.

This means that Greenstein and subsequently Kushner are involved in a still ongoing criminal conspiracy. By extension, U.S. Presidential Donald Trump and his overtly compromised administration are also in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 (S/RES/242).

This also means they would have been risking American lives, while killing numerous Syrians, to further or protect personal business interests which are criminal in nature.

The first airstrikes were said to be justified through the Authorization For Use of Military Force (AUMF), signed on September 14th, 2001 by former U.S. President George Bush immediately following 9/11. This has come under scrutiny, with its use for attacking Syria’s government being deemed unconstitutional.

U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) has since raised this issue but is also pushing for a new AUMF.

At the time of the airstrikes, the attack had been solely ordered by Trump, rather than by receiving approval through U.S. Congress. Despite this, U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) still backed up the airstrikes, as has the GOP.

Historically, the Obama administration also struggled with presenting valid legal arguments for attacking Syria.

To reiterate, this means that Trump attacked Syria while lacking clear legal justification, while having direct; major conflicts of interest in the White House and while violating laws on multiple levels.

Further U.S.-led military action in February of 2018 at the Battle of Khasham would also lead to the death of Russian private military contractors from Wagner, as well as Syrian forces, who suffered a hundred losses.

Ira Greenstein is a rather close associate of the Kushners, described as a longtime family friend, especially to Charles Kushner.

Politico:

Charlie Kushner might be keeping the Trump administration at arm’s length, but he has some old pals working in government under his son with whom he also stays in touch. One example: Ira Greenstein, a former Newark-based executive and longtime Kushner family friend, who quit his job as chairman of IDT Corp. and now works out of the Old Executive Office Building on Kushner’s team as a lawyer working primarily under Liddell and Cordish.

As some will recall, top Democratic donor Kushner was previously sentenced to federal prison for the crimes of “tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations.”

Democratic influence doesn’t end with the Kushners though, as Genie Energy’s “mission” is apolitically-based, much of their progress rests on the work of Democrats — such as former U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA).

Landrieu was key in leading a groundbreaking U.S. energy mission to Israel.

Like former Deputy Assistant Sebastian Gorka, Ira Greenstein is on the high end of the spectrum when it comes to salaries, earning $155,000 at the White House in 2017.

Greenstein does not appear on the 2018 White House Staff Salary report.

Greenstein was also a past President of IDT Corporation, which funneled significant amounts of funds totaling millions of dollars to the Central Fund of Israel (CFI) through the IDT Charitable Foundation, an organization which has supported individuals that advocate for the killing of non-Jewish (Gentile) children on the basis of race.

The Electronic Intifada:

As reported by Akiva Eldar in Haaretz, the CFI supports a yeshiva whose leader, Rabbi Yitzhak Shapira, has tried to justify the killing of gentile babies because of “the future danger that will arise if they are allowed to grow into evil people like their parents.”

IDT, along with its founder’s foundation, donated around $2,000,000 or more over the years.

The IDT Charitable Foundation contributed $870,000 to the CFI since 2005 and the Jonas Foundation — a foundation run by Howard Jonas, the founder and chair of IDT — contributed $1.12 million.

The Central Fund of Israel is involved in development of settlements in occupied territories.

Ira Greenstein held around 100,000 shares in Genie Energy while assuming his position in the administration.

Another issue is the timing regarding donations to Trump’s campaign, Greenstein donated $10,000 to Make America Great Again, in late August of 2015. This could fall under 18 U.S.C. § 211 since he later rose to hold key positions in the presidential transition team and then in the White House itself. Positions which affected foreign policy at the root.

Donations occurred just a few weeks after substantial oil was discovered at the Ness-3 drilling site, in the Golan Heights. This followed earlier findings at Ness-5, in May of 2015, a little over two years into the initial three year exploratory license granted to Afek Oil And Gas.

Genie Energy also exploits other resources in occupied Syrian territory, like water, through its drilling services company Atid Drilling Ltd. — which launched in January of 2017.

The surrounding area supplies a third of water to Israel.

Ira Greenstein previously communicated with Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton, before he was appointed Chairman of the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC).

Reuters:

Clayton also disclosed in his written responses that he communicated with others, including Rebekah Mercer, a Trump donor whose father, Robert Mercer, founded the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies; Genie Energy Ltd President Ira Greenstein; venture capitalist Darren Blanton; Martin Silverstein, a lawyer who is senior counsel with the law firm Greenberg Taurig and who was ambassador to Uruguay for four years under President George W. Bush; Trump’s current chief strategist Steve Bannon; and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, the documents show.

More recently, it has been reported that after meeting with Joshua Harris from Apollo Global Management (AGM), one of two companies that gave Jared Kushner a loan — a SEC investigation targeted at AGM was dropped. This transpired after Greenstein had communicated with the future SEC Chairman, with Greenstein — as noted — working under both Chris Liddell and Reed Cordish overseeing infrastructure policy.

Greenstein appears to provide the missing link to this incident.

A further connection between parties is found through David Blitzer, who is involved with Hillel International, which had partnered with Mosaic United, in projects involving millions spearheading activities for the Israeli government. Blitzer previously made a deal with Harris in a major acquisition of the New Jersey Devils and the Prudential Center arena in Newark. As noted, Greenstein is also the President of Mosaic United and from Newark.

Greenstein is or was also Counsel to Global Risk Advisors (GRA), founded by former U.S. diplomat Kevin Chalker, it is a multi-tiered corporation which had gone to Doha, the capital of Qatar, to register a branch last year. GRA Quantum is involved in cyber-security and has on its Advisory Board members such as Matthew Waxman — Columbia Law School alumni like Greenstein — who is also a member of the Council On Foreign Relations (CFR). GRA Maven is involved in training government, military and police for clandestine operations.

Greenstein provides a direct line from this group to the White House.

The New York-based private security firm Global Risk Advisors (GRA) registered a new subsidiary in Qatar in October. The new entity will handle missions in the Middle East. GRA, which was founded by Kevin Chalker, will be represented in Doha by David Powell, a former member of the Ministry of…

Martin Silverstein, one of the other lawyers that was on the presidential transition team, is an old friend of both the Kushner and Trump families. He had also met with Clayton at the time.

Renaissance Technologies, whose CEO Robert Mercer funds Breitbart with tens of millions of dollars as a major stakeholder, also owns part of Genie Energy as a significant shareholder.

Breitbart has previously defended Rupert Murdoch, owner of The Sun, in regards to U.K. Labour politician Caroline Kolek’s Tweets about Genie Energy and Murdoch’s involvement in it — calling her Tweets “anti-Semitic.”

Jason Greenblatt, another senior White House staffer who was Donald Trump’s lawyer at the Trump Organization as Chief Legal Officer, also has investments in Genie Energy. Greenblatt is Trump’s adviser on Israel, currently serving as an Assistant to the President and as Special Representative For International Negotiations. Like Greenstein, his position in handling affairs abroad directly comes into question due to these shares and his employment represents a secondary conflict of interest.

Where this conflict of interest is most apparent or blatant, is Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt hovering behind Nikki Haley at the U.N. — with her rhetoric about Syria as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. being directly contrasted by her being vetted by Ira Greenstein.

Haley, nor her fellow aides, can be trusted by the public to be impartial.

The CEO as well as Chairman of one of Genie Energy’s largest shareholders, BlackRock, visited the White House just a few days after the airstrikes (April 11th). Laurence Fink and the monolithic firm that he represents — as well as proximal involvement by Goldman Sachs — stand to gain from both lobbying and utilizing the U.S. military for their own self-interest(s). Subsequently, BlackRock’s former [pre-1995] parent company Blackstone and its CEO Stephen Schwarzman also met on the same day.

Schwarzman was also an adviser to then President-elect Donald Trump.

BlackRock is also one of the largest shareholders of Raytheon, the defense contractor that manufactures Tomahawk cruise missiles. The U.S. Navy has requested Raytheon to replace these under a modified contract.

Greenstein also owns shares in Axalta Coating Systems, which paints components and vehicles for Raytheon.

Like the Kushner’s $250,000,000 credit line for Cadre through Soros Fund Management, they have also received funds from Blackstone, for real estate.

Lord Jacob Rothschild sits on the International Advisory Board of Blackstone.

Another point of inherent subjugation within the Trump administration is IDT Corporation’s Michael Glassner, Chief Strategist, including for reelection (2020).

Jacinda Ardern has become the first New Zealand prime minister to walk in the country’s gay pride parade.

More than 25,000 people watched the parade in Auckland on Saturday night, cheering as the prime minister strolled down Ponsonby Road flanked by her finance minister, Grant Robertson, a gay man, and Louisa Wall, a Labour MP who is gay.

Although the prime minister did not partake in some of the more exuberant fashions, she got into the swing of festivities by dancing, taking selfies with admirers and bestowing hugs on members of the crowd.

Ardern said LGBTQI people in New Zealand still faced many challenges, including bullying, mental health problems and discrimination.

“Ultimately this is a parade about diversity and inclusiveness. And I’m really proud of the work the team has done to make that real over the years and in our laws,” Ardern told TVNZ.

“But we can’t be complacent. As long as there are kids in New Zealand, if they are LGBTQI, if they have high levels of mental health issues or self harm, that tells us that we still have work to do.”

The producer of the parade, Shaughan Woodcock, told the New Zealand Herald the prime minister’s decision to march in the parade was “very exciting” and a significant step forward.

“I think the overall message is that we are being led by a progressive government, a government that stands for all groups not just some,” Woodcock said.

“It also sends a very clear message that New Zealand is leading the way around basic human rights and human rights for our rainbow community, and that it is time for the other countries to step up.”

Over 50 floats were involved in the parade, including ones from New Zealand police, Rainbow Teachers and – for the first time – New Zealand Rugby.

Julie Anne Genter, a Greens MP and minister for women, also attended the parade, dressed in purple and riding her bike.

Genter, 38, announced on Sunday that she is pregnant, and intends to take six weeks off after giving birth in August, followed by six weeks working from home, after which her partner Peter Nunns would take over childcare full-time.

Genter is one of two candidates vying for the co-leadership of the Greens party, and said she told Ardern her pregnancy news after the prime minister told her she was expecting a child in June.

“It’s a bit exciting, and unexpected news, but I’m really looking forward to the opportunity to have yet another woman leading the way in this government and showing that it is possible for women to hold careers and have families at the same time,” Genter said at a press conference on Sunday."
Emma Watson donates ?1m to help fund for sexual harassment victims,http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/emma-watson-donates-1m-victims-fund-sexual-harassment-times-up-baftas-women-letter-red-carpet-times-a8216151.html,"Emma Watson has donated £1m to a new campaign aiming to help those affected by sexual harassment.

The donation from the Harry Potter star to the UK Justice and Equality Fund comes as nearly 200 female British and Irish stars signed an open letter calling for an end to sexual harassment in the workplace.

Watson is one of the first donors to the fund, which was set up by the 190 women who signed the open letter, along with a group of 160 academics, activists and charity workers.

​Emma Thompson, Carey Mulligan, Saoirse Ronan, Gemma Chan, Keira Knightley and Watson are among the actors to sign the letter, which was published in The Observer.

The letter says Sunday’s Bafta awards ceremony is a time to “celebrate this tremendous moment of solidarity and unity across borders by coming together and making this movement international”.

“This movement is bigger than just a change in our industry alone,” it continues. “In the very near past, we lived in a world where sexual harassment was an uncomfortable joke; an unavoidable awkward part of being a girl or a woman.”

It concludes: “If you have said ‘time’s up’, if the stories you have read in the papers have resonated and distressed you – join us in shifting the dial. Let’s make 2018 the year that time was up on sexual harassment and abuse. This is your moment too.”

Women attending the Bafta Awards in London last night have also said they will wear black on the red carpet, in a show of solidarity with the Hollywood-based Time’s Up movement.

Many are set to attend the ceremony with activists and campaigners rather than their partners. For instance, Gemma Arterton will be joined by former sewing machine operators Eileen Pullen and Gwen Davis, two of the 187 women who staged a three week walk-out from Ford’s Dagenham plant in June 1968 after learning they were to be paid 15 per cent less than their male counterparts.

The Baftas ceremony will be held at London’s Royal Albert Hall and will air from 9pm today on BBC1."

Remarkable secrets of ketamine's antidepressant effect unlocked by scientists,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/ketamine-antidepressant-brain-scientists-psychiatrists-nature-depression-suicidal-thoughts-mood-a8212936.html?amp&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter&__twitter_impression=true,"The Independent employs over 100 journalists around the world to bring you news you can trust.

Ketamine, most commonly known for its use as a recreational drug, has in recent years come to be thought of as the biggest breakthrough psychiatric treatment for severe depression in half a century.

In as little as half an hour it has been shown to banish severe and even suicidal thoughts in patients with treatment-resistant depression, often after all other options have been exhausted, and the effects can last for weeks.

Now, a study, published in the journal Nature, has been able to shine a light on how ketamine jams the mechanics of acute mental health problems and could be a step towards a new generation of drugs.

While the treatment is currently available privately in the UK, it needs to be professionally administered and is a last resort following the failure of other options because it can be abused recreationally, and it can also induce a temporary psychotic state similar to schizophrenia.

Compared to traditional antidepressants, which can take days before an improvement in the patient’s mood is seen, ketamine’s fast action made scientists think it was acting on a fundamental link of the brain chemistry of depression.

But, despite its use in the clinic, the way it works “has remained elusive”, the authors of the new study said.

The team of doctors and neuroscientists from Zhejiang University in China have shown it switches off an erratic burst of electrical impulses firing in neurons in the brain region known as the lateral habenula.

“The lateral habenula is like the ‘anti-reward centre’ in the brain,” the study’s lead author Professor Hailan Hu told The Independent.

When it’s firing it acts against these areas where key mood-boosting neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin are produced and collected in the brain.

“The lateral habenula inhibits both of those reward centres,” she added. “So when it goes into the bursting mode, the suppression becomes much stronger, it’s like a machine gun compared to a single shot.”

While in the last decade the habenula has come to be thought of as an important driver for the negative moods affecting depression, the reasons behind this had been hard to show.

This is in part due to the difficulty of studying brain activity without powerful brain imaging scans.

How to spot signs of depression

Professor Hu’s team have been examining this region, using rats to look at differences in depressed and normal brains, for a number of years and had identified patterns of irregular electrical activity that they thought could be playing a part.

But identifying that this rapid “machine gun firing” of electrical impulses in the habenula was shut off by ketamine was a “serendipitous discovery”.

“In previous experiments we had delivered ketamine generally into the body, so you wouldn’t know which brain region was being affected,” Professor Hu said.

“But in this study we injected it directly into the lateral habenula and we were surprised to find that just affecting this very localised area was sufficient to have this very rapid antidepressant effect.”

This was similar to rapid relief of symptoms that can be seen in human patients, and suggests that ketamine’s remarkable effects are largely derived from this one area as no other parts of the brain are being treated.

With further experiments they were able to show a group of receptors (NMDARs) are causing these signals and are blocked by ketamine.

In an analysis of the findings, also published in Nature, Dr Paul Kenny, professor of neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the results were “striking”.

“Ketamine is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of major depressive disorder with imminent risk of suicide, but the mechanisms by which ketamine acts have been a puzzle to scientists.

“These findings suggest that the therapeutic actions of ketamine might relate, at least in part, to its ability to block burst firing in the lateral habenula ”"
The health ministry on Friday approved an outline for raising the optional age for tapping public pensions to 71 or older to address the national labor shortage stemming from Japan's falling birthrate and rapidly graying population.,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/02/16/national/politics-diplomacy/government-oks-plan-hike-pension-collection-age-71/,"The government on Friday approved an outline for raising the optional age for tapping public pensions to 71 or older to address the national labor shortage stemming from Japan’s falling birthrate and rapidly graying population.

The ministry will consider revising the related laws in fiscal 2020 to encourage people in their 60s or older to continue working.

The ministry’s outline notes that older adults are physically healthier than previous generations and are highly motivated to continue working or participate in community activities.

In addition, the outline says the government will review the “standardization of life stages according to age categories.”

“Depopulation in rural areas is expected as the pace of aging picks up. It is important to realize a society where people of all generations can widely and actively participate,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said during a meeting on the issue Friday.

After studying next year’s pension financing, the ministry plans to design a new system in a more concrete manner.

By law, one’s pension can be tapped at any time between 60 and 70. If a person chooses to start receiving his or her pension after their 65th birthday, their monthly payments are raised. But this scheme is not widely used.

“We will earnestly consider expanding options,” health minister Katsunobu Kato told a news conference.

But Kato ruled out the possibility of the pension collection age, which is currently set at 65 in principle, being hiked uniformly.

The government is looking to back the idea of companies raising their retirement ages or extending post-retirement employment.

It will also consider providing support for people who start their own businesses and promote telecommuting.

The government will also support the development of advanced technologies, such as automated driving systems and nursing robots, to help the elderly work.

The outline, which is reviewed roughly every five years, also set a range of numerical targets. These include goals to reduce the number of drivers 80 or older killed in traffic accidents to below 200 by 2020, compared with 266 in 2016, and raise the employment rate for people between 60 and 64 to 67.0 percent by 2020, compared with the current 63.6 percent."
"Antigua and Barbuda Set to Decriminalise Cannabis, as Prime Minister Says It is ""Part of the Culture of the Country""",https://www.talkingdrugs.org/antigua-barbuda-decriminalise-cannabis,"Legislators in Antigua and Barbuda’s lower house have voted to decriminalise cannabis possession, allow Rastafarians to use cannabis ritually, and expunge prior possession convictions.

On February 6, legislators in the Caribbean nation's House of Representatives voted to approve the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill. The bill, which has support from Prime Minister Gaston Browne, seeks to decriminalise the possession of less than 10 grams of cannabis for all adults, and allow Rastafarian people to legally use cannabis during religious rituals and ceremonies. It also aims to offset harms that criminalisation has caused by expunging prior convictions for minor cannabis offences.

Cannabis has been illegal in the multi-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda since Governor Wilfred Jacobs signed the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 into law, while the country was ruled by the British Empire.

Speaking at the parliamentary debate on cannabis, Prime Minister Browne recalled personally witnessing police using excessive force against Rastafarian people for alleged cannabis offences prior to the country gaining independence from British rulers.

“[The police] were rampant. Just the smell of marijuana, they would literally go into people’s private homes and literally abuse them […] I recall a couple of times I see guys running, literally running from police officers even before they approached them because they knew the consequences. The consequences were not just prosecution. It was also brutalisation,” Browne said, according to the Antigua Observer, “I want to take this opportunity to apologise to the family members of those individuals for the abuse that would have taken place over the decades”.

The bill is awaiting approval from the country’s upper house, the Senate, before passing in to law – but PM Browne has already made a direct plea to police officers to stop prosecuting people for cannabis use.

“I want to signal to the members of the police force, in the interim, that they desist from incriminating individuals,” he said in an interview with Pointe FM. “The government has made its policy very clear. Even though the law has not been changed, at least they must respect the intent and give those who use marijuana a break”.

The bill outlines that no adult can be charged for simply possessing under 10 grams of cannabis, but that smoking cannabis in a public place can potentially lead to a conviction. People found smoking cannabis in public should face a warning and a ticket on their first and second offence respectively, but ""third or subsequent occasion offenders"" could face a conviction and a fine of up to $1500, the bill states. Rastafarian people would be exempt from this rule in certain circumstances, as the bill would permit them to use ""cannabis in a lawful way during sacred ritual ceremonies"".

Samantha Marshall MP - head of the government's cannabis commission - warned that the wider public should understand that this is not full legalisation, and that “the use of that substance should be in your private home”.

Antigua and Barbuda's cannabis bill goes further than similar legislation abroad in undoing the consequences of criminalisation, as it would work retrospectively. According to Clause 6 of the bill, any person convicted for an offence involving 10 grams of cannabis or less - regardless of the offence - would have their conviction ""spent and expunged"".

While the bill is yet to be approved by the Senate, its significant cross-party political support suggests that it is likely to proceed smoothly into law. Prime Minister Browne believes that it should have strong support among the public too: “The use of marijuana is now socially acceptable,” he said, “it is, in essence, a part of the culture of the country.”

Update: On 5 March 2018, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2018 took effect - meaning that the possession of 15 grams of cannabis or less (by an adult) is no loonger a criminal offence."
American man whose Northern Irish wife refuses to identify as British finally approved for UK visa,https://www.irishcentral.com/news/american-man-whose-northern-irish-wife-refuses-to-identify-as-british-finally-approved-for-uk-visa,"The Californian husband of a Co Derry native was previously denied a UK work visa because his wife did not identify as a British citizen.

As of Monday, the couple were vindicated as a Belfast court rejected the UK Home Office's bid to appeal against his right to live in Britain (Belfast) with his wife.

The court maintained that Emma DeSouza would not have to go through a procedure to denounce her Irish citizenship, as initially demanded by the UK Home Office.

Jake DeSouza married his wife in Belfast in July 2015. Five months later, the couple became involved in a highly publicized debate over citizenship as they attempted to gain UK residency for DeSouza.

County Derry native Emma had only ever carried an Irish passport. Thus, DeSouza's application to become a British citizen was rejected over the ground's that his wife should technically identify as British.

In a post she penned for Medium, his wife wrote passionately about her right to hold on to her Irish heritage, as a ""child who grew up in The Troubles"":

""At its core my identity is first and foremost Irish. It is not something I chose or considered, simply put, it is who I am. But would you consider me Irish if I told you I was born in Northern Ireland?""

By law, the couple were told the only way forward was for Emma to declare herself as a British citizen.

However their case relied on The Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which maintained that residents of Northern Ireland can select whether they should be classed as British or Irish citizens, or more importantly, a citizen of both.

The pair also argued that as an Irish citizen, Emma was therefore an EU citizen exercising her freedom of movement rights.

The newlyweds have spent over a year tied up in the legal battle, raising awareness about the fraught path between declaring citizenship of Britain or Ireland.

Meet Shadow - he may not look Irish to well just about anyone but he is an Irish water spaniel... (and half labrador) he was born and raised on our beautiful island. He reminds us that identity isn't something you can see #WeAreIrish #HeIsIrishtoo #YouAreIrish #GFA pic.twitter.com/TPjR9kV2eJ — Emma DeSouza (@EmmandJDeSouza) February 11, 2018

Writing of the moment the couple were granted work and residency status for DeSouza, Emma stated on her Facebook page,

""Something amazing and wonderful for us and many others has happened today. The Home Offices application to appeal has been refused on the grounds that there is no arguable error in law. We have the privilege of being able to chose our identity whether that be Irish, British or Both and the home offices inability to recognise and respect that choice is coming to an end. The Good Friday Agreement is binding, not aspirational and protects all of us in the North. We are just so thankful to be winning without having to compromise who we are.""

At present, a UK Home Office spokesperson said it was examining the ruling and considering whether to launch yet another appeal.

Meanwhile, Sinn Féin politician Niall O Donghaille is also calling on Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney to meet with Emma and ensure she is protected from the ongoing campaign being waged against her by the UK Home Office for asserting her rights as an Irish national who is resident in the North."
AI is helping seismologists detect earthquakes they'd otherwise miss | The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17011396/ai-earthquake-detection-oklahoma-neural-network,"Oklahoma never used to be known for its earthquakes. Before 2009, the state had roughly two quakes of magnitude three and above each year. (Magnitude three is when things shake on the shelf, but before houses start getting damaged.) In 2015, this tally rocketed to more than 900, though it’s calmed since, falling to 304 last year.

This sudden increase is thought to be caused by the disposal of wastewater by the state’s booming fracking industry, and it’s caught seismologists off-guard. As a historically quake-free area, Oklahoma doesn’t have enough equipment to detect and locate all of these quakes, making it hard to investigate their root cause. “There are no major faults in Oklahoma so it’s just not something we would expect,” Thibaut Perol, a deep learning researcher who’s worked on this problem, tells The Verge. “And to understand what’s happening, we need a big, big catalogue of earthquakes.”

“We need a big, big catalogue of earthquakes.”

The solution proposed by Perol and his colleagues from Harvard University’s engineering and earth sciences departments is to use artificial intelligence to amplify the sensitivity of the state’s earthquake detectors, otherwise known as seismographs. In a paper published today in the journal Science Advances, they show how effective this technique is — capable of detecting 17 times more earthquakes than older methods in a fraction of the time.

The method is similar to the voice detection software used by digital assistants like Alexa and Siri, explains Perol. It’s all about uncovering the signal hidden in the noise. With Alexa, that means listening out for your voice commands while ignoring the background sound of your home. And for seismographs, it means cancelling out the normal geological rumblings of the Earth (what’s known as “ambient seismic noise”) to spot the earthquakes that might be very small or far away. This way, scientists in Oklahoma can get more out of the data they already have.

To make this happen, Perol and his colleagues trained a convolutional neural network to recognize background noise, feeding it data from seismically quiet areas, like pre-fracking era Oklahoma and the geological dead-zone of Wisconsin. (The state has only really had one significant earthquake, and that was in 1947.) As with all neural networks, the software examines this input and learns to pick out common patterns. Once it knows what ambient rumblings sound like, it can remove these from the data, leaving behind the tiny earthquakes that had previously been hidden — like sea shells revealed by a retreating tide. As a bonus, the neural network is even able to identify the rough whereabouts of individual quakes by matching the patterns they created with historical data where a tremor’s location was known.

“With this method we are able to detect earthquakes of magnitude zero or minus one, and these are signals you wouldn’t be able to see with a human eye,” says Perol.

William Yeck, a seismologist at the United States Geological Survey (USGS), praised the work as “compelling and novel.” Speaking to The Verge by email, he noted that the neural network would best apply to “local earthquake monitoring efforts” — as in Oklahoma — “where there are high-seismicity rates.” Yeck cautions, though, that earthquake detection is only ever going to be a part of the puzzle. “Estimations of earthquake sizes and accurate event locations are also necessary,” says Yeck. “For the very small events that this technique detects, this will be challenging.”

If this neural network can be used more widely in Oklahoma applied, says Perol, it’ll help seismologists investigate the exact cause of the state’s earthquakes. There’s even some hope that it could predict earthquakes before they occur. This could be done by looking for patterns in the data; for example, finding times when a number of small earthquakes have happened in quick succession, triggering a bigger, potentially damaging quake.

The idea of using AI to predict — not just detect — earthquakes is an exciting one, but it’s not something that the whole seismologist community is confident about.

Heathrow airport incident: engineer dies after serious accident on airfield,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/heathrow-airport-incident-latest-updates-man-dead-killed-london-flights-terminal-5-vehicles-crash-a8209956.html,"A British Airways aircraft engineer has died after two vehicles crashed in a “serious accident” on the airfield at London’s Heathrow Airport.

The collision took place near the “B” gates of Terminal 5, used by BA.

A man in his forties was taken to hospital in west London after going into cardiac arrest, according to police and paramedics.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police’s serious collision investigation unit are investigating and the Health and Safety Executive has been informed, the force said.

A Heathrow spokesman said: “We can confirm that following a serious accident involving two vehicles on our airfield, an airport colleague has passed away.

“Our deepest condolences go to the family and friends affected by this accident. We will be fully cooperating with the police in the investigation which will follow.”

British Airways said: “We are deeply saddened by this tragic incident and are offering our full care and support to his family and colleagues.”

The Met said the other man was thought to have suffered a broken shoulder in the crash, shortly after 6am, but his injuries were not life-threatening or life-changing.

No arrests have been made, it said.

London Fire Brigade said it had been called to release two people who were trapped in the vehicles following the crash.

At least 20 British Airways flights from Terminal 5 were delayed and passengers were ordered to leave an aircraft which was unable to take off because of the incident.

The airport was not closed as a result of the accident and no passengers were involved.

British Airways passengers to Amsterdam and Zurich, whose aircraft were near the scene of the accident, were delayed by more than three hours.

There were also flight delays of over two hours to Tel Aviv and an hour or more on flights to Istanbul, Manchester, Milan and Newcastle.

In the aftermath of the crash, Heathrow initially said it would not disrupt flights.

The airport was responding to a tweet from Alastair MacLeod, who said: “Apparently there has been an accident on one of the runways at @HeathrowAirport and many planes (including this one) are parked on the apron with unspecified delays of ‘hours’.

“No public news of this and no useful updates from @British_Airways – anyone out there know any more?”

Heathrow Airport then responded on Twitter, saying: “Following an incident on the airfield involving two members of staff, an investigation is underway and we are working with the police. This incident didn’t involve any passengers and is not expected to cause any impact on journeys today.”

Another passenger, Steven Ross, tweeted in response: “With respect, it is impacting journeys departing B gates – BA710 to Zurich delayed by +2 hrs and aircraft change required.”"
'Caring' town may boot homeless for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/02/14/homeless-may-get-kicked-out-prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-royal-wedding/327256002/,"Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s wedding may relocate homeless in ‘caring’ Windsor

WINDSOR, England — It's a place fit for a prince, but not, it seems, for a pauper.

Ahead of Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle's wedding here May 19, this picturesque riverside town is grappling with a problem affecting a growing number of communities across England: homelessness.

Windsor is host to the world's oldest and largest inhabited castle. Queen Elizabeth II uses it on weekends. It has a Gothic chapel that is the final resting place of 10 monarchs, including Henry VIII. The town, 25 miles west of London, has put on royal weddings for centuries.

But a rift in this otherwise serene place has opened up after Simon Dudley, a local Conservative Party official, suggested police should consider using legal powers to clear the destitute from Windsor's streets so that ""aggressive begging and intimidation"" and bags and debris do not spoil Harry and Markle's big day.

More: 11 burning questions about the royal wedding

""It’s not just because they are homeless and we don’t want them here, although it doesn’t look great for tourists when they are always being asked for money,"" said Kelly Carpenter, who runs a pub across from Windsor Castle, where the pair will wed.

""They are a security threat. Anyone could be hiding under those blankets.""

For the royal wedding in April 2011 of Harry's older brother, Prince William, to Kate Middleton in Westminster Abbey in central London, about 350,000 overseas visitors showed up in Britain that month, according to the Office for National Statistics.

When USA TODAY visited Windsor in early February, about a half-dozen people were bundled in sleeping bags amid cardboard boxes. Layers of warm clothing could be seen in prominent spots on the town's High Street, one of the main thoroughfares on which Harry and Markle will greet crowds as part of a carriage procession through the town.

Windsor is filled with upmarket restaurants, tea rooms, quaint pubs and fancy stores selling kitchen goods, antiques and pricey clothing. Businesses here are busy renting out rooms, hiring extra staff, concocting special menus, designing royal-wedding-themed souvenirs — and preparing to be besieged by thousands of tourists, well-wishers and media for the wedding.

But it is also a place caught up in the U.K.'s homelessness problem. Over the past year, homelessness in England is up 14% and has risen by 136% over the past five years, according to government statistics. Homeless charities such as Mungos, based in London, blame cuts by Prime Minister Theresa May's administration to social welfare programs for the spike in numbers.

But in Windsor, with a population of 32,200, there are only 12 to 15 people who routinely live on the streets, said Murphy James, who runs the Windsor Homelessness Project, an organization that provides food, health services and housing advice.

""Dudley called it an 'epidemic.' ""It's not an epidemic,"" James said.

James added that Windsor was a ""caring and compassionate"" town. He believes most of the people disagree with Dudley's controversial suggestion.

Since making the comments in January, Dudley has survived a no-confidence vote in his position as the leader of Windsor and Maidenhead Council. He has also said his remarks were misinterpreted. The council, meanwhile, has moved forward with a separate proposal that forbids bedding, belongings and other personal items from being left unattended in Windsor.

The proposal includes a fine of about $140 for those who fail to heed the law, although existing legislation already permits police to remove the homeless from public places.

""If we were living in the 1800s I could maybe understand it, but not now,"" said Kevin Dorian, 47, referring to the crackdown on vagrants in that time period. Dorian grew up in Windsor. He has spent time in prison for robbery, and he has been homeless here since 2003.

""This is a wealthy area, in a wealthy country. More should be done to help us,"" he said. ""We're people. We're not just animals who can be shooed away.""

And Stuart Thatcher, 40, a former heroin user who now occupies a coveted spot under a bus shelter directly across from Windsor Castle, said he would forcibly resist any attempts by the authorities to make him leave the town. ""They will have to physically pick me up,"" Thatcher said.

When asked about the upcoming royal wedding, Thatcher said: ""Is Harry marrying an American? I’m really happy for him. Of course, mate."""
Giant lava dome discovered growing inside Japanese supervolcano that could release 40 cubic kilometres of magma - Bulge of molten rock beneath underwater structure could be capable of triggering supereruption like one that took place 7300 years ago,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/japan-supervolcano-giant-lava-dome-discovered-kikai-caldera-a8210221.html,"One of the world’s largest lava domes has been discovered in an underwater volcano south of Japan, suggesting an enormous build-up of magma may exist underneath it.

The structure, which appears to be growing in size, was formed following the Akahoya supereruption that took place at the site 7300 years ago, leaving a 12-mile hollow called Kikai Caldera.

That eruption is thought to have wiped out the ancient Jomon culture that inhabited the southern Japanese island of Kyushu at the time.

Supereruptions are rare but devastating events that can have global impacts due to volcanic ash and chemicals obscuring the Sun and triggering a “volcanic winter”.

The researchers who made the discovery said there was a slim chance a supereruption could once again occur at the site, releasing over 10 cubic miles of magma in one burst.

While the likelihood is low, the damage that such an eruption would cause makes understanding the necessary circumstances a priority for scientists.

“Although the probability of a gigantic caldera eruption hitting the Japanese archipelago is 1 per cent in the next 100 years, it is estimated that the death toll could rise to approximately 100 million in the worst case scenario,” Professor Yoshiyuki Tatsumi, head of the Kobe Ocean-Bottom Exploration Center and a magma specialist, told The Mainichi.

On a series of three survey voyages conducted throughout 2017, Professor Tatsumi and his team explored the bottom of Kikai Caldera. A caldera is a crater that forms when a volcano collapses following eruption.

In doing so, they identified the lava dome, which rises 600 metres above the seabed, protruding from the caldera’s bottom.

While magma refers to molten rock stored beneath the Earth’s crust, lava is magma that has reached the surface through a volcano. Analysis of rocks from the dome revealed it was formed by solidifying lava – the result of a far smaller eruption that has taken place since Akahoya.

Upon further inspection, a distortion in the dome’s surface suggested a growing chamber of magma inside it.

The discovery of the lava dome does not necessarily mean the next supereruption is right around the corner, but a developing magma chamber could be capable of triggering just such an eruption, according to the scientists.

The results of this research were published in the journal Scientific Reports, and Professor Tatsumi is planning a voyage to the site in March to confirm the findings.

They will use underwater robots to unravel the processes that resulted in the volcano’s formation, and use seismic and electromagnetic methods to determine the existence of a sizeable accumulation of magma."

German-Russian trade picking up sharply,http://www.dw.com/en/german-russian-trade-picking-up-sharply/a-42564278,"Following years of slumping trade activity, the exchange of goods and services between Russia and Germany saw a considerable increase in 2017.

Customs officials said trade between the two nations soared by roughly 23 percent in 2017 year on year despite the ongoing negative impact of economic sanctions slapped on Russia by Brussels over Moscow's alleged role in the Ukraine conflict and the annexation of Crimea.

The German-Russian Chamber of Commerce (AHK) said the exchange of goods totaled $50 billion (€41 billion) last year.

Positive outlook

Russia imported German goods worth €19.7 billion marking a 25-percent increase, while Russian shipments to Germany rose by roughly 21 percent over the same 12-month period.

AHK chief Matthias Schepp welcomed the pickup, but added it had been far from offsetting previous dips.

""We hope that the positive trend will carry over into the current year,"" he told reporters in Moscow.

Schepp added that fresh impetus is bound to come with the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia this summer. He mentioned the large number of German companies helping to provide vehicles, machinery and chemical products for the building projects surrounding the sporting events.

The Obamas Official Portraits,http://time.com/5143747/obama-presidential-portrait-kehinde-wiley/,"The National Portrait Gallery unveiled the long-awaited portraits of former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama on Monday.

The Obamas’ portraits were painted by New York based artist Kehinde Wiley and Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald. They are the first African Americans commissioned to paint official portraits of the first couple for the National Portrait Gallery. The two artists’ works will be on display at the National Portrait Gallery starting on February 13. Aside from the White House, the Gallery is home to the only complete collection of presidential portraits; according to the Smithsonian, it is comprised of more than 1,600 works.

Each artist has a distinct way of presenting black subjects.

Wiley, who painted President Obama, is best known for his vivid depictions of people of color. His most famous collection features young black men— “street cast” on the sidewalks of New York— in grand scenes and poses that mimic the works of classical Western artists. His work has offered a stylized blend of the old and the new, and is often meant to challenge perceptions of black people, particularly the young black men who live in urban centers of the U.S.

“I tried to negotiate less gray hair, smaller ears,” Obama joked at the unveiling. “Maybe the one are where there were some concessions … his initial impulse may be in the work may be to elevate me … mounting me on horses … and I had to explain I’ve got enough political problems without you making me look like Napoleon.”

Obama called the process of sitting for a portrait “torturous,” noting that as far as he knows he’s the first person in his family to have a portrait done.

Kehinde, who noted that he was “humbled” by the invitation to paint Obama, said that he backdrop includes flowers from Chicago, Kenya and Hawaii as a way of showing the president’s background.

Though lesser known than Wiley, Sherald is a rising star in the art world. In 2016, she became the first woman to win the National Portrait Gallery Outwin Boochever Portrait competition, beating 2,500 other entries. She was also recently awarded the High Museum of Art’s David Driskell Prize.

Bold colors and patterns are a constant in Sherald’s work — from the bright red fascinator adorned by the young Miss Everything to the multi-colored print dress that pops from the canvas of her 2017 work, Untitled — but the skin of her African American subjects is often presented in varying shades of gray. She has also been said to seek out subjects who she sees as “existing in the past, present, and future simultaneously,” according to Artnet.

Though she did not choose the First Lady as a subject, in an interview with the New York Times she described her as “an archetype that a lot of women can relate to — no matter shape, size, race or color. We see our best selves in her.”

Since the administration of President George H.W. Bush, the National Portrait Gallery has been commissioning portraits of American presidents. In 2006, starting with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the gallery also began commissioning portraits of the First Lady. President Obama’s portrait will be on display in the recently renovated “American Presidents” exhibit on the gallery’s second floor.

Former First Lady Michelle Obama’s portrait will be hung somewhere else in the museum.

"German workers win right to 28-hour week following industrial action: Collective deal covers around 900,000 metal and engineering workers but is expected to prompt changes across Germany and in other industries.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-workers-right-28hour-week-trade-union-industrial-action-ig-metall-a8205751.html,"German workers have won the right to a 28-hour week in a victory towards their fight for a better work-life balance.

Industrial union IG Metall, Europe’s largest trade union, has won its workers the right to work the equivalent of under six hours each day in a deal that could eventually impact almost 4 million people in the country.

The collective deal covers around 900,000 metal and engineering workers in the south-western state of Baden-Württemberg, but it is expected to prompt changes across the country and in other industries.

It means from next year, workers at many of Germany’s most important engineering firms can opt to take on a 28-hour working week for up to two years. Employers will not be able to prevent individual workers from taking up the offer.

The agreement comes after IG Metall called three 24-hour strikes and workers downed tools at a number of engineering companies. In return for agreeing the shorter week, employers gained a right to offer more workers 40-hour contracts, meaning the deal will offer more flexibility.

The union’s demands reflect changing working preferences of employees who want more private time instead of more pay. Some want to care for their children or ailing parents while others want to engage in communal work.

Jorg Hoffman leader of IG Metall, said the agreement was a ""milestone on the way to a modern, self-determined world of work"".

Rainer Dugler, head of the employers' association for the industry, echoed his remarks, saying: “It was worth the effort. We have laid the foundation for a flexible working time system.""

The deal represents a major breakthrough for flexible working in Europe, and comes partly in response to the rise of the so-called gig economy, where workers are able to control their own hours with much greater ease than those on full time contracts."

A love affair that spanned decades – and species – is at an end.

Thomas the blind, bisexual goose died last week, and will be buried next to his partner of nearly 30 years, a black swan named Henry, on the edge of the Kāpiti lagoon that the pair called home.

Having spent his final years at a Wellington bird sanctuary, Thomas will be laid to rest with a public ceremony held later this month, birdwatcher Mik Peryer said.

STUFF Thomas the gay goose at his new home in Ohariu Valley, having been relocated from the Waimanu Lagoon in Waikanae Beach.

""It was a 30 year love story that should be celebrated.""

Initially, when the pair were first seen together, Henry was thought to be a female swan but the lack of babies soon proved otherwise, he said.

The happy partnership was briefly tested when Henry paired up with a female swan but Thomas stuck around, even helping to raise the inevitable babies.

""Prior to Henrietta turning up they had about 18 happy gay years together.""

SUPPLIED Thomas helped raise over 60 cygnets.

The feathered threesome delighted visitors who watched the ""the eternal triangle"" raise 68 cygnet over the years with Thomas fulfilling the role of doting uncle.

He was left heartbroken after Henry's 2009 death and could be heard occasionally crying for him, Peryer said.

""Henrietta just flew off with another bird, being a young female, but poor old Tom was left on his own.""

SUPPLIED Thomas the goose with orphaned goslings at Wellington Bird Rehabilitation Trust.

The arrival of a couple of female geese finally saw Thomas father his own babies only to have them stolen by another goose, named George, who raised them as his own.

""You would see George and the babies with Thomas just following them around.""

Failing eyesight and attacks by swans saw Thomas rehomed to the Wellington Bird Rehabilitation Trust in 2013, where he spent his final years eating corn and raising orphaned cygnets.

Thomas, who Peryer estimated to be 38-years-old, will be buried under the commemorative stone – complete with plaque – that marks Henry's final resting place.

""We had about 100 people turn up for Henry and I wouldn't be surprised if the same happened for Thomas.""​"
New research on nearly 2 million Uber drivers finds a gender earnings gap of 7% even in the complete absence of gender discrimination,https://www.aei.org/publication/new-research-on-nearly-2-million-uber-drivers-finds-a-gender-earnings-gap-of-7-even-in-the-complete-absence-of-gender-discrimination/,"Blog Post

AEIdeas

There’s a really interesting new research paper titled “The Gender Earnings Gap in the Gig Economy: Evidence from More Than a Million Rideshare Drivers” written by five economists — two who are employed by Uber Technologies (Cody Cook and (Jonathan Hall), two Stanford graduate business professors (Rebecca Diamond and Paul Oyer) and the chairman of the University of Chicago economics department (John List). It was featured yesterday as a Freakonomics podcast. As the title of the paper suggests, the researchers analyzed national ride-sharing data for nearly 1.9 million Uber drivers (27.3% female) who provided more than 740 million Uber trips between January 2015 and March 2017 in 196 US cities. Here’s part of the Freakonomics podcast:

STEPHEN DUBNER: So you write in the paper that unlike previous studies, you were able to, “completely explain the pay gap.” So can you unpack that just a bit? REBECCA DIAMOND: Sure. Uber pays drivers based on a relatively simple, transparent formula that takes into account how long your ride is in miles, how long the ride takes, and potentially, a surge multiplier where sometimes there’s, excessively high demand. JOHN LIST: So the fare itself is determined by an algorithm, which is gender-blind. The dispatch itself is gender-blind. And pay structure’s tied directly to output and not negotiated. DIAMOND: That transparency and that simplicity of pay is what makes this environment so interesting for studying a gender pay gap. HALL: Because we were able to work with such excellent, detailed data, we believe this is a first-of-its-kind study, insofar as it can actually fully explain the gender pay gap. …. DUBNER: So let me just make sure I’m clear. You’re saying there’s no gender discrimination on the Uber side, on the supply side, because the algorithm is gender-blind and the price is the price. And you’re saying there’s no gender discrimination on the passenger side. So does that mean that discrimination accounts for zero percent of whatever pay gap you find or don’t find between male and female Uber drivers? LIST: That’s correct.

So it’s a great natural experiment to test for any differences in earnings by gender for Uber drivers, in an environment completely free of any possible gender discrimination on either the supply/driver side (gender-blind pricing by Uber) or the demand/customer side, since the researchers found empirically that riders have no gender preferences for drivers. What exactly did the researchers conclude about gender earning differences from this mountain of evidence from nearly 2 million Uber drivers and close to a billion ride-sharing trips?

Here’s the paper’s Abstract (emphasis added):

The growth of the “gig” economy generates worker flexibility that, some have speculated, will favor women. We explore one facet of the gig economy by examining labor supply choices and earnings among more than a million rideshare drivers on Uber in the U.S. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that there is a roughly 7% gender earnings gap among drivers. The uniqueness of our data—knowing exactly the production and compensation functions—permits us to completely unpack the underlying determinants of the gender earnings gap. We find that the entire gender gap is caused by three factors: a) experience on the platform (learning-by-doing), b) preferences over where/when to work, and c) preferences for driving speed. This suggests that, as the gig economy grows and brings more flexibility in employment, women’s relatively high opportunity cost of non-paid-work time and gender-based preference differences can perpetuate a gender earnings gap even in the absence of discrimination.

It’s a pretty significant and important finding that has implications for the rest of the labor market — you can find a gender earnings gap even in the complete absence of gender discrimination that is explained by gender differences in preferences. Here’s more on the three non-discrimination factors that help explain the 7% gender earnings gap for Uber drivers.

We can explain the entire gap with three factors. First, hourly earnings on Uber vary predictably by location and time of week, and men tend to drive in more lucrative locations. The second factor is work experience. Even in the relatively simple production of a passenger’s ride, past experience is valuable for drivers. A driver with more than 2,500 lifetime trips completed earns 14% more per hour than a driver who has completed fewer than 100 trips in her time on the platform, in part because she learn where to drive, when to drive, and how to strategically cancel and accept trips. Male drivers accumulate more experience than women by driving more each week and being less likely to stop driving with Uber. Because of these returns to experience and because the typical male Uber driver has more experience than the typical female—putting them higher on the learning curve—men earn more money per hour. The residual gender earnings gap can be explained by a third variable: average driving speed. Increasing speed increases expected driver earnings in almost all Uber settings. Drivers are paid according to the distance and time they travel on trip and, in the vast majority of cases, the loss of per-minute pay when driving quickly is outweighed by the value of completing a trip quickly to start the next trip sooner and accumulate more per-mile pay (across all trips). We show that men’s higher driving speed is due to preference as drivers appear insensitive to the incentive to drive faster. Men’s higher average speed and the productive value of speed for Uber and the drivers (and, presumably, the passengers) enlarges the pay gap in this labor market.

What about the relative importance of those three factors that explain the gender earnings gap for Uber drivers (see chart above)?

First, driving speed alone can explain nearly half of the gender pay gap (48%). Second, over a third of the gap can be explained by returns to experience (36%), a factor which is often almost impossible to evaluate in other contexts that lack high frequency data on pay, labor supply, and output. The remaining ∼20% of the gender pay gap can be explained by choices over where to drive. Men’s willingness to supply more hours per week (enabling them to learn more) and to target the most profitable locations shows that women continue to pay a cost for working reduced hours each week.

And here’s part of the paper’s conclusion:

We show that—much like with traditional jobs—there is a gender pay gap. However, unlike earlier studies, we are able to completely explain the pay gap with three main factors related to driver preferences and learning: returns to experience, a pay premium for faster driving, and preferences for where to drive. Indeed, the contribution of the return to experience to gender earnings gaps has not gotten much attention in previous empirical literature, as it is often quite difficult to measure in traditional work settings. These results suggest that the role of on-the-job learning may contribute to the gender earnings gap more broadly in the economy than previously thought. Overall, our results suggest that, even in the gender-blind, transactional, flexible environment of the gig economy, gender-based preferences can open gender earnings gaps. The preference differences that contribute to pay differences in professional markets for lawyers and MBAs also lead to earnings gaps for drivers on Uber, suggesting they are pervasive across the skill distribution and whether in the traditional or gig workplace.

And here’s the final part of the Freakonomics podcast:

DUBNER: So in summary, this is a labor ecosystem — Uber drivers — that would seem to remove all gender discrimination, and yet women earn 7% less for doing essentially the same work. DIAMOND: I think they’re not doing the same. That’s what we’re showing, they’re doing different — they’re making different choices in the labor market. I think the main point is that they’re not doing the same. And once you control for the differences, they are paid the same. LIST: That’s right. We’ve stripped away all of the factors that we thought were underlying determinants of the gender earnings gap, and we go to this new vibrant gig economy that promises worker flexibility and labor flexibility and equal pay for equal work. When you analyze the mounds and mounds of data, it ends up that we have a 7% gender difference. Now, what’s interesting and intriguing is that after you unpack those differences, what you find is that there are perfectly reasonable explanations for what’s happening on the Uber platform.

MP: We’re just several months away from the next Equal Pay Day on April 10, when we’ll hear lots of noise from the gender activists and feminists about a 20% gender pay gap and how that forces a typical woman to have to work until the second week of April to earn what her male counterpart earned in 2018. An underlying assumption behind Equal Pay Day is that the 20% gender pay gap is mostly due to gender discrimination in the labor market, which can only be “fixed” by some type of corrective action via government policies. The Uber study above provides strong statistical support to challenge that assumption by uncovering empirical evidence of gender earnings differences among Uber drivers that have nothing to do with gender discrimination and everything to do with gender differences in work preferences and experience. And since the researchers suggest those gender differences in preferences are pervasive throughout the labor market, it’s likely that much of the overall 20% gender earnings gap nationally can be explained by those differences in gender preferences and not gender discrimination. According to the Uber study, once you control for gender differences in preferences, men and women, at least Uber drivers (and by extension to the workforce at large), are paid exactly the same. And that means Equal Pay Day for female Uber drivers occurs on December 31, and not April 10. But that doesn’t make a very good story….."
"In Sweeping War on Obesity, Chile Slays Tony the Tiger",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/health/obesity-chile-sugar-regulations.html,"Last month, Coca-Cola began an advertising campaign for new versions of Sprite and Fanta that boasts the tagline “Free of Logos, Equally Rich” — a nod to the fact that they will no longer contain warning labels because the company replaced half the sugar with artificial sweetener.

Ben Sheidler, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said the company had created 32 new beverages in the last 18 months, and that 65 percent of its drinks portfolio in Chile could now be described as having low or reduced sugar.

A spokesman for PepsiCo said two-thirds of its beverage brands in Chile also qualified as low or sugar-free and that more than 90 percent of its snack offerings were now low in both sodium and saturated fat.

Other companies have embraced the logo system as a way to tout healthy offerings. Soprole, a Chilean dairy company, produced a commercial that features child newscasters explaining the label system in a way their peers can understand.

“Originally we didn’t believe the logos would make much of a difference but in focus groups, we’ve discovered that kids really do look at them,” said Dr. Camila Corvalan, of the University of Chile who has been assessing the impact of new label system. “They’ll say ‘Mom, this has so many logos. I can’t bring them to school. My teacher won’t allow it.”

Soon after the labels began appearing, AB Chile, the industry association, released an online ad using Chilean celebrities to attack the new regulations. In one scene, a well-known television presenter propped up in his putative sick bed considers a tray of soup, crackers and marmalade — items he said the new law has deemed unhealthy. “This is what my mom gave me all my life and I can no longer eat it?” he asks indignantly. In another, an actress pulls a mound of mints from her pocketbook. “It’s obvious that they are high in sugar,” she says. “But I only eat two or three.”"
SpaceX oddity-Elon Musk's Tesla now floats in space soundtracked by Bowie,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/space-oddity-elon-musk-spacex-car-mars-falcon-heavy,"It takes a beat or two for the brain to compute. The image is startling, incongruous, barmy. A car floats in space. At the wheel is a spacesuit, seatbelt on. Earth hangs behind it. The two objects don’t work together. The image jars like bad Photoshop. But it is real.

The photograph was beamed down to Earth courtesy of Elon Musk’s ego, bravado and taste for the absurd. It is human folly and genius rolled into one, a picture that sums up 2018 so far. Life on Earth feels precarious, so we look to the stars.

So how did we get here: the heavens navigated by a dummy astronaut in an electric car, with a handy note for aliens – “Made on Earth by humans” – imprinted on the circuit board?

Even Musk, engineer of the circus show, was surprised that his audacious stunt worked. “Apparently, there is a car in orbit around Earth,” he tweeted. His plan is for the $100,000 Tesla Roadster – with the message “Don’t panic!” stamped on the dashboard and David Bowie playing on the speakers – to cruise through high-energy radiation belts that circuit Earth towards deep space.

The most powerful rocket in operation

Its projected path will bring it close to Mars. There is a tiny chance it might crash into the planet. If it stays on course, it will instead drift through space, potentially for millions of years.

The Roadster was delivered into space by Musk and his company SpaceX’s biggest bet so far: the Falcon Heavy, now the most powerful rocket in operation and second only to the Saturn V rockets, which carried men to the moon during the Apollo era.

The Falcon launched from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday, watched by hundreds of thousands of people who crowded Florida’s space coast, eyes skyward.

A graphic showing the path of the Falcon Heavy rocket

But even Musk wasn’t sure it would work, putting the chance of a fully successful launch at 50%. On launch day, the company delayed for over three hours, citing high winds.

Minutes before countdown, Jeff Lucas, a Nasa communications staffer and compere of the viewing party at the Saturn V Centre, was not confident. “If it goes, don’t clap,” he told the audience. “Don’t clap until you see those orange flames clearing the tower.”

In the end, the winds died down, the sky cleared and the Falcon – shrouded in steam and mist – took off to claim its place in space and history.

Moments later the side boosters separated, beginning their choreographed dance back down to Earth. At the SpaceX launch centre, Life on Mars came on the sound system.

The Roadster, still attached to the rocket’s upper stage, will spend hours zapped by radioactive rays in the Van Allen belts. After that, all being well, the upper stage boosters will fire one last time, pushing the Tesla out towards its elliptical orbit around Mars. If things don’t go to plan, it could orbit Earth, potentially indefinitely.

Controlled burns

Falcon’s success provides the United States with a heavy-lift capability in space not seen since the 60s – big enough to carry a car as its payload just for fun. SpaceX has landing used rockets via controlled burns down to a fine art, cutting the cost of space flight from the billions to the tens of millions (the Falcon Heavy launch cost $90m, while Nasa’s planned SLS rocket, a comparable system, is expected to cost about $1bn per flight).

Two of the three boosters landed safely. The third, which SpaceX had predicted was less likely to be salvaged, slammed into the Atlantic at about 300mph (483 kph).

A more worthy payload?

Musk is not without his critics. Many wondered what the point of the expensive stunt was. Should the most powerful rocket of our age not have carried a more useful, worthy payload?

Either way, the plan worked and puts SpaceX far at the front of the commercial space race.

“If we are successful, it’s game over for other operators of heavy-lift rockets,” Musk claimed before liftoff. “It’s like where one aircraft company has reusable aircraft and all the other aircraft companies had aircraft that were single-use, and you’d sort of parachute out at your destination and the plane would crash land somewhere. Crazy at it sounds, that’s how the rocket business works.”

It is a long way from the failed launches of 2015, when mission CRS-7 mission was lost, and 2016, when a smaller Falcon 9 exploded on a launch zone at Cape Canaveral, forcing it to close for repairs for more than a year.

The Falcon Heavy’s successful launch propels the dream into a new orbit. Plans include building a new space station above the moon, carrying new telecom or spy satellites, and shuttling people to deep space destinations. Last February SpaceX said it intended to send two private citizens on a trip around the moon, possibly as soon as this year.

In the meantime, the Roadster will be ploughing its lonely course through space.

The stars look very different today."
"Elon Musk thinks the Falcon Heavy launch will inspire an exciting, international space race: ""I think it's going to encourage other countries and companies to raise their sights and say, 'we can do bigger and better,' which is great. We want a new space race. Space races are exciting.""",https://www.inquisitr.com/4775742/elon-musk-thinks-the-falcon-heavy-launch-will-inspire-an-exciting-international-space-race/,"Elon Musk has successfully launched his new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, BBC News reported yesterday.

This, according to BBC News, should open up new possibilities for the entrepreneur and his company, but the launch could also mark a significant paradigm shift.

Simply put, the Falcon Heavy launch could be a real game-changer in a few different ways.

“It’ll be game-over for all other heavy-lift rockets,” Musk told reporters.

The Falcon Heavy launch could also open up a sense of possibility, Musk argues, and SpaceX wants competition in space.

“I think it’s going to encourage other companies and countries to say, ‘hey, if SpaceX, which is a commercial company, and it can do this, and nobody paid for Falcon Heavy, it was paid with internal funds,’ then they could do it, too. So I think it’s going to encourage other countries and companies to raise their sights and say, ‘we can do bigger and better,’ which is great,” Musk told reporters during a press conference yesterday, Business Insider reported.

“We want a new space race. Space races are exciting,” the SpaceX founder and CEO added.

Did SpaceX open the cosmos to the masses? Ars Technica’s Eric Berger argues that it did. The new rocket may play an important role in science missions to the outer planets. The Falcon Heavy may even disrupt the defense, commercial, space science and human exploration markets, Berger claims.

Apart from that, the launch may accelerate other countries’ efforts when it comes to space exploration.

The 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union and the United States, has had a profound impact on science, math, and technology.

If Elon Musk is right, and if indeed a new space race is emerging, who knows what lies ahead?

Other countries and other companies may want to join in, and to an extent, they already have.

Amazon’s Jeff Bezos told Geek Wire last year that he sells about $1 billion worth of Amazon stock each year and then uses the money to invest in Blue Origin, his own aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight service company.

China’s economic growth in the past few decades has reflected in space too. China is challenging the United States for dominance in space, artificial intelligence, and similar technologies.

“Future conflicts on Earth are more likely to have a space component,” Brian Weeden, director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation, told Vice last year.

According to Vice, the next space race will likely include more than two competitors.

Countries like China and India, a country which launched a single rocket that carried 104 satellites into low-earth orbit last year, are challenging American and Russian space efforts.

If Elon Musk is right, other private companies could join the race too. Whatever happens, it seems like exciting times are ahead."
Tennessee sheriff taped saying 'I love this shit' after ordering suspect's killing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/tennessee-sheriff-caught-on-tape-killing-suspect-lawsuit,"A Tennessee sheriff is being sued for using excessive force after he was recorded boasting he had told officers to shoot a man rather than risk damaging police cars by ramming him off the road.

“They said ‘we’re ramming him,’” Sheriff Oddie Shoupe of White County said on tape in the aftermath of the killing of suspect Michael Dial. “I said, ‘Don’t ram him, shoot him.’ Fuck that shit. Ain’t gonna tear up my cars.”

Shoupe arrived on the scene shortly after police had shot Dial at the conclusion of a low-speed chase, clearly upset he had missed the excitement.

Sheriff Oddie Shoupe.

“I love this shit,” Shoupe said, apparently unaware that his comments were being picked up by another deputy’s body-worn camera. “God, I tell you what, I thrive on it.

“If they don’t think I’ll give the damn order to kill that motherfucker they’re full of shit,” he added, laughing. “Take him out. I’m here on the damn wrong end of the county,” he said.

Shoupe’s comments have prompted a federal lawsuit from Dial’s widow, Robyn Dial, alleging the use of excessive force against her late husband, who was unarmed.

“It was not only inappropriate but also unconscionable for Defendant Shoupe to give the order to use deadly force,” the filing states, calling his decision proof of a “malicious and sadistic mindset”. The suit also names the county, the city of Sparta and the two officers who fired their weapons.

“The comments as seen on the video are extremely disturbing. I’m not sure how anybody can thrive on the taking of a life, let alone somebody in law enforcement,” Dial’s attorney David Weissman told the Guardian.

Police had initially attempted to pull Dial over in April last year for driving on a suspended licence. He drove away, but the fact that he was driving a 40-odd-year-old pickup truck with a fully loaded trailer severely restricted his speed.

DeKalb County deputies, who began the pursuit before White County deputies took over, told investigators it was “more like a funeral procession” than a highway chase, with speeds topping out around 50mph.

Deputies tried using a PIT (Pursuit Intervention Technique) maneuver to slow Dial’s car, a common police tactic involving a police car nudging another vehicle to turn it sideways.

But Shoupe radioed officers to tell them to stop attempting to do that, instead ordering them to shoot the driver.

When a deputy had successfully nudged Dial off the road, Reserve Deputy Adam West, who was in pursuit in his own personal vehicle, fired three shots as the vehicle went down into a ditch. Dial died of a gunshot wound to the head.

In June, the county district attorney declared the shooting justified.

Dial told Tennessee’s News Channel 5 that she believed her husband had tried to drive away from the police because he was scared, and said she could not make sense of the order to shoot. “I feel with every part of me that’s exactly what they wanted to do was kill him.”

The sheriff’s office declined to comment to the Guardian."
"Edinburgh University divests from all fossil fuels, move makes it the largest university fund in the UK to ditch all coal, oil and gas holdings, following a long student campaign.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/06/edinburgh-university-divests-from-all-fossil-fuels,"Move makes it the largest university fund in the UK to ditch all coal, oil and gas holdings, following a long student campaign

The University of Edinburgh is dumping all its fossil fuel investments, making it the largest UK university endowment fund to be completely free of all coal, oil and gas holdings.



The decision was announced on Monday and followed a long student campaign. More than 60 UK universities have now divested from fossil fuels, with the University of Sussex the latest to make the move.

Most existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned without causing dangerous climate change, and proponents of divestment argue this makes fossil fuel companies bad investments on both ethical and financial grounds. The risk to investments is taken seriously at the highest level, including the Bank of England, World Bank and the G20’s financial stability board, and many major investment firms have also divested.

The University of Edinburgh decided in 2015 to divest from the most polluting companies – those involved in coal and tar sands – but stopped short of full divestment. But now the university will sell its final £6.3m of fossil fuel holdings, in the companies Total, BG Group and Atlas Copco.

The University of Edinburgh’s £1bn endowment fund is the third largest in the UK, behind Cambridge and Oxford. Those universities have only committed to divest from coal and tar sands to date.

Tara Wight, campaigner at People and Planet Edinburgh and a PhD student, said: “We are thrilled that Edinburgh University has finally realised the importance of divestment, and decided to match their investment portfolio with the environmentally friendly image they present to the public.”

Prof Charlie Jeffery, senior vice-principal at the University of Edinburgh, said: “I’m very proud of the university’s decision. Climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges. Over the past few years, we have thought hard about how to respond to that challenge. This change in our investment strategy is a vital step on that journey.”

A university spokesman said Edinburgh had invested more than £150m in low carbon technology, climate-related research and businesses that directly benefit the environment since 2010 and would become carbon neutral by 2040.

In January, New York City announced it would sell $5bn of fossil fuel investments held by the city’s pension funds. The value of investment funds around the world committed to selling off fossil fuel assets is at least $5tn."

"On Maldives emergency night, dramatic Twitter reporting covers moments of chaos",https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/on-maldives-emergency-night-dramatic-twitter-reporting-covers-moments-of-chaos-1162408-2018-02-06,"Opposition supporters protest against the government's delay in releasing their jailed leaders, including former president Mohamed Nasheed, despite a Supreme Court order, in Male, Maldives, February 4, 2018.

""A large number of @PoliceMv [Maldives Police] around my residence. To protect me or to arrest me? No idea."" That is the last tweet on the timeline of former Maldives president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who was arrested early this morning after the government of Abdulla Yameen imposed a state of emergency in the island nation.



The imposition of an emergency in Maldives last night brought to a head a crisis that was sparked by the country's Supreme Court last week ordering the release of nine jailed political leaders, including ex-president Mohamed Nasheed.



The Abdulla Yameen government had refused to heed the Supreme Court's directive, sparking speculation that the top court may move to impeach President Yameen. That, however, seems to have been thwarted by the developments of last night, which saw the Maldives's Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed getting arrested.

CRISIS IN MALDIVES

The Maldives Supreme Court last week ordered release of ex-president Mohamed Nasheed, 8 others

The Abdulla Yameen government refused to heed the judicial order, sparking speculation the court could move to impeach President Yameen.

Last night, President Yameen declared a state of emergency in Maldives.

Maldives Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom were arrested.

The night itself was full of drama and chaos with initial - but unverified - information coming via Twitter. The social media website was where news of the emergency first broke and Twitter was where former President Gayoom seemed to send out a cry for help.

In his tweet quoted above, Gayoom tagged the top Indian diplomat in Maldives - Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra - as well as the US ambassador, the Maldivian defence forces, the country's human rights commission and global rights watchdog Amnesty International.

MALDIVES EMERGENCY | India, China advise citizens to avoid travelling to island nation



While he did not post any more tweets as Maldives descended into chaos, his daughter - Yumna - live-tweeted his arrest. ""SO [Special Operations] police broke down the door and are arresting my father President @maumoonagayoom and husband @MNadhym right now,"" tagging her ex-president father's official account.

Maldivians were not the only ones tweeting out information about the emergency. The country's media too took to the social media website to post information and photos of the situation on the ground.



The Maldives Independent kept up a steady stream of tweets, reporting what initially seemed suspicious but later turned out to be true - that the Maldivian police had come knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court, the institution that sparked the current crisis.

It later emerged that soon after emergency was imposed in Maldives, security forces had stormed the Supreme Court building in order to put Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and a couple of other judicial officers under arrest.

Police said in a Twitter message they had arrested Saeed and Supreme Court Judge Ali Hameed ""for an ongoing investigation"", news agency Reuters reported.



So, after a night of high drama President Abdulla Yameen has tightened his grip on power. The fate of former president Mohamed Nasheed, whose release was ordered by the Supreme Court and who was seen as a potential challenger in Yameen in the elections scheduled for this year, hangs in the balance, as does that of the country's Supreme Court.



It must be noted that the emergency declared last night in Maldives is a temporary one, in effect for 15 days.

Ehang's passenger-carrying drones look insanely impressive in first test flights,https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16974310/ehang-passenger-carrying-drone-first-test-flight,"Two years ago, Chinese drone maker Ehang came to CES in Las Vegas and promised to build a completely autonomous, passenger-carrying quadcopter that would revolutionize mobility. Many of us in the tech community chortled under our breath, wondering if such a thing was even possible, let alone advisable. Today, the company released footage of its first piloted test flights in China — and color us impressed: this thing is no joke.

over 1,000 test flights with human passengers

Ehang’s engineers put the quadcopter, dubbed the Ehang 184, through a battery of tests over the last several months, and with good measure. The company conducted over 1,000 test flights with human passengers, including a 984-foot (300-meter) vertical climb, a weight test carrying over 500 pounds (230 kilograms), a routed test flight covering 9.3 miles (15 kilometers), and a high-speed cruising test that reached 80.7 mph (130 km/h).

Ehang’s engineers also tested the 184 in a variety of weather conditions, including high heat, heavy fog, night tests, and during a Category 7 typhoon with gale-force winds. Clearly, it would seem that Ehang heard our skepticism after its first announcement and it aimed to respond with supporting data.

“What we’re doing isn’t an extreme sport, so the safety of each passenger always comes first,” said Ehang founder and CEO Huazhi Hu in a statement. “Now that we’ve successfully tested the Ehang 184, I’m really excited to see what the future holds for us in terms of air mobility.”

The key word there is “mobility,” as it often is with these types of ventures. Ehang wants to put its egg-shaped, multirotor aircraft in use as an air taxi, shuttling passengers across dense urban environments. The company has said it would demonstrate this service for Dubai’s World Government Summit later this month, but a spokesperson didn’t respond whether that was still the case. Dubai is also working with Germany’s Volocopter on a similar air taxi service. If that doesn’t work, Ehang has permission from the state of Nevada to test the Ehang 184 at its FAA-approved UAV test site.

The key word there is “mobility,” as it often is

Ehang says the 184, which is all electric, can carry a single passenger up to 10 miles or roughly 23 minutes of flight. The person in the cockpit doesn’t do any piloting; they just input their destination and enjoy the ride. The company claims its aircraft is able to take off autonomously, fly a route, sense obstacles, and land. And if anything goes wrong, a human pilot is supposed to step in and take over the controls from a remote command station.

Ehang sees luxury rides for rich folks as the first phase of this new market, with autonomous aircraft becoming more widely available at lower prices after fleets and flight paths have become well established, and, of course, once the cost of having a human pilot around is eliminated.

Despite its early successful test flights, Ehang says it is making improvements to the aircraft. More emphasis will be placed on improving passenger experience and on adding an option for manual control, giving passengers with piloting experience the choice to operate the vehicle manually. In addition, the company has already developed and tested a two-seater with a payload of up to 617 pounds (280 kilograms).

Ehang has proven that its autonomous aerial vehicle can fly, which is no small feat. But proving that it can scale up into a full-blown aerial taxi service is an entirely different challenge and something with which a number of giant, multibillion-dollar companies are currently wrestling. There’s a vertical take-off and landing gold rush going on right now, and Ehang clearly wants to prove itself a major player."
"For The First Time Ever, Astronomers Have Detected Planets Outside Our Galaxy",https://www.sciencealert.com/planets-found-in-another-galaxy-quasar-gravitational-microlensing,"In an incredible world first, astrophysicists have detected multiple planets in another galaxy, ranging from masses as small as the Moon to ones as great as Jupiter.

Given how difficult it is to find exoplanets even within our Milky Way galaxy, this is no mean feat. Researchers at the University of Oklahoma achieved this thanks to clever use of gravitational microlensing.

The technique, first predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, has been used to find exoplanets within Milky Way, and it's the only known way of finding the smallest and most distant planets, thousands of light-years from Earth.

As a planet orbits a star, the gravitational field of the system can bend the light of a distant star behind it.

We know what this looks like when it's just two stars, so when a planet enters the mix, it creates a further disturbance in the light that reaches us - a recognisable signature for the planet.

So far, 53 exoplanets within the Milky Way have been detected using this method. To find planets farther afield, though, something a little bit more powerful than a single star was required.

Oklahoma University astronomers Xinyu Dai and Eduardo Guerras studied a quasar 6 billion light-years away called RX J1131-1231, one of the best gravitationally lensed quasars in the sky.

The gravitational field of a galaxy 3.8 billion light-years away between us and the quasar bends light in such a way that it creates four images of the quasar, which is an active supermassive black hole that's extremely bright in X-ray, thanks to the intense heat of its accretion disc.

Using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray observatory, the researchers found that there were peculiar line energy shifts in the quasar's light that could only be explained by planets in the galaxy lensing the quasar.

It turned out to be around 2,000 unbound planets with masses ranging between the Moon and Jupiter, between the galaxy's stars.

""We are very excited about this discovery. This is the first time anyone has discovered planets outside our galaxy,"" Dai said.

Of course, we haven't seen the planets directly, and are unlikely to in the lifetime of anyone alive today. But being able to detect them at all is an incredible testament to the power of microlensing, not to mention being evidence that there are planets in other galaxies.

Of course, common sense would dictate that planets are out there - but evidence is always nice.

""This is an example of how powerful the techniques of analysis of extragalactic microlensing can be,""said Guerras.

""This galaxy is located 3.8 billion light years away, and there is not the slightest chance of observing these planets directly, not even with the best telescope one can imagine in a science fiction scenario.

""However, we are able to study them, unveil their presence and even have an idea of their masses. This is very cool science.""

The research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal."
"Berlusconi pledges to deport 600,000 illegal immigrants from Italy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/05/berlusconi-pledges-to-deport-600000-illegal-immigrants-italy-election,"Former PM warns of ‘social bomb ready to explode’ in election run-up after weekend shooting

Silvio Berlusconi has pledged to deport 600,000 illegal immigrants from Italy should his centre-right coalition enter government after elections on 4 March, as tensions simmer over the shooting of six Africans by a far-right extremist on Saturday.

The 81-year-old rightwing former prime minister said in a TV interview that immigration was a “social bomb ready to explode in Italy” and that the shooting in Macerata posed a security problem.

“Immigration has become an urgent question, because after years with a leftwing government, there are 600,000 migrants who don’t have the right to stay,” said Berlusconi. “We consider it to be an absolute priority to regain control over the situation.”

Berlusconi’s Forza Italia has forged an alliance with two far-right parties, the Northern League and the smaller Brothers of Italy, for the elections.

The three-time former prime minister is banned from running for office after being convicted of tax fraud, but could still end up pulling the strings of power should the coalition gain enough of a majority to govern.

“When we’re in government we will invest many resources in security,” he said. “We will boost police presence and reintroduce the ‘Safe Streets’ initiative … Our soldiers will patrol the streets alongside police officers.”

Berlusconi took a swipe at the EU for failing to share the burden of Italy’s migrant arrivals, saying: “Today, Italy counts for nothing in Brussels and the world. We will make it count again.”

Italy is a favoured landing point on Europe’s southern coastline for people making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, often on board unseaworthy boats, to enter the continent. However, 2017 was a turning point for Italy: the country went from large-scale arrivals in the first six months to a sharp drop-off, thanks to a controversial agreement between the EU and Libya. About 119,000 people came to Italy by boat last year, a 37% drop from 2016.

Five men and one woman, all from Ghana, Mali or Nigeria, were wounded in the Macerata shooting. Luca Traini, a 28-year-old arrested over the incident, was a failed candidate for the Northern League in local elections last year.



The party’s leader, Matteo Salvini, distanced himself from the shooting but said an “invasion of migrants” was at the root of a “social clash”. “I can’t wait to get into government to restore security, social justice and serenity to Italy,” he said on Saturday.

Traini has reportedly shown no remorse over the attack, which he told investigators he had carried out in retaliation for the murder last week of an 18-year-old woman, Pamela Mastropietro, whose dismembered body was discovered hidden in two suitcases near Macerata.

A Nigerian man, Innocent Oseghale, was arrested in connection with her death. He was denied asylum last year but has remained in Italy.

After the shootings, Traini allegedly got out of his car, made a fascist salute with a tricolour Italian flag draped over his shoulders and shouted “viva Italia” (“long live Italy”) and “Italy for Italians”, Italian media reported."
"Berlin Wall now gone for as long as it stood -- More than 28 years after the fall of the wall, stories are still emerging about East Berliners' attempts to flee across the border",http://www.dw.com/en/berlin-wall-now-gone-for-as-long-as-it-stood/a-42418154,"The Berlin Wall sliced up its city, dividing East from West, for 28 years, two months and 27 days. Monday marks a turning point: for the first time, the wall has been gone for as long as it stood.

Its construction in 1961, designed to stem the flow of East Germans fleeing over the Berlin border, forced would-be escapees to come up with more creative methods to make it to the West. Some enlisted the help of sympathetic West Berliners to try to cross over where nobody would see them: underground.

A woman emerges from an escape tunnel in West Berlin in 1964.

It is estimated that about 75 tunnels were dug underneath the Berlin Wall. An archaeologist recently found the entrance of one such tunnel near the city's Mauerpark. Its rediscovery has unearthed the story of a man whose committed opposition to the wall began with this underground passage to the East.

Painstaking progress

""You couldn't just shovel away at this kind of soil — you had to really scrape your way through,"" says Carl-Wolfgang Holzapfel. ""That's what made it so difficult and frustrating. Sometimes you had the feeling you weren't getting anywhere at all.""

In 1963, the then 19-year-old West Berliner, along with a group of friends, started burrowing underneath a disused warehouse in the Wedding district of the city. Their aim was to reach a basement 80 meters (262 feet) away, on the eastern side of the wall, so that Gerhard Weinstein, an acquaintance of Holzapfel's, could be reunited with his young daughter.

Carl-Wolfgang Holzapfel at the site where the western entrance to the tunnel has recently been rediscovered.

After four months of painstaking work, news of the group's endeavor reached the Stasi (the East German state security service). In total 21 people on the eastern side, who had been planning to escape via the tunnel, were detained. Holzapfel did not hear from them again.

It was a bitter disappointment, but 73-year-old Holzapfel insists his group's efforts were not entirely in vain.

""It was a reminder that there will always be people who will fight against injustice, and who will find ways to erode that injustice,"" he told DW.

Taking on the wall

For Holzapfel, the tunnel marked the beginning of a struggle that would last nearly three decades.

""At 17 I told myself: You're going to fight against this wall — because it is unjust — until you see it come down or until it outlives you,"" he recalls.

Berlin 1964: A young Carl-Wolfgang Holzapfel protests against the Berlin Wall

In 1965 he was arrested during a peaceful demonstration at the Berlin border crossing known as Checkpoint Charlie. He spent nine months in the infamous Stasi prison at Hohenschönhausen. After his release, he continued to protest and remained resolute in his conviction that he would see a reunified Germany again.

On the 28th anniversary of the wall being built, Holzapfel made perhaps his most symbolic act of protest.

""I thought: now I need to do something to clearly show the madness of dividing a city.""

'One body'

Bridging the East-West divide in an unconventional manner

Holzapfel draped himself in the German flag and tied a thick white band around his waist. As he lay down on the ground at Checkpoint Charlie — heart and head in the East, feet in the West — the white line marking the border appeared to run over his body.

""Just as I am obviously one body,"" he explains, ""Berlin is a whole, and Germany is a whole.""

Less than three months later, on November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. The next day, Holzapfel stood where East and West met at the city's Potsdamer Platz.

""I was in tears,"" he recalls. ""There is nothing better — nothing will ever top that feeling.""

Plans are in motion to preserve Holzapfel's escape tunnel and integrate it into the official Berlin Wall Memorial. For him, returning to the site of the tunnel's entrance has been a moving experience. ""But it's not just my own story,"" he adds. ""It's a piece of Berlin's history."""

Citing the impending joint military exercises and the US' assertions in the Korean peninsula region, Pyongyang said Washington's actions are bound to derail the improving relationships between the two Koreas.

North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho wrote a letter to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres asking the international body to stop the US from deploying military equipment and conducting joint drills in the Korean peninsula.

The Trump administration's aims are ""to provoke a nuclear war, which will undermine the improvement of inter-Korean relations and the easing of tensions,"" said Ri. The top North Korean authority asked the UN chief not to remain a mute spectator against what he called ""the US dangerous game of aggravating (the) situation in and around the Korean peninsula and driving the whole world into a possible disaster of nuclear war.""

Tensions in Korean peninsula sharply escalated in 2017 with the North defiantly indulging in missile launches and pursuing its nuclear programme. But, this situation has cooled down in recent weeks as the rival Koreas agreed on the participation of North Korean athletes in the February Winter Olympics in South Korea.

Ri had accused the US of ""intentionally"" destabilising the situation in the region by drafting in more assets including aircraft carrier-led strike groups threatening a ""pre-emptive strike"" on North Korea.

""This is a primary factor which would block the inter-Korean reconciliation process and drive the situation of the Korean peninsula into an unpredictable dangerous phase,"" added Ri asking the top UN body of Security Council to take up the matter.

Recently, South Korea has made it clear it is marching ahead with its joint military exercises with the US despite the ongoing sports diplomacy with the rogue North Korean regime. The US and South Korea, key allies facing an increasing threat from North Korea, usually conduct Key Resolve and Foal Eagle at the start of Spring season in the country. But, the two countries have said they are delaying the exercises due to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics and Paralympics in February this year."

Divorce parties are now a trend in Saudi Arabia,http://www.arabnews.com/node/1235681/saudi-arabia#.WnB2tuh9sYg.twitter,"JEDDAH: Parties to celebrate divorces have become a trend in the Kingdom as divorced women have become accepted by society.

The stigma following women in Saudi Arabia whose marriages have ended has been, for the most part, eradicated, and the divorce rate rose marginally in 2017.

In the past, divorced women were marginalized, assumed to be barren or unfit for remarriage if divorced. Nowadays, divorced women can walk with their heads held high without having to worry about how society perceives them, and they can easily remarry if they please.

In recent years, celebrations have become frequent enough to instigate a trend. Some shunned the idea because they believed no joy could come of the separation of a married couple and their children. Others dismissed the notion as a cry for attention, while many believed it has stemmed from the injustice endured for the duration of the marriage.

Amani Al-Ghoraibi, a master’s student at King Abdulaziz University, told Arab News about a divorce celebration she attended. “It was actually my aunt’s. She felt relieved after the legal procedures were concluded and her papers got settled, not to mention relieved at being rid of him. She rented a cabin at a resort and invited the entire family to stay for a couple of days. There was a feast of goat roast (thabeeha) and the family brought her a cake.”

Doaa Abdullah was 13 when her mother and father separated. “I remember feeling confused at the time… my mom threw a big party with a DJ and all, and she invited all her friends and relatives. When it was time to cut the cake, I was happy to help her with it. She’d been trying to get a divorce for several years and felt the need to celebrate when it finally happened.”

Mohammed Adel told Arab News about how his uncles celebrated with his mother, Fatima, when the court allowed her legally to leave her husband through khula. Khula is a second solution for women whose divorce papers are not approved by a judge; women can separate from their husbands by returning the sum of the dowry to the husband.

“My uncles and relatives picked her up from court and told her they were taking her out to celebrate her khula. They did it to show her she wasn’t alone and that she had people around her who care for her deeply.

“She had suffered a lot at the hands of my father and was treated poorly. He even wanted to keep her from seeing us. When we got to the restaurant and she realized what was happening, she was speechless with joy, and seeing her happy made me happy, too.”"
"New, Strict EU Laws Force Facebook To Redefine And Publicize Its Privacy Principles. A major victory for privacy advocates, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation will be the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet. Drastic fines announced.",https://www.inquisitr.com/4760352/new-strict-eu-laws-force-facebook-to-redefine-and-publicize-its-privacy-principles/,"In a blog post published earlier today, Erin Egan, Chief Privacy Officer at Facebook, announced the social media giant would be publishing its privacy principles for the first time ever. Apart from that, Facebook will release educational videos to help users better understand how to control who has access to their information. In Egan’s words, this will be an “education campaign,” meant to help users understand how their data is used.

Facebook’s privacy principles are not to be confused with the user terms and conditions that are agreed upon when someone opens an account, and have never been available to the public.

This newfound transparency is a major shift for Facebook and the first time since the company’s birth that it is providing valuable, privacy-related insight for its users. Erin Egan laid out Facebook’s Privacy Principles in seven bullet points, describing what each of them means.

Facebook users will now have multiple “privacy choices,” and the social network will provide educational content in an effort to educate users about where their privacy controls are, and how to use them.

“You own the information you share on Facebook,” Egan wrote. “This means you decide what you share and who you share it with on Facebook, and you can change your mind. That’s why we give you tools for deleting anything you’ve posted. We remove it from your timeline and from our servers. You can also delete your account whenever you want.”

The Chief Privacy Officer then added that Facebook is now cooperating with privacy professionals and regulators. “We recognize that people use Facebook to connect, but not everyone wants to share everything with everyone. It’s important that you have choices when it comes to how your data is used,” Egan added.

This sudden shift in transparency did not come out of nowhere. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enters into force on May 25 2018, Reuters reported, describing the GDPR as “the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.”

Once GDPR goes into full effect, internet companies will be obligated to allow users to export and delete their data. The General Data Protection Regulation will drastically increase fines. Companies found to be in breach of this law will be forced to pay fines as high as 4 percent of global annual turnover.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation is the most important data privacy regulation in decades, so the European Union has an entire website dedicated to it, meant to educate companies and users alike.

Key changes the GDPR will bring are listed and explained on the website, with “Right to be Forgotten” being one of them; also known as “Data Erasure,” this will allow the data subject to have the data controller permanently erase their personal data.

In case of a data breach, data controllers will be required to notify their customers “without undue delay.” Perhaps most importantly, under the GDPR, the conditions for consent will be significantly strengthened.

Companies will be required to give requests for consent in “an intelligible and easily accessible form,” using clean and plain language instead of legalese."

ICE is about to start tracking license plates across the US,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/26/16932350/ice-immigration-customs-license-plate-recognition-contract-vigilant-solutions,"The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has officially gained agency-wide access to a nationwide license plate recognition database, according to a contract finalized earlier this month. The system gives the agency access to billions of license plate records and new powers of real-time location tracking, raising significant concerns from civil libertarians.

The source of the data is not named in the contract, but an ICE representative said the data came from Vigilant Solutions, the leading network for license plate recognition data. “Like most other law enforcement agencies, ICE uses information obtained from license plate readers as one tool in support of its investigations,” spokesperson Dani Bennett said in a statement. “ICE is not seeking to build a license plate reader database, and will not collect nor contribute any data to a national public or private database through this contract.”

Reached by The Verge, Vigilant declined to confirm any contract with ICE. “As policy, Vigilant Solutions is not at liberty to share any contractual details,” the company said in a statement. “This is a standard agreement between our company, our partners, and our clients.”

While it collects few photos itself, Vigilant Solutions has amassed a database of more than 2 billion license plate photos by ingesting data from partners like vehicle repossession agencies and other private groups. Vigilant also partners with local law enforcement agencies, often collecting even more data from camera-equipped police cars. The result is a massive vehicle-tracking network generating as many as 100 million sightings per month, each tagged with a date, time, and GPS coordinates of the sighting.

“Are we as a society ... willing to let our government create an infrastructure that will track all of us?”

ICE agents would be able to query that database in two ways. A historical search would turn up every place a given license plate has been spotted in the last five years, a detailed record of the target’s movements. That data could be used to find a given subject’s residence or even identify associates if a given car is regularly spotted in a specific parking lot.

“Knowing the previous locations of a vehicle can help determine the whereabouts of subjects of criminal investigations or priority aliens to facilitate their interdiction and removal,” an official privacy assessment explains. “In some cases, when other leads have gone cold, the availability of commercial LPR data may be the only viable way to find a subject.”

ICE agents can also receive instantaneous email alerts whenever a new record of a particular plate is found — a system known internally as a “hot list.” (The same alerts can also be funneled to the Vigilant’s iOS app.) According to the privacy assessment, as many as 2,500 license plates could be uploaded to the hot list in a single batch, although the assessment does not detail how often new batches can be added. With sightings flooding in from police dashcams and stationary readers on bridges and toll booths, it would be hard for anyone on the list to stay unnoticed for long.

Those powers are particularly troubling given ICE’s recent move to expand deportations beyond criminal offenders, fueling concerns of politically motivated enforcement. In California, state officials have braced for rumored deportation sweeps targeted at sanctuary cities. In New York, community leaders say they’ve been specifically targeted for deportation as a result of their activism. With automated license plate recognition, that targeting would only grow more powerful.

For civil liberties groups, the implications go far beyond immigration. “There are people circulating in our society who are undocumented,” says senior policy analyst Jay Stanley, who studies license plate readers with the ACLU. “Are we as a society, out of our desire to find those people, willing to let our government create an infrastructure that will track all of us?”

The new license plate reader contract comes after years of internal lobbying by the agency. ICE first tested Vigilant’s system in 2012, gauging how effective it was at locating undocumented immigrants. Two years later, the agency issued an open solicitation for the technology, sparking an outcry from civil liberties group. Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson canceled the solicitation shortly afterward, citing privacy concerns, although two field offices subsequently formed rogue contracts with Vigilant in apparent violation of Johnson’s policy. In 2015, Homeland Security issued another call for bids, although an ICE representative said no contract resulted from that solicitation.

As a result, this new contract is the first agency-wide contract ICE has completed with the company, a fact that is reflected in accompanying documents. On December 27th, 2017, Homeland Security issued an updated privacy assessment of license plate reader technology, a move it explained was necessary because “ICE has now entered into a contract with a vendor.”

The new system places some limits on ICE surveillance, but not enough to quiet privacy concerns. Unlike many agencies, ICE won’t upload new data to Vigilant’s system but simply scan through the data that’s already there. In practical terms, that means driving past a Vigilant-linked camera might flag a car to ICE, but driving past an ICE camera won’t flag a car to everyone else using the system. License plates on the hot list will also expire after one year, and the system retains extensive audit logs to help supervisors trace back any abuse of the system.

Still, the biggest concern for critics is the sheer scale of Vigilant’s network, assembled almost entirely outside of public accountability. “If ICE were to propose a system that would do what Vigilant does, there would be a huge privacy uproar and I don’t think Congress would approve it,” Stanley says. “But because it’s a private contract, they can sidestep that process.”

"With more Islamic schooling, Erdogan aims to reshape Turkey",https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/turkey-erdogan-education/,"On a hill overlooking Istanbul is a religious school where, 50 years ago, a boy from a working class district attended classes in Islam. The boy was Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s future president. The school was one of the first Imam Hatip schools, founded by the state to educate young men to be imams and preachers.

At the start of the 2017-2018 academic year in September, Erdogan returned to his old school, now renamed the Recep Tayyip Erdogan Anatolian Imam Hatip upper school after an $11 million redevelopment. He recalled the “tough days” of his childhood and the spirit in the school that drove its students to success.

“The joint goal of all education and our teaching system is to bring up good people with respect for their history, culture and values,” Erdogan told flag-waving children at a ceremony to mark the reopening of the school.

Erdogan has said one of his goals is to forge a “pious generation” in predominantly Muslim Turkey “that will work for the construction of a new civilisation.” His recent speeches have emphasised Turkey’s Ottoman history and domestic achievements over Western ideas and influences. Reviving Imam Hatip, or Imam and Preacher, schools is part of Erdogan’s drive to put religion at the heart of national life after decades of secular dominance, and his old school is just one beneficiary of a government programme to pump billions of dollars into religious education.

A Reuters review of government budget and investment plans shows that spending on Imam Hatip upper schools for boys and girls aged 14 to 18 will double to 6.57 billion lira ($1.68 billion) in 2018 - nearly a quarter of the total upper schools budget. Although the 645,000 Imam Hatip students make up only 11 percent of the total upper school population, they receive 23 percent of funding - double the spend per pupil at mainstream schools.

Since 2012, when Imam Hatip education was extended to middle schools for pupils aged 10 to 14, total pupil numbers have risen fivefold to 1.3 million students in over 4,000 schools. The government intends to complete construction of 128 Imam Hatip upper schools in 2018 and has plans to build a further 50, the budget and investment plans show. Turkey has also increased religious education teaching at regular state schools, some of which have been converted into Imam Hatip schools. The government declined to say how many.









But for all the extra cash they receive, the Islamic schools are underperforming the regular ones, key metrics show.

The education ministry didn’t respond to questions about the expansion of Imam Hatip schools. Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz has said previously that the government is responding to popular demand by opening new Imam Hatip schools. “We are doing whatever our citizens say,” he said at a ground-breaking ceremony for a school mosque in December.

An official in the president’s office referred Reuters to Erdogan’s public remarks on Imam Hatip schools and declined to comment further. A government adviser said, “Islam is not being forced on people. It is not a matter of saying everyone should go to Imam Hatips. We are just providing an opportunity to those families who want to send their children to Imam Hatips.”

The expansion of religious education is unsettling some Turks. Interviews with two dozen parents, teachers and education officials point to deep divisions over the role of Islam in education. Some secularist parents say the Islamist school movement is robbing their children of resources and opportunity. Those differences are part of a wider disagreement between liberal and secular sections of society and Erdogan’s support base of conservative, pious Turks.

It was that support base that swept Erdogan’s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, the AK Party, to power in 2002. Since then, critics have accused Erdogan of rolling back the secular state founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923 and weakening its pillars - the army, judiciary and media. Relations between NATO-member Turkey and its U.S. and European partners have become strained. Ankara’s bid to join the European Union has stalled and Western countries have criticised Turkey over mass arrests that followed a failed military coup in July 2016.

PRAISE AND PROTEST

The new Recep Tayyip Erdogan Anatolian Imam Hatip school complex, its Islamic-style architecture rising in a historic district on the European side of Istanbul, is a source of pride for the parents of the 800 children who fill its classrooms and playground.

“God willing, all our schools will reach this standard and quality,” said Kamber Cal, 45, a chemist. His 16-year-old son is delighted to attend the school, he said. “My daughter is now dreaming about going to Imam Hatip, the time when she will cover up and she will learn about the Koran and the Prophet’s life.”

In a mosque on the roof, boys listened to a preacher before Friday prayers when a Reuters reporter visited the school in October, while in the playground below, other boys played football. Some students perused books on shelves in the corridors. The school’s website vaunts its success in pursuits including karate, biology, chemistry, Arabic, music and Koran recitation. Religious education lessons account for around a quarter to a third of the curriculum in Imam Hatip schools.

Cal and other advocates of Imam Hatip schools say parents want a strong moral education for their children. “If there is demand, it must be met. How high will this go? To 20, 25, 40 percent” of pupils? “Demand and society will decide,” Cal said.

Such a prospect is anathema to secularists, people on the political left and members of the minority Alevi faith, which draws upon Shi’ite, Sufi and Anatolian folk traditions and rituals that differ sharply from those of the country’s Sunni majority. Feray Aytekin Aydogan, chairwoman of the Egitim-Sen teachers’ trade union and a critic of the expansion of Imam Hatip schools, said: “There is no need to give people religious education in order for them to get a profession.”

“What we see now is a ‘national and native’ identity being constructed in education.”

Erdogan’s redeveloped school stands as a paragon among religious schools. On the Asian side of the city, the crowded 60th Year Sarigazi middle school, established six decades after the founding of Turkey’s secular republic, illustrates some challenges that the spread of Imam Hatip schools has presented. Sarigazi is a non-religious school, in an area with a strong Alevi and secular community, but a large part of the premises has been converted into an Imam Hatip school.

A group of parents has petitioned education authorities to stop the conversion, collecting hundreds of signatures. Those parents say the change began several years ago with a few Imam Hatip “guest” classes but has since expanded to 1,300 pupils, encroaching on the building where some 3,000 students study in a regular middle school. The mother of a 10-year-old girl at the regular school said she and other parents would continue their fight against the school’s conversion. She said it was wrong to force Islam on people. Like several other secularist parents interviewed, the woman declined to give her name.

Parents complained that non-religious students at the 60th Year Sarigazi middle school get less support than Imam Hatip students and that their classes are more crowded, with an average 40 pupils in a classroom, compared with 30 on the Imam Hatip side. They say they have lost laboratory and art space. The mother of a boy at the school said her son asked, “Why is the Imam Hatip part of the school better?”

Reuters could not independently verify the parents’ claims and the education ministry declined to comment. But in response to the parents’ petition, education authorities said there were plans to build a new school in the area. It was unclear which students would move there.

Parents at the Sarigazi middle school claim success for another petition they filed in October to halt construction of a wall at one end of a playground. They saw the wall as an attempt to divide the school permanently. The local education authority said it had halted construction, without giving a reason.

A group of parents at another school - the Mahmut Kemal Inal middle school on the Asian side of Istanbul - failed in a campaign to prevent it being converted into an Imam Hatip. They picketed at the gates and organised protests and a petition signed by hundreds. It was to no avail. The only intake for the 2017-2018 academic year was of Imam Hatip students. “I am sad that we were ignored,” said Fulya Yilmaz, whose 11-year-old daughter attends the school.

Education authorities said the local community wanted the school to become an Imam Hatip school. But Yilmaz said only 125 students had enrolled in September, a low intake. On average around 230 pupils normally study in each of the school’s four year groups. The education authority declined to comment on enrolment details.

“SCHOOLS FOR MORALITY”

Successive AK Party governments have given a high priority to education, ramping up the education ministry’s spending to some 12.3 percent of the entire budget this year from 6.9 percent in 2003, the AK Party’s first full year in power.

Despite all the money allocated to the schools, figures on 2017 university placements show graduates of religious schools lag their peers in regular schools. Only 18 percent of applicants from religious schools earned places on full degree courses at university last year, compared with 35 percent from regular state upper schools and 45 percent from private upper schools.

A survey of academic performance published in December 2016 for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development showed the success of Imam Hatip upper school students was below the national average.

More broadly, Turkey slipped an average of eight places in the survey’s rankings for science, mathematics and reading, compared with the previous study three years earlier, to 50th among 72 countries. That marked a reversal of the progress Turkey made in the previous two terms of AK Party government. It was also a setback for Erdogan, who hopes that driving up education standards will help achieve his target of making Turkey one of the world’s 10 largest economies by 2023, the centenary of the founding of Ataturk’s secular republic. Turkey is currently a member of the Group of 20 top global economies.

Reuters could not determine whether socioeconomic factors were contributing to the performance gap between Imam Hatip and regular schools because there is no data available on pupils’ family backgrounds, their income and education. However, religious schools are found in towns and cities across Turkey, in poor and affluent districts.

While the number of Imam Hatip schools has surged in recent years, the number of students in Imam Hatip upper schools dipped slightly last year. Opposition lawmaker Engin Altay said the slide was “directly correlated with the low success rate of Imam Hatip upper schools in an academic sense.” Education Ministry Undersecretary Yusuf Tekin said Imam Hatip upper schools had filled 84 percent of their quota for 2017-2018. Standard curriculum upper schools had exceeded theirs.

Advocates of Imam Hatip schools say the current expansion should be seen in the context of the previous suppression of these schools. They point to a crackdown in 1997 when Turkey’s then powerful military pressured the first Islamist-led government out of power and forced the closure of most Imam Hatip establishments.

Muslims went out into the squares to defend their rights in protests. Businessman Hanefi Gundogan, 49, said he was unable to send his eldest son to an Imam Hatip school because of the crackdown, but now his youngest attends such a school.

“Muslims have now reached a point where they can breathe more easily in their own country,” he said. “In the last 15 years this government has shown respect to Muslims.”

Halit Bekiroglu, chairman of an association of Imam Hatip members and graduates, said secularist fears about the schools were exaggerated. Their revival, he said, reflected the conservative religious character of most of Turkish society and a desire for a change in an education system that previously imported Western ideas.

“Modernisation and Westernisation were not implemented healthily. They were implemented in a superficial, formalistic, harsh, copy-paste way. This was not in harmony with this country’s sociology,” he told Reuters in the association’s offices, overlooking the huge dome of the 6th century Hagia Sophia.

Parents who send their children to Imam Hatip schools speak of their desire for them to have a strong moral education. It’s a theme Erdogan stressed during his visit to his old school. “The school brought up children with such morality that they would not even pick fruit which hung from the apple tree hanging over the school walls,” he said.

Whatever the origins of the Islamist education revival, critics are worried by it. Batuhan Aydagul, director of Education Reform Initiative, an independent think tank in Istanbul, said: “What we see now is a ‘national and native’ identity being constructed in education.”

The most recent national curriculum, announced in July, excluded Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution from science lessons. The government has also doubled religious teaching in regular schools to two hours per week. This compulsory teaching is a bone of contention for many secular Turks. Some have launched legal action to secure exemptions for their children.

One parent who did so successfully was mathematical engineer Ozlem Koc, 42, who lives on the Asian side of Istanbul. She won a court case in June after a year-long battle with education authorities to exempt her 10-year-old son from religious education, arguing that it was contrary to human rights to force it on children.

“This is not just my personal case,” she said. “I want my child to be exempt from religious lessons, but I am also fighting for compulsory religious education to be removed from the curriculum.”

An Iranian protester removed her head scarf and waved it in public like a flag. She hasn't been seen since,http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-headscarf-20180124-htmlstory.html,"One day late last month, a woman wearing black trousers and gray sneakers climbed atop a telephone utility box in Tehran’s crowded Enghelab Square.

In an act of defiance as quiet as it was striking, she removed her white head scarf, tied it to a stick and waved the garment back and forth like a flag in protest against modesty laws that require Iranian women to cover their hair.

In cellphone videos captured by onlookers, her movements are slow, almost hypnotic, her dark hair flowing down to the middle of her back.

Weeks later, after Iran was shaken by the biggest anti-government protests in nearly a decade, the woman’s whereabouts are unknown. She has become the subject of a social media campaign labeled #Where_Is_She, and an anonymous symbol of opposition to what many Iranians view as the theocracy’s harsh laws against free expression.

Questions over the woman’s fate deepened this week after Nasrin Sotoudeh, one of Iran’s most prominent human rights lawyers, posted on Facebook that she had learned the woman was arrested the day of her protest, Dec. 27, released shortly afterward and then rearrested.

Sotoudeh said the woman was 31 and mother to a 20-month-old child, but she did not know whether she had been tried. No family members or friends have come forward to identify her publicly, perhaps to protect themselves as dissidents come under added scrutiny after the unrest.

Shopkeepers near where the woman stood — a street corner with a confectionary and several sidewalk peddlers — said in interviews that her protest went on for more than an hour, until she was arrested by two female police officers.

Peddlers who took video of her were arrested and later released, they said.

Her protest occurred on a Wednesday, a day when activists wear white in protest of the modesty laws that have been enforced with varying degrees of fervor since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Women must cover their hair with the head scarf, or hijab, and wear long, loose-fitting coats known as manteaus — or risk being stopped by so-called moral police.

The next day, protests over economic grievances and corruption broke out and quickly spread to dozens of cities. In the ensuing crackdown, more than 20 people were killed and thousands arrested, with some believed to have died in custody under circumstances that authorities have not fully explained.

All that has made the hijab-less woman a cause celebre on social media, her gesture forever linked to the anti-government demonstrations even though she was not actually a part of them.

“As the protests spread, many Iranian activists online were inspired by the nonviolent protest of the lone girl,” Masih Alinejad, an activist and founder of the My Stealthy Freedom campaign against enforced hijab, told Al-Monitor, a news site covering the Middle East.

“Her gesture was seen as a symbol of resistance. Her protest caught the imagination of Iranian women and men, feminists and non-feminists.”

Internet memes have sprung up showing the woman facing a firing squad, standing in place of the emblem in the Iranian flag and countering a police baton with her hijab.

“I hail what she has done,” Golnar Ramesh, a 28-year-old engineer in Tehran, said in an interview.

Ramesh said she often goes without a scarf while in public or driving, in defiance of the moral police, but “I don’t have her courage to stand in public near Tehran University for more than an hour.”

Ramesh said that the woman’s protest was impulsive, but that authorities probably would deal with her more harshly because of the broader crackdown against demonstrators.

“I think she has been punished for a protest that could have been done without as much risk at some other time,” she said.

Special correspondent Mostaghim reported from Tehran and Times staff writer Bengali from Mumbai, India.

Tsunami warning for much Alaska coast follows earthquake.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tsunami-warning-for-much-alaska-coast-follows-earthquake-live-updates/,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck off Alaska's Kodiak Island early Tuesday, prompting a tsunami warning for a large swath of the state's coast and Canada's British Columbia, and watches for the rest of the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. Officials at the National Tsunami Center canceled the warning after a few tense hours after waves failed to show up in coastal Alaska communities.

The strong earthquake hit at 12:30 a.m. and was recorded about 170 miles southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska. Kodiak Island is located about 200 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, which was not under a tsunami threat. Reports varied about how long the shaking lasted. In the popular cruise ship town of Seward, about 230 miles northeast of Kodiak Island, fire chief Eddie Athey said the quake felt like a gentle rattle and lasted for up to 90 seconds.

There were no immediate reports of damage, not even on Kodiak Island, the closest land to the epicenter of the quake.

Initially, the USGS said the earthquake was a magnitude 8.2. That prompted the tsunami warning for coastal Alaska and Canada's British Columbia, while the remainder of the U.S. West Coast was under a watch.

A tsunami warning for the southern coastline of Alaska -- from the Aleutian Islands to Southeast Alaska -- was downgraded to a tsunami advisory for the coastline east of Seward to Chignik Bay. It was later canceled, CBS Anchorage affiliate KTVA-TV reported.

Elsewhere in the United States, Washington state, Oregon, California and Hawaii were under tsunami watches, which eventually were lifted. Officials in Japan say there was no tsunami threat there.

For Alaskans accustomed not only to tsunami threats but also to regular drills, the early morning alert that made cellphone alarms go off still created some fretful moments. The phone message read: ""Emergency Alert. Tsunami danger on the coast. Go to high ground or move inland.""

Keith Perkins got the phone alert and later heard sirens going off in his southeast Alaska hometown of Sitka. He said people on Facebook were talking about whether the threat was real and what they should do.

Given the magnitude of the earthquake, Perkins said, he thought it best to head to the high school, a tsunami evacuation point, even though in the past he felt his home was at a ""high-enough spot.""

""I figured I'd probably just better play it safe,"" he said.

Vehicles are seen evacuating Kodiak, Alaska, in wake of tsunami warning issued after powerful earthquake 175 miles southeast of Kodiak Island early on Jan. 23, 2018 @Jupiter00000

People reported on social media that the quake was felt hundreds of miles away, in Anchorage. Reports varied about how long the quake's shaking lasted, depending on location.

In the popular cruise ship town of Seward, about 110 miles south of Anchorage, Fire Chief Eddie Athey said the quake felt like a gentle rattle that lasted for up to 90 seconds.

""It went on long enough that you start thinking to yourself, 'Boy, I hope this stops soon because it's just getting worse,'"" Athey said.

The earthquake woke Kodiak Police Lt. Tim Putney from a dead sleep. He said it shook for at least 30 seconds but admits his estimate might be skewed by sleeping through some of it.

""I've been in Kodiak for 19 years that was the strongest, longest-lasting one I've ever felt,"" he said by telephone.

John Bellini, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center, said there had been more than two dozen aftershocks as of about 6:30 a.m. The biggest aftershock had a magnitude of 5.3.

The earthquake was initially reported as magnitude 8.2, but Bellini said as more data comes in, better calculations can be made. Earthquake waves take time to spread.

Kodiak was projected to get the first tsunami wave, and officials warned residents to evacuate if they lived in low-lying areas. Some people sought refuge in schools. The wave never materialized there or in other coastal communities like Homer and Seward, and the warning was soon canceled.

Larry LeDoux, superintendent of the Kodiak Island Borough School District, said schools were open as shelters and estimated there were about 500 people at the high school. He described the atmosphere inside as calm, with people waiting for updates.

He said sirens go off in the community every week as a test to make sure they are working.

In Seward, at the southern end of Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, residents retreated to higher ground or left on the only road out of the city, the fire chief said. He described it as a controlled evacuation and compared it to people driving home from a holiday fireworks show.

Officials later tweeted: ""National Tsunami Warning Center has CANCELLED the Tsunami Watch for San Francisco.""

"Thai police have arrested an alleged kingpin in Asia's illegal trade in endangered species, dealing a blow to family-run syndicate that smuggles elephant ivory, rhino horn and tiger parts to Chinese and Vietnamese dealers",http://www.france24.com/en/20180120-thai-police-arrest-kingpin-asian-wildlife-trafficking,"Advertising Read more

Bangkok (AFP)

Thai police have arrested an alleged kingpin in Asia's illegal trade in endangered species, dealing a blow to family-run syndicate that smuggles elephant ivory, rhino horn and tiger parts to Chinese and Vietnamese dealers.

Boonchai Bach, 40, a Vietnamese national with Thai citizenship, was arrested on Friday evening over the smuggling of 14 rhino horns worth around $1 million from Africa to Thailand.

His downfall follows the December 12 arrest of Nikorn Wongprachan, a Thai National Parks and Wildlife Conservation official, at Bangkok's main airport as he attempted to smuggle the rhino horn from the quarantine section to a nearby apartment.

The horn was smuggled into Bangkok by a Chinese man who was arrested a day before on arrival from Johannesburg, South Africa.

The police sting led to Boonchai, who financed the network.

""This is a major smuggling syndicate and Boonchai is a ringleader,"" General Chalermkiat Srivorakan, deputy national police chief, told reporters Saturday after the suspect arrived at Suvarnabhumi airport ahead of his remand.

""Boonchai admitted he was involved,"" Chalermkiat said, adding he faces up to four years in jail for smuggling parts of protected animals.

For years Boonchai and the Bach family are believed to operated with impunity from Nakhon Phanom in northeast Thailand, bordering Laos -- linchpin players in a multi-million-dollar trade in illegal wildlife.

The town is a pivot point in Asia's wildlife trafficking chain, in part because it is the narrowest neck of land for smuggled goods to transit through Thailand, into Laos and onto Vietnam, a major market for animal parts used in traditional medicine.

Freeland, a counter-trafficking organisation which works closely with Thai police, said the Bach family are part of a sprawling Southeast Asian crime organisation dubbed ""Hydra"".

The Bachs have ""long run the international supply chain of illicit wildlife from Asia and Africa to major dealers in Laos, Vietnam and China,"" Freeland said in statement following the announcement of Boonchai's arrest.

They are believed to work alongside Vixay Keosavang, a Laotian dubbed ""the Pablo Escobar of animal trafficking"", who orchestrates a major wildlife trafficking ring from the Communist state, bribing officials to allow him to operate.

Laos has long been a top transit hub for smuggling wildlife products, with widespread corruption and weak law enforcement allowing the criminal activity to flourish.

China and Vietnam are among the world's biggest markets for parts from endangered or protected species including tigers, elephants, rhino and pangolins.

The traditional medicine market flourishes despite the total lack of scientific evidence as to their efficacy and government campaigns to end the trade.

For the first time, China has overtaken the United States in terms of the total number of science publications, according to statistics compiled by the US National Science Foundation (NSF).

The agency’s report, released on 18 January, documents the United States’ increasing competition from China and other developing countries that are stepping up their investments in science and technology. Nonetheless, the report suggests that the United States remains a scientific powerhouse, pumping out high-profile research, attracting international students and translating science into valuable intellectual property.

“The US continues to be the global leader in science and technology, but the world is changing,” says Maria Zuber, a geophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. As other nations increase their output, the United States’ relative share of global science activity is declining, says Zuber, who chairs the National Science Board, which oversees the NSF and produced the report. “We can’t be asleep at the wheel.”

The shifting landscape is already evident in terms of the sheer volume of publications: China published more than 426,000 studies in 2016, or 18.6% of the total documented in Elsevier’s Scopus database. That compares with nearly 409,000 by the United States. India surpassed Japan, and the rest of the developing world continued its upward trend.

The NSF analysis divides the credit for a publication fractionally among its authors. By contrast, Scopus gives one full credit to each author; as a result, it still ranks the United States first in terms of the number of publications.

The United States ranked third, behind Sweden and Switzerland, when the NSF team examined where the most highly cited publications came from. The European Union came in fourth and China fifth. The United States still produces the most doctoral graduates in science and technology, and remains the primary destination for international students seeking advanced degrees — although its share of such students fell from 25% in 2000 to 19% in 2014, the report says.

The United States spent the most on research and development (R&D) — around US$500 billion in 2015, or 26% of the global total. China came in second, at roughly $400 billion. But US spending remained flat as a share of the country’s economy, whereas China has increased its R&D spending, proportionally, in recent years.

The NSF analysis, the latest edition of the agency’s biennial Science and Engineering Indicators, comes at a time of heightened concern about the state of US science. It should raise some alarms, says Mark Muro, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington DC. Trends in US science spending are heading in the wrong direction, he says, and the talent pool of researchers continues to be limited by under-representation of women and minorities. Similarly, key industries such as semiconductors have been hollowed out as businesses ship production work to other countries, Muro adds.

For the first time, the NSF included a section on technology transfer and innovation in its statistical analysis. Data suggest that the United States continues to lead the world when it comes to things like patents, revenue from intellectual property and venture capital funding for innovative technologies. Although more focus is needed at the local and regional level, Muro says, the report nonetheless provides important data about the value of scientific innovation.

“A nation’s innovation capacity is one of the main drivers of productivity growth and so prosperity,” Muro says. The new data provide “a useful reminder of why we care about these indicators in the first place.”"
UK Man convicted of theft in 1976 cleared after Googling his arresting officer - Stephen Simmons was convicted of mailbag theft over 40 years ago but a chance discovery led to his acquittal,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/17/man-convicted-of-theft-in-1976-cleared-after-googling-his-arresting-officer,"A man found guilty of stealing mailbags more than 40 years ago has had his conviction quashed in what the lord chief justice described as an exceptional case. The court of appeal heard that the arresting officer in the original trial had died in prison not long afterwards while also serving a sentence for mailbag theft.

Stephen Simmons, now 62, a businessman from Dorking in Surrey, was arrested with two friends in Clapham, south London, in June 1975 by DS Derek Ridgewell of the British Transport Police, who attributed incriminating remarks to the young men.

They were allowed to see a duty solicitor who told them that if they called the police liars, the judge would jail them for a long time. Despite the solicitor’s warnings, they pleaded not guilty but were all convicted.

Simmons was sent to a borstal in Suffolk and served eight months. He said that the conviction had haunted him ever since and until recently he had not even told his grown-up daughters about the case.

Steven Powles, for Simmons, told the court: “Mr Simmons has been waiting for 43 years for this day.” The crown did not contest the application nor seek a retrial, he said.

The court heard that four years ago Simmons was given “friendly advice” by barrister Daniel Barnett on LBC radio’s legal advice programme to Google the name of his arresting officer if he wished to overturn his conviction. He did so without expecting to discover anything but what emerged was that Ridgewell himself had been jailed for seven years for mailbag thefts totalling £300,000 in 1980, and had died in prison in 1982.

“I was gobsmacked,” Simmons told the Guardian. He then took his case to the criminal cases review commission whose “meticulous research”, carried out by case worker Adam Bell, led to the appeal.

The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, sitting with Mr Justice Warby and Mr Justice Julian Knowles, paid tribute to Bell’s “remarkable” efforts and expressed regret to Simmons that the case had taken so long to come back to court. He said that the evidence before him was “extremely telling … It is an exceptional case”.

What also emerged, the court heard, was that Ridgewell was responsible for a series of notorious cases in which young black men were falsely accused of “mugging” on the London Undergound. One victim was Winston Trew, who along with three others became known as “the Oval 4”, and who was present in court for Simmons’ appeal.

Trew has written a book, Black for a Cause, which detailed Ridgewell’s long history of “fit-ups” and and which became part of the investigation.

“This is one of the happiest days of my life,” said Simmons outside court after his conviction was quashed. “It has hardly sunk in but I am not a criminal any more. I can hold my head up high.

“One of the hardest things for me was that my parents did not believe me because they were of the generation that believed that the police could not lie.”

He had suffered ill-health as a result of the prosecution and one of his co-defendants became an alcoholic and is now dead. “Ridgewell ruined three lives for no reason and I am sure many, many more ... if this can help someone else who was also arrested by him then at least something will have been achieved.”

Trew, who embraced Simmons after the case, said: “Today is a great day. This opens the door for me to present my case. It means that evidence that Ridgewell gave in our trial is as tainted as in Stephen’s case.”

Ithaca College President Shirley Collado pleaded no contest to sexual abuse charge in 2001,https://theithacan.org/news/ithaca-college-president-shirley-collado-has-2001-sexual-abuse-conviction/,"Update Jan. 31: The patient who alleged she and Shirley M. Collado — who was her therapist in 2000 and is now the president of Ithaca College — entered into a sexual relationship in 2000 has come forward to affirm that she stands by the account of the case she gave the prosecution in 2001. The patient also said she did not send the anonymous packages that were circulating with information about the case and does not know who did.

Original: Ithaca College President Shirley M. Collado was accused of sexually abusing a female patient while working as a psychologist in Washington, D.C., in 2000 and was convicted of sexual abuse in 2001.

Prosecutors argued Collado took advantage of a vulnerable, sexual-abuse survivor with mental illness by entering into a monthslong sexual relationship that started when Collado was the patient’s therapist. Collado denies having any sexual contact with the patient.

Collado admits to living with the patient after the latter was discharged from The Center at the Psychiatric Institute of Washington. This violated her employment contract at The Center — a program specializing in post-traumatic and dissociative conditions at a private psychiatric hospital — as it was considered to be an unethical outside relationship and grounds for immediate termination. Collado said she was trying to help her by providing her a place to stay.

Collado pleaded nolo contendere — no contest — to one count of misdemeanor sexual abuse in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in August 2001 for a sole charge of placing her hand on the patient’s clothed breast with sexual intent while Collado was her therapist. Collado knew, or had reason to know, that the sexual contact was against the patient’s permission, as the patient was an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital, according to the charge against Collado.

“The laws and ethical rules prohibiting sexual and outside relationships with former or current patients are designed to prevent the very activity that occurred in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sharon Marcus-Kurn, the case’s prosecutor, wrote in the Government’s Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing. “The law recognizes that individuals that are wards of psychiatric institutions are extremely vulnerable to being abused and taken advantage of. The laws are designed to protect them and punish anyone who violates the therapist/patient relationship.”

By pleading nolo contendere, Collado did not admit guilt but accepted a conviction. After a defendant enters a nolo contendere plea, the case moves forward as though the defendant pleaded guilty. With this plea, there is no trial.

Collado maintains her innocence and said she never had any sexual contact with the patient.

“I didn’t have the legal resources; I didn’t have the financial resources to, and I didn’t have the emotional wherewithal to really take this on the way I would have preferred,” Collado told The Ithacan. “So I took a different route. And like many people in this country, young people in this country, people of color, people who don’t have networks, that was me. This happens all the time, where you make this really difficult choice, even if it goes completely against the truth of who you are.”

Collado was one of the the patient’s treating therapists when the patient was an inpatient ward between May 12, 2000 and June 9, at The Center, Marcus-Kurn wrote.

Collado, who graduated from Duke University with a Ph.D. in 1999, was 28 years old when she was treating the patient. She did not have a therapist’s license and was practicing under the supervision of a licensed therapist who was also employed at The Center, Marcus-Kurn wrote.

Marcus-Kurn wrote that the patient’s two therapists and The Center’s director — it is unclear whether Marcus-Kurn is referring to Joan Turkus, The Center’s medical director, or Christine Courtois, The Center’s clinical director — all believed the patient’s allegations. Marcus-Kurn wrote that the two therapists had known the patient for a long period of time through numerous hospitalizations.

“They both find her to be an extremely truthful person, and although she may have flashbacks of prior abuse or may relive traumatic experiences, her therapists have stated that she does not fabricate or hallucinate things that simply did not happen,” Marcus-Kurn wrote. “In other words, she has not experienced psychotic episodes and has never been diagnosed as psychotic.”

One of Collado’s co-workers at The Center, who was familiar with the situation and wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the story, told The Ithacan they believe the patient’s allegation that she and Collado had a sexual relationship.

“She had no reason to lie about them,” the co-worker said. “She had no reason to lie.”

The revelation of these accusations against Collado comes amid a national reckoning with sexual assault and harassment, reflected in the #MeToo movement, in which survivors of sexual assault and harassment are sharing their stories. The #MeToo movement has touched every aspect of society, including higher education.

Collado was sentenced to a 30-day suspended sentence, 18 months of supervised probation, an order to stay away from the patient, and 80 hours of community service. The court recommended that the community service should “not directly involve vulnerable people.” She was also ordered to pay $250 under the Victims of Violent Crime Compensation Act of 1981.

Chronology

The patient was receiving therapy for post-traumatic stress at The Center, as she had previously been sexually abused by a doctor — who was convicted for the abuse — and as a child, according to the prosecution. The patient, who was 30 years old at the time of the court case, was diagnosed with having bipolar disorder and a dissociative identity disorder and had experienced lengthy periods of deep depression and suicidal thoughts, Marcus-Kurn wrote.

The patient alleged that she began a sexual relationship with Collado on May 20, 2000, which lasted until October 2000, according to the prosecution. Marcus-Kurn wrote that the patient recorded encounters with Collado in a journal that was submitted to the court but is not included in the case file.

Marcus-Kurn wrote that the patient said the two first kissed after a therapy session on May 20. The patient said that some time between May 20 and June 9, 2000, Collado fondled her buttocks and directed her hand to Collado’s breast. She further alleged that after most individual therapy sessions, she and Collado kissed, usually going to private areas at The Center to avoid detection.

On two occasions, Collado fondled the patient’s buttocks and rubbed her inner thigh and pelvic region, the patient said.

Collado told her that their sexual contact would be “therapeutic” and would “bring her out of her shell,” the patient said. Collado denies this allegation.

Collado said she was working in the trauma unit at The Center when her first husband committed suicide on July 9, 2000, starting a very difficult time in her life.

She resigned from The Center as she was grieving her husband’s death.

“I, at that point, was sought out by a patient who I had treated before on the unit who really needed my help and was in crisis and didn’t have a place to stay,” she said.

The patient moved into Collado’s house “shortly after” her discharge from The Center, according to the prosecution. Collado supported the patient with a place to live after she was discharged from the hospital, Collado’s attorney, William Hickey, wrote in the defendant’s memorandum in aid of sentencing.

Marcus-Kurn declined to comment, and Hickey did not respond to a request for comment.

During this period of time, the patient and Collado lived with a third roommate, Alyssa Rotschaefer. Rotschaefer — who has since married and is now Alyssa Mueller — declined to comment.

The patient alleged that she had participated in a three-way sexual encounter with Collado and an adult male on Sept. 9, 2000, according to the prosecution. The patient alleged Collado told her it “would be psychologically helpful for her.” The man and Collado denied that the interaction had taken place.

Collado said the patient moved in either in the late summer or fall of 2000 and moved out by November after Collado asked her to move out.

“I learned, and it came to me, that that was probably not a good idea, that I needed to really focus on myself and that I was not in the position to help someone who I knew had a pretty troubled past,” she said.

The patient notified Nora Rowny, The Center’s social services director, about her relationship with Collado in early November, according to an email message Rowny sent to Turkus. The email was obtained and verified by The Ithacan. Turkus forwarded the message to Courtois.

Rowny wrote in the email that on Oct. 30, 2000, the patient called her and told her she had “lost her housing, felt betrayed and frightened and wasn’t sure where to go” and that she needed to move out in two weeks. Rowny wrote that the patient told her on Nov. 4, 2000, that the patient had a relationship with Collado, saying she had been living with Collado and they had been having a “‘sort of’ relationship” that began when she was a patient at The Center. She told Rowny she and Collado had “expressed a mutual attraction and that Dr. Collado had kissed her” two weeks before her last discharge from The Center. The patient told Rowny she continued to call and see Collado after leaving the unit.

The patient told Rowny that Collado had asked her to move in following the suicide of Collado’s husband, and that she gave most of her furniture to Collado’s brother and moved in. The patient told Rowny she and Collado “became more sexually intimate and that she often slept with Dr. Collado” after she moved in.

But the patient told Rowny that tensions had risen between her and Collado over Collado’s involvement with a man; that the patient doing chores around the house triggered Collado by reminding her of her late husband; and that Collado was upset after she learned the patient told one of her other therapists, Amelie Zurn, about their relationship. The patient said Collado asked her to move out on Oct. 30, the day the patient called Rowny asking for help.

Rowny wrote in the email that she called Zurn on Nov. 4, 2000. Zurn said the patient “had told her about the involvement with Dr. Collado only recently.” Zurn told Rowny she was not sure what to do as “the story unfolded slowly concerning the extent and timing of the relationship.” By the time the patient told her about it, Zurn said, the patient had not been at The Center for a few months and Collado was on leave.

Rowny wrote that Zurn said she had decided not to immediately disclose the relationship since the patient said she was invested in her relationship with Collado and had told Zurn not to get Collado in any trouble. Zurn said alerting others would be a breach in her therapeutic relationship with the patient and that the patient may “decompensate lethally” if Zurn alerted leadership at The Center too quickly. The patient had told Zurn she had ruled out returning to The Center in case of decompensation because of her relationship with Collado and would not “easily accept hospitalization elsewhere.” Zurn said she was afraid the decompensation without the patient’s regular hospital could be lethal.

Zurn and Rowny discussed the matter and decided it would be best for The Center to be aware of the situation, as the patient had told both of them about the situation.

Courtois, Turkus, Zurn and Rowny all declined to comment. The patient also did not want to discuss the case.

Collado’s employment agreement with The Center stated that “any personal/friendship, intimate/sexual, or business (apart from clinical referral and services) relationships with a current or former patients constitutes a dual relationship and is an ethic violation. Any such relationship is grounds for immediate termination of employment,” according to the prosecution.

Collado said the patient needed her help.

“One of the things that is really hard when you are doing work, especially around trauma, is I think all good therapists see people as whole people, and I thought that I was making a thoughtful decision, and then I quickly learned that I wasn’t,” she said. “I put myself at risk by allowing her to live in my home.”

She added that she was on leave, not working at the clinic, when the patient moved in.

“I treated this person with integrity as a psychologist, I treated her on the unit appropriately and professionally,” she said. “And then I took a leave and again, I tried to help and make a decision, and then these allegations were made.”

Collado was suspended from The Center following the revelation, Marcus-Kurn wrote. Collado said she was on leave from The Center after her husband’s suicide and decided to resign after she realized she needed to spend more time grieving her husband’s death and was not in a position to return to the intense therapeutic work at The Center. Hickey wrote that she resigned and was not terminated.

The Psychiatric Institute of Washington was acquired by new owners in 2014 and has no records or information on the situation, a representative said.

The co-worker said that The Center had approximately 15 to 20 patients and 10 staff members, who were caught off-guard by the allegations.

“People were very shocked and very betrayed, because it struck at the heart of what we were trying to do with the patients who suffered trauma,” the co-worker said. “They need to have very strict boundaries and relearn what normal separation is between people. We tried to build up those boundaries — internal boundaries and external boundaries — so they can get through the world.”

Legal Case

In her interview with The Ithacan, Collado said that shortly after she asked the former patient to move out, she became aware of the claims the patient made against her. She said she did not have the resources to fight the allegations and wanted to take care of herself and figure out a way forward.

Collado pleaded nolo contendere on Aug. 29, 2001. By entering this plea, Collado waived her right to a trial by jury or the court and gave up her right to appeal the conviction in the Court of Appeals. The three conditions of the plea were that the government would allow the no contest plea, the government would recommend suspension of all jail time if the judge considered incarceration, and the government would not pursue any other charges based on the allegations to date.

Marcus-Kurn wrote Collado had met the patient when the patient was emotionally vulnerable, had encouraged the patient to open up to her and knew the patient had been sexually abused in the past. After Collado realized she did not want to continue the relationship, she ended it abruptly, Marcus-Kurn wrote.

“The defendant had to have known that, in the long run, her relationship with the victim would cause great emotional damage to the victim,” Marcus-Kurn wrote.

The patient told Marcus-Kurn that she was emotionally unable to write a formal letter to the court. While she said she really wanted the court to know how she felt, she was concerned reliving the painful experiences could lead to suicidal thoughts she was unsure she had the strength to fight.

The patient did express her feelings to Marcus-Kurn over the telephone. Marcus-Kurn wrote that the patient said the following:

“It brings on such immense pain and it is very, very intense feelings of confusion. I start hearing her calling her name, I start smelling her, I start remembering her telling me that it would be good for me to sleep with (name redacted) , and I remember being raped, and I have blocked that all out and I’m afraid that it would kill me if I start dealing with it right now. She has hurt me beyond belief and it’s like so bad that I can hardly touch it because it hurts so bad. I have to take it really slow. I know that I feel a lot inside but I’m not really sure what all of those feelings are because I try really hard not to feel them but I know that they are painful as hell. I literally feel that I will fall apart every time I think I’ll deal with it. And it hurts too much. And I’m really angry that she slept with me and that she convinced me to sleep with her boyfriend and I feel that I was raped and that there is nothing I can do with it because I believe it isn’t against the law in D.C.”

Collado’s lawyer made a motion to strike the victim impact statement from the case, arguing that victim impact statements were intended to be used for crimes of violence, not misdemeanor assault charges, and that the prosecution did not follow the correct procedures to attain it. The judge struck the patient’s statement from consideration.

The patient sent Courtois and Turkus emails she alleged were from Collado and photographs from a trip to New York she had taken with Collado, Marcus-Kurn wrote.

Collado would not discuss the alleged trip to New York with The Ithacan and said she did not want to go through every claim the patient made, as she had already gone through a court case.

“Just to generally say, when she lived in my home and when I was trying to help, I tried to be a normal roommate and a kind person and be able to be helpful like I did with my other roommate living in the home and, you know, my friends and family,” she said.

Marcus-Kurn included the emails that the patient claimed were from Collado in the government’s memorandum in aid of sentencing. One sent on Oct. 10, near the end of their relationship, stated:

“I have grown to be very attached to you and don’t want anything to hurt you in any way. The thought of losing you is overwhelming…When I told you that it scared me and that it made me less capable of being close/intimate with you…I realized that you need CLEAR boundaries with me. I realized that I just want to be your friend…I have tremendous love for you. I care about you deeply…I realize that this is a huge loss for you, but I don’t think that we can afford to do anything more. It has become too confusing and too sticky when the boundaries are loose… [Regarding (name redacted)], [h]e wants to be your friend. He has no regrets about being intimate with us or you being intimate with me, but he does not agree with any unclear stuff (i.e. you wanting to still be with me, etc.)… Please don’t hurt (name redacted) with details about “us” or how you feel about me. Just keep the promise of loving me unconditionally. I want to offer that to you. You have not lost me. You have lost an aspect of our relationship. I don’t regret it. It gave me tremendous gifts and insights…I am also going to stress that I am keeping this between us.”

The other email the patient alleged Collado sent her read:

“As for us, I must tell you that not a day goes by that I don’t regret mixing everything up, setting poor boundaries and misleading you/(name redacted)/etc. in any way…Anyway, all this is say that I am not good for you, [patient]…As far as (name redacted) is concerned, we are working on many things including what we gained and lost from being intimate with you, building trust between us, deciding what we can be open about at this point…”

Collado denies writing the emails.

“I don’t know where these came from,” she said. “I didn’t write any of the emails. And, in fact, if you’re looking at the court documents, you will see that my lawyer made it very clear in my statements that had I gone to trial, I had credible people, and I think it’s written in there very carefully, about the allegations about the emails, details of emails that were not mine.”

Hickey wrote in the defendant’s Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing that Rotschaefer — Collado’s other roommate — would have testified that the patient had access to Collado’s computer and it became a “problem,” as the patient was frequently using the computer. Hickey wrote that the defense also would have called an expert witness, forensic expert Gerald R. McMenamin, who would have testified Collado was not the author of the emails and that the patient was most likely the author.

McMenamin told The Ithacan that he did not recall working on or forming an opinion on this matter, and said he that even if he did recall it, he would not be able to comment on it, as it was not presented as testimony in court.

“Additionally, what someone ‘would have testified to’ is not evidence and should not be used as a basis for argument,” he said.

Marcus-Kurn wrote that when Collado was confronted by “The Center Director,” she admitted she had been living with the patient and that she and the patient had been in the area of The Center where the patient alleged some of the sexual contact had occurred. But she denied any sexual relationship, Marcus-Kurn wrote.

Collado denies speaking with either of the two directors of The Center.

“When I learned about the allegations, I attempted to contact them and talk to them, and I never had a conversation with them,” she said. “They never talked to me.”

At the time, Collado was also working part-time as a youth and family psychotherapist at the Multicultural Clinical Center in Springfield, Virginia. Collado said the Multicultural Clinical Center was doing contract work for the County Attorney’s Office of Arlington County.

Marcus-Kurn wrote that “The Center Director” contacted that office after the revelation of the allegations and that Collado was approached by “the supervisors of Child and Family Mental Health Services at the Arlington County Office.” In that discussion, Marcus-Kurn wrote, Collado denied any personal relationship and said she had only allowed the client to store personal belongings in her garage, but that the client had gotten upset when Collado asked her to remove the belongings.

“I don’t know if that happened; that’s what they wrote,” Collado said. “It’s so long ago. I talked to one of my colleagues there at some point. I wasn’t there full-time. Again, I mean, I guess I just go back to, I have said from the beginning, and so it’s very consistent, that … I have denied these allegations the entire time. There was not one moment where I said the opposite of that. So just… that’s all I can say.”

Rebecca Keegan, director and founder of the Multicultural Clinical Center, did not respond to a request for comment. Jessica Perkins, a legal assistant at the Arlington County Office of the County Attorney, said Collado was not employed at that office at any time in any capacity.

The defense maintained that Collado had encouraged the patient to work with her multiple personalities by doing artwork and keeping a journal.

“Dr. Collado attributes [the patient’s] belief of ongoing sexual encounters as fantasies and aberrations,” Hickey wrote in the memorandum. “At no time ever did Ms. Collado tell [the patient] that acting out sexual fantasies with others would be therapeutic.”

The prosecution submitted a letter from Courtois and Turkus to Judge Frederick Dorsey as a supplemental submission in aid of sentencing. Though the document introducing this letter to the case is included in the case file, the letter itself is not. The letter was obtained and verified by The Ithacan.

Entering into a sexual relationship with a patient is against the American Psychological Association’s Code of Ethics, Courtois and Turkus wrote.

“Her conduct, in terms of entering into a personal relationship with a patient, is not only a violation of the ethical code of her chosen profession and her contract with her employer, but a betrayal of those who trained her and of all of us in the field,” Courtois and Turkus said. “She neither sought supervision nor support from her colleagues when she violated the code; instead she kept it hidden.”

In the letter, Courtois and Turkus wrote they encouraged “due consideration of restricting Shirley Collado from employment involving patient contact” and wrote they had “grave concerns in this area.”

“It has been a shock to us to discover this months later and has shaken us to our professional core,” Courtois and Turkus wrote. “The damage to the hospital program, in which she worked, is inestimable. Many hours have been spent by us and our staff in processing these issues. We will undoubtedly continue to do so for some time to come. What Shirley Collado did is the antithesis of all of our beliefs, values, and responsibility to patients.”

In their letter to the judge, Courtois and Turkus wrote they also made a report to the Board of Psychology of the District of Columbia. A Freedom of Information Act request filed by The Ithacan revealed the board has no records regarding Collado. Ed Rich, senior assistant general counsel for the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the board has no jurisdiction over a health professional prior to their licensure and would not speculate as to what the board would have done with a report of wrongdoing by an unlicensed individual.

In the defendant’s Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing, Hickey wrote the patient’s allegations were “reckless and spurious.”

Hickey wrote that the patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had hallucinatory episodes. On “several occasions,” the patient thought someone else was in the room with her and Collado and confused Collado with other people, Hickey wrote. He wrote that Collado’s accuser “suffers from psychoses and is highly unstable and unreliable” — although he cites no source for that diagnosis. The claim contradicts what those who treated the patient told the prosecution.

The patient was not psychotic, the co-worker said.

Collado said she fully stands by what her lawyer submitted in her defense and could not talk about the patient’s medical history.

“I can’t speculate why the therapists reported what they did,” she said. “What I can tell you, in a very general way, without disclosing her whole medical profile… this is someone who was treated multiple times — not just by me, by multiple hospitalizations and therapists — had a very serious psychiatric disorders that have lasted years upon years in a pretty serious profile when you look at dissociative disorders, psychotic disorders, things like that.”

Hickey argued that the patient did not register any complaints about Collado until after she was asked to move out in November 2000.

Hickey wrote that the fact the patient was unwilling to provide a written statement “should give serious pause to any credence attributed to her” and that “the fact that she never complained to anyone until she had to move out of the Collado residence should question her motivations.”

He also noted there had never been any other allegations made against Collado. Collado told The Ithacan there has never been another allegation of sexual misconduct against her.

Hickey wrote that the unit in which the patient was located was highly visible. He wrote that there were windows in therapy rooms, nurses noted where each patient was at all times and there were no places off-limits in The Center.

“Therapists have offices, and offices have doors,” the co-worker told The Ithacan. “And people do therapy behind closed doors.”

Rotschaefer told Hickey that the patient “was extremely unstable, unreliable and had a crazy lifestyle.” Rotschaefer said she never knew or observed an inappropriate relationship between Collado and the patient.

Collado was sentenced on Nov. 20, 2001. The prosecution requested she be sentenced to go to counseling for mental health providers who sexually assault their patients, perform 120 hours of community service, and write the victim a letter of apology. Dorsey sentenced her to a 30-day suspended sentence, 18 months of supervised probation, an order to stay away from the patient, and 80 hours of community service.

Leah Gurowitz, a spokesperson for the District of Columbia Superior Court, said no transcript explaining the judge’s sentencing decision is available and that Dorsey has retired. Dorsey said he did not recall the case when reached by The Ithacan and that it is not his custom to discuss specific cases. He said a case in which a nolo contendere plea is entered proceeds the same as an admission of guilt for the purposes of the law.

“Then I proceed on sentencing based on the circumstances and background of what is alleged in the case and the information that is provided by the lawyers,” Dorsey said.

The probation was transferred to New York, as Collado had moved to New York City by the time she was sentenced.

Ethical Issues

Eric Harris, a licensed psychologist and attorney who is currently the legal counsel for the Massachusetts Psychological Association, had approximately 60,000 consultations with psychologists while he worked for the American Psychological Association Insurance Trust, which changed its name to the American Insurance Trust. Though unfamiliar with the specifics of this case, he spoke with The Ithacan about the wider ethical issues involved.

Harris said living with a former patient is an ethical violation due to the power differential between the therapist and patient. He said that when a client comes to a therapist and requests help, the therapist should be completely devoted to the interest of the client. But that changes when therapists enter any type of personal relationship — such as living together — with a former patient.

“When a client develops any type of personal relationship with their therapist, when they are no longer in therapy, the client begins to expect that the therapist will continue to behave like a therapist,” he said. “But often, when you have a personal relationship with somebody, you don’t behave like you’re a therapist. You behave like you are a normal human being, and that means you have needs of your own. That can lead to disagreements and fights.”

Harris said patients are very vulnerable when they enter therapy. If anything goes wrong after a therapist enters into any type of personal relationship with a patient, it is much more harmful, he said.

Collado said she couldn’t anticipate how the patient would feel after being asked to move out.

“I’m sure she was confused and felt rejected or hurt, and clearly — within a matter of a week, days — she’s … making claims about something she alleges that I did when she was being treated, and that simply did not take place,” Collado said. “I’m sure she felt a lot of things.”

Susan Roth, professor emeritus of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, met Collado when Collado was a graduate student and has remained in touch with her. Roth is an expert in trauma therapy and said she does not believe the allegations of sexual misconduct against Collado.

Roth said that generally speaking, she would recommend against a therapist living with a former patient. But she said that considering the context of the situation, Collado feared for the patient’s safety, did not feel at risk for having an inappropriate relationship and had other people living in the house, she doesn’t hold it against Collado.

“I think the context in which it happened — and she was in training on top of that — the harm was done to her and not to the patient,” Roth said. “If I weren’t confident that she had boundaries, if I thought that would put them at risk for having a relationship, yes, then I think, even with a former patient, having some kind of romantic or sexual relationship of any kind, I would not feel good about. But that is not what happened. It’s an easy call if someone knows Shirley. Without knowing Shirley, it’s not such an easy call… If you asked me, do you think it is okay for anybody to do that, I would say no, not in general.”

The co-worker said that The Center had very strict rules and that employees were not allowed to hug or touch the patients or give them rides to the bus station, for example.

“The sexual stuff aside, there were so many boundaries broken there,” the co-worker said. “We needed to model perfect boundaries at all times. For someone who is supposed to be a trained expert to come in and do something like this that broke every rule, and every therapeutic rule of making boundaries, that was not good.”

They said these rules were made very clear and explained to all the employees.

“It is difficult, and people make mistakes,” the co-worker said. “People overstep the bounds, and that’s why we have supervisors upon supervisors. For example, to invite a patient to come and live with you, that would be something you’d have to talk to your supervisor about, and I can guarantee you, they would say hell no.”

Harris said entering into a sexual relationship with a patient is “about one of the most harmful things you can do as a therapist.”

“If you have sex with an existing patient, in psychology there is only one mortal sin, and that’s it,” he said. “The whole issue of sexual harassment, and #MeToo now … involves the question of consent. And in the opinion of the profession, there is no way a current client, given the power differential in the relationship, can meaningfully consent to a sexual relationship. The reason it is such as serious violation is we know the amount of serious harm that clients have suffered as a result of being abused in this way.”

The patient would have understood that engaging in a sexual relationship with a therapist would be a violation of The Center’s rules, the co-worker said. The patient was unable to consent to sexual contact because of her status as a trauma patient, the co-worker said.

“It would be like seducing a child, honestly — that’s how vulnerable… you just don’t do that,” the co-worker said. “I would not say that she would be capable of giving consent.”

Presidential Search

Despite the conviction, Collado rose through the ranks of higher education. She left D.C. and moved back to New York, taking a job at the Posse Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes college access and youth leadership development. Collado had attended Vanderbilt University as a member of the first group of Posse Scholars and graduated in 1994.

After leaving the Posse Foundation in 2006, she held administrative roles at Middlebury College, Lafayette College, Rutgers University–Newark and, now, as president of Ithaca College. Collado began her tenure as president on July 1, 2017. She also serves on the Board of Trust at Vanderbilt University.

Tom Grape, chair of the Ithaca College Board of Trustees, and Jim Nolan, trustee and chair of the search committee, said the case was thoroughly vetted during the search process.

“We had very thorough and comprehensive discussions with Shirley about this issue with the search committee and, ultimately, with the board,” Grape said. “So it was very open discussions, and we talked with some of her previous employers and references about this matter, so it was something that was very openly discussed, that we knew all about.”

Grape and Nolan would not reveal which references the board or search committee spoke with, or if the board or search committee spoke with anyone who oversaw Collado’s work at The Center, saying they had promised confidentiality with the references they spoke with.

“My own perspective about it is this is something of almost 20 years ago that was adjudicated in court and has been settled,” Grape said. “And I think for us to sort of go back and ask people, well, something that happened 20 years ago when there’s since been a 20-year history of behavior that is spotless, to me, the matter was settled with the court action 20 years ago. And we’ve done very thorough reference-checking for her professional activity since, and we did talk to some folks from that era, and we’re satisfied.”

While the presidential search began as an open search, meaning final candidates would be publicly identified and would interact with the campus community, the search became closed in December due to feedback from the candidates and the search firm, Spencer Stuart. This follows the trend in higher education of having more confidential searches.

Nolan said he believes Collado’s denial “100 percent,” and Grape said he does not believe the allegations of sexual misconduct against Collado.

Grape said Collado has acknowledged that letting the patient move in with her was a mistake and that Collado was trying to be helpful.

“That’s the kind of person she is, and we think that’s her character, of trying to be helpful to folks,” he said. “And she acknowledges she, in retrospect, wouldn’t do that again. … Her ethics are of the highest order, and we are not concerned about ethical breaches in the past 20 years or going forward.”

While the board of trustees examined all the court documents, the search committee — which consisted of trustees, faculty, students and staff — reviewed only a summary of the court documents provided by the board. Nolan said he feels the search committee had the pertinent information. Both the board and the search committee discussed the matter with Collado in-depth, Grape said.

“The search committee was fully aware of the contents,” Grape said. “But they’re very sensitive documents, and we wanted to be careful about the distributions.”

The court documents are available to the public, upon request to the District of Columbia Superior Court.

Nolan and Grape would not share with The Ithacan what information the search committee received and how the court documents were summarized for the search committee.

“The search process, by its nature, is a very confidential process, and I think to recreate documents and start making those public would not be in anyone’s best interest,” Nolan said.

Grape said the board had all the documents and went through them in great detail.

“The board, who ultimately makes the hiring decision, did have all the documents and did have a chance — several chances — to meet with Dr. Collado and go through it in great detail,” he said. “The board was satisfied with information they read and with the conversation they had and the due diligence that we’d done.”

Nolan said Collado described the incident during the search process similarly to the way she did in a Q&A with IC View released by the college on March 1, 2017, shortly after the board of trustees announced her hiring Feb. 22, 2017. In the interview, Collado discussed the death of her first husband, the difficult period in her life and how a former patient made false claims against her after she asked the former patient to move out. She didn’t reveal that she was charged with and convicted of a crime or explain the specific nature of the charges against her in the IC View Q&A.

The Ithacan received an anonymous package in early December including the prosecution’s memorandum and some additional documents not included in the case file. Collado said her office also received an anonymous package with information from the case, which was reviewed by Grape and others.

“From the beginning, with the the board and the search committee, this is not news, this is not something that was unknown, this is not something that is a big surprise,” she said. “It’s something that the right people, at the right time, thoroughly investigated and looked at carefully, and I was completely transparent and forthcoming.”

She said she made the intentional decision to publicly talk about the case in the IC View interview.

“I cannot control what has been disseminated, how one-sided it might be,” she said. “I cannot control how people are interpreting the documents. … All I can do is give you my facts and my truth and try to share, as I have, with the board, with the search committee, and with the IC community my part of what actually happened.”

Grape and Nolan said they both absolutely stand by their decision to hire Collado.

“In any situation, you have to look at the entirety of the individual and the work that they have done,” Nolan said. “And there are challenges in people’s lives. So you take the whole body into consideration, and when we take the whole body of work, of her life experiences, into consideration, she is an exceptional individual … who we believe is absolutely the right fit for the institution.”

Hacktivist has compiled massive database of white nationalist activity.,https://www.wired.com/story/free-speech-issue-antifa-data-mining/?mbid=social_fb_onsiteshare,"The email arrived just as Megan Squire was starting to cook Thanksgiving dinner. She was flitting between the kitchen, where some chicken soup was simmering, and her living room office, when she saw the subject line flash on her laptop screen: “LOSer Leak.” Squire recognized the acronym of the League of the South, a neo-­Confederate organization whose leaders have called for a “second secession” and the return of slavery. An anonymous insider had released the names, addresses, emails, passwords, and dues-paying records of more than 4,800 members of the group to a left-wing activist, who in turn forwarded the information to Squire, an expert in data mining and an enemy of far-right extremism.

Fingers tapping across the keyboard, Squire first tried to figure out exactly what she had. She pulled up the Excel file’s metadata, which suggested that it had passed through several hands before reaching hers. She would have to establish its provenance. The data itself was a few years old and haphazardly assembled, so Squire had to rake the tens of thousands of information-filled cells into standardized sets. Next, she searched for League members near her home of Gibsonville, North Carolina. When she found five, she felt a shiver. She had recently received death threats for her activism, so she Googled the names to find images, in case those people showed up at her door. Then she began combing through the thousands of other names. Two appeared to be former South Carolina state legislators, one a firearms industry executive, another a former director at Bank of America.

Once she had a long list of people to investigate, Squire opened a database of her own design—named Whack-a-Mole—which contains, as far as anyone can tell, the most robust trove of information on far-right extremists. When she cross-checked the names, she found that many matched, strengthening her belief in the authenticity of the leak. By midafternoon, Squire was exchanging messages via Slack with an analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a 46-year-old organization that monitors hate groups. Squire often feeds data to the SPLC, whose analysts might use it to provide information to police or to reveal white supremacists to their employers, seeking to get them fired. She also sent several high-profile names from the list back to the left-wing activist, who she knew might take more radical action—like posting their identities and photos online, for the public to do with what it would.1

Squire, a 45-year-old professor of computer science at Elon University, lives in a large white house at the end of a suburban street. Inside are, usually, some combination of husband, daughter, two step-children, rescue dog, and cat. In her downtime she runs marathons and tracks far-right extremists. Whack-a-Mole, her creation, is a set of programs that monitors some 400,000 accounts of white nationalists on Facebook and other websites and feeds that information into a centralized database. She insists she is scrupulous to not break the law or violate Facebook’s terms of service. Nor does she conceal her identity, in person or online: “We shouldn’t have to mask up to say Nazis are bad. And I want them to see I don’t fit their stereotypes—I’m not a millennial or a ‘snowflake.’ I’m a peaceful white mom who definitely doesn’t like what they’re saying.”

Though Squire may be peaceful herself, among her strongest allies are “antifa” activists, the far-left antifascists. She doesn’t consider herself to be antifa and pushes digital activism instead of the group’s black-bloc tactics, in which bandanna-masked activists physically attack white supremacists. But she is sympathetic to antifa’s goal of silencing racist extremists and is unwilling to condemn their use of violence, describing it as the last resort of a “diversity of tactics.” She’s an intelligence operative of sorts in the battle against far-right extremism, passing along information to those who might put it to real-world use. Who might weaponize it."
"China More Than Doubles America's 2017 Investments in Clean Energy, in a 'Runaway' Year",https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/china-more-than-doubles-americas-clean-energy-investments-in-2017,"China hit record levels of clean energy investment in 2017, according to the latest annual analysis from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

The country increased its clean energy spending last year by 24 percent, to a total of $132.6 billion. Most of that money, $86.5 billion, went to solar. BNEF estimates China installed a “runaway” 53 gigawatts of PV capacity in 2017, which is approximately 20 more gigawatts than analysts originally projected.

GTM Research estimates the country’s total installs just under that number, at 52 gigawatts.

And China wasn’t the only record-setter, according to BNEF.

Australia grew renewables investment by 150 percent, to a record $9 billion. Energy-smart technologies, such as smart meters and battery storage, also hit record-high investment at $48.8 billion, an increase of 7 percent over 2016.

All told, clean energy investment reached a record annual total of 160 commissioned gigawatts. Last year's total annual investment, $333.5 billion, equals the second highest after 2015.

“The 2017 total is all the more remarkable when you consider that capital costs for the leading technology -- solar -- continue to fall sharply,” said Jon Moore, chief executive at BNEF.

According to GTM Research Senior Global Solar Analyst Tom Heggarty, year-over-year global installed solar PV costs fell 12 percent in 2017. At the same time, Heggarty said, “Installations have risen significantly, in large part due to the 52 gigawatts of PV installed in China.”

Heggarty attributes China’s gains to an increased demand for distributed solar, which China defines as any installation below 20 megawatts. Distributed solar there grew from 4 gigawatts in 2016 to over 18 gigawatts last year, according to GTM Research.

“The National Energy Administration in China has been looking to increase smaller-scale installations, closer to large demand centers in eastern China, in order to try to alleviate some of the current issues with solar power generation being curtailed,” Heggarty said in an email. “The NEA’s Poverty Alleviation Program, designed to incentivize the installation of solar PV in impoverished areas of China, has also contributed to the impressive levels of growth.”

BNEF credits the expansion in China’s solar market to reluctance from regulators to cut off subsidies for new utility-scale projects outside government quotas, as well as the rising prevalence of distributed solar on sites such as rooftops and industrial parks, driven by falling costs.

The figures contradict earlier 2017 projections that the country's solar market would decline after a peak year in 2016. Both BNEF and GTM Research projected China’s market would see 2017 installations around 30 gigawatts.

Instead, China’s spending on solar accounted for half the world’s $160.8 billion total. Global solar investment grew 18 percent in 2017, accounting for 48 percent of total global clean energy investment.

In other findings from the BNEF report, wind investment came in under solar at $107.2 billion in total investment. That sector showed a 12 percent decrease in spending from 2016 levels. According to MAKE Consulting, GTM's sister company, global wind installations fell by 6 percent year-over-year.

Mexico’s clean energy investment ballooned 516 percent to $6.2 billion. The United States also increased its spending with a modest bump of 1 percent over 2016, to a total $56.9 billion. The United Kingdom, Germany and Japan saw the most drastic drops in investment of 56 percent, 26 percent and 16 percent, respectively.

Acquisition and refinancing of existing projects reached new peaks in 2017, at $87.2 billion. The largest deal went to Brookfield Asset Management when it acquired a majority stake in YieldCo Terraform Power for $4.7 billion. This activity is a positive sign indicating market maturity, according to BNEF.

“It is notable that acquisition activity in clean energy has been in excess of $100 billion in each of the last three years,” said BNEF analyst Abraham Louw in a statement. “The fact that generating assets, in particular, are in growing demand from buyers is a sign of a maturing sector.”"
MLK spent the last year of his life detested by the liberal establishment,https://theintercept.com/2018/01/15/martin-luther-king-jr-mlk-day-2018/,"In 1999, the polling agency Gallup set out to determine the individuals Americans most admired in the 20th century. Mother Teresa came in first, with 49 percent of Americans putting her at the top; the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., ranked second, with 34 percent placing him on the same list. But, the polling agency would later write, “King was far from universally revered during his lifetime.” They noted that in 1966, 63 percent of Americans held a negative view of the civil rights leader, while just 32 percent held a positive one. This was a marked reversal from five years earlier, when 41 percent of Americans gave King a positive rating and 37 percent a negative one. King’s slide in popularity coincided with his activism taking a turn from what Americans largely know him for — his campaign for civil rights in the American South — to a much more radical one aimed at the war in Vietnam and poverty. Refusing to Choose Between Civil Rights for African-Americans and Peace for Vietnamese For years, King had been troubled by the war in Vietnam and raised it privately in conversations with the Democratic President Lyndon Johnson. As the conflict dragged on, King felt he had no choice but to publicly denounce the war. In an April 1967 speech at Riverside Church in New York City, the civil rights leader publicly denounced American involvement in Indochina. “This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation’s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love,” he warned. “A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.” Many in King’s inner circle warned against making the speech and publicly campaigning against the war. Their argument was that Johnson had risked his neck for the African-American community on issues like civil rights, health care, and welfare, and publicly condemning his foreign policy would irreparably harm the relationship between black activists and the president.

“We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation, for those it calls ‘enemy,’ for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers.”

King reserved a section of his remarks to address these critics. He labeled the war an “enemy of the poor,” saying that its budget was draining anti-poverty programs; he also pointed out that it was hypocritical for him to preach nonviolence to activists at home, while watching his government reject that principle abroad. But ultimately his stance came from personal moral conviction and his devoted Christian beliefs. “Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonship and brotherhood. Because I believe that the Father is deeply concerned, especially for His suffering and helpless and outcast children, I come tonight to speak for them,” he said. “This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties, which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation’s self-defined goals and positions. We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation, for those it calls ‘enemy,’ for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers.”

The Liberal Backlash The backlash from a liberal establishment that had once praised King for his civil rights campaign came as hard and fast as his allies had feared. The New York Times editorial board lambasted King for linking the war in Vietnam to the struggles of civil rights and poverty alleviation in the United States, saying it was “too facile a connection” and that he was doing a “disservice” to both causes. It concluded that there “are no simple answers to the war in Vietnam or to racial injustice in this country.” The Washington Post editorial board said King had “diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country and his people.” A political cartoon in the Kansas City Star depicted the civil rights movement as a young black girl crying and begging for her drunk father King, who is consuming the contents of a bottle labeled “Anti-Vietnam.” In all, 168 newspapers denounced him the next day. Johnson ended his formal relationship with King. “What is that goddamned nigger preacher doing to me?” Johnson reportedly remarked after the Riverside speech. “We gave him the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we gave him the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we gave him the war on poverty. What more does he want?” The African-American establishment, fearful of Johnson’s reaction, also distanced itself from King. The NAACP under the leadership of Roy Wilkins refused to oppose the war and explicitly condemned the effort to link the peace and civil rights movements. Whitney Young, the leader of the National Urban League, warned that “Johnson needs a consensus. If we are not with him on Vietnam, then he is not going to be with us on civil rights.” Jackie Robinson, the celebrated African-American baseball player and civil rights advocate, wrote to Johnson two weeks after King’s speech to distance himself from the civil rights leader: “While I am certain your faith has been shaken by demonstrations against the Viet Nam war, I hope the actions of any one individual does not make you feel as Vice President Humphrey does, that Dr. King’s stand will hurt the civil rights movement. It would not be fair to the thousands of our Negro fighting men who are giving their lives because they believe, in most instances, that our Viet Nam stand is just.” Many donors to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference wrote to King announcing they were pulling their support.

Tolerance for Civil Disobedience Ends at the Mason-Dixon Line As he alienated the liberal establishment for his campaign against the Vietnam War, King also planned to mobilize mass demonstrations and civil disobedience aimed not at his old foes in the segregationist South, but politicians north of the Mason Dixon line who he believed were failing to act to stop endemic poverty. In August 1967, he told the SCLC that he was calling for activists to “dislocate” northern cities with nonviolent civil disobedience campaigns demanding action on federal aid. He said he would consider tactics, such as school boycotts, blocking plant gates with unemployed African-Americans, and mass sit-ins in federal buildings. The New York Times, a steady ally of King’s civil disobedience campaign in the South, was furious. Two days after King’s SCLC address, the editorial board called his idea a “formula for discord.” The paper complained that there is an “inherent contradiction in Dr. King’s summons to Negroes to act ‘peacefully but forcefully to cripple the operations of an oppressive society.’ He himself has acknowledged that nonviolence is losing its appeal; once the spark of massive law-defiance is applied in the present overheated atmosphere, the potential for disaster becomes overwhelming.” But King was never an advocate for violence. Although some on the left in King’s time and today argue about the utility of violence, King spent much of the end of his life trying to prevent the rioting and violent unrest that the Times was so concerned about. In February 1968, he warned during a tour through Alabama that increased rioting could lead to a “right-wing takeover.” He pointed to segregationist George Wallace’s presidential bid, saying, “Every time a riot develops, it helps George Wallace.” Defending his threat to take poverty protests to the doorsteps of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, he portrayed nonviolence as a sort of middle path between acquiescence and violence. “We need an alternative to riots and to timid supplication,” he said. Also that year, he launched the Poor People’s Campaign, aimed at providing good jobs, housing, and a decent standard of living to all Americans. More than 40 years before American protesters took to the streets of New York City and other locales to “occupy” space to protest inequality, King proposed a massive tent encampment in Washington, D.C. to demand action on poverty. King was assassinated during a campaign to organize sanitation workers in Tennessee in April of that year, before he was able to set up the encampment. His widow Coretta Scott King, as well as fellow civil rights leader Ralph David Abernathy, went ahead with the plan to create what they called Resurrection City. The camp lasted six weeks until police moved in to shut it down and evict all of its inhabitants, pointing to sporadic acts of hooliganism as justification. Andrew Young, the young civil rights leader who later went on to be Jimmy Carter’s U.N. ambassador and a mayor of Atlanta, was horrified, saying the crushing of the camp was worse than the police violence he saw in the South. “It was worse than anything I saw in Mississippi or Alabama,” he said. “You don’t shoot tear gas into an entire city because two or three hooligans are throwing rocks.” Following King’s assassination, the mood shifted quickly. Johnson, who had once terminated all communication with King and privately cursed his name, issued a statement saying the “heart of America is heavy, the spirit of America weeps” following the activist’s death. Georgia’s segregationist Gov. Lester Maddox, a frequent critic of King, even begrudgingly allowed Georgia’s flag to fly at half mast following his death. Bobby Kennedy, who once authorized the wiretaps of King’s phones, attended the funeral.

“He gave his life for the poor of the world — the garbage workers of Memphis and the peasants of Vietnam.”"

It's official- fish feel pain,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/fish-feel-pain-180967764/,"When Culum Brown was a young boy, he and his grandmother frequented a park near her home in Melbourne, Australia. He was fascinated by the park’s large ornamental pond wriggling with goldfish, mosquitofish, and loaches. Brown would walk the perimeter of the pond, peering into the translucent shallows to gaze at the fish. One day, he and his grandmother arrived at the park and discovered that the pond had been drained—something the parks department apparently did every few years. Heaps of fish flapped upon the exposed bed, suffocating in the sun.

Brown raced from one trash can to another, searching through them and collecting whatever discarded containers he could find—mostly plastic soda bottles. He filled the bottles at drinking fountains and corralled several fish into each one. He pushed other stranded fish toward regions of the pond where some water remained. “I was frantic, running around like a lunatic, trying to save these animals,” recalls Brown, who is now a marine biologist at Macquarie University in Sydney. Ultimately, he managed to rescue hundreds of fish, about 60 of which he adopted. Some of them lived in his home aquariums for more than 10 years.

As a child, I too kept fish. My very first pets were two goldfish, bright as newly minted pennies, in an unornamented glass bowl the size of a cantaloupe. They died within a few weeks. I later upgraded to a 40-liter tank lined with rainbow gravel and a few plastic plants. Inside I kept various small fish: neon tetras with bands of fluorescent blue and red, guppies with bold billowing tails like solar flares, and glass catfish so diaphanous they seemed nothing more than silver-crowned spinal columns darting through the water. Most of these fish lived much longer than the goldfish, but some of them had a habit of leaping in ecstatic arcs straight through the gaps in the tank’s cover and onto the living room floor. My family and I would find them flopping behind the TV, cocooned in dust and lint.

Should we care how fish feel? In his 1789 treatise An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, English philosopher Jeremy Bentham—who developed the theory of utilitarianism (essentially, the greatest good for the greatest number of individuals)—articulated an idea that has been central to debates about animal welfare ever since. When considering our ethical obligations to other animals, Bentham wrote, the most important question is not, “Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?” Conventional wisdom has long held that fish cannot—that they do not feel pain. An exchange in a 1977 issue of Field & Stream exemplifies the typical argument. In response to a 13-year-old girl’s letter about whether fish suffer when caught, the writer and fisherman Ed Zern first accuses her of having a parent or teacher write the letter because it is so well composed. He then explains that “fish don’t feel pain the way you do when you skin your knee or stub your toe or have a toothache, because their nervous systems are much simpler. I’m not really sure they feel anypain, as we feel pain, but probably they feel a kind of ‘fish pain.’” Ultimately, whatever primitive suffering they endure is irrelevant, he continues, because it’s all part of the great food chain and, besides, “if something or somebody ever stops us from fishing, we’ll suffer terribly.”

Such logic is still prevalent today. In 2014, BBC Newsnight invited Penn State University biologist Victoria Braithwaite to discuss fish pain and welfare with Bertie Armstrong, head of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation. Armstrong dismissed the notion that fish deserve welfare laws as “cranky” and insisted that “the balance of scientific evidence is that fish do not feel pain as we do.”

That’s not quite true, Braithwaite says. It is impossible to definitively know whether another creature’s subjective experience is like our own. But that is beside the point. We do not know whether cats, dogs, lab animals, chickens, and cattle feel pain the way we do, yet we still afford them increasingly humane treatment and legal protections because they have demonstrated an ability to suffer. In the past 15 years, Braithwaite and other fish biologists around the world have produced substantial evidence that, just like mammals and birds, fish also experience conscious pain. “More and more people are willing to accept the facts,” Braithwaite says. “Fish do feel pain. It’s likely different from what humans feel, but it is still a kind of pain.”

At the anatomical level, fish have neurons known as nociceptors, which detect potential harm, such as high temperatures, intense pressure, and caustic chemicals. Fish produce the same opioids—the body’s innate painkillers—that mammals do. And their brain activity during injury is analogous to that in terrestrial vertebrates: sticking a pin into goldfish or rainbow trout, just behind their gills, stimulates nociceptors and a cascade of electrical activity that surges toward brain regions essential for conscious sensory perceptions (such as the cerebellum, tectum, and telencephalon), not just the hindbrain and brainstem, which are responsible for reflexes and impulses.

Fish also behave in ways that indicate they consciously experience pain. In one study, researchers dropped clusters of brightly colored Lego blocks into tanks containing rainbow trout. Trout typically avoid an unfamiliar object suddenly introduced to their environment in case it’s dangerous. But when scientists gave the rainbow trout a painful injection of acetic acid, they were much less likely to exhibit these defensive behaviors, presumably because they were distracted by their own suffering. In contrast, fish injected with both acid and morphine maintained their usual caution. Like all analgesics, morphine dulls the experience of pain, but does nothing to remove the source of pain itself, suggesting that the fish’s behavior reflected their mental state, not mere physiology. If the fish were reflexively responding to the presence of caustic acid, as opposed to consciously experiencing pain, then the morphine should not have made a difference.

In another study, rainbow trout that received injections of acetic acid in their lips began to breathe more quickly, rocked back and forth on the bottom of the tank, rubbed their lips against the gravel and the side of the tank, and took more than twice as long to resume feeding as fish injected with benign saline. Fish injected with both acid and morphine also showed some of these unusual behaviors, but to a much lesser extent, whereas fish injected with saline never behaved oddly.

Several years ago, Lynne Sneddon, a University of Liverpool biologist and one of the world’s foremost experts on fish pain, began conducting a set of particularly intriguing experiments; so far, only some of the results have been published. In one test, she gave zebrafish the choice between two aquariums: one completely barren, the other containing gravel, a plant, and a view of other fish. They consistently preferred to spend time in the livelier, decorated chamber. When some fish were injected with acid, however, and the bleak aquarium was flooded with pain-numbing lidocaine, they switched their preference, abandoning the enriched tank. Sneddon repeated this study with one change: rather than suffusing the boring aquarium with painkiller, she injected it straight into the fish’s bodies, so they could take it with them wherever they swam. The fish remained among the gravel and greenery.

The collective evidence is now robust enough that biologists and veterinarians increasingly accept fish pain as a reality. “It’s changed so much,” Sneddon says, reflecting on her experiences speaking to both scientists and the general public. “Back in 2003, when I gave talks, I would ask, ‘Who believes fish can feel pain?’ Just one or two hands would go up. Now you ask the room and pretty much everyone puts their hands up.” In 2013, the American Veterinary Medical Association published new guidelines for the euthanasia of animals, which included the following statements: “Suggestions that finfish responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted. … the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain.”

Yet this scientific consensus has not permeated public perception. Google “do fish feel pain” and you plunge yourself into a morass of conflicting messages. They don’t, says one headline. They do, says another. Other sources claim there’s a convoluted debate raging between scientists. In truth, that level of ambiguity and disagreement no longer exists in the scientific community. In 2016, University of Queensland professor Brian Key published an article titled “Why fish do not feel pain” in Animal Sentience: An Interdisciplinary Journal on Animal Feeling. So far, Key’s article has provoked more than 40 responses from scientists around the world, almost all of whom reject his conclusions.

Key is one of the most vociferous critics of the idea that fish can consciously suffer; the other is James D. Rose, a professor emeritus of zoology at the University of Wyoming and an avid fisherman who has written for the pro-angling publication Angling Matters. The thrust of their argument is that the studies ostensibly demonstrating pain in fish are poorly designed and, more fundamentally, that fish lack brains complex enough to generate a subjective experience of pain. In particular, they stress that fish do not have the kind of large, dense, undulating cerebral cortices that humans, primates, and certain other mammals possess. The cortex, which envelops the rest of the brain like bark, is thought to be crucial for sensory perceptions and consciousness.

Some of the critiques published by Key and Rose are valid, particularly on the subject of methodological flaws. A few studies in the growing literature on fish pain do not properly distinguish between a reflexive response to injury and a probable experience of pain, and some researchers have overstated the significance of these flawed efforts. At this point, however, such studies are in the minority. Many experiments have confirmed the early work of Braithwaite and Sneddon.

Moreover, the notion that fish do not have the cerebral complexity to feel pain is decidedly antiquated. Scientists agree that most, if not all, vertebrates (as well as some invertebrates) are conscious and that a cerebral cortex as swollen as our own is not a prerequisite for a subjective experience of the world. The planet contains a multitude of brains, dense and spongy, globular and elongated, as small as poppy seeds and as large as watermelons; different animal lineages have independently conjured similar mental abilities from very different neural machines. A mind does not have to be human to suffer.

Despite the evidence of conscious suffering in fish, they are not typically afforded the kind of legal protections given to farm animals, lab animals, and pets in many countries around the world. The United Kingdom has some of the most progressive animal welfare legislation, which typically covers all nonhuman vertebrates. In Canada and Australia, animal welfare laws are more piecemeal, varying from one state or province to another; some protect fish, some don’t. Japan’s relevant legislation largely neglects fish. China has very few substantive animal welfare laws of any kind. And in the United States, the Animal Welfare Act protects most warm-blooded animals used in research and sold as pets, but excludes fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Yet the sheer number of fish killed for food and bred for pet stores dwarfs the corresponding numbers of mammals, birds, and reptiles. Annually, about 70 billion land animals are killed for food around the world. That number includes chickens, other poultry, and all forms of livestock. In contrast, an estimated 10 to 100 billion farmed fish are killed globally every year, and about another one to three trillion fish are caught from the wild. The number of fish killed each year far exceeds the number of people who have ever existed on Earth.

“We have largely thought of fish as very alien and very simple, so we didn’t really care how we killed them,” Braithwaite says. “If we look at trawl netting, that’s a pretty gruesome way for fish to die: the barometric trauma of getting ripped from the ocean into open air, and then slowly suffocating. Can we do that more humanely? Yes. Should we? Probably, yes. We’re mostly not doing it at the moment because it’s more expensive to kill fish humanely, especially in the wild.”

**********

In some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Norway, fish farms have largely adopted humane slaughter methods. Instead of suffocating fish in air—the easiest and historically the most common practice—or freezing them to death in ice water, or poisoning them with carbon dioxide, they render fish unconscious with either a quick blow to the head or strong electrical currents, then pierce their brains or bleed them out. In Norway, Hanne Digre and her colleagues at the research organization SINTEF have brought these techniques onto commercial fishing vessels on a trial basis to investigate whether humane slaughter is feasible out at sea.

In a series of experiments, Digre and her colleagues tested different open-sea slaughter methods on a variety of species. They found that cod and haddock stored in dry bins on ships after harvest remained conscious for at least two hours. An electric shock delivered immediately after bringing fish onto a ship could knock them unconscious, but only if the current was strong enough. If the electric shock was too weak, the fish were merely immobilized. Some species, such as saithe, tended to break their spines and bleed internally when shocked; others, such as cod, struggled much less. Some fish regained consciousness about 10 minutes after being stunned, so the researchers recommend cutting their throats within 30 seconds of an electric shock.

In the United States, two brothers are pioneering a new kind of humane fishing. In fall of 2016, Michael and Patrick Burns, both longtime fishermen and cattle ranchers, launched a unique fishing vessel named Blue North. The 58-meter boat, which can carry about 750 tonnes and a crew of 26, specializes in harvesting Pacific cod from the Bering Sea. The crew works within a temperature-controlled room in the middle of the boat, which houses a moon pool—a hole through which they haul up fish one at a time. This sanctuary protects the crew from the elements and gives them much more control over the act of fishing than they would have on an ordinary vessel. Within seconds of bringing a fish to the surface, the crew moves it to a stun table that renders the animal unconscious with about 10 volts of direct current. The fish are then bled.

The Burns brothers were initially inspired by groundbreaking research on humane slaughter facilities for livestock conducted by Colorado State University animal science professor and internationally renowned autism spokesperson Temple Grandin. By considering the perspectives of the animals themselves, Grandin’s innovative designs greatly reduced stress, panic, and injury in cattle being herded toward an abattoir, while simultaneously making the whole process more efficient for ranchers. “One day it occurred to me, why couldn’t we take some of those principles and apply them to the fishing industry? Michael recalls. Inspired by moon pools on Norwegian fishing vessels, and the use of electrical stunning in various forms of animal husbandry, they designed Blue North. Michael thinks his new ship is one of perhaps two vessels in the world to consistently use electrical stunning on wild-caught fish. “We believe that fish are sentient beings, that they do experience panic and stress,” he says. “We have come up with a method to stop that.”"
A man in a remote eastern Indian village has single-handedly carved a five-mile (8km) road through hilly terrain to help his children attend school,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/11/india-man-carves-road-through-hills-children-attend-school,"A man in a remote eastern Indian village has single-handedly carved a five-mile (8km) road through hilly terrain to help his children attend school.

It had been taking Jalandhar Nayak’s three sons about three hours each way to navigate the narrow, rocky route to class. So two years ago the vegetable seller from Odisha state picked up a chisel, a garden hoe and pickaxe and began building a shorter route.

His efforts came to the attention of government officials this week when he was featured in a local media bulletin.

“My children found it hard to walk on the narrow and stony path while going to their school. I often saw them stumbling against the rocks and decided to carve a road through the mountain so that they can walk more easily,” he told News World Odisha.

“Nayak’s effort and determination to cut mountains to build a road left me spellbound,” the local administrator, Brundha D, told reporters.

He said Nayak, 45, would be paid for the time he had spent building the path between Gumsahi village and the school in Phulbani, according to the Press Trust of India.

The family are the only remaining residents of Gumsahi, with the rest of the village having left for areas with better roads and amenities.

Nayak had planned to work for another three years to build the remaining four miles (7km) required to complete the road – a job that has now been taken over by the local government.

“The district collector has assured me [he will] complete the construction of the road to my village,” Nayak said.

Footage of Nayak labouring has been aired on national TV, showing him carving out the route and struggling to line it with small boulders.

His story is being compared with that of Dashrath Manjhi, a labourer from Bihar who spent 22 years building a road through a mountain, reportedly reducing the route between two districts by 42km.

Manjhi’s efforts, which have inspired several films, were prompted by injuries his wife suffered while trying to cross the mountain to bring him lunch. He died in 2007 and received a state funeral."

$100 Million Anonymous Donation made to CAMH,https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/01/11/a-donor-is-giving-a-record-100-million-to-camh-and-doesnt-want-to-be-named.html,"An anonymous donor has made a staggering $100-million gift to Toronto’s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

“I send my own 100 million thank-yous from the bottom of my heart to our bold benefactor,” CAMH president Dr. Catherine Zahn said to a cheering crowd of some 200 people, gathered in a centre gym for the announcement.

“I’m happy to say that CAMH will now have the opportunity to animate our hope in a way that we’ve only secretly imagined,” Zahn said.

The donation was given to support research into mental illnesses, which affect some 6.7 million Canadians and are the leading cause of disability on earth.

“I believe CAMH is well-positioned to make a transformational impact in the field of mental health research,” the donor, who insisted on anonymity, said in a media release.

“I have seen the devastating impact of mental illness on individuals and their families; I want to provide support to the next generation of researchers and scientists to pursue the research that will directly transform care.”

The donation, which was announced at 11 a.m. Thursday, will support the recruitment and retention of top scientists and encourage them to take chances with their research.

“In order to enable quantum leaps forward, this gift will also support high-risk, high-reward research,” the donor said.

The donation is by far the largest ever given to a mental health centre in Canada and one of only a handful of that magnitude bestowed on any health organization in the country.

Last September, Toronto philanthropist Peter Munk donated $100 million to the heart centre that bears his name at the Toronto General Hospital.

In 2014, businessman Geoffrey Cumming donated $100 million to the University of Calgary’s school of medicine.

Zahn said the donation and the Discovery Fund it will anchor will help scientists improve the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illnesses.

“In broad strokes what we will be using the gift for is to recruit and retain excellent scientists (and) to create a fund that helps our own young scientists to grow and evolve,” she said.

“We will be looking for ways to provide funding for really, really leading-edge ideas that are going to be focused on understanding disease mechanisms, effective diagnosis and treatment.”

Calling the gift “an injection of wild, wild hope,” Zahn said she does not know for sure why the donor insisted on anonymity.

“There are people who entrust organizations simply in the spirit of public service,” Zahn said. “I don’t have any other explanation. Some people understand that perhaps an anonymous gift may be the most sacred way of giving.”

Zahn says the money will likely be divvied up into an endowment and a direct spending stream.

Dr. Trevor Young, dean of medicine at the University of Toronto, with which CAMH is affiliated, said the gift would help researchers discover the genetic underpinnings of many brain ailments.

“We’re in a very important time for medical research right now. Our explorations into the human genome are raising many fundamental questions about why people get sick, and these questions will lead to new treatments and cures,” Young said in an email interview.

From the Star archives: The next phase of CAMH’s redevelopment is designed to serve people with the most complex forms of mental illness

“But it’s not just physical diseases like cancer that stand to benefit. Understanding the biological roots of depression, schizophrenia and other mental health diseases absolutely will lead to better treatments and ideally prevention.”

Young also said the gift would have a significant impact on many people across the city and province.

“There’s no question a gift of this enormity will open up many new and exciting studies that our residents will be eligible to join,” he said. “CAMH will be able to offer more cutting-edge treatments to people suffering from serious psychiatric disease.”

Tom Churchill, who was successfully treated at CAMH for a 50-year depression, was grateful for the donation.

“Thanks from me and thanks for all the people this donation will help,” Churchill said.

“No one knows what future breakthroughs in mental health (this will) bring.”

Darrell Louise Gregersen, president and CEO of the CAMH Foundation, said the gift would inject a “high octane rocket fuel” into CAMH and its hopes for mental health discoveries.

“We are eternally grateful to this donor, for investing $100 million in our capacity to generate world-leading clinical discovery, and to invest in some of the high-risk, high-reward research that usually doesn’t get top funding priority,” Gregersen said in a release.

“Philanthropy at CAMH is truly changing the future of mental illness, and creating hope for all Canadians.”

Red Robin eliminates bus boys as restaurants combat minimum wage hikes,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2018/01/09/red-robin-eliminates-bus-boys-as-restaurants-combat-minimum-wage-hikes.html,"At the beginning of January, minimum wage increases took effect in 18 states and 20 cities across the nation, and some industries are struggling to keep pace with rising labor costs.

Continue Reading Below

Late Monday, casual dining chain Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (NASDAQ:RRGB) announced that it would eliminate bus boys at 570 restaurant locations, a move that is expected to save the company an estimated $8 million over the course of the coming year. The company’s chief financial officer said the decision was made in order to “address the labor increases we’ve seen.”

“I read that as minimum wage,” Michael Saltsman, director of the Employment Policies Institute (EPI), told FOX Business. “Somebody like Red Robin, which has a lot of exposure in western states [where the minimum wage is rising faster] … this is sort of a burger and beer chain. If they can’t pass those increases off in higher prices … they have to find a way to do more with less.”

Introducing new technologies has been one way restaurants have sought to cut costs. Other chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s have replaced servers with tableside tablets for placing orders.

“From a business standpoint, [Red Robin made a] very smart move. From an employee standpoint, you just cut out $8 million worth of labor,” 1851Franchise.com editor-in-chief Nick Powills told FOX Business. “The interesting thing about the minimum wage hike is that those that made the decisions to do it, did it on behalf of the employee … when intentions are good, and you can’t appease everybody, someone is going to eventually be on the short [end of the] stick.”

Michael Mabry, president and chief operating officer of restaurant franchise MOOYAH Burgers, Fries & Shakes, told FOX Business that his business has been “greatly affected by … rising costs.” While MOOYAH Burgers is not eliminating positions, it is looking for ways to combat the increased expenses resulting from minimum wage hikes.

“What we are looking at, of course, is how do we build efficiencies within the restaurant to keep the same guest service … with the same people, but still allow franchisees to make money? Some of that comes through renegotiation of leases [and contracts] … unfortunately some of it comes through [increasing] menu prices,” Mabry said, adding that during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, he was able to decrease menu prices again by 10% thanks to successful contract negotiations.

Mabry noted that as a business practice, he is not looking to reduce labor because in the hospitality industry, “you’ve got to have people to deliver hospitality.”

Still, cutting jobs is often a popular response to rising labor costs among restaurants, Iain Murray, vice president for strategy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said.

“The restaurant industry exists on razor-thin margins … there are very few other places where you can cut costs to offset that rising cost,” he said.

Other industries where rising labor costs have forced companies to make tough decisions include retail and manufacturing.

Saltsman said one negative consequence of rising minimum wages has been increased challenges for America’s youth in the labor market.

“I think the loss, as the minimum wage goes up … [is the] hollowing out of entry-level opportunities,” Saltsman added.

Murray agreed, adding that this trend sets certain demographics up for long-term unemployment.

There are conflicting reports on how rising minimum wages affect the labor force. Earlier this year, a study conducted by EPI, which analyzed employment trends from 1990 through 2017, found that each 10% increase in the minimum wage in California has resulted in a corresponding 2% decline in employment for affected employees. The impact was larger, 5%, for lower-paid workers.

However, the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment (IRLE) at U.C. Berkeley found that a higher minimum wage would actually add a small amount of jobs to the state economy by 2023.

One thing is clear: Red Robin is not the only restaurant in the industry feeling pressure.

“At the end of the day … [Red Robin is] a good company, and my guess is they’re looking to enhance guest service and I’m sure they’ve got a plan to do that,” Mabry said. “We’re all fighting the same thing.”"

Alzheimers Drug Turns Back the Clock in Mitochondria |,https://www.leafscience.org/alzheimers-drug-turns-back-the-clock-in-mitochondria/,"Alzheimers Drug Turns Back the Clock in Mitochondria

J147 is an experimental drug that has been shown to treat Alzheimer’s disease, and it also appears to reverse some aspects of aging. It is also poised to enter human clinical trials in the near future, although how it works has been somewhat of a puzzle.

A new study published in the journal Aging Cell has changed all that, and the results are quite intriguing[1]. Researchers at the Salk Institute have solved the mystery of how J147 works and why it makes old flies, mice, and cells more youthful.

Rejuvenating mitochondria

The drug apparently works because it binds to a protein found in mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells; this, in turn, causes cells to function in a more youthful manner. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of aging and is thought to be a key reason why we age and develop age-related diseases[2]. This drug appears, at least partially, to address some of that dysfunction.

Finding the target of J147 was the key to revealing the link between Alzheimer’s disease and the aging process. It was the critical information the researchers needed and was holding the drug back from clinical trials.

Dave Schubert, head of Salk’s Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory, and his team originally developed the J147 drug in 2011. The team screened numerous plant-sourced compounds with the potential to reverse the cellular and molecular signs of aging in the brain. The drug was developed as a modified version of a molecule found in the spice curcumin, a common ingredient in Asian foods such as curry.







Since then, the researchers have shown that J147 can reverse memory deficits, increases the production of brain cells, and slows the progression of Alzheimer’s in mice[3]. However, at that point, they did not understand how J147 worked.

Finding the target

During the new study lead by Dave Schubert and Salk Research Associate Josh Goldberg, the researchers used a number of approaches to find out how J147 worked. They eventually identified that the target of J147 was the mitochondrial protein known as ATP synthase, specifically ATP5A, a subunit of that protein. ATP synthase is involved in the mitochondrial generation of ATP, which cells use for energy.

The researchers demonstrated that by reducing the activity of ATP synthase, they were able to protect neuronal cells from a number of toxicities associated with the aging of the brain. One reason for this neuroprotective effect is thought to be the role of excitotoxicity in neuronal cell damage.

Excitotoxicity is the pathological process by which neurons are damaged and killed by the overactivation of receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Think of it being a bit like a light switch being turned on and off so rapidly that it ends up causing the light bulb to blow.

Recently, the role of ATP synthase inhibition for neuroprotection against excitotoxic damage was demonstrated in a mouse study[4]. The second study showed that mouse models expressing the human form of mutant ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (hIF1), which causes a sustained inhibition of ATP synthase, were more resilient to neuronal death after excitotoxic damage. This data is consistent with this new J147 study, in which an increase in IF1 in the mice reduced the activity of ATP synthase (specifically ATP5A) and was neuroprotective.

ATP synthase is implicated in aging

ATP synthase has previously been shown to influence aging in C. elegans worms and flies. Given that aging is the greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease, it is no surprise that the target of the drug is also involved in the aging process.

The team also revealed that by modulating the activity of ATP synthase, they could influence the levels of ATP and other molecules and were able to encourage healthier, more stable mitochondria during aging. Mice given the compound showed profound changes, appearing to look younger at a cellular and molecular level.

The researchers believe that these results are not only encouraging for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, they suggest that J147 may also be useful in treating other age-related diseases.

“People have always thought that you need separate drugs for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and stroke,” said Dave Schubert. “But it may be that by targeting aging we can treat or slow down many pathological conditions that are old-age-associated.”

With J147 having just completed the FDA required toxicology testing in animals, the next step is phase 1 human clinical trials, and the road to approval begins.

Conclusion

It is very heartening to hear important researchers suggesting that in order to treat age-related diseases, one needs to treat the aging processes themselves. This is the exactly what Dr. Aubrey de Grey and others have been saying for many years. It is good to hear more voices joining the call to tackle age-related diseases at their root: the hallmarks and damages where they all begin.

The process of age-related disease begins long before the familiar signs and diagnoses are made; by targeting the early processes that are not given specific disease names, we might yet defeat horrific diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, which rob us of who we are.

Verizon CTO: We won't acclerate network investment due to new corporate tax rate,https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/verizon-cto-we-won-t-accelerate-network-capex-due-to-new-corporate-tax-rate,"Verizon’s CTO said the company doesn’t plan to accelerate spending on its network due to new legislation that lowers corporate tax rates.

“You probably don’t want to have big spikes in the capital allocation because then in the end it drives inefficiencies. We want to be consistent,” said Hans Vestberg, Verizon’s new CTO, during an investor event today. “From an execution point of view you want to be consistent.”

Added Vestberg: “It’s not helpful to go up and down in capital allocation because it ramps up and down resources—money wasted … But we are always debating. And we should debate in a leadership team the size of Verizon.”

Vestberg’s comments are noteworthy in light of announcements that AT&T and Comcast made immediately following the passage of the new tax legislation. Both companies said they would offer their employees year-end bonuses due to the bill, and that they would also boost their network spending.

Specifically, AT&T said it will spend an additional $1 billion on network upgrades in 2018. According to the Washington Post, AT&T is expected to spend around $22 billion on network upgrades in 2017; adding $1 billion would represent a modest increase of 4.5%.

Verizon, and the rest of the nation’s wireless operators, is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results later this month. Vestberg joined Verizon roughly eight months ago following his ouster as CEO of Swedish equipment company Ericsson.

In his comments today, Vestberg also addressed the additional traffic flowing over Verizon’s network after the carrier introduced unlimited data plans in early 2017.

“Of course the growth in the network went up,” he said. “Of course the network grew in certain areas. But more important, the distribution on the growth went a bit different than normally. Normally, peak hours are between 4 and 5 in the afternoons, and suddenly with the unlimited it moved around to different places, locations and different times. So we were not only able to handle those higher loads in that moment, in the peak, but it was also that we were able to make better use of the network. ”

He added that the “engineering team of Verizon did a very good job.”

Those comments are noteworthy considering T-Mobile claimed that Verizon's network slowed 14% after launch of unlimited data—an allegation Verizon has denied.

Finally, Vestberg also commented on Verizon’s overall spectrum position.

“I think we’re sitting on a good position,” he said, noting the carrier would look to technologies like carrier aggregation to use its existing spectrum holdings to keep pace with customer demand.

Interestingly, Vestberg also said Verizon would look to shared spectrum in the 3.5 GHz CBRS band for additional spectrum. “We’re going to use that as well,” he said. “I think that combination puts us on a good position to handle our traffic.”"

Scientists prove existence of 4th spatial dimension,https://tecake.in/scientists-prove-existence-fourth-spatial-dimension/amp,"It has been said that our universe works on three physical dimensions. In 1905, Albert Einstein had developed the theory of relativity that informed about the fourth dimension based on time, called the dimension of time. The latest study has given some deeper insight into a new spatial dimension. Two teams of scientists from Switzerland, USA, Germany, Italy, and Israel have discovered the fourth dimension.

The lead author Oded Zilberberg has given the theoretical concept for this experiment which shows the existence of the new fourth dimension where one can move backwards or forward in time. Mikael Rechtsman from Penn State University and a researcher with the US-based team informed that the 4D spatial systems which can’t be felt physically but they managed to get a glimpse of new dimension

The study was based on the results of two quantum hall experiments. For readers those who don’t know, quantum Hall effect occurs when a high magnetic field is applied in the perpendicular direction to the electron whose movements are restricted in 2D at a very low temperature. In such a situation, the voltage forbids continuous increments rather it makes discrete jumps. In such system, electrons move in predetermined paths and scientists can make the electrons travel along the edges of the material by applying particular magnetic field. This is a quantum Hall effect which was discovered nearly 20 years ago and scientists believe that similar thing will happen to a particle in fourth-dimension.

In layman’s language, 3D objects cast shadows in 2D, therefore, a 4D object should also cast a shadow in 3D. Although 4D is not accessible at the moment, but scientists can trace its shadow in 3D to prove its existence and recent experiments were based on the same theory.

For the study, the scientists placed two specially designed 2D set up, and it gave them a clue about the new fourth spatial dimension. This is an advanced calculation process which in 2016 managed to corner the Nobel Prize for Physics. Researchers used topological pumps which enabled them to change the quantum stated in a predetermined way and scientists were to able convert a 2D system into 4 D system.

In another experiment, physicists used a two-dimensional array of waveguides into a fifteen-centimetre-long glass block using laser beams. The European team then supercooled the atoms and placed them in a 2D lattice which was created using lasers. With the help of additional lasers, the team used a quantum charged pump to stimulate the atoms and to move them. The team then detected a slight variation in the movement of the atoms which shows how a 4D quantum Hall Effect will ripple out.

By measuring the movements of atoms in the 2D lattice, Immanuel Bloch and his team at the Max-Planck Institute for Quantum Optic in Munich found that those atoms worked as the topology of the quantum Hall effect in four dimensions. However, Zilberberg informed that these new experiments can’t be used in real life for now. But it has given significant progress to Physics.

Both the studies have come up with complementary outcomes where the study by U.S. team showed how effects of 4D appear on edges of a special system while other study showed how the fourth dimension might occur in the physical world. The studies were simulations of 4D effects instead of actual four dimensional system.

The experiments are still in its nascent stages and the team is now working to find out how it works. However, the study has given a direction to scientists which will further enable them in future to make the fourth dimension a reality. The fourth dimension will make time travel possible which only exists in theory as of now.

The study appeared in the journal Nature."

Israeli mastermind behind organ trafficking ring is arrested in Cyprus,http://www.dw.com/en/israeli-mastermind-behind-organ-trafficking-ring-is-arrested-in-cyprus/a-42051747,"Police in Cyprus have arrested an Israeli man described as the ringleader of a world-wide organ trafficking network that operated out of the tiny Balkan country of Kosovo several years ago.

Moshe Harel is accused of luring donors from eastern Europe, Turkey and the former Soviet Union to Kosovo, promising to pay them €12,000 ($14,500) for a kidney. He then allegedly charged people (most of them Israelis) in need of a kidney as much as €100,000 for the implant.

Both Kosovo and Russia have issued warrants for Harel's arrest. Kosovo has requested his extradition; it's not clear if Russia has done likewise.

""Based on an international arrest warrant the suspect M.H. was arrested a few days ago in Cyprus,"" said police spokesman Baki Kelani. ""He has been a wanted person since 2010.""

Israeli police arrested Harel in 2012 in a related investigation but he was never extradited to Kosovo because the two countries don't have diplomatic relations.

The trafficking ring operated out of the Medicus clinic — which has since been shut down — on a residential road on the outskirts of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. The scandal came to light by accident in 2008 when a Turkish man collapsed at Pristina airport, visibly in pain after having his kidney removed.

Court annuls convictions

The clinic was run by urologist Lutfi Dervishi. He was convicted of participating in organized crime and organ trafficking and was sentenced to eight years in prison. His son Arban was convicted of the same charges in 2013 and sentenced to seven years in prison. Both men went into hiding.

Urologist Lutfi Dervishi was convicted of organ traffficking

All told, five Kosovan doctors were sentenced to up to eight years in prison for organ trafficking. The donors, whose organs were illegally removed, were left without proper medical care and treated ""like waste,"" prosecutors said at the time of the trial.

But Kosovo's Supreme Court annulled the convictions in 2016 and ordered a retrial of those convicted — that trial is ongoing.

Lutfi Dervishi was recaptured in 2016, but Arban Dervishi and Turkish doctor Yusuf Sonmez are still at large. All of the suspects have denied wrongdoing.

Separately, in 2010 a Council of Europe envoy accused Kosovo Albanian guerilla fighters of harvesting organs from captives, most of them Serbs, during the Kosovo war in 1998-99

A special court with international prosecutors and judges, but operating under Kosovo law, was set up to resolve the allegations made by the envoy Dick Marty. But no indictments have been handed down.

"For the first time in a decade, the Dutch 'Maeslantkering' storm surge barrier, one of the largest movable structures in the world, will close due to high seas.",https://nltimes.nl/2018/01/03/dutch-storm-surge-barriers-close-hard-winds-bring-high-seas,"Strong winds and high seas in the Netherlands on Wednesday forced the closure of two storm surge barriers around Rotterdam and another in Zeeland. The Maeslantkering, said to be one of the three largest moving structures in the world, protects the second largest city in the Netherlands from flooding.

Scheduled for closure at 2:10 p.m., the Maeslantkering had not closed since a late night storm on November 8, 2007. That was the first time a storm triggered its closure since it went operational in an inauguration ceremony led by Queen Beatrix.

Meanwhile, the nine-kilometer Oosterscheldekering in Zeeland was closed for the first time in three years. Also the Hartelkering and HollandscheIJsselkering, both in Zuid-Holland, were expected to close respectively at 11:40 a.m. and 12:15 p.m., Rijkswaterstaat said. They protect some of the lowest lying parts of the Netherlands from water, the latter of the two being the first storm surge barrier built as part of the ambitious Delta Works water management plan of the mid 20th century. An update from the Dutch infrastructure management agency at 1:45 p.m. noted that the Hartelkering was still in a safe position and could be closed later in the day.

Throughout the country the storm was causing dangerous traffic situations with wind-swept debris and strong gusts. A tree blown over onto the A6 highway near Rutten at about 11:30 a.m. quickly brought emergency crews to the area. Two lanes on the A2 from Utrecht to Amsterdam were closed when a truck blew over. These are just two reports out of hundreds of storm damage notifications called into emergency services on Wednesday morning.

The fire department in the Utrecht region had already received 125 storm damage reports by late Wednesday morning.

Despite this, traffic information service VID said it does not expect major problems during evening rush hour. ""But it only has to go wrong in one place for everything to get stuck"", a spokesperson said to RTL Nieuws. ""The advice is not to go on the road with a trailer.""

The NS national train service was also facing limited weather related problems. The high speed rail line between Rotterdam and Breda is down until at least 1:00 p.m. Fewer trains were traveling between Amsterdam, Zaandam and Alkmaar, between Den Haag and Rotterdam, and between Dordrecht and Breda due to the weather.

As of 11 a.m., a total of 176 flights at Schiphol were canceled. That number will keep on increasing, a spokesperson said to RTL Nieuws. Travelers are advised to check their flight status before leaving for the airport.

Several ferries between Den Helder and Texel ferries were delayed or canceled because of the winds, the ferry company said on Twitter.

Amusement park Efteling closed all its outside rollercoasters due to the strong winds. The Python, Joris en de Draak, and Baron 1898 will be closed for the rest of the day."
Israel Tackles Existential Threat Posed by 16-Year-Old Palestinian Girl,https://theintercept.com/2017/12/20/israel-tackles-existential-threat-posed-16-year-old-palestinian-girl/,"On Wednesday, an Israeli military court extended the detention of Ahed Tamimi, a 16-year-old girl who has become the face of Palestinian resistance to Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank for many who follow the weekly protests in her village through social media. The girl was arrested in an overnight raid of her family’s home in the village of Nabi Saleh early Monday.

The arrest, and images of the less-than-daring raid released by the Israeli police to broadcasters, appeared to be an effort to placate far-right Israelis who were angered by video recorded last Friday, as the Palestinian teenager and a female cousin forced two heavily armed Israeli soldiers from her front yard, slapping and kicking them.

The outrage was stoked by Israelis, who claimed that the confrontation with the soldiers had been staged to generate sympathy and made no mention of the fact that the incident took place after an Israeli soldier shot Ahed’s 15-year-old cousin in the head with a rubber-coated metal bullet during a demonstration against the ongoing military occupation. The girl’s father, Bassem, told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that his daughter, who will be 17 in January, was angry because her cousin Mohammed had been shot, and it was unclear at the time if he would survive. (Over the weekend, doctors removed the bullet from the boy’s skull and he was placed in a medically induced coma.)

Video of the incident had been widely shared over the weekend on social networks by Israelis who variously expressed pride in the “quiet restraint” shown by the soldiers and outrage that they appeared to have been bullied by a girl.

As Palestinian activists noted, however, that reading of the incident ignores the fact that the soldiers were on the family’s property, in an area that has been under military occupation for more than half a century.

One copy of the clip posted on Facebook by far-right rapper Yoav Eliasi, known to his fans as The Shadow, was viewed more than a million times, along with his caption decrying the supposed “impotence” of Israel’s “castrated army.” As the Haaretz correspondent Anshel Pfeffer observed following the girl’s arrest, “What no one could explain was why, if indeed there was a valid reason to apprehend her, was she not taken into custody on Friday? Unless, that is, the real charge against her is having made Israeli soldiers look impotent on camera.” Israelis who are critical of the occupation voiced their support for the young political prisoner.

The uproar over the incident in Israel was caused, in part, by simmering anger at the success her parents, Bassem and Nariman Tamimi, have had in drawing attention to the Israeli occupation by using social media to document the weekly protests they have led in Nabi Saleh since 2009. As Ben Ehrenreich explained in a New York Times Magazine profile of the family, Ahed became first became a viral sensation in 2012, when she was caught on camera shaking her fist at an Israeli soldier, demanding to know why her brother had been detained at a protest. The Internet took over: video of the tiny, bare-armed blond girl facing down a soldier went viral. She and Nariman were invited to Istanbul, where, to their surprise, Nariman said, they were greeted at the airport by dozens of children wearing T-shirts printed with Ahed’s photo. They drove past billboards displaying Ahed’s image. Reporters followed them everywhere. Crowds gathered when they walked in the streets. They were taken to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the southeastern city of Urfa, Nariman said, and flew back with him to Istanbul on his plane. Not everyone reacted so enthusiastically. One right-wing blogger dubbed Ahed “Shirley Temper.” The Israeli news site Ynet took the images as evidence that “Palestinian protesters use children to needle I.D.F. soldiers in the hope of provoking a violent response.” A similar debate erupted two years ago, when images of Ahed biting the finger of an Israeli soldier who had her younger brother in a headlock went viral. Israelis who defend the ongoing occupation of the West Bank — and the illegal, Jewish-only settlements there that soldiers are deployed to guard — tried again to blame the girl’s parents for her arrest this week, by claiming that her distress at living under military rule was somehow an act.

The girl’s supporters, however, argued that she and her family have every right to use social media to document the impact of Israel’s military rule on their lives, and on those of millions of Palestinians who are denied basic civil rights.

Despite official calls for Palestinians to commit themselves to unarmed struggle, Israel’s leaders appear deeply unsettled by the protest movement led by the Tamimi family in Nabi Saleh. Education Minister Naftali Bennett told Israel’s Army Radio on Tuesday that the young women filmed slapping the soldiers “should finish their lives in prison.” When Ahed’s mother Nariman went to the Israeli police station where her daughter was being held, she, too, was arrested.

The Israeli military court that extended Ahed Tamimi’s detention on Wednesday also informed her father Bassem that he is now under investigation as well and subject to arrest. Still, the activist said after the hearing, he is proud of his daughter and his family is determined to continue their protests.

"In world first, Israeli undergoes surgery to regrow a bone",https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-world-first-israeli-undergoes-surgery-to-regrow-a-bone/,"Groundbreaking surgery to regrow part of a human bone was carried out on Tuesday at HaEmek Hospital in the northern Israeli town of Afula.

Danny, a resident of a nearby kibbutz who had part of his shinbone removed eight months ago after a car accident, was treated in the procedure, which was hailed by medical staff as “science fiction.”

During the surgery, the first of its kind in the world, doctors took fat cells from the patient, grew them in a lab and injected them back into his body for them to generate the missing parts of the bone, the Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported Wednesday.

Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up

The procedure was developed several years ago by Israeli biotechnology company Bonus BioGroup. Fat cells are separated from the cells capable of generating tissue and blood vessels, and the latter are grown in a bioreactor, a device that simulates the environment inside the human body and provides optimal condition for bone generation. After two weeks, the process yields tissue that can be transplanted in the patient’s body and regrows the missing parts of the bone.

“We created thousands of tiny bone particles, each one of them alive, which enables us to inject them into the missing part where they join together to form a fully functional bone,” said Dr. Shai Meretzky, CEO of Bonus BioGroup.

The surgery was carried out by Prof. Nimrod Rozen, ‎head of the orthopedic ward at HaEmek.

“Our patient arrived with a missing part in his shinbone that his body could not regenerate on its own,” he told Yedioth. “In the surgery I transplanted the cells we extracted from him two weeks ago, and within six weeks the bone will regrow itself and his shin will function normally again. This surgery is truly science fiction, it changes the entire game in orthopedics. Today I have the ability to grow any bone in a lab.”

According to Rozen, the new surgery can also help elderly people who suffer from osteoporosis and cancer patients who had amputations. In the future, he contends, it could even be used to make people with dwarfism dozens of centimeters taller.

“In every surgery I can add ten centimeters, and it can be repeated several times,” he said. “This can change the self-esteem of many people.”

Danny, who became the first person in the world to undergo the innovative procedure, said he trusts his doctors. “I am sure they did a good job, and hope that in a few weeks I will be able to stand normally on my foot again.”

In a procedure last month at the same hospital, in what it said was part of a clinical trial, semi-liquid live human bone tissue, which had been grown in a lab from a patient’s fat cells, was transplanted into the patient’s arm by injection."

"Researchers say they can identify individuals in government healthcare data that was supposed to be anonymous, potentially exposing private information of people receiving mental health treatment or HIV medication...information included medical & pharmaceutical bills of about 10% of Australians.",http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-12-18/anonymous-medicare-data-can-identify-patients-researchers-say/9267684,"Researchers say they can identify individuals in government healthcare data that was supposed to be anonymous, potentially exposing the private information of people receiving mental health treatment or HIV medication.

Published by the federal Department of Health in August 2016 as part of a move towards open data, the historical information included the medical and pharmaceutical bills of about 10 per cent of Australians.

It was pulled offline last year after experts from the University of Melbourne were able to decrypt or decode a number of doctor ID numbers.

In a new report released today, the Melbourne team describe how they were able to use information easily available on the internet to possibly identify seven famous Australians within the same dataset, without figuring out their patient ID numbers.

The report's co-author Dr Vanessa Teague said being able to expose this kind of patient data could be significant for those with stigmatising or chronic illness.

""The possibility of having that fact exposed might have very serious consequences,"" she said.

A Department of Health spokesperson said the matter had already been referred to the Privacy Commissioner, who is investigating, and the department had taken steps to improve its processes.

""The project was halted and remains halted, and the dataset was removed immediately,"" she said.

""The department has not been aware of anyone being identified.""

How to find someone in anonymous data

Even though the Department of Health removed names and took other steps to ensure the dataset was anonymous, the researchers were able to identify individual patients using the type of information people might share on Facebook: gender, birth year, state and health events.

""Two or three boring, typical facts about a person, or data points about a person, will very often make them unique,"" Dr Teague explained.

To illustrate, Dr Teague looked for herself in the data.

More than 17,000 women in the dataset matched her year of birth, but when the years of birth of two of her children were added, only 59 possible matches remained. And only 23 in her home state of Victoria.

Adding their specific days of birth brought the possible matches to zero.

To find the unique patient records that potentially matched the seven prominent Australians, the researchers simply examined online news reports and Wikipedia stories that described celebrity births, sport injuries or surgeries.

Dr Trent Yarwood, a member of the technology-focused policy organisation Future Wise, said the researchers' results were not surprising.

""When you combine an [anonymised dataset] with other publicly accessible data like people's social media or other available demographic data, it means that you can use this stuff to individually identify people.""

Open data versus privacy

The report demonstrates the difficult trade-off between protecting patient privacy and making data openly accessible for important public research.

""I think what we have learnt from this is posting a detailed individual record in a de-identified way just doesn't work, and it would be a lot better to separate out the data that's intended for researchers from public statistics,"" Dr Teague said.

Dr Teague pointed to the Productivity Commission's proposal that would give sensitive data to ""trusted users,"" like a medical research body, with the strong expectation that they keep it secure.

This is different from open datasets about the function of government — say, government expenditure, donations and gifts.

""People's medical records are not really government data,"" Dr Teague suggested. ""They're information about individuals that is in the care of the Government.""

In 2016, the Government proposed making the re-identification of government data an offence, but Dr Teague believes that is misguided and could affect legitimate research.

""I think that's confusing the symptom with the disease,"" she said. ""In fact, if the Government has posted an easily re-identifiable dataset, they should find out.""

""This paper's really important at highlighting that even what on paper looks like 'reasonable' de-identification steps can actually cause problems,"" Dr Yarwood said.

""If computer security researchers are doing this, then you can bet that advertising companies ... are going to be doing exactly the same sort of stuff.""

"Trump turning US into 'world champion of extreme inequality', UN envoy warns | US news",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/15/america-un-extreme-poverty-trump-republicans,"The United Nations monitor on poverty and human rights has issued a devastating report on the condition of America, accusing Donald Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress of attempting to turn the country into the “world champion of extreme inequality”.

A journey through a land of extreme poverty: welcome to America Read more

Philip Alston, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, has completed a two-week official tour of the US by releasing an excoriating attack on the direction of the nation. Not only does he warn that the tax bill currently being rushed through Congress will hugely increase already large disparities between rich and poor, he accuses Trump and his party of consciously distorting the shape of American society in a “bid to become the most unequal society in the world”.

“American exceptionalism was a constant theme in my conversations,” he writes. “But instead of realizing its founders’ admirable commitments, today’s United States has proved itself to be exceptional in far more problematic ways that are shockingly at odds with its immense wealth and its founding commitment to human rights. As a result, contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound.”

In his most stark message, Alston warns that the Republicans’ declared intent to slash crucial welfare programs next year in order to pay for some of the $1.5tn tax cuts could cost American lives. “The consequences for an already overstretched and inadequate system of social protection are likely to be fatal for many programs, and possibly also for those who rely upon them,” he writes.

The American Dream is rapidly becoming the American Illusion Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur

Alston’s piercing findings present the Trump administration with a challenge. The charge that the US president is actively seeking to harm millions of Americans may be difficult to ignore, given that the report carries the imprimatur of the UN human rights council in Geneva.

Trump has frequently been dismissive of the world body, complaining during the 2016 presidential campaign that “we get nothing out of the United Nations other than good real-estate prices”. But he has also shown himself to have a thin skin when it comes to criticism of him or his administration. At a press conference launching his preliminary report in Washington, Alston quipped about possible Trump reaction: “I’m hoping for a tweet”.

Bernie Sanders, the US senator who has led the debate on inequality, has waded into the fray. He met the UN monitor on Friday and sounded his own alarm about the future of the country.

Sanders said that as the “wealthiest country in the history of the world” the US should be providing a model in how to treat all of its citizens with dignity. “Sadly that is not the case. We are moving into 2018 – we should not be living in a country with 41 million people living in poverty and so many more in extreme poverty, and nobody even talks about it.”

Alston invited Paul Ryan to meet him but was told the Republican speaker of the House was too busy.

In his 15-day fact-finding mission, Alston, an Australian academic and law professor at New York University, visited Los Angeles and San Francisco, Alabama, Georgia, Puerto Rico and West Virginia, talking to low-income families as well as governmental officials. He will produce a final report next May and that in turn will go before the UN human rights council.

Alston takes a strip out of the US for what he suggests are its double standards over human rights. The Trump administration, in line with previous US governments, preaches about human rights to other countries while refusing to be bound itself by international rules.

“The US is alone among developed countries in insisting that while human rights are of fundamental importance, they do not include rights that guard against dying of hunger, dying from a lack of access to affordable healthcare, or growing up in a context of total deprivation. But denial does not eliminate responsibility or negate obligations.”

Alston is also scathing about the attitudes of some of the politicians and officials he met on his tour, who subscribe to what he calls the caricature of rich people as industrious and entrepreneurial and poor people as “wasters, losers and scammers”.

He writes: “Some politicians and political appointees with whom I spoke were completely sold on the narrative of such scammers sitting on comfortable sofas, watching color TVs, while surfing on their smartphones, all paid for by welfare. I wonder how many of these politicians have ever visited poor areas, let alone spoken to those who dwell there.”

Inequality is not inevitable – but the US 'experiment' is a recipe for divergence Read more

At the press conference, Alston said that current US trends were undermining democracy. “Democracy is the foundation stone upon which this country is built, the contribution of which it has been most proud internationally. And yet what we see is the lowest voter turnouts in any developed country.”

He pointed to the disenfranchisement of former prisoners, as well as covert voter suppression efforts such as the imposition of voter ID requirements as examples of the way the political rights of low-income people were being eroded.

Latest figures put the number of Americans living in poverty at 41 million – almost 13% of the population. Of those, almost half (19 million) are living in deep poverty, defined as having a total family income that is below one-half of the poverty threshold.

In a report packed with depressing evidence, the UN rapporteur tries to give a positive spin to his findings, saying that with the wealth that abounds in the US the country is in a position to solve its poverty and inequality crisis. “The persistence of extreme poverty is a political choice made by those in power. With political will, it could readily be eliminated.”

In a phrase that might reverberate around Capitol Hill and the White House, Alston concludes: “The American Dream is rapidly becoming the American Illusion since the US now has the lowest rate of social mobility of any of the rich countries.”"
World-first solar train now leaving the platform in Byron Bay with zero emissions: What is claimed to be the world's first fully solar-powered train is operating on the New South Wales North Coast.,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-16/world-first-solar-train-the-brainchild-of-byron-bay-millionaire/9265522,"What is claimed to be the world's first fully solar-powered train is operating on the New South Wales North Coast.

A refurbished 70-year-old 'red rattler' is running on a three-kilometre stretch of disused rail line at the popular tourist destination of Byron Bay.

It made its maiden trip yesterday with almost 100 passengers on board.

Electric bus solar system

The $4-million project is the brainchild of multi-millionaire businessman Brian Flannery, who owns a resort in the area.

""Hopefully it attracts people to Byron Bay,"" Mr Flannery said.

""I think international tourists will come here to have a look at this world's first solar train.

""So let's see, in five years' time they'll probably still say I'm mad, but it's a bit of fun.""

Tim Elderton, from the Lithgow Railway Workshop, was tasked with building curved solar panels and a battery system to power the train.

""Basically it's electric bus technology that we've re-engineered to adapt to a train,"" he said.

""Of course the major difference is it's got solar panels on the roof so it can recharge itself.

""For those cloudy days we've also got 30 kilowatts of solar panels in this [station's] roof here so we can also plug it in.

""On a sunny day like today we can do about four or five trips before we have to plug it in.""

Modern technology and old-world charm

It has been 13 years since a train has run on the disused track between Casino and Murwillumbah.

The New South Wales Government closed the North Coast line in 2004, citing low passenger numbers.

But the Byron Bay Railroad Company's Jeremy Holmes said the alternative lifestyle haven was an ideal place for a project that combined modern solar technology with the old-world charm of a heritage train.

""I think everyone knows that Byron's very conscious about anything to do with the environment,"" he said.

""It's really nice to be able to run a train that's zero emissions and powered by the sun.""

But it might be premature to call this the dawn of an new era in rail travel.

Tram infrastructure a possibility

Longer trips than this one — 10 minutes to cover three kilometres or so — would require regular recharging stations along the route, but Mr Flannery said the technology might be suited to inner-city trams.

The solar technology used on the train might also be suited to trams like this one in Melbourne. ( ABC News: Andie Noonan )

""A lot of the tram networks of course have overhead wires and they're electric but they're powered off the grid from overhead,"" he said.

""But in a case where you want to build a tramline without that infrastructure, I think you could.

""At various stations you could top the train [or tram] up."""

"Man accused of keeping stepdaughter captive for 19 years, fathering 9 children",http://wishtv.com/2017/12/15/man-accused-of-keeping-stepdaughter-captive-for-19-years-fathering-9-children/,"Man accused of keeping stepdaughter captive for 19 years, fathering 9 children

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) – A federal grand jury in Oklahoma has indicted a 63-year-old man accused of kidnapping his stepdaughter and holding her captive for 19 years in Mexico and elsewhere while fathering her nine children.

Henri Michelle Piette is accused of kidnapping Rosalynn Michelle McGinnis in 1995 or 1996 and traveling with the intent to have sex with her, according to an indictment a grand jury in Muskogee, Oklahoma, handed up Wednesday.

The Associated Press generally doesn’t identify people who say they have been sexually abused, but McGinnis has discussed her case publicly.

“Knowing that the man who physically took 22 years from me, leaving me with a lifetime of painful challenges, has been captured makes today one of the most pivotal times of my life,” she told People magazine in an online article published on Oct. 9.

McGinnis’ phone number is not publicly listed and she could not be reached for comment.

Trending Headlines

Piette also faces state charges of first-degree rape of a victim under age 14, child abuse by injury and two counts of lewd molestation, according to online Wagoner County court records.

FBI agent Adam Reynolds wrote in an affidavit in the federal case that Piette first had sex with McGinnis when she was 11 or 12 in the back room of a residence in the eastern Oklahoma city of Wagoner, where she shared a bunk bed with another female.

McGinnis was about 11 when Piette “took her to a van and married her” at a ceremony in Wagoner where Piette “gave her a ring,” the affidavit states.

Piette changed McGinnis’ name as well as his own “numerous times in an attempt to stay hidden,” the affidavit says. They traveled throughout the U.S. and Mexico but occasionally returned to Oklahoma to mail letters so people would think they were still in the state, the document says.

McGinnis conceived two children with Piette while she was younger than 18 and another seven after she had turned 18, the affidavit says. Federal officials obtained DNA samples from Piette and eight of the nine children for comparison. The ninth child was not at the same location when the samples were collected, according to the affidavit.

Now 33, McGinnis says she managed to escape from Piette last year in Mexico, where they were living, and she went to the U.S. Embassy, where she secured passports for herself and the children so they could enter the U.S.

McGinnis provided statements to federal officials about her ordeal and reported that Piette was living in Mexico at the time “and had strong connections with the Mexican Mafia.” He is currently in custody in Oklahoma.

Federal court records do not list an attorney for Piette. Piette’s attorney on the state charges, Lauren Blake of Tulsa, Oklahoma, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.

If convicted of kidnapping, he faces a sentence of up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. Travel with intent to engage in sexual act with a juvenile is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

The state first-degree rape charge is also punishable by up to life in prison. Child abuse by injury can also carry a life prison sentence, and lewd molestation is punishable by up to 25 years in prison if the victim is under 12."
"India clears bill criminalising instant triple talaq - Instant triple talaq, or Talaq-e-biddat involves Muslim men divorcing their wives by mentioning the word 'talaq (divorce)' three times in one go, sometimes over email, WhatsApp messages or letters",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-clears-bill-criminalising-instant-triple-talaq/story-L48mVyE77iBTShBEpxjZSI.html,"india

Updated: Dec 15, 2017, 16:47 IST

The Union Cabinet on Friday cleared a bill that criminalises the Islamic practice of instant triple talaq, ahead of it being taken up in the Winter Session of Parliament.

In November, the Narendra Modi government said it was ready with a bill that would provide a legal framework to prosecute Muslim men calling off marriages using a custom outlawed by the Supreme Court.

Instant triple talaq, or Talaq-e-biddat involves Muslim men divorcing their wives by mentioning the word ‘talaq (divorce)’ three times in one go, sometimes over email, WhatsApp messages or letters.

The proposed bill hands out a three-year jail sentence as well as fine, and states that the offence will be cognisable and non-bailable.

“We welcome this, it was much needed.Unlike previous governments, this government cares for rights of Muslim women. Appeal to all parties to ensure passage of this bill in Parliament,” said Shaista Ambar of the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board.

Titled the ‘Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017’, the proposed law also gives a “victim” of Talaq-e-Biddat a right to seek maintenance from her husband before a magistrate’s court. She will also be entitled to her children’s custody, the draft law says.

In August, the top court had struck down the custom as “arbitrary” and “unconstitutional” in a verdict that was hailed as a watershed moment for gender justice in India.

A law ministry official, explaining the rationale behind the bill, said: “Before the judgement this year, there were 177 reported cases of Talaq-e-biddat. Since then, there have been 67. These are only reported cases, the actual figure could be much higher.”

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a non-governmental body that lobbies for the application of Islamic civil laws and opposes any ban on triple talaq, also welcomed the verdict, saying it “accords protection to Muslim personal laws”."

Weapons sales up again worldwide: Arms sales are increasing around the world. The current report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) shows that the main beneficiaries are armaments groups in the US and Western Europe,http://www.dw.com/en/sipri-weapons-sales-up-again-worldwide/a-41735391,"Munitions, tanks, drones: The global trade in arms and military services increased again in 2016, for the first time in five years. It was up 1.9 percent on the previous year — and 38 percent compared to 2002. These new figures are from the latest report on the international arms industry by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). It says that in 2016 the world's 100 biggest armaments groups sold $374.8 billion (€317.7 billion) of weapons and weapons systems.

Read more: Nobel Peace laureates — Nuclear war is 'one tantrum away'

Particularly in the United States, armaments groups are producing and selling more weapons. According to the report, sales from US firms rose 4 percent in 2016, totaling $217.2 billion. This was not only because of the US' own military deployments abroad: The figure was also boosted by the purchase of large weapons systems by other countries. The US group Lockheed Martin — the biggest weapons producer worldwide — did lucrative business selling its new F-35 to countries like Britain, Italy and Norway. Its biggest customer, though, is the United States Air Force.

Read more: 'Killer robots' — autonomous weapons pose moral dilemma

Big American players like Lockheed Martin make up the majority of the top 100 armaments groups researched by SIPRI's experts. Once again, the report clearly shows that the majority of arms come from American companies — a total of 57.9 percent of all global arms sales. Western Europe takes second place in the list of the most important suppliers of arms, followed by Russia with 7.1 percent of arms sales around the world.

Crises benefit the arms trade

The picture is more mixed in the Western European countries. While French and Italian firms are selling fewer arms, German and British groups — despite Brexit — increased their turnover. The German tank manufacturer Krauss-Maffei, for example, and Rheinmetall, which makes military vehicles, profited from the demand for their products in Europe, the Middle East and South-East Asia.

""Nonetheless, it's very difficult to make a direct connection between large arms purchases and ongoing wars. But of course, there are links: There's a greater demand for certain types of weapon — munitions, missiles or ground vehicles, for example,"" says Aude Fleurant, Director of the Arms and Military Expenditure Program at SIPRI. The rise in arms sales around the world is also a response to smoldering conflicts, she adds. ""We observe that in some regions the perceived threat is increasing.""

South Korea is arming itself

South Korea is one example of this. In 2016 South Korean firms reported a huge 20.6 percent increase in arms sales. ""That quite clearly has to do with the security situation in the region,"" Fleurant says. South Korea feels seriously threatened by the nuclear provocations of its neighbor North Korea — and is increasing its military expenditure in response. South Korean arms manufacturers, who mainly sell to their country's defense ministry, are profiting from this.

Read more: Japan to purchase offensive missiles capable of striking North Korea

The SIPRI researchers believe China may also be a top weapons manufacturer. The country does not, however, appear in their statistics, because the experts have no reliable data on the Chinese arms trade. ""But we assume that Chinese armaments groups are among the top 20 biggest companies in the world,"" says Aude Fleurant.

Anti-aircraft missiles can bring down passenger jets, as happened in 2014 with Malaysian Airlines flight 17

Fewer arms sold when the oil price falls

The experts did, however, observe that some of the traditional weapons importers apparently ran out of money in 2016. ""The falling commodity prices for oil and gas have put such a strain on the public finances of many African and South American countries that they bought fewer weapons than planned,"" says SIPRI researcher Fleurant. Russia's armaments groups were also affected by the crisis. Russian arms sales continued to rise, but at a slower rate than in the past. The reasons for this were falling oil and gas prices on the one hand, but also European Union (EU) and US sanctions.

There is no question that wars prompt individual states to procure weapons. When crises threaten, countries spend more money on more modern arms: They buy new warships, fighter jets and tanks, and armaments groups sell more as a result.

But according to SIPRI expert Fleurant, the majority of weapons are sold by arms manufacturers to the defense ministries of their own countries, not abroad. Thus, the new SIPRI report not only provides information about who is selling and buying how many weapons: It also says something about how safe the world as a whole currently feels."
"Bitcoin plunges more than $3,000 after hitting new record",http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/08/investing/bitcoin-latest-price/index.html,"Bitcoin has given investors whiplash yet again.

Just after hitting a new record of more than $17,000, the digital currency plummeted Friday. Its price nosedived more than $3,000, swinging wildly between a high of $17,154 and a low of $13,964, according to tracking site CoinDesk.

Bitcoin has been on a wild ride this year. Its price has soared from less than $1,000 in January -- but with occasional sudden drops along the way.

Trading has become especially frenzied in recent weeks as new investors have dived into the volatile market. Before Friday's fall, it had gained roughly $5,000 in the previous 48 hours.

Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learned

Arthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitmex, said he thought the sharp correction Friday was ""healthy"" given that the digital currency's price had jumped about 80% the past week.

He predicted more sharp moves early next week when the Chicago Board Options Exchange starts allowing investors to trade bitcoin futures.

By Friday evening in Hong Kong, bitcoin was trading at around $15,000.

Bitcoin's extraordinary boom has raised a host of questions. Here are some of the major issues:

How do you buy bitcoin?

One of our reporters used his experience of buying $250 of bitcoin recently to explore what on earth is going on with the digital currency right now.

Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learned

""It's an investing frenzy, plain and simple,"" he wrote.

Is it safe?

The online exchanges where many people trade bitcoin and other digital currencies have a checkered history.

Are you trading Bitcoin? We want to hear from you.

Some have gone bust altogether and others have suffered cyber heists in which hackers have made off with huge sums. The latest example is digital currency site NiceHash, where bitcoins worth more than $70 million were stolen this week.

What does Wall Street make of it?

One factor driving bitcoin's price higher and higher in recent weeks is the expectation that big financial players like hedge funds and asset managers are set to wade into the market. That's been supported by established exchanges in the U.S. saying they're planning to let investors trade bitcoin futures soon.

Related: Big banks say bitcoin futures could be dangerous

But big banks -- who have a complicated relationship with digital currencies -- have issued a warning about the dangers of bitcoin futures, saying the risks haven't been properly studied.

What does the future hold?

An environmental crisis is looming if bitcoin continues on its current trajectory, some experts say. The complex computer algorithms that underpin bitcoin require huge data centers that guzzle power.

Related: Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environment

One observer predicts that without a significant change in how transactions are processed, bitcoin could be consuming enough electricity to power the U.S. by the middle of 2019. Six months later, that demand could equal the entire world's power consumption.

Guant?namo art show rattles US military and could prompt confiscation or destruction,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/08/guantanamo-bay-art-new-york-exhibition,"Works by detainees are making waves at a New York exhibition – but now officials have taken away finished artworks and won’t let them leave the site

When Moath al-Alwi wants to get his mind out of the US detention center in Guantánamo Bay, where he has been held without charge for almost 16 years, he builds model ships.

“A ship expresses rescue,” he told his lawyer during a recent visit. “Noah was able to rescue people and animals on Earth with a ship. That is why I love to build ships.”

One of his ships, Giant – with a hull of cardboard and rigging made out of T-shirt fibers – is currently on display in an exhibition of work by current and former detainees in New York City.



'I can get my soul out of prison': the art made by Guantánamo detainees Read more

But another ship he recently finished was seized by camp officials in response to the exhibition, according his lawyer, Beth Jacob. Its fate is unclear.



After the exhibition opened at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in October, the US Department of Defense announced that it would not only prevent artworks from leaving Guantánamo, but that it would also take inmates’ artwork away from them – and might destroy them.

After finding out that some artworks had been sold, the Pentagon “effectively eliminated transfer of detainee produced artwork from the detention facility”, a spokesman, Maj Ben Sakrisson, told the Guardian via email.

Lawyers for some of the remaining 41 prisoners in Guantánamo say that since the exhibition began, the camp administration has taken away finished artworks from detainees, and that camp officials have not allowed art to exit the facility, which was previously permitted.

This has caused “anguish and concern” among the detainees, some of whom “are manifesting the physical and psychological stress resulting from this new and still-evolving policy”, said Jacob, who has four clients in Guantánamo.

“In prison, you are so deeply connected to your stuff that taking away your artworks is like taking away your children,” said the former detainee Mansoor Adayfi.

While detainees may continue attending weekly art classes, they can only keep a limited number of artworks, which will all be US government property, said Sakrisson.

He did not elaborate on what would happen to removed art, but the Miami Herald reported that artworks may be archived rather than burned.

Jacob said it remained unclear what “archiving” meant and whether the art would ever be seen. “Hiding the artwork is a form of censorship, not far removed from the original statement that it would be destroyed.”

The art program at Guantánamo began in in the later years of George W Bush’s presidency and was promoted by the camp administration. Artworks were given as gifts to lawyers, after being thoroughly checked for secret messages.

Adayfi, who was released in July 2016 after 15 years without charge, remembers that guards would stroll around the cell block admiring how they were decorated.

“Some detainees made their cells beautiful,” he said. “They made trees out of cardboard paper. One detainee would make the most beautiful creations from cardboard and glue. Imagine! We didn’t even have scissors!”

But, he said, policies changed regularly. The most recent change, he said, reminded him of a time in 2013 when guards raided the camp and seized art and other possessions, including family photos and hundreds of handwritten pages of a manuscript he was working on. He never got them back.

“They were targeting our art and destroying it in front of our eyes,” he said. “Those artworks are precious to us because they not only connect you to the world outside – they remind you of who you are. The treatment there was intentionally to suppress your mind and your soul.”

UK - Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn taking aim at tax avoidance in UN speech,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/08/jeremy-corbyn-to-take-aim-at-tax-avoidance-in-speech-at-un,"Jeremy Corbyn will describe “grotesque” levels of inequality and mass tax avoidance as among the most pressing challenges faced by the world, in a speech at the UN in Geneva.

The Labour leader will highlight four main threats faced by humanity: the concentration of wealth and power in a small group, exacerbated by tax avoidance; climate change; the refugee crisis, and what he will call a “bomb first, think later” approach to conflict resolution.

Corbyn will highlight the recent Paradise Papers revelations as evidence of the scale of tax avoidance, according to extracts of Friday’s speech released in advance.



“As the Paradise and Panama Papers have shown, the super-rich and powerful can’t be trusted to regulate themselves,” Corbyn will say.

“Multinational companies must be required to undertake country-by-country reporting, while countries in the global south need support now to keep hold of the billions being stolen from their people.”



A Labour government would actively seek to assist tax authorities in developing countries, as Norway has done in a scheme with Zambia, he will say. Corruption in poorer nations is “a global issue that requires a global response”.

He will add: “When people are kept in poverty while politicians funnel public funds into tax havens, that is corruption, and a Labour government will act decisively on tax havens, introducing strict standards of transparency for crown dependencies and overseas territories, including a public register of owners, directors, major shareholders and beneficial owners for all companies and trusts.”



More generally on the economic system, Corbyn will condemn a system “where a wealthy few control 90% of global resources; of growing insecurity and grotesque levels of inequality within and between nations”.

He will add: “This is a global scandal. The most powerful international corporations must not be allowed to continue to dictate how and for who our world is run.



“Thirty years after structural adjustment programmes first ravaged so much of the world, and a decade after the financial crash of 2008, the neoliberal orthodoxy that delivered them is in crisis.

“This moment – a crisis of confidence in a bankrupt economic system and social order – presents us with a once in a generation opportunity to build a new economic and social consensus which puts the majority in the driving seat.”



Extracts of the speech on climate change call for new policies from the globe’s most-polluting countries, including the UK, including allowing armed forces to devote more resources to tackling humanitarian emergencies, to factor environmental costs into official financial forecasting and to back the Paris climate accord.

Beyond the main points of his speech, Corbyn was due to again outline his vision for a post-Brexit Britain based on high standards, and reject those who hoped to “put rocket boosters under our current economic system’s insecurities and inequalities”.

Corbyn will also accuse the UK government of being complicit in mass rights violations in Yemen, where Saudi-backed forces are fighting a long and bloody civil war against Houthi rebels.

During a stopover in Saudi Arabia last week during a Middle East visit, Theresa May called on the country’s rulers to lift a blockade on Yemen, which aid groups say is contributing to a humanitarian catastrophe that is fast getting even worse.

But Corbyn will say ministers should do more: “Theresa May turns a wilfully blind eye to the flagrant and large-scale human rights abuses now taking place in Yemen, fuelled by arms sales to Saudi Arabia worth billions of pounds.

“Total British government aid to Yemen last year was under £150m, less than the profits made by British arms companies selling weapons to Saudi Arabia. What does that say about our country’s priorities, or our government’s role in the humanitarian disaster now gripping Yemen?

“The weight of international community opinion needs to be brought to bear on those supporting Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, including Theresa May’s government, to meet our legal and moral obligations on arms sales, and to negotiate an urgent ceasefire and settlement of this devastating conflict.”"

"The US Coast Guard is operating floating prisons in the Pacific Ocean, outside US legal protections",https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-11-24/us-coast-guard-operating-floating-prisons-pacific-ocean-outside-us-legal?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=The%20Scan%20%20Nov%2027&utm_content=The%20Scan%20%20Nov%2027+CID_2910d397057a2d2f05ebb8dbe97a5f24&utm_so,"If you've followed the War on Terror at all, you're almost certainly familiar with the US detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba — a US prison that exists outside the realm of the US justice system.

Now, it turns out, there's a secret US detention system in the War on Drugs, too — and this one is aboard US Coast Guard cutters sailing in the Pacific Ocean.

In an effort to stanch the flow of cocaine and other hard drugs from South America to Central America and points north, Coast Guard cutters have been deployed farther and farther from the shore in the Pacific Ocean. When these cutters capture a boat carrying drugs, the smugglers are brought onto the ships and kept shackled to the deck, sometimes outside in the elements, until the Coast Guard makes arrangements for them to be transported back to the US for trial.

But this isn't a wait of just a few hours or days. Often, these waits can last weeks or months, according to new reporting from The New York Times. Coast Guard officials say they can do this because the drug smugglers aren't under arrest until they reach US shores, but some of the worst cases are drawing criticism even from Coast Guard officials.

Seth Freed Wessler reported this story for The Times. He says a combination of US agreements with Latin American countries and the US Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act allows the US to take this action. Wessler spoke with The World's Carol Hills about his reporting and these ""floating Guantánamos"" on the Pacific Ocean.

The Coast Guard usually has a reputation for being the good guys out there — rescuing people, apprehending bad guys. We've done stories about that. I take it it's a little bit more complicated?

It is. The Coast Guard has a broad mission. It does search and rescue, enforces fisheries laws. It enforces drug laws on the oceans and, what few people know, is that the US Coast Guard has actually been deployed in recent years deep into the Pacific Ocean to interdict drug smugglers moving between South America — Colombia, Ecuador — and Central America, where the drugs — often cocaine — are dropped off and then often moved up through Mexico. These Coast Guard ships are deployed deep into the Pacific —sometimes thousands of miles from the nearest US port, where they're detaining suspected smugglers and holding them aboard these Coast Guard cutters. What I found in my reporting is that detainees, men who are moving cocaine in the Pacific Ocean.

You write about some Ecuadorians who are out there transporting drugs and they end up shackled for many, many days on a Coast Guard boat. Give us the quick thumbnail sketch of this one guy, in particular, Jhonny Arcentales, and how he ended up there?

He is a fisherman from a coastal town in Ecuador and was having a particularly, economically, rough year and made a decision to take a job smuggling cocaine off of the coast of Ecuador. He really didn't know all that much about what he was doing.

As he was moving this cocaine on a boat with three other men, another Ecuadorian man and a Colombian man, they were approaching Central America, approaching Guatemala and the US Navy and Coast Guard intercepted that boat and pulled these men off. For the next 70 days, Mr. Arcentales and the other man he was detained with were held — always chained by their ankle to the deck of a ship or to a cable running along one of these large Coast Guard or Navy ships — for 70 days. He was moved from ship to ship as these Coast Guard cutters went about their patrols, picking up more cocaine in the Pacific Ocean.

So this guy, Arcentales, and another guy — they're on a ship. This is a Coast Guard ship and they're basically exposed to the elements and basically shackled and not getting much food. How can the Coast Guard get away with keeping people under those conditions when the men haven't even been charged?

The Coast Guard makes the argument that these people are not formally under arrest until they get to the United States. They're simply being held, while the Coast Guard deals with the logistical challenges of trying to get these men onto shore — into an airplane and flown to Florida, where they'll be prosecuted.

Courts have generally bought the government's argument. The argument by the Coast Guard and by federal prosecutors that these logistical delays are legitimate, as it's hard enough to get people back. The reality is that when the Coast Guard has had to move people more quickly, they do. Very often, detainees are brought to port in one of these cutters, then placed in a hidden room in a helicopter hangar or in a room below deck and hidden there for the day while the Coast Guard cutter refuels or the Coast Guard crew get a bit of a break and then are brought back out to sea.

So there are these delays that people in the Coast Guard — Coast Guard officials I interviewed — though really are actually unreasonable, considering that they're near an airport. Somebody could be put on a plane and brought back to the United States. As we've made this decision to prosecute more and more people, these delays have grown longer and longer.

What we're seeing now is sort of carting people around ... carting suspected drug smugglers around the ocean an average of 18 days — very often longer than that — as the government waits to transport people to courts in Florida.

Now Donald Trump's chief of staff, General John Kelly, he played a key role in expanding the reach of the Coast Guard in this way.

Well, John Kelly was in charge of Southern Command, the Department of Defense area of operation in Latin America that's in charge of managing the drug war in Latin America. He was the head of Southern Command between 2012 and 2016 then retired. Under the Trump administration, he became head of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Coast Guard.

On two occasions he has had a role in these operations. And John Kelly has really been a proponent of the idea. He's called drug smuggling in Central America an existential threat to the United States. And the idea that we need to push our borders outward farther and farther away from our actual borders in order to defend the homeland, that's led to this effort to interdict drugs far, far away from the United States in places where drug smugglers actually really have very little idea where their drugs are headed. So, Johnny Arcentales and the other men that I've spoken to know, they're not thinking about where these drugs are going. The drugs are moving from South America to Central America as far as they're concerned. It's out of their control after that, but we're arresting people in international waters, often on foreign boats, thousands of miles from the United States.

So the Coast Guard is arresting these people in these boats and it's not clear whether the drugs on these boats are going to the US?

Ultimately, most of the cocaine on these smugglers' small boats is probably headed for the United States. But some of it may be going to other markets, to European markets, to Australian markets or elsewhere. It's not always clear that the drugs are coming here and, in fact, the circuit court in California has said that the US can't prosecute these cases unless they can prove that the drugs were headed to the United States — that they actually intended to to show up there. And that's one of the reasons why federal prosecutors prefer to bring these cases to Florida, where that burden of proof is not required.

Whatever happened to Johnny Arcentales? How many days was he out there on this ship?

He was picked up in September of 2014. And for the next 70 days, he was held aboard a series of Coast Guard cutters and Navy frigates as he was moved around the Pacific Ocean. He describes the experience of feeling like he really might disappear.

He didn't know that he was going to be brought to the United States, wasn't being allowed to call his family — wondering, ""does my family think I died?"" He was ultimately brought to shore in Central America and told ""you're going to be handed over to the Drug Enforcement Administration now"" and brought to the United States to face prosecution after more than two months held aboard these ships.

He was brought to the United States, charged criminally under drug trafficking laws and was sentenced to 10 years to a decade in federal prison. He's now in a federal prison in New Jersey.

The community he comes from on the central coast of Ecuador, many men have left on these smuggling trips. More than a year ago, there was a major earthquake in Ecuador that left families in dire economic straits. Since then, there have been more and more people leaving. In fact, his son-in-law decided not long after that earthquake to take one of these jobs and left home. He didn't tell anyone and disappeared. Days later, was picked up by the Coast Guard. He was also sentenced to a decade in US federal prison.

The question about the legality of the US Coast Guard's detention practices has not been raised, in an international context, in criminal courts. In the United States, when defense attorneys have tried to argue that the conditions amount to inhumane treatment, some cases judges have agreed. But they've said there's nothing we can really do about it. The law does not allow for us to throw this case out.

What about the shame factor?

This is a practice of detention that until now hasn't really been known.

I wrote to dozens of men and received letters back from many of these men who'd been detained on these Coast Guard ships, describing the conditions of their confinement. Describing what sounded to me like real terror for them on the high seas. Those are stories that hadn't been told before.

Are they allowed to use a proper bathroom?

No the bathrooms on these boats are very different, ship to ship. They're provided essentially buckets to use as toilets on some of the boats. And these men are then required to clean out the buckets themselves and dump them off the edge of the ship. They describe that as a really terrible disgusting process. And the Coast Guard says ""our ships aren't equipped as detention centers. We don't have facilities here. This is what we've got.""

In fact, I spoke to Coast Guard commanders who are really uncomfortable about the conditions on their ship — and uncomfortable about the amount of time people are held.

I have evidence of people being held for upwards of 70 days. A Coast Guard official told me people have been held for 90 days. But the Coast Guard has no clear rules about how long they can hold people.

When you talk to Coast Guard officials and ask them about these things that you've researched and found out, what do they say? Are they proud of this or are they a little bit wary of what's going on?

Many of the Coast Guard officials that I talked to were really uncomfortable about the detention conditions and the amount of time that people were being held during their detention. I really felt that officials thought people need to be moved off the boats more quickly and, again, are uncomfortable about the conditions that they have to hold people in.

Have you talked with the families?

Yes. Many families, in fact, believe that their loved ones — husbands, fathers, sons — had disappeared. It's not unheard of for fishermen to disappear in the sea.

For these fishermen, the ocean is the geography of their life. And so when I talked to Arcentales, for example, about the sea, he said to me ""the ocean used to be a place that for me represented freedom. But now it's like a prison in the open ocean.""

And all of these men say ""we understand that we've broken laws. We understand that we made these decisions. We understand that we're going to be punished for this."" The question that they raise is ""how are we in the United States right now?"""
Zimbabwe activists fear post-Mugabe human rights crackdown.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/zimbabwe-activists-fear-post-mugabe-human-rights-crackdown-mnangagwa,"Concerns grow over track record of new president Mnangagwa, who has been accused of involvement in 1980s killings

Activists and human rights campaigners in Zimbabwe fear a new crackdown that could roll back gains made during the eight-day crisis that culminated in the resignation of President Robert Mugabe last week.

Relatives of victims of state-sponsored violence said they were concerned about the track record of the new leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was Mugabe’s righthand man and is blamed for the brutal suppression of political opposition parties during elections in 2008.

Profile Who is Emmerson Mnangagwa? Show Hide Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in as president of Zimbabwe on 24 November, capping a dramatic few weeks that began when he was sacked as vice-president by Robert Mugabe on 6 November. Mnangagwa, a 75-year-old former intelligence chief, had been locked in a battle with the first lady, Grace Mugabe, to succeed her husband as president. His sacking – an attempt to clear Grace's path to power - was a tactical error that triggered a military takeover, Mugabe's impeachment by parliament, and his resignation. Mnangagwa has strong support within the security establishment and among veterans of Zimbabwe’s 1970s guerrilla war, when he earned the nickname “the crocodile”.

Despite allegations about his role in atrocities in the 1980s, much of the international community had long seen him as being the most likely figure in Zimbabwe to guarantee a stable transition and implement economic reforms. Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP

“Just because [Mnangagwa] has wrestled power from the devil does not mean I see him as the messiah,” said Patson Dzamara, whose activist brother Itai was abducted in 2015 and has not been heard of since.

“So many have been killed, maimed, tortured or imprisoned, and the ones who are presiding over this transition are the ones responsible.” he added.

Mugabe, whose 37-year rule over the impoverished southern African country was marked by brutal repression, stepped down after a military takeover led to mass protests and impeachment proceedings in parliament.

In his inauguration speech in a packed national stadium in Harare on Friday, Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old stalwart of the ruling Zanu-PF party, said he would govern for all “patriotic Zimbabweans” and promised elections would be held as scheduled next year.

He did not mention lifting restrictions on freedom of expression, or any measures to weaken the grip of the feared internal security services he helped set up following Zimbabwe’s independence from white-minority rule in 1980.

The new president was minister of justice when Itai Dzamara was pushed into a vehicle by unknown men, and has been accused of involvement in the killings of more than 20,000 civilians in the south of Zimbabwe in the 1980s.

Mnangagwa denies any responsibility, saying he was head of internal security at the time and not in the military, which carried out the massacres.

In his inauguration speech, he called on Zimbabweans to “let bygones be bygones”.

There are concerns that Mnangagwa, despite describing Zimbabwe as an “unfolding democracy”, may prove as intolerant of protest as his predecessor.

On Monday, a high court judgment is expected on subversion charges brought against Magamba, an award-winning satirical online network, social media activist centre and creative hub raided by police hours before the military takeover 13 days ago. Laptop and desktop computers confiscated by police have yet to be returned.

“How they deal with this [case] is a litmus test for the new government. It will be a signal to any activist who uses social media … about what you can and can’t say in this supposedly new Zimbabwe,” said Samm Farai Monro, Zimbabwe’s best-known political satirist, comedian and creative director of Magamba.

The network had repeatedly incurred the wrath of authorities with an irreverent and immensely popular weekly show.

The raid came after attempts by authorities to close its offices in Harare for alleged planning permission infringements failed. Martha O’Donovan, a US citizen who was an activist working with the network, was arrested last month on charges of subversion and undermining the authority of the president and will appear again in court in two weeks.

The fall of Mugabe, 93, was triggered by a factional battle within the ruling party over his succession. Within days of the military takeover, thousands of ordinary people were on the streets, waving placards and chanting slogans against the ageing autocrat in scenes unthinkable under his rule. In one massive protest more than 100,000 people marched through Harare.

“The military turned on the tap to allow a one-off big demonstration but the citizens’ momentum has to stay on. We are fighting not just to keep that space open but to radically expand that space that we need as citizens to make the new Zimbabwe a free country,” Monro, 37, said.

Human rights activists in Harare say that more than 400 people have been detained since the military took power. These include hundreds of security officials loyal to Mugabe, as well as former finance minister Ignatius Chombo. Only a handful have been charged with any offence.

Chombo appeared in court on Saturday in leg irons to face corruption charges after more than week in military custody.

The whereabouts of several other prominent supporters of Grace Mugabe, the former president’s 52-year-old wife, are unknown. It was the first lady’s bid to cement her hold on power through the sacking of Mnangagwa on 6 November that led to her husband’s fall.

The sudden events pose creative challenges to activists and satirists, too. “Now that Bob [Mugabe] is gone we have to work tirelessly on new Emmerson [Mnangagwa] jokes but they’ll definitely be coming very soon in the next show,” said Monro."
Irish warn Theresa May: change course or risk Brexit chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/25/phil-hogan-ireland-eu-commissioner-brexit-chaos,"Ireland’s European commissioner has urged Theresa May to change her Brexit plans dramatically to prevent a mounting crisis over the Irish border from derailing her hopes of an EU trade deal.

The threat of a hard Irish border has emerged as the major obstacle to the prime minister’s aim of securing the green light for Brexit trade talks at a crucial summit only weeks away. She has effectively been handed just days to give stronger guarantees over the issue.

Phil Hogan, the EU’s agriculture commissioner, told the Observer that it was a “very simple fact” that remaining inside the single market and customs union, or allowing Northern Ireland to do so, would end the standoff.

Hogan warned there was “blind faith” from some UK ministers that Britain would secure a comprehensive Brexit free trade deal. He warned that Ireland would “continue to play tough to the end” over its threat to veto trade talks until it had guarantees over the border.

“If the UK or Northern Ireland remained in the EU customs union, or better still the single market, there would be no border issue,” he said. “That’s a very simple fact. I continue to be amazed at the blind faith that some in London place in theoretical future free trade agreements. First, the best possible FTA with the EU will fall far short of the benefits of being in the single market. This fact is simply not understood in the UK. Most real costs to cross-border business today are not tariffs – they are about standards, about customs procedures, about red tape. These are solved by the single market, but not in an FTA.”

The Irish government wants a written guarantee that there will be no hard border with Northern Ireland, something Dublin believes can only be achieved, in effect, by keeping the region within the single market and customs union. However, the Democratic Unionist party, whose support is propping up May’s government, warned on Saturday it would never accept a post-Brexit deal that would effectively see a customs border pushed back to the Irish Sea. May has repeatedly made clear Britain will leave the single market and customs union.

The Irish crisis came as Britain’s former EU ambassador, Sir Ivan Rogers, warned May’s Brexit strategy was “an accident waiting to happen”. Speaking after a speech at Hertford College, Oxford, he said completing the Brexit process was “guaranteed” to take a decade. He said that the prime minister’s unrealistic hopes of securing a bespoke trade deal meant a car crash in the next few months was “quite likely”.

“The internal market is an extraordinarily complex international law construct that simply doesn’t work in a way that permits the type of options that the current government is pushing for,” he said. “So there is an accident waiting to happen ... and it is going to happen because the other side is going to put on a table a deal which looks broadly like a Canada or a Korea deal.

“The only safe way to leave without enormous turbulence and trouble over a lengthy transitional period is to have a reasonable slope ... take your time and try and go for as smooth a glide path as possible from here to the mid-2020s. I can guarantee you that this is going to take a decade to do. We will not have reached a new equilibrium in British economics and politics until 2030.”

Hogan warned Britain may struggle to keep the 59 trade deals it now has through the EU on the same terms. “The UK would be running to stand still,” he said. “When it comes to trying to negotiate new FTAs with the rest of the world, Britain will be pushed around the way the EU – with currently more than eight times the UK population – will never be.

“The US have already started their attack on standards, so chlorine chicken and hormone beef for the British Sunday roast post-Brexit? India will insist on visas that the UK can never give. Australia and New Zealand are a long way away and of very limited economic interest. And any deal with China will be a one-way street in terms of costs and benefits for the UK.”

Ministers are under mounting pressure to come clean over the extent of economic damage that a “no deal” outcome could cause to the economy. In the budget, Philip Hammond announced that the Office for Budget Responsibility revised downwards forecasts for UK growth over the next few years, mainly because of concerns of low productivity growth. But the OBR made clear that these downgrades were premised on a benign outcome to Brexit negotiations. Both the Treasury, privately, and leading independent economists recognise that actual growth will be considerably lower than the gloomy budget projections if the UK does not achieve most of its negotiating goals, or if there is a “no deal” result.

Government sources said ministers would this week release sections of assessments into the potential economic impact of Brexit carried out across Whitehall, which until recently they had tried to keep secret.

Many MPs believe the published sections will be heavily redacted and will not make clear the extent of potential economic damage. Last night Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, said it was essential that as many projections as possible were made public.

The latest work by economists at the London School of Economics estimates that, if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal, the impact will be far more severe than the projections in the budget suggested. Thomas Sampson of the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance said Brexit could reduce UK living standards by up to 9% in the most pessimistic case."

"Drilling Reawakens Sleeping Faults in Texas, Leads to Earthquakes",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/drilling-reawakens-sleeping-faults-in-texas-leads-to-earthquakes/,"Since 2008, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and a handful of other states have experienced unprecedented surges of earthquakes. Oklahoma’s rate increased from one or two per year to more than 800. Texas has seen a sixfold spike. Most have been small, but Oklahoma has seen several damaging quakes stronger than magnitude 5. While most scientists agree that the surge has been triggered by the injection of wastewater from oil and gas production into deep wells, some have suggested these quakes are natural, arising from faults in the crust that move on their own every so often. Now researchers have traced 450 million years of fault history in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and learned these faults almost never move. “There hasn’t been activity along these faults for 300 million years,” says Beatrice Magnani, a seismologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and lead author of a paper describing the research, published today in Science Advances. “Geologically, we usually define these faults as dead.”

Magnani and her colleagues argue that these faults would not have produced the recent earthquakes if not for wastewater injection. Pressure from these injections propagates underground and can disturb weak faults. The work is another piece of evidence implicating drilling in the quakes, yet the Texas government has not officially accepted the link to one of its most lucrative industries.

Magnani and her colleagues studied the Texas faults using images of the subsurface similar to ultrasound scans. Known as seismic reflection data, the images are created by equipment that generates sound waves and records the speeds at which the waves bounce off faults and different rock layers deep within the ground. Faults that have produced earthquakes look like vertical cracks in a brick wall, where one side of the wall has sunk down a few inches so the rows of bricks no longer line up. Scientists know the age of each rock layer—each row of bricks--based on previous studies that have used a variety of dating techniques.

The seismologists compared images of faults in north Texas with images of other faults that have been active throughout geologic history. These active cracks are in the New Madrid Seismic Zone that encompasses parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee along the Mississippi River. New Madrid-area faults produced earthquakes as large as 7 or 8-magnitude in the early 1800s and have produced smaller quakes since then.

When Magnani and her colleagues examined the New Madrid faults, they saw evidence of earthquakes—the horizontal rows of bricks were offset at the fault line--from the distant past into the present. But images of the north Texas faults showed zero disturbances in the last 300 million years.

The scientists then took another step to refine their results. Their seismic reflection data cannot pick up vertical offsets smaller than 15 meters, or about 49 feet. Yet the recent north Texas earthquakes were so small they caused offsets of just a fraction of a centimeter. The seismologists wanted to be sure these faults had not been producing this kind of tiny earthquake all along. They were able to do this because the offsets representing rock moved by quakes are cumulative: each new quake adds more distance. The researchers took the 300-million-year time span and calculated the maximum number of small to medium sized quakes it would take to produce a cumulative offset just shy of 15 meters. That fell into the range of 3,800 to 6,000 earthquakes – or, roughly, an earthquake every 50,000 to 79,000 years. Even if temblors occurred that frequently, the probability of a natural earthquake sequence occurring in north Texas in the previous 10 years was only one in 6,000 and the probability of two sequences was one in 60 million. Since north Texas has had five earthquake sequences during that 10-year span, the scientists write that it is “exceedingly unlikely” that the recent quakes were natural.

Mark Zoback, an expert on induced seismicity at Stanford University, says he agrees with the paper’s conclusions that the recent Texas quakes are likely tied to oil and gas production. But he would not describe the faults as completely dormant. A fault that produces earthquakes every 60,000 years is still an active fault, just one that ruptures very rarely, Zoback says. He also notes that the energy released in an induced earthquake comes from the earth – the result of tectonic stresses building up at the fault over geologic time – and not from the wastewater injections themselves. “The injections can’t put energy into the ground,” said Zoback. “The energy has to be there already and the injection just triggers its release.”"
"Desperate for electricity, Puerto Rico children's hospital goes solar",http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/puerto-rico-childrens-hospital-solar-power-tesla-1.3443985,"Puerto Rico is slowly rebuilding its electrical grid and the generating stations damaged by hurricane Maria, but for some residents the sun holds the best promise of restoring light.

And a hospital parking lot in San Juan covered in hundreds of solar panels has become a test area.

""There are a little bit under 800 solar panels,"" says Juliana Canino, who runs the Hospital del Niño.

There are nearly 800 solar panels set up in the Hospital del Nino's parking lot to power the facility's microgrid. (Jennifer Barr/CBC) The nonprofit hospital is the only rehabilitation facility for children in Puerto Rico. It's involved in one of the first alternative-energy experiments of its kind on the island, an agreement between the government and Tesla, the company best-known for electric cars.

The hospital's microgrid is an alternative to the regular public grid. Microgrids are self-contained power systems with enough capacity to run a small neighbourhood or a large facility.

Canino expertly steps between the rows of panels as she gives a tour. ""They were assembled and tested in eight days, and on a sunny day we can produce up to 250 kilowatts of energy.""

That's enough electricity to power the hospital for about 20 hours a day. It relies on its generators for the rest.

""It gives us the opportunity to continue our services,"" says Canino. ""We have 35 patients with chronic and physical and mental conditions, and they need skilled nursing services 24 hours a day seven days a week.""

Decimated grid

The island's systems for generating and distributing electricity, already crippled due to years of neglect, were decimated when hurricane Maria plunged all of Puerto Rico into darkness two months ago.

The storm destroyed the public grid, and most of the island remains without electricity. Service — where it exists at all — is spotty.

Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has pledged to restore power to 95 per cent of the island's residents by mid-December.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is less optimistic, saying it expects to reach just 75 per cent by the end of January.

Microgrid

Hospital del Nino staff and workers from Tesla celebrate the installation of the solar-powered microgrid. (Tesla) Until late last month when Tesla came forward, the Hospital del Niño was forced to run its generators non-stop to keep critical medical equipment going. The generators are expensive to run, and there's the constant risk of mechanical failure.

""Generators are not built to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for 50 days,"" says Canino.

""We only had one generator working at the time of the hurricane, and it was after two weeks we were able to put the second generator to work. So definitely we were scared that the first generator was going to break.""

Then the call offering help came, and Canino says it was like winning the jackpot.

Tesla said it would lend the hospital a solar microgrid as part of a humanitarian aid initiative in Puerto Rico. The hospital can use it until the local electrical system is fixed.

""I actually felt a little bit skeptical at the beginning, but then when I saw them working I was very relieved,"" Canino says. ""Definitely, it's less of a burden for us not to use diesel [generators] all the time.""

Dr. Elizabeth Pagan, the medical director at the Hospital del Nino in San Juan, says reliable electricity is ""critical"" to the care of many of the facility's patients. (Jennifer Barr/CBC) Tesla is one of several companies intent on transforming Puerto Rico's power grid by offering things like panels and batteries to the devastated island. Only 3 per cent of the island's power is solar-generated now, but that could change as Puerto Rico rebuilds its infrastructure.

Government officials are evaluating options that focus on microgrids for individual facilities, as well as larger regional grids that use solar and other renewable sources.

The Hospital del Niño was chosen as a microgrid test case because of its importance to the community and its need for reliable power. More than 3,000 children from around the island come for services like speech and occupational therapy, as well as psychological services. It's also basically a medical orphanage — the kids here are under children's aid and many will likely grow up in the facility.

""We have patients with many critical, chronic, severe conditions,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Pagan, the medical director.

""We have patients that have respiratory conditions that need frequent respiratory therapies. We have patients that need ventilatory support for sleep during the night. We have patients with cardiac conditions ... we have patients, they need equipment for them to be fed during the day. [Electricity] was critical.""

The microgrid cost about $1 million US to set up. (Jennifer Barr/CBC) The CBC News team experienced the hospital's need for a reliable source of energy first-hand when, on a visit, the elevator suddenly stopped and the lights went off. During the hours when the hospital wasn't operating on the solar system there was an island-wide blackout and the breaker for the hospital's generator tripped as well, underlining how fragile both systems are.

The system of panels and batteries in the hospital's microgrid cost about $1 million US. With the local power situation so precarious, the hospital is launching a fundraising campaign aimed at keeping the solar setup permanently.

""I don't want to go back to the grid,"" says Canino, gesturing to the batteries that store the hospital's solar-generated power. ""This is my future now."""
Iran vows to send warships to Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean soon,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-promises-send-warships-gulf-mexico-atlantic-ocean-n823596,"LONDON — Iran's new naval commander has vowed to send warships to America's backyard.

Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi said plans were being drawn up for vessels to be deployed to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean ""in the near future."" They would also visit South American countries, he added.

Tehran has long complained about U.S. ships being based in the Persian Gulf.

Speaking at his first press conference since being appointed, Khanzadi promised his navy would ""wave the flag of our country in the Gulf of Mexico.""

He pointed out that ""the appearance of our vessels in the Mediterranean and Suez Canal shocked the world and the U.S. also made comments on it.""

It isn't the first time Iran's military has pledged its ships would enter the Gulf of Mexico.

Khanzadi’s predecessor Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari said in 2014 that Iran planned to send vessels close to American maritime borders as a counter to the U.S. Navy’s presence in the Persian Gulf.

Sayyari later said the manoeuvers had been canceled “due to a change in schedule.”

Thousands of American troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which border Iran.

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet is based across the Persian Gulf in Bahrain, while neighboring Qatar is home to 10,000 American troops.

President Donald Trump has branded Iran's government a ""murderous regime"" and warned of its ""sinister vision for the future."" He also has accused the Islamic republic of spreading ""death, destruction and chaos around the globe.""

In August, the Pentagon said there had been 14 ""unsafe"" and/or ""unprofessional"" encounters between the U.S. and Iranian militaries during 2017.

In July, a U.S. Navy patrol boat fired two warning shots toward an Iranian craft that approached it at high speed during what American officials said were routine exercises in the Persian Gulf."
'Butcher of Bosnia' Ratko Mladic found guilty of genocide and war crimes,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/butcher-bosnia-ratko-mladic-guilty-genocide-war-crimes-n823206,"LONDON — Ratko Mladic, the so-called Butcher of Bosnia, was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday after being found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, acts that included Europe's deadliest massacre since World War II.

A United Nations court found that the former general had ""significantly contributed"" to some of the worst atrocities during the 1992-95 Bosnian War, in which some 100,000 people were killed and 2 million were forced to flee their homes.

His crimes ""rank among the most heinous known to humankind,"" Judge told the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the U.N. court based in the Netherlands.

Following the verdict, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called Mladic the ""epitome of evil.""

The defense team called the verdict ""erroneous"" and said they planned to appeal it.

Mladic, a Bosnian Serb, is seen by many as the embodiment of the horrors visited upon Croats and Muslim Bosniaks during ethnic violence that engulfed the region after the breakup of communist Yugoslavia.

He was found guilty of all but one of the 11 charges against him — including genocide, persecution and terror. He was found not guilty of one of two genocide charges.

Mladic, who denies the allegations and says he was only defending his people, was not in court to hear his fate. In a moment of drama before the verdict, he had to be removed by two guards after standing up and shouting in the direction of Judge Orie.

The judge had declined a request by Mladic's defense to halt or shorten the proceedings because of his high blood pressure. Mladic has had several strokes.

The most infamous crimes from a lengthy charge sheet were the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, in which some 8,000 men and boys were killed, as well as the three-year siege of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.

Ramiz Ahmetovic, 61, whose parents and sister were all killed by Mladic's forces, told NBC News that the former military chief deserved to spend the rest of his days in prison.

""This sentence was the only right sentence and will bring satisfaction to the victims. Any other would be injustice,"" said Ahmetovic who lives in Brcko, a town on the Bosnian-Croatian border. ""It also blames other people, soldiers under his command who committed war crimes. I am against all the war crimes, no matter which army committed them in the war we had.""

One of the victims in Sarajevo was Fikret Grabovica's 11-year-old daughter, who was playing with friends in March 1993 when a bomb struck close to the family home.

""During heavy artillery shelling, we kept our children in basements so they would be safe,"" Grabovica told NBC News. ""But, you know the children, after a day or just couple of hours of artillery silence, they want to go out to play.""

""Suddenly, shelling started and one missile hit very close,"" said Grabovica, who is now chairman of a nongovernmental organization called Parents of the Children Killed in Sarajevo. ""One of the pieces of shrapnel hit her and she bled out. She was dead.""

Although reviled by many, Mladic remains a hero to some Bosnian Serbs.

In his native Bosnian village of Bozinovici, the main street is named after Mladic and almost every house cherishes at least one photo of him, according to The Associated Press. T-shirts with his wartime portrait and the inscription ""Serbian Hero"" are sold on the streets of Serbian towns.

These divisions were apparent before Wednesday's hearing when a scuffle broke out between a young man carrying a Serbian flag and a group of Bosniaks awaiting the verdict, the A.P. reported.

The man, who said he came to support Mladic, shouted: ""Do not touch my flag."" A Bosnian woman told him to stop provoking victims, adding that it ""is sad that the villains still glorify genocide and aggression,"" the news agency said.

""Mladic has his supporters, particularly among those who he commanded during the war,"" according to Kenneth Morrison, professor of modern southeast European history at De Montfort University in Leicester, England. These people he said, ""still regard Mladic as a hero and as their defender and protector, while non-Serbs in Bosnia regard him as a war criminal, and will continue to do so regardless of the sentence he receives.""

Mladic was arrested in 2011 after being on the run for 16 years. His trial has lasted five years, and included almost 10,000 pieces of evidence and hundreds of witnesses.

The same court found Radovan Karadzic, the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs, guilty of war crimes last year, sentencing him to 40 years in prison.

According to Neven Andjelic, a senior lecturer in international relations and human rights at Regent's University London, the verdict is significant because of what it tells other would-be perpetrators of war crimes.

""It is even more important for a 'closure' in the future for conflicts in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere,"" he said. ""Where is crime there will be punishment. This is the most important message.""

FCC prepares to unveil plant to gut net neutrality.,https://www.wired.com/story/fcc-prepares-to-unveil-plan-to-gut-net-neutrality/,"The Federal Communications Commission will publish on Wednesday its plan to reverse Obama-era net neutrality rules that banned internet service providers from blocking or slowing down content, or creating so-called ""fast lanes"" for companies willing to pay extra to deliver their content more quickly.

The new FCC order will throw out almost all of the agency's 2015 net-neutrality rules, including the prohibitions on blocking and throttling content, senior FCC staff said during a conference call with reporters Tuesday. The order will also ban states from imposing their own net-neutrality rules to replace the federal regulations.

The order also reverses the decision to classify both mobile and home broadband internet services as ""common carriers"" like telephone services. That change will allow the Federal Trade Commission to enforce antitrust laws against broadband providers should they engage in anticompetitive behavior. The order will also require broadband providers to publicly disclose if they block or slow content, or accept payments from companies for preferential treatment.

""Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,"" FCC chair Ajit Pai said in a statement Tuesday. ""Instead, the FCC would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.""

The FCC's two Democratic members blasted the proposal. ""Following actions earlier this year to erase consumer privacy protections, the Commission now wants to wipe out court-tested rules and a decade’s work in order to favor cable and telephone companies,"" Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement. ""This is ridiculous and offensive to the millions of Americans who use the Internet every day.""

But the GOP has a majority on the commission. Barring a last-minute change of heart by one of the three Republican commissioners, the order will likely be approved during the agency's next open meeting on December 14.

Jettisoning net-neutrality rules would make it easier for companies like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon to give their own streaming video services priority over others, such as Amazon Prime or Netflix. It could also make it easier for companies to impede voice and messaging tools like Skype and WhatsApp.

Of course, well-established services from deep-pocketed companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft will likely remain widely available. But net-neutrality advocates argue that smaller companies that don’t have the money to pay for fast lanes could suffer. In other words, protecting net neutrality isn't about saving Netflix but about saving the next Netflix.

Previous FCCs have largely agreed. The agency first moved to protect net neutrality in a 2005 policy statement declaring that internet users had a right to access the content and services of their choosing. Under that policy, the FCC in 2008 ordered Comcast to stop slowing BitTorrent connections; the cable giant challenged the ruling, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority, and won. The Obama-era FCC passed a more robust set of rules in 2010, but those were struck down in 2014 following a lawsuit filed by Verizon.

Under then chair Tom Wheeler, the FCC then decided that the best way to ensure its authority to enforce net-neutrality rules was to reclassify broadband internet providers as common carriers.

Despite broad support for net neutrality among both Democratic and Republican voters, Republican politicians rallied against Wheeler's net-neutrality rules before they even passed. US senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called net neutrality ""Obamacare for the internet,"" and Donald Trump warned, nonsensically, that it would ""target conservative media."" The FCC ultimately passed the rules along a party-line vote.

Narrowing the rules

Pai has narrowed the scope of the rules since taking over as chair in January. In February, for example, he ended an investigation into whether AT&T and Verizon used data limits for anticompetitive purposes, effectively ruling that the two companies could exempt their own video services from customers' data caps but still charge for data used by their competitors’ services."
NZ study first in world to find common herbicides cause antibiotic resistance,https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/nz-study-first-in-world-find-common-herbicides-cause-antibiotic-resistance,"The active ingredients in a list of commonly used herbicides, including Roundup used by most New Zealand local governments for weed control, has been shown to cause antibiotic resistance, a world-first Kiwi study has found.

Source: 1 NEWS

New University of Canterbury research has confirmed the active ingredients in RoundUp, Kamba and 2,4-D (glyphosate, dicamba and 2,4-D, respectively) can cause bacteria to alter how susceptible they are to antibiotics.

University of Canterbury molecular biology and genetics Professor Jack Heinemann said the herbicides studied are three of the most commonly used in the world, including New Zealand.

""They are among the most common manufactured chemical products to which people, pets and livestock in both rural and urban environments are exposed,"" Professor Heinemann said.

""These products are sold in the local hardware store and may be used without training, and there are no controls that prevent children and pets from being exposed in home gardens or parks.

""Despite their ubiquitous use, this University of Canterbury research is the first in the world to demonstrate that herbicides may be undermining the use of a fundamental medicine-antibiotics.""

The new paper led by University of Canterbury researchers also found ingredients that are regularly used in some herbicide formulations, and processed foods, also cause antibiotic resistance.

""More emphasis needs to be placed on antibiotic stewardship compared to new antibiotic discovery. Otherwise, new drugs will fail rapidly and be lost to humanity,"" Professor Heinemann said.

Professor Heinemann says antibiotic resistance has caused nearly a million additional deaths worldwide from infectious diseases.

""The United States, for example, estimates that more than two million people are sickened every year with antibiotic-resistant infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result."

World's cheapest electricity is Mexican solar power,https://inhabitat.com/worlds-cheapest-solar-power-is-generated-in-mexico/,"Mexico is on track to generate the world’s cheapest solar power — with prices as low as 1.77¢/kWh, according to Mexico’s Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (Cenace). Mexico’s Department of Energy recently announced the companies selected to complete new renewable power projects, and the rates at which this electricity will be sold. The lowest price for solar in Mexico has been set just below that of Saudi Arabia at 1.77¢/kWh, and is expected to continue to decrease to 1¢/kWh in 2019 or sooner. In this most recent bidding round, 15 bids from eight solar and wind energy companies, including Canadian Solar, ENEL Green Power, and Mitsui, were approved in a sign that Mexico’s renewable surge is not slowing down.

The clean energy projects recently approved by Mexico will be online and selling power by 2020. These projects and others are important steps towards meeting Mexico’s goals under the Paris agreement as well as regional goals established by Mexico, the United States, and Canada. In 2016, all three countries pledged to source 50 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2025. Canada is on track to meet this goal while Mexico continues to build up its renewable portfolio. As it was when the regional pledge was made, the United States still lags behind in its transition to clean energy.

Mexico’s achievement of cheap solar energy exceeds the expectations of skeptics who believed that such a price in a country like Mexico, rather than one like wealthy Saudi Arabia, would be highly unlikely. Despite its economic challenges, Mexico is proving that affordable renewable energy is possible around the world, brightening the prospects of the Paris agreement even as the United States refuses to participate. If current trends continue, the world may soon be faced with the prospect of plentiful, clean, affordable energy, the possibilities for which are endless.

The Lebanese Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Bechara Boutros Al Rai is in Saudi Arabia for a historic visit. It’s the first time that the kingdom invites a church leader, unlike Christian politicians who visit the kingdom often. The patriarch met the King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and the Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. He also met with the Prime Minister Saad Hariri who said that he would return to Lebanon within days. The kingdom intends to restore a 900-year-old church in Saudi Arabia. It will be a symbolic gift to the Lebanese Maronite Patriarch and the symbol of the beginning of the Christian-Islamic dialogue. This visit has an important significance since Saudi Arabia vowed to be open to other faiths. The Crown Prince is aiming at moderating Islam and making Saudi Arabia a country open to all religions and cultures."

From the Everglades in the US to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, climate change is destroying the many of the greatest wonders of the natural world.



A new report on Monday from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reveals that the number of natural world heritage sites being damaged and at risk from global warming has almost doubled to 62 in the past three years.

Those at high risk include iconic places from the Galapagos Islands to the central Amazon and less well known but equally vibrant and unique sites such as the karst caves of Hungary and Slovakia and the monarch butterfly reserves in Mexico.

Coral reefs are particularly badly affected by rising ocean temperatures, from the Seychelles to Belize, where the northern hemisphere’s biggest reef is situated. Global heating is also causing mountain glaciers to rapidly shrink, from Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to the Rocky Mountains in Canada and the Swiss Alps Jungfrau-Aletsch – home to the largest Alpine glacier.

Other ecosystems being damaged are wetlands, such as the Everglades, where sea level is rising as the ocean warms and salt water is intruding. In the Sundarbans mangrove forest on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal, two islands have already been submerged and a dozen more are threatened. Fiercer storms are also increasing the risk of devastation.

Rising numbers of wildfires are damaging the beautiful Fynbos flowerscapes in the Cape region of South Africa and the Monarch butterfly site in Mexico. Elsewhere, warming is melting the permafrost in the newly declared Qinghai Hoh Xil heritage site, which is at 4,500m altitude in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.



Australia is especially exposed as it has 10 natural heritage sites where climate change damage is rated as high or very high risk, from its Gondwana rainforests to Shark Bay in western Australia and islands such as Fraser and Macquarie.

The new IUCN report was launched at the UN climate summit being held in Bonn, Germany, where the world’s nations are working to put the 2015 landmark Paris agreement into operation.

“Protection of world heritage sites is an international responsibility of the same governments that have signed up to the Paris agreement,” said Inger Andersen, IUCN director general. “This report sends them a clear message: climate change acts fast and is not sparing the finest treasures of our planet. This underlines the need for urgent and ambitious national commitments and actions to implement the Paris agreement.”

Climate change is one of a range of factors that mean about a third of the world’s 241 natural heritage sites are being damaged, with invasive alien species being the top threat. Then, after global warming, comes unsustainable tourism, followed by other problems like poaching and construction.

Prince Charles, the UK’s heir to the throne and longtime environmentalist, said: “Climate change is in actual fact becoming regarded as the fastest growing threat, its impacts already visible in many of the sites. This report highlights the incredibly urgent need to expedite the global response to climate change.” A further 55 sites around the world are expected to be harmed by climate change in the future unless warming is curbed.

“Natural world heritage sites also play a crucial role supporting local economies and livelihoods,” said Tim Badman, director of IUCN’s World Heritage Programme. “Their destruction can thus have devastating consequences that go beyond their exceptional beauty and natural value. In Peru’s Huascarán national park, for example, melting glaciers affect [people’s] water supplies.”

The report does include some success stories, showing that the destruction of nature’s most precious sites can be tackled. In Ivory Coast’s Comoé national park, for example, elephant and chimpanzee populations have recovered thanks to better management and international support after the end of conflicts.

But overall, the number of sites with good status has fallen, leaving Andersen to ask: “If we cannot secure the highest quality protection for the world’s most precious natural areas, what will this say about our ability to fulfil our collective commitments towards the planet, including the Paris agreement?”

Warning of 'ecological Armageddon' after dramatic plunge in insect numbers,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers?CMP=share_btn_tw,"Three-quarters of flying insects in nature reserves across Germany have vanished in 25 years, with serious implications for all life on Earth, scientists say

The abundance of flying insects has plunged by three-quarters over the past 25 years, according to a new study that has shocked scientists.

Insects are an integral part of life on Earth as both pollinators and prey for other wildlife and it was known that some species such as butterflies were declining. But the newly revealed scale of the losses to all insects has prompted warnings that the world is “on course for ecological Armageddon”, with profound impacts on human society.

The new data was gathered in nature reserves across Germany but has implications for all landscapes dominated by agriculture, the researchers said.

The cause of the huge decline is as yet unclear, although the destruction of wild areas and widespread use of pesticides are the most likely factors and climate change may play a role. The scientists were able to rule out weather and changes to landscape in the reserves as causes, but data on pesticide levels has not been collected.

“The fact that the number of flying insects is decreasing at such a high rate in such a large area is an alarming discovery,” said Hans de Kroon, at Radboud University in the Netherlands and who led the new research.

“Insects make up about two-thirds of all life on Earth [but] there has been some kind of horrific decline,” said Prof Dave Goulson of Sussex University, UK, and part of the team behind the new study. “We appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse.”

The research, published in the journal Plos One, is based on the work of dozens of amateur entomologists across Germany who began using strictly standardised ways of collecting insects in 1989. Special tents called malaise traps were used to capture more than 1,500 samples of all flying insects at 63 different nature reserves.

When the total weight of the insects in each sample was measured a startling decline was revealed. The annual average fell by 76% over the 27 year period, but the fall was even higher – 82% – in summer, when insect numbers reach their peak.

Previous reports of insect declines have been limited to particular insects, such European grassland butterflies, which have fallen by 50% in recent decades. But the new research captured all flying insects, including wasps and flies which are rarely studied, making it a much stronger indicator of decline.

The fact that the samples were taken in protected areas makes the findings even more worrying, said Caspar Hallmann at Radboud University, also part of the research team: “All these areas are protected and most of them are well-managed nature reserves. Yet, this dramatic decline has occurred.”

The amateur entomologists also collected detailed weather measurements and recorded changes to the landscape or plant species in the reserves, but this could not explain the loss of the insects. “The weather might explain many of the fluctuations within the season and between the years, but it doesn’t explain the rapid downward trend,” said Martin Sorg from the Krefeld Entomological Society in Germany, who led the amateur entomologists.

Goulson said a likely explanation could be that the flying insects perish when they leave the nature reserves. “Farmland has very little to offer for any wild creature,” he said. “But exactly what is causing their death is open to debate. It could be simply that there is no food for them or it could be, more specifically, exposure to chemical pesticides, or a combination of the two.”

In September, a chief scientific adviser to the UK government warned that regulators around the world have falsely assumed that it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes and that the “effects of dosing whole landscapes with chemicals have been largely ignored”.

The scientists said further work is urgently needed to corroborate the new findings in other regions and to explore the issue in more detail. While most insects do fly, it may be that those that don’t, leave nature reserves less often and are faring better. It is also possible that smaller and larger insects are affected differently, and the German samples have all been preserved and will be further analysed.

In the meantime, said De Kroon: “We need to do less of the things that we know have a negative impact, such as the use of pesticides and the disappearance of farmland borders full of flowers.”

Lynn Dicks at the University of East Anglia, UK, and not involved in the new research said the work was convincing. “It provides important new evidence for an alarming decline that many entomologists have suspected is occurring for some time.”

“If total flying insect biomass is genuinely declining at this rate – about 6% per year – it is extremely concerning,” she said. “Flying insects have really important ecological functions, for which their numbers matter a lot. They pollinate flowers: flies, moths and butterflies are as important as bees for many flowering plants, including some crops. They provide food for many animals – birds, bats, some mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians. Flies, beetles and wasps are also predators and decomposers, controlling pests and cleaning up the place generally.”

Another way of sampling insects – car windscreens – has often been anecdotally used to suggest a major decline, with people remembering many more bugs squashed on their windscreens in the past.

“I think that is real,” said Goulson. “I drove right across France and back this summer – just when you’d expect your windscreen to be splattered all over – and I literally never had to stop to clean the windscreen.”"
Quebec passes law prohibiting Muslim women from wearing niqab while using public services,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-niqab-burka-bill-62-1.4360121,"A new law that would effectively force Muslim women who wear a niqab or burka to uncover their faces to use public services is based on a principle ""the vast majority of Canadians, and not just Quebecers"" can agree on, Premier Philippe Couillard said.

The Liberal government's Bill 62 on religious neutrality was passed Wednesday in Quebec's National Assembly.

""We are just saying that for reasons linked to communication, identification and safety, public services should be given and received with an open face,"" Couillard told reporters.

""We are in a free and democratic society. You speak to me, I should see your face, and you should see mine. It's as simple as that.""

The law prohibits public workers — including doctors, teachers and daycare employees — as well as those receiving a service from the government from covering their faces.

It was extended to municipal services, including public transit, in an amendment made in August.

The Liberals, who hold a majority in provincial parliament, voted in favour of the bill, while all the other parties voted against.

The two main opposition parties, the Parti Québécois and Coalition Avenir Québec, have argued the legislation doesn't go far enough, while civil rights advocates and Muslim groups argue it discriminates against religious minorities.

'Neutrality of the state'

While the niqab and burka are not mentioned in the legislation, Quebec Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée said earlier this week the bill aims to clearly establish the ""neutrality of the state.""

The bill provides for the possibility of religious accommodation in certain cases, leading critics to question how far reaching it will actually be.

It remains unclear how religious accommodation requests will be evaluated.

The province will work with public services, including municipalities, schools and public daycares, to establish guidelines for how it will be enforced, Vallée said. Those may not be ready until next summer.

Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, who is in the middle of a municipal election campaign, has been an outspoken critic of the bill, accusing the provincial government of overstepping its jurisdiction and ignoring his city's multicultural character.

On Tuesday, he said there are ""serious problems"" with how it would be applied.

Vallée tabled the legislation in 2015, a year after the Liberals took power.

Religion and identity became a key issue in the last election after the Parti Québécois put forward a contentious proposal for a charter of values, which would have banned public servants from wearing obvious religious symbols.

Liberals accused of 'ugly identity politics'

The National Council of Canadian Muslims issued a statement saying it was ""deeply concerned"" by the new law and that it ""boils down to ugly identity politics"" ahead of the 2018 provincial election.

Zayneb Binruchd, a 21-year-old Montrealer who wears a niqab, said she would rather stay home than take it off to ride a bus.

""I go to mall with my friends, I go out, I go to the library, so it will just make me stay home,"" she said.

""I don't have a car, I don't have anybody to drive me around, so it will just block me from the rest of the world.""

Legal challenge looms

At the federal level, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he's ""completely opposed"" to the law, and he's confident the legislation will be challenged.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government does not interfere with provincial laws, but will work to ensure the rights of all Canadians are respected.

""I will continue to work to ensure that all Canadians are protected by the charter, while respecting the choices that different parliamentarians can make at different levels,"" he said. ""Yet here at the federal level, we stand up for the rights of all Canadians.""

Julius Grey, a prominent Montreal-based civil rights lawyer, called it a ""terrible law.""

""I think it's an unconstitutional law as well. It's virtually certain to be set aside whole or … possibly in part,"" he said.

Couillard acknowledged the law could face a legal challenge, but said it was crafted to be compatible with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as well as the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms."
"Africa's elite are plundering their countries: A new report based on the Panama Papers reveals how Africa's politicians, generals and business leaders are systematically siphoning off billions of dollars and parking the money offshore.",http://www.dw.com/en/panama-papers-africas-elite-are-plundering-their-countries/a-41004488,"The investigative report, ""The Plunder Route to Panama"", highlights how Africa's leaders are doing more than accepting bribes from foreign companies or evading tax. Rather, they are systematically setting up power structures run by favored friends or family members to steal billions of dollars and store the loot outside of their countries, the report finds. This cuts budgets, hinders development and keeps people impoverished.

The investigation by a consortium of African journalists was inspired by the Panama Papers, a massive leak of documents of offshore accounts and companies that included the names of numerous African politicians. This new report attempts to follow the trail back to Africa to see where the money came from.

""We often point fingers at foreign multinationals that come to make a fortune here in Africa,"" Maxime Domegni, a Togo journalist involved in the investigation, told DW. ""But this investigation shows the extent to which African oligarchs are complicit in plundering the continent.""

Carried out by the African Investigative Publishing Collective, Africa Uncensored and Zam magazine, the report takes a detailed look at seven African countries: Togo, Mozambique, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, South Africa and Botswana.

Phosphorus is used for producing fertilizers

Togo's shadowy dealings in phosphates

Togo, for example, is home to vast reserves of phosphate directly managed from the offices of president Faure Gnassinge, whose family have ruled the West African country for 50 years. Togo earns 40 percent of its export earnings from the mineral, which is crucial for making fertilizers. The investigation found that phosphate would generate more wealth if it weren't being sold for two thirds of the going rate to a ""shady"" shipping family called Gupta. (The consortium behind the report is researching if this Gupta family is connected to South Africa's Guptas - more about them below.)

""We are critical of the total lack of transparency in the management of the phosphate industry in Togo,"" said journalist Domegni. In a country where more than 80 percent of the population live under the poverty line, ""those benefiting from [phosphate] are those who manage the country with the complicity of their friends,"" he said.

The Gupta family has close ties to South Africa's President Zuma

Mozambique's mining licenses reserved for generals

The report found a similar situation in Mozambique, where half of the world's rubies are mined. Dozens of generals, ministers and high-ranking party members hold ruby licenses. Villagers in the mining areas have been forcibly removed from their traditional lands, and even beaten and killed. Mozambique's powerful ruling elite aren't content with profiting directly from rubies, though. Despite a UK company paying Mozambique's government millions in ruby royalties, a percentage of which is supposed to flow back to these impoverished communities, there is no record of this money ever arriving.

The dark side of Botswana's tourism

In Botwswana, tourism is the preferred method of plundering the country's coffers. Botswana's reputation for high-quality, low impact tourism attracts the likes of UK's Prince Harry and US talkshow queen Oprah Winfrey. The report says President Ian Khama, along with his relatives and friends, virtually control Botswana's tourism industry through interests in major agencies, channeling profits offshore.

South Africa's President Zuma is under pressure regarding his dealings with the Guptas

Tax – a foreign word for DR Congo's presidential family

In DR Congo, it's an open secret that the Kabila family control almost all sectors of the economy through a veritable empire of more than eighty companies inside and outside the country, from telecommunications to mining. It is difficult to estimate the assets of the Congolese presidential family, said Jason Stearns, Director of the US-based Congo Research Group, because their commercial network is ""completely opaque.""

""We don't know whether the Kabila family pays taxes at all. We do not know the value of the different companies in the family. We don't even know where these companies are located or where they are registered,"" Stearns told DW.

Growing sick of corruption, nepotism and cronyism

""The Plunder Route to Panama"" report sounds a small note of optimism, noting that protests against kleptocratic governments have flared up in a number of African countries from Togo to Kenya and DR Congo.

Congo is rich in natural resources

In South Africa, the demonstrations have even shown some signs of success, with banks closing the accounts of the Gupta family, close friends of President Jacob Zuma linked to money laundering and fraud. Although Zuma is still clinging to power, people are growing sick of the vast tentacles of corruption and embezzlement that have sucked wealth out of South Africa and into offshore companies.

""The Gupta-Zuma system exemplifies other corrupt models in Africa, such as in Burundi or DR Congo,"" Jean-Claude Mputu, an anti-corruption activist from Congo, told DW.

He points out that unlike many countries in Africa, South Africa benefits from having a democratic regime with a free, critical press.

""Many South Africans are now demanding severe consequences: they want the Guptas and Zuma to be held responsible for their machinations,"" he said.

NHS provokes fury with indefinite surgery ban for smokers and obese,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/17/nhs-provokes-fury-indefinite-surgery-ban-smokers-obese/,"The NHS will ban patients from surgery indefinitely unless they lose weight or quit smoking, under controversial plans drawn up in Hertfordshire.

The restrictions - thought to be the most extreme yet to be introduced by health services - immediately came under attack from the Royal College of Surgeons.

Its vice president called for an “urgent rethink” of policies which he said were “discriminatory” and went against the fundamental principles of the NHS.

In recent years, a number of areas have introduced delays for such patients - with some told operations will be put back for months, during which time they are expected to try to lose weight or stop smoking.

But the new rules, drawn up by clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in Hertfordshire, say that obese patients “will not get non-urgent surgery until they reduce their weight” at all, unless the circumstances are exceptional.

The criteria also mean smokers will only be referred for operations if they have stopped smoking for at least eight weeks, with such patients breathalysed before referral.

East and North Hertfordshire CCG and Herts Valleys said the plans aimed to encourage people “to take more responsibility for their own health and wellbeing, wherever possible, freeing up limited NHS resources for priority treatment”."

FBI uncovered Russian bribery plot before Obama administration approved controversial nuclear deal with Moscow,http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration?amp,"Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin's atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.

Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.

They also obtained an eyewitness account - backed by documents - indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton's charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.

The racketeering scheme was conducted ""with the consent of higher level officials"" in Russia who ""shared the proceeds"" from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.

Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin's commercial nuclear ambitions.

The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America's uranium supply.

When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton's spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she ""never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.""

In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom's Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.

""The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,"" a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.

The Obama administration's decision to approve Rosatom's purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.

That's when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.

But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee's decision that Vadim Mikerin - the main Russian overseeing Putin's nuclear expansion inside the United States - was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.

Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.

Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn't comment.

Mikerin was a director of Rosatom's Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom's nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom's new American arm called Tenam.

Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin ""did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons ... to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,"" a November 2014 indictment stated.

His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin's direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.

In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a ""racketeering scheme"" that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.

""As part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,"" Agent David Gadren testified.

""Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,"" the agent added.

The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump's deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.

Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife's Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.

The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired earlier this year.

Its many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.

The case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia's uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.

One of Mikerin's former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to ""allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,"" agents testified in one court filing.

Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency's cap.

But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.

The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.

By that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States's approval.

The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia's nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton's foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.

The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.

On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, ""a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison"" and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.

Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin's case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.

""I had no idea this case was being conducted,"" a surprised Hosko said in an interview.

Likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.

Former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration's approval of the Uranium One deal.

""Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,"" he said. ""The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.""

"In less than 24 hours, Iraq has recaptured about 30% of Iraqi Kurdish-held territory in dramatic campaign",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-kirkuk/iraqi-forces-seize-more-territory-in-advance-against-kurds-idUSKBN1CM1CT,"BAGHDAD/KIRKUK (Reuters) - The Baghdad government recaptured territory from Kurds across the breadth of northern Iraq on Tuesday, making startlingly rapid gains in a sudden campaign that has shifted the balance of power in the country almost overnight.

In the second day of a lightning government advance to take back towns and countryside from forces of the Kurdish autonomous region, Kurdish troops known as Peshmerga pulled out of the long disputed Khanaqin area near the Iranian border.

Government troops took control of the last two oilfields in the vicinity of Kirkuk, an oil city of 1 million people which the Peshmerga abandoned the previous day in the face of the government forces’ advance. A Yazidi group allied to Baghdad also took control of the town of Sinjar.

Baghdad’s military operation has redrawn the map of northern Iraq, rolling back gains by the Kurds who infuriated Baghdad last month by holding a referendum on independence.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Tuesday the referendum “is finished and has become a thing of the past”.

Addressing a news conference in Baghdad, he called for a dialogue with Kurdish leaders “under the constitution”.

Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) President Masoud Barzani said the vote for independence “won’t be in vain”. He did not call for dialogue, but added, “Kurds have always been against waging wars and have worked in pursuit of peace.”

The KRG governs three mountainous northern provinces making up the autonomous region. It has also held a wide crescent of additional territory in northern Iraq, much of which they seized after helping drive out Islamic State militants since 2014.

Abadi ordered his troops on Monday to raise their flag over all Kurdish-held territory outside the autonomous region itself. They achieved a swift victory in Kirkuk, reaching the center of the city in less than a day.

The fighting in one of Iraq’s main oil-producing areas has helped return a risk premium to oil prices. After months of range-bound trading, benchmark Brent crude is now above $58 a barrel, up almost a third from its mid-year levels.

Oil officials in Baghdad said all the fields near Kirkuk were working normally on Tuesday after the last came under central government control. Kirkuk, situated just outside the KRG autonomous region, is the base of Iraq’s Northern Oil Company, one of the two giant state energy firms that provide nearly all government revenue.

Oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said Baghdad would now try to nearly double the output of the Kirkuk oil fields to more than 1 million barrels per day.

DILEMMA FOR WASHINGTON

The Iraqi army advances create a dilemma for Washington, which has armed and trained both sides in its successful campaign to drive Islamic State insurgents out of Iraq.

“We don’t like the fact that they’re clashing,” U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. “We’ve had for many years a very good relationship with the Kurds as you know, and we’ve also been on the side of Iraq.”

So far most of the advances appear to have come unopposed, with Kurds withdrawing before government forces move in. There have been reports of just one serious battle, in the early hours of Monday on the outskirts of Kirkuk.

The U.S. military said on Tuesday it had received mixed accounts of the death toll in that clash, with between three and 11 combatants killed.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said the transfer of control appeared to have taken place with a minimum of fighting, with the number of wounded no higher than in the dozens. ICRC regional deputy director Patrick Hamilton told Reuters that he was concerned roads were closed, especially access to Mosul, the former Islamic State urban battlefield where hundreds of thousands of people still depend on aid.

In Kirkuk, one of Iraq’s most diverse cities, members of the Turkmen ethnic group who opposed Kurdish rule celebrated on Monday, driving through the streets firing weapons in the air.

By Tuesday, the once ubiquitous green, red and white Kurdish flag with a blazing yellow sun had vanished from the streets. U.S.-trained Iraqi special forces and local police patrolled to maintain order. Markets, shops and schools were open as normal.

Some Kurdish families who had left the city on Monday were already returning home. They said thousands of Kurdish fighters in convoys formed a long queue in efforts to flee Kirkuk towards the Kurdish regional capital Erbil, clogging the road and making it difficult for civilians to leave.

TOUGH TERRITORIAL LOSS

For the Kurds, the loss of territory, particularly Kirkuk, which Kurdish folklore views as the heart of their homeland, is a severe blow just three weeks after they voted to declare the independent state that had been their goal for decades.

“Our leaders abandoned us in the middle of nowhere. Our future is dark,” said retired Kirkuk teacher Malla Bakhtiyar.

He said he tried to escape on Monday but returned with his wife and sons after an Arab neighbor phoned, begging him not to leave and assuring him the city was safe.

University lecturer Salar Othman Ameen blamed the Kurdish authorities for calling the independence referendum prematurely.

“We feel broken now. The referendum was a catastrophic decision ... Our Kurdish leadership was supposed to think of the consequences before moving along with independence vote. Now we have lost what we have achieved over three decades.”

The setbacks led to recriminations among the two main Kurdish political parties - the KDP and PUK, which each control separate units of Peshmerga.

Barzani said political rivals had ordered the withdrawal of Kurdish forces from Kirkuk, and officials in his KDP accused the PUK of his long-time rival Jalal Talabani of “treason” for abandoning the city.

Talabani, who served as ceremonial Iraqi president in Baghdad from 2003 to 2014, died two weeks ago. His widow denied blame for the fall of Kirkuk and said her party had tried to avert the advance through contact with U.S. and Iraqi officials.

The advances were a second resounding triumph for Abadi, the soft-spoken Iraqi prime minister, months after his forces recaptured Mosul from Islamic State. Abadi had faced threats from Iran-backed Shi’ite armed groups to take matters into their own hands if he did not act decisively to take on the Kurds.

“If elections were held tomorrow, I would vote with 10 fingers for Abadi. He succeeded in keeping Iraq a single state,” said Adel Abdul Kareem, a Baghdad lawyer.

“When Kurdish leaders were threatening Baghdad, Abadi was always smiling. We did not expect he was hiding a tornado behind this smile. He proved he was a smart leader, and with his wisdom he won against Masoud (Barzani) with a knockout in the second round.”

For the Kurds, the loss of Kirkuk restores the status quo in place before they seized it in 2014, which saw their self-ruled region prosper under an Iraqi constitution that guaranteed them a fixed percentage of Iraq’s total oil income.

Control of Kirkuk and its oil had made it seem more plausible for them to break away; without it, independence is problematic, since they would be financially worse off than inside Iraq with a share of its overall oil income."
Malta car bomb kills Panama Papers journalist | World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/malta-car-bomb-kills-panama-papers-journalist,"Daphne Caruana Galizia, a blogger whose investigations focused on corruption, was described as a ‘one-woman WikiLeaks’

The journalist who led the Panama Papers investigation into corruption in Malta was killed on Monday in a car bomb near her home.

Daphne Caruana Galizia died on Monday afternoon when her car, a Peugeot 108, was destroyed by a powerful explosive device which blew the vehicle into several pieces and threw the debris into a nearby field.

A bomb silenced Daphne Caruana Galizia. But her investigation lives on Read more

A blogger whose posts often attracted more readers than the combined circulation of the country’s newspapers, Caruana Galizia was recently described by the Politico website as a “one-woman WikiLeaks”. Her blogs were a thorn in the side of both the establishment and underworld figures that hold sway in Europe’s smallest member state.

Her most recent revelations pointed the finger at Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and two of his closest aides, connecting offshore companies linked to the three men with the sale of Maltese passports and payments from the government of Azerbaijan.

No group or individual has come forward to claim responsibility for the attack.



Malta’s president, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, called for calm. “In these moments, when the country is shocked by such a vicious attack, I call on everyone to measure their words, to not pass judgment and to show solidarity,” she said.

After a fraught general election this summer, commentators had been fearing a return to the political violence that scarred Malta during the 1980s.



In a statement, Muscat condemned the “barbaric attack”, saying he had asked police to reach out to other countries’ security services for help identifying the perpetrators.

“Everyone knows Ms Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine,” said Muscat at a hastily convened press conference, “both politically and personally, but nobody can justify this barbaric act in any way”.

Muscat announced later in parliament that FBI officers were on their way to Malta to assist with the investigation, following his request for outside help from the US government.

The Nationalist party leader, Adrian Delia – himself the subject of negative stories by Caruana Galizia – claimed the killing was linked to her reporting. “A political murder took place today,” Delia said in a statement. “What happened today is not an ordinary killing. It is a consequence of the total collapse of the rule of law which has been going on for the past four years.”

According to local media reports, Caruana Galizia filed a police report 15 days ago to say that she had been receiving death threats.

The journalist posted her final blog on her Running Commentary website at 2.35pm on Monday, and the explosion, which occurred near her home, was reported to police just after 3pm. Officers said her body had not yet been identified. According to sources, one of her sons heard the blast from their home and rushed out to the scene.

Caruana Galizia, who claimed to have no political affiliations, set her sights on a wide range of targets, from banks facilitating money laundering to links between Malta’s online gaming industry and the Mafia.

What are the Panama Papers? A guide to history's biggest data leak Read more

Over the last two years, her reporting had largely focused on revelations from the Panama Papers, a cache of 11.5m documents leaked from the internal database of the world’s fourth largest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca.



The data was obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with media partners around the world, including the Guardian, by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington.



Caruana Galizia’s son, Matthew Caruana Galizia, is a journalist and programmer who works for the ICIJ.



Her family have filed a court application demanding a change of inquiring magistrate. Investigations into the case are being led by Consuelo Scerri Herrera, the magistrate who was on duty at the time. But Herrera had come under criticism by Galizia in her blog. The family’s petition states that they “have no trust” in Scerri Herrera and “do not believe that she can conduct a magisterial inquiry through the seriousness and impartiality that is needed in the search for truth”.

Earlier this year, during Malta’s presidency of the European Union, her revelations caused major concern in Brussels.



MEPs openly called for Muscat’s departure amid a growing scandal involving his wife, a Panamanian shell company and alleged payments from the president of Azerbaijan’s daughter.

Muscat, who has been premier since 2013, went to the polls a year early after his wife was implicated in the scandal. He has always denied any wrongdoing and promised to quit if any evidence emerges of his family having secret offshore bank accounts used to stash kickbacks – as Caruana Galizia had alleged.

Responding to news of the attack, the German MEP Sven Giegold, a leading figure in the parliament’s Panama Papers inquiry, said he was “shocked and saddened”.

“It is too early to know the cause of the explosion but we expect to see a thorough investigation,” said Giegold. “Such incidents bring to mind Putin’s Russia, not the European Union. There can be absolutely no tolerance for violence against the press and violations of the freedom of expression in the European Union.”

Opposition politicians claim rule of law has been under threat since Muscat returned Malta’s Labour party to power in 2013 following a long period in opposition. Four police commissioners have resigned under his leadership. The fifth, Lawrence Cutajar, took up his post in August 2016.

There have been several car bomb killings in Malta during recent years. While the perpetrators have not been identified, the violence is thought to have been linked to disputes between criminal gangs. None are thought to have been politically motivated.

Caruana Galizia was 53 and leaves a husband and three sons."
Masked and Armed With Rifles: Military Security Firms Roam Streets of San Juan,http://www.latinorebels.com/2017/10/10/masked-and-armed-with-rifles-military-security-firms-roam-streets-of-san-juan/,"By Joel Cintrón Arbasetti

SANTURCE, PUERTO RICO — It’s the morning of Oct. 7 and a man stops traffic on Antonsanti Street in Santurce, behind the Ciudadela building. He is wearing a helmet, sunglasses, facemask, a vest with ammunition, gloves, plastic straps used for arrests, boots, camouflaged pants with knee pads, a knife and gun. There is a machine gun in his hand. He has no plaque or ID.

He works for a private security firm hired by Nicholas Prouty, the owner of the Ciudadela complex. Prouty turned to that service after Hurricane María, he told the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI in Spanish) last week.

“With a substantial reduction in the number of police officers on the streets [due to the government’s reallocation of resources to protect diesel and supply chains0, and most streets lights not functioning, Ciudadela has taken the necessary steps to make its residents and commercial tenants feel safe,” he said, without revealing the name of the security firm.

Who do you work for?, the CPI asked the armed man who was at Ciudadela.

“We work with the government,” he answered.

Which division?

“It’s a humanitarian mission, we’re helping Puerto Rico,” he said in broken Spanish.

And why the covered face?

“Because if I go with my daughter to eat at Burger King tomorrow and somebody identifies me, they could kill me,” he said.

Two other men dressed in military uniforms standing at another corner of Ciudadela said they worked for a private company, but also refused to reveal the name.

Why do you cover your face?

“Because we want to,” one of them said, pulling the facemask up to his nose to cover himself better. He had a rifle in his hand: a silver shotgun.

The CPI asked Héctor Pesquera, secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety, if a special permit was issued to private security companies to carry rifles after Hurricane María made landfall. “We’re dealing with that,” he said as he left a press conference at the Convention Center. When we showed him the photo of the security men in Ciudadela, he said, “they could be military,” and scurried to the back of a room in the San Juan Convention Center where the government of Puerto Rico has set up its Emergency Operations Center (COE in Spanish) after Hurricane María.

Does the federal weapons law allow private security guards to carry long weapons?, the CPI asked Rosa Emilia Rodríguez, head of the Federal Prosecutor’s Office in Puerto Rico.

“We go by federal law violations and they include long weapons, carrying an automatic rifle and so on, if they do not have the proper license.”

But are there licenses to carry long weapons?

“It depends [on] whether they are military. That is, it is very restricted. I’m surprised that this is happening. I don’t know if they are off-duty police officers, I don’t know, I would have to see the circumstances. A police officer can work in a private security company in their spare time.”

In that case, could they have long weapons?

“I don’t know, it has roused my interest, so I’ll check it out. But I’m surprised that they only have access to long weapons,” Rodríguez replied.

Meanwhile, Attorney General Olga Castellón said Pesquera is processing an executive order that will detail the rules for private security companies. Perhaps that’s what the Secretary of Public Security referred to when he said, “We’re dealing with that.”

Both federal officials agreed that the order should not allow private security guards to carry long weapons. “They would be going very far,” said Rodríguez.

The Puerto Rico Weapons Act says that “you can not…own, use, transfer or import a Semi-Automatic Assault Weapon.” This prohibition does not apply to “people whose license contains the category of target shooting, hunting or who possess an armory license, or for those assault weapons legally existing in the United States.” Or to people “with a gunsmith license, or law enforcement agents who use arms in the call of duty, or the government of Puerto Rico or the United States, or for the use of by armed forces of the Government of the United States or Puerto Rico.” The law bans arms such as shotguns and semiautomatic rifles.

Two members of the United States Air Force consulted by the CPI said that both the shotgun and the machine gun carried by the men of Ciudadela are automatic or semi-automatic weapons, after seeing a photo.

“In terms of firearms, [private security companies] have to be governed by the Puerto Rico Weapons Act and must have a gun holding license. As far as I know, gun licenses granted here are for short guns. Long weapons are used solely and exclusively for the custody of securities transport, armored trucks, and is a special license provided by the government of Puerto Rico. All other armed services have to be with small arms. The only people who could use long weapons are those of the State. I don’t know of any legal authorization to carry long guns in private service in Puerto Rico,” said Adalberto Mercado, vice president of operations for private security company Ranger America.

“The State can provide provisional licenses, but they have to request them and the State has to grant them. If not, they would be carrying illegal weapons inside the territory of Puerto Rico,” Mercado said.

Security firm Academi —known by its former name, Blackwater, which won $21 million contract with the U.S. government to provide security services during the Iraq war in 2003— said that they already have offers from the local and federal government and by the Red Cross to come to Puerto Rico.

“We’re ready to go,” said Paul Donahue, Chief Operating Officer of Constellis, Academi’s parent company, in a phone interview with the CPI. He explained that if the government of Puerto Rico accepts the proposal made by Academi to respond to the government’s offer, they would be providing security services for water transportation. The company already operates in the Caribbean islands of Dominica and St. Martin, where they arrived after Hurricanes Irma and Maria made landfall. This company, described as an army of mercenaries by investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill, has changed its name three times since its founding in 1997 by a former Navy Seal Officer (United States Marine, Air and Land Teams.)

Blackwater also operated in New Orleans after the passing of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. There they worked under a federal contract and for millionaires who left the city before the storm passed. They were hired to protect their properties.

On the entry of U.S. security companies into Puerto Rico, Mercado, Ranger America’s vice president of operations, said, “We have signed service contracts with U.S. security firms that have hired us to in turn provide security to clients they have here in Puerto Rico… I would say there are large numbers (of companies), but we have seen hiring (of U.S. security companies) in the area of communications and in the hotel area. They are companies that we don’t really know about, they have no presence here in Puerto Rico, but they have come and we know they are serving some corporations and multinationals.”

Mercado said Ranger America has been recruiting more employees since the hurricane, to serve retailers, supermarkets, government warehouses, and “more recently,” FEMA. He did not mentioned the names of the companies or agencies that have hired them.

The Whitestone Group, another U.S. security company, posted an ad on the Monster job search site on September 29 seeking “retired officers with gun licenses for immediate response in Puerto Rico.” The ad said salary would be about $2,400 a week plus a per-diem and housing. The ad that indicates the offer says “FEMA-Puerto Rico.”

“I really don’t know the answer,” said Alejandro De La Campa, director of FEMA in Puerto Rico, when the CPI asked if the agency had hired private security companies to work in Puerto Rico and, specifically, The Whitestone Group.

“But we’re going to hire… all the hiring is done through Federal Protective Services, that’s the federal agency that does the hiring; they would be the ones who could answer you. That we’re going to need (private) security across the island, that’s true,” De La Campa said during a quick exit from the COE.

Whitestone Group currently has “several contracts” with the U.S. Departments of Defense, Engineering, Interior and Commerce, as well as with the Army, Armed Forces and Coast Guard. Its first contract with the federal government was with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Treasury Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

People watching the military show behind Ciudadela on that Saturday morning did not seem safer. An elderly woman who was prevented by the man armed with a machine gun from going on Antonsanti Street looked anxious, nervous and frightened. But she still rebuked him through her car window. She asked him to let her pass because she was going to a street that was before where a truck was unloading merchandise. The woman was about to cry. The robot-looking man finally let her in and said, “Thanks for interrupting my work.”

200 Female Inmates Are Fighting Fires in California,http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/The-Female-Inmates-Fighting-Fires-in-California-450438783.html,"Before they head out, the women pack plenty of water: at least two canteens and a CamelBak hydration system each, along with extra safety glasses, snacks, and ready-to-eat meals in case the shift runs long. They also bring “ponies,” short lengths of hose to attach to a hydrant or other apparatus. The backpack weighs nearly 40 pounds in the end.

Sandra Welsh is a firefighter. But unlike most California firefighters, she is only paid $2 per day and doesn’t get to go home at the end her shift. Because she's also a prison inmate.

“We are the ones that do the line. We are the ones that carry the hose out. We’re the line of defense,” Welsh said in a recent interview with NBC News. Welsh, an inmate at Malibu Conservation Camp #13, is one of about 200 incarcerated women incarcerated around the state who fight fires in California.

Her group is on standby as firefighters battle the Canyon 2 fire in the Anaheim Hills. But other women are part of the fight against the fires currently devastating the state, which have claimed 21 lives and destroyed 3,500 structures over the past few days.

""We have female crews from other camps working on the Canyon Fire in Anaheim and also up in Napa,"" said Bill Sessa, a spokesman for the corrections department. ""The crews from the Malibu camp are on standby and also have to provide back-up fire protection for L.A. County.""

The status of the crews could change quickly depending on conditions, he said.



About 3,800 inmates, both women and men, fight fires in California, making up about 13 percent of California’s firefighting force. The fire program saves taxpayers $124 million per year, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

In the fire program, the women do the same work as the men.

“We basically fight fires and it gives us a chance to better ourselves mentally and physically,” Latoya Najar, an inmate at the Malibu camp, told NBC News last month.

Working in crews of 14, the women use hand tools and chain saws to cut containment lines that stop fires from spreading.

“Every day is a difficult day,” Najar said. “This will show you that you can do anything you put your mind to.”

Malibu Conservation Camp #13 in Southern California is one of 43 conservation fire camps for adults run by the corrections department, and one of three such camps for female inmates. Inmates in the camps work hundreds of fires each year. Women at the Malibu camp, for example, have been called out on 177 fires so far this year, Sessa said.

Sandra Welsh decided to volunteer in the program for the sake of her two children.

“This prison trip has taken a lot out of their lives and I wanted them to have something to hold onto,” Welsh, who is also at the Malibu camp, told NBC News. “My mom’s a firefighter. I might be an inmate firefighter, but I’m a firefighter.”

Inmates must volunteer to be in the program, and there are many benefits that motivate the women to sign up, said Sessa of the corrections department.

""They get paid better than any other prison job,"" he said. The pay is $2 per day day in camp and $1 per hour for time on the fire line.

Being housed in a camp is an ""improvement"" over the confines of a traditional prison behind an electric fence, he said.

Another incentive is that inmate firefighters earn two days off their sentence for each day they're in the fire camp, as compared to other California inmates who can earn just one day for each day of good behavior.

Still, at least one California politician has called the program's low pay ""slave labor.""

Gayle McLaughlin, the former mayor of Richmond, Calif., and a candidate for lieutenant governor in the state, said she does support the fire programs.

""But they must be paid fairly for each day of work – and $1 an hour is not fair pay,"" she wrote in September on her campaign website. ""No matter how you may want to dress it up, if you have people working for nothing or almost nothing, you’ve got slave labor, and it is not acceptable.""

Not all inmates are eligible to volunteer for the fire program.

To participate, inmates must be convicted of a non-violent crime, have a record of good behavior and pass physical examinations. If an inmate has a history of sexual offenses, arson or any history of violent escape, they’re automatically disqualified from the firefighting program. Qualified volunteers are trained by Cal Fire and then receive additional wildfire training in the camps. Training focuses on endurance because shifts can be as long as 16 hours, inmates say.

When she first came close to a fire, inmate Helen Chung was terrified.

""I said, 'Oh my god, we're actually in the fire,'"" she told NBC News for its report.

But she says attitude is everything.

""You have to be very positive and make the most of your situation and your circumstances,"" Chung said. ""But these are challenges that I’ve overcome and I’m proud to be here.""

Other inmates also find the work rewarding.

""You get to save people’s houses,” said Melissa Logan, an inmate who fought fires at the Malibu camp but is now housed at the California Institution for Women in Chino. “You get to help people. It’s really gratifying and empowering when you’re driving by and people are holding up signs saying ‘Thank you, firefighters’ and they’re crying because you just saved their homes.""

Inmates in the fire program are less likely to be rearrested after release than other inmates.

In the general prison population, three quarters of prisoners are arrested again within five years of release, according to studies by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But these rates in the firefighting program are 10 percent lower, according to the corrections department.

""This is not a vocational program,"" Sessa said. ""It is not designed to teach inmates how to be full-time firefighters. But they learn many life skills that they will say help them succeed in life when they leave prison… leadership, discipline, teamwork, responsibility."""
Richard Branson's Virgin Group invests in super-fast Hyperloop One transport system,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/12/richard-bransons-virgin-group-invests-in-hyperloop-one.html,"Richard Branson's Virgin Group is investing in Hyperloop One, a company developing the super-fast transport system originally dreamed up by Elon Musk.

Hypleroop One is rebranding itself as Virgin Hyperloop One, and Branson is joining the board, the billionaire British investor and entrepreneur announced Thursday on CNBC from London.

Virgin Hyperloop One will focus on a passenger and mixed-use cargo service.

Last month, Hypleroop One raised $85 million in new funding, and that includes the investment from Virgin. Branson refused to provide numbers.

Breaking ground on a commercial hyperloop in two to four years is possible if ""governments move quickly,"" Branson said in a ""Squawk Box"" interview. So far, no government has approved a plan for a hyperloop system. The Virgin founder also said that building a hyperloop tube above or below ground is ""cheaper"" and ""faster"" than a traditional rail network.

The idea of the transport system — conceived in 2013 by Musk, the head of both electric automaker Tesla and SpaceX — works by propelling pods through tubes using magnets reaching speeds akin to those of airplanes.

""As a train owner, "" Branson said, ""I felt this is something that I want to be able to operate. At the moment our trains are limited to 125 miles an hour."" His sprawling Virgin Group empire includes a train network in the U.K., as well as airlines and a business to take tourists into space.

""There are consumers, for instance, that would love to go from London to Edinburgh in roughly 45 minutes. And that will be possible"" with a hyperloop, he said. ""You can have a pod outside your office that you and your colleagues can jump into. The pod can self-drive to the top of the tunnel. It then goes down the tunnel. It connects up and off you go at 600, 700 miles an hour up to your destination, going faster than an airline."""

UK Govt Board Rules Report Critical of Israeli Influence on UK Politics Is Not anti-Semitic,https://theintercept.com/2017/10/09/an-al-jazeera-reporter-went-undercover-with-the-pro-israel-lobby-in-washington/,"Britain’s broadcasting regulator on Monday concluded that Al Jazeera did not violate any rules in its controversial undercover investigation exposing the Israeli embassy’s campaign to target British citizens critical of Israel, a campaign that included attempts to destroy the careers of pro-Palestinian British politicians.

The move by the communications regulator, known as Ofcom, clears the way for a follow-up documentary focused on Israeli influence in the U.S., the existence of which has previously been suspected but had yet to be made public. Clayton Swisher, director of investigative journalism for Al Jazeera Media Network, confirmed it to The Intercept on Monday. The goal of the British complaint may partly have been to delay publication of the follow-up American version, he said. “At the very same time [as the London investigation] — and we can safely reveal this now — we had an undercover operative working in tandem in Washington, D.C. With this U.K. verdict and vindication past us, we can soon reveal how the Israel lobby in America works through the eyes of an undercover reporter,” he said.

The four-part series, “The Lobby,” dug into the Israeli embassy in London, as well as several other pro-Israel lobby groups, and their campaign to “take down” British Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan.

The investigation led to the resignation of a top Israeli official in London, as well as a high-profile complaint that Al Jazeera had broken broadcasting regulations in the United Kingdom. One of the complaints charged the investigation with anti-Semitism, but the government board ruled that imputing such a motive to a film critical of Israel would be akin to calling a series on gang violence racist.

Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Prime Minister Theresa May in January, calling for a probe into Shai Masot, the Israeli embassy’s then-senior political officer. An undercover reporter secretly filmed Masot discussing a plot to “take down” Duncan, which Corbyn described as “improper interference in this country’s democratic process.” Masot resigned shortly after the recordings were made public.

Swisher, whose writing has also appeared in The Intercept, said that his outlet turned over reams of unpublished audio and video files to demonstrate that its report had not been unfairly edited. “For several months, we were put through the equivalent of an editorial colonoscopy. Turning over emails, different edits, all the raw footage, photos, cellphone messages — basically anything the investigators found of interest,” said Swisher.

Ofcom received complaints about the series from pro-Israel British activists and a former Israel embassy employee. It dismissed all charges, which included anti-Semitism, bias, unfair editing, and the infringement of privacy.

It ruled that as per the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s guidance: “It did not consider that such a critical analysis of the actions of a foreign state constituted anti-Semitism, particularly as the overall focus of the programme was to examine whether the State of Israel was acting in a manner that would be expected of other democratic nations.”

All other charges were also dismissed as Ofcom found the program maintained due impartiality, the footage was not edited in a way which resulted in unfairness, and there was no unwarranted infringement of privacy.

In January, pro-Israel activists in the U.S. began to suspect they’d been infiltrated when footage in America appeared in the British version of “The Lobby.” Tablet began piecing things together and identified the likely hoaxer as a highfalutin British intern who’d dissonantly been renting a fully furnished $5,460 a month corporate apartment.

Swisher wouldn’t confirm or deny the identity of the American operative, but he said that with the American political class focused on foreign intervention in the affairs of the United States, now is an appropriate time to run the follow-up investigation. “I hear the U.S. is having problems with foreign interference these days, so I see no reason why the U.S. establishment won’t take our findings in America as seriously as the British did, unless of course Israel is somehow off limits from that debate,” he said."
"Russia targeted US troops, vets on social media, study finds",http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/354596-russia-targeted-us-troops-veterans-on-social-media-platforms-study-finds,"Russia targeted U.S. military personnel and veterans in a cyber campaign last spring by spreading messages on social media networks that promoted Kremlin propaganda as well as conspiracy theories, according to a new study.

The Oxford University study found that three websites with Kremlin ties — Veteranstoday.com, Veteransnewsnow.com and Southfront.org — engaged in “significant and persistent interactions” with the U.S. military community, McClatchy highlighted Monday.

“We’ve found an entire ecosystem of junk news about national security issues that is deliberately crafted for U.S. veterans and active military personnel,” professor Philip Howard, who led the research in the study, told the newswire.

“It’s a complex blend of content with a Russian view of the world — wild rumors and conspiracies.”

Despite their attempts to gain influence through social media platforms last June, the study found that they did not make ""very deep"" inroads with the group on Twitter. The sites, however, did have more success with Twitter than Facebook.

Mike Carpenter, a former senior Pentagon official, told McClatchy that the three websites all “appear to be Russian fronts, given the high degree of Russian content.”

Veterans Today, for example, reportedly mixed stories that included advice for veterans on how to find jobs with headlines like “Ukraine’s Ku Klux Klan — NATO’s New Ally.”

Veterans Today began publishing content that came from a news outlet that had ties to the Russian Academy of Sciences, which is chartered by the Russian government, according to the report.

The other two websites, which similarly had Moscow ties, also published Russian propaganda.

News from the study's findings comes after Facebook revealed last week that Moscow purchased online ads that specifically targeted presidential swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin as well as specific demographic groups in an attempt to influence the presidential election.

Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating the extent and the success in which Russia disseminated false news or further fanned inflammatory reports."
Half the universe's missing matter has just been finally found,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2149742-half-the-universes-missing-matter-has-just-been-finally-found/,"Discoveries seem to back up many of our ideas about how the universe got its large-scale structure Andrey Kravtsov (The University of Chicago) and Anatoly Klypin (New Mexico State University). Visualisation by Andrey Kravtsov

The missing links between galaxies have finally been found. This is the first detection of the roughly half of the normal matter in our universe – protons, neutrons and electrons – unaccounted for by previous observations of stars, galaxies and other bright objects in space.

You have probably heard about the hunt for dark matter, a mysterious substance thought to permeate the universe, the effects of which we can see through its gravitational pull. But our models of the universe also say there should be about twice as much ordinary matter out there, compared with what we have observed so far.

Two separate teams found the missing matter – made of particles called baryons rather than dark matter – linking galaxies together through filaments of hot, diffuse gas.

“The missing baryon problem is solved,” says Hideki Tanimura at the Institute of Space Astrophysics in Orsay, France, leader of one of the groups. The other team was led by Anna de Graaff at the University of Edinburgh, UK.

Because the gas is so tenuous and not quite hot enough for X-ray telescopes to pick up, nobody had been able to see it before.

“There’s no sweet spot – no sweet instrument that we’ve invented yet that can directly observe this gas,” says Richard Ellis at University College London. “It’s been purely speculation until now.”

So the two groups had to find another way to definitively show that these threads of gas are really there.

Both teams took advantage of a phenomenon called the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect that occurs when light left over from the big bang passes through hot gas. As the light travels, some of it scatters off the electrons in the gas, leaving a dim patch in the cosmic microwave background – our snapshot of the remnants from the birth of the cosmos.

Stack ‘em up

In 2015, the Planck satellite created a map of this effect throughout the observable universe. Because the tendrils of gas between galaxies are so diffuse, the dim blotches they cause are far too slight to be seen directly on Planck’s map.

Both teams selected pairs of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that were expected to be connected by a strand of baryons. They stacked the Planck signals for the areas between the galaxies, making the individually faint strands detectable en masse.

Tanimura’s team stacked data on 260,000 pairs of galaxies, and de Graaff’s group used over a million pairs. Both teams found definitive evidence of gas filaments between the galaxies. Tanimura’s group found they were almost three times denser than the mean for normal matter in the universe, and de Graaf’s group found they were six times denser – confirmation that the gas in these areas is dense enough to form filaments.

“We expect some differences because we are looking at filaments at different distances,” says Tanimura. “If this factor is included, our findings are very consistent with the other group.”

Finally finding the extra baryons that have been predicted by decades of simulations validates some of our assumptions about the universe.

“Everybody sort of knows that it has to be there, but this is the first time that somebody – two different groups, no less – has come up with a definitive detection,” says Ralph Kraft at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts.

“This goes a long way toward showing that many of our ideas of how galaxies form and how structures form over the history of the universe are pretty much correct,” he says.

Owners of Ellen's Stardust Diner Reach Agreement with Union,http://www.playbill.com/article/owners-of-ellens-stardust-diner-reach-agreement-with-union,"Owners of Ellen’s Stardust Diner Reach Agreement with Union

Owners of the diner have agreed to offer immediate and full reinstatement to 31 employees who were fired over the past year.

A year after the singing wait staff at Ellen’s Stardust Diner unionized with Industrial Workers of the World to improve working conditions at the Times Square institution, the union representing employees has announced that it has reached an agreement with the diner’s owners.

According to a release issued by Stardust Family United—the union representing the diner’s singing staff—all 31 employees who were terminated over the past year in retaliation for union activity will be offered full and immediate reinstatement and will receive back-pay from the time they were fired.

At this time, 13 of the fired individuals plan to immediately return to work at the diner.

As previously reported by Playbill.com, the singing wait staff at Ellen’s unionized with Industrial Workers of the World in August 2016, citing unfair and sometimes unsafe working conditions.

Read: SINGING STAFF OF ELLEN'S STARDUST DINER GOES SILENT AMID FIRINGS

The action resulted in a bitter stand-off between employees and Ken Sturm, the owner of the diner, who fired some 31 long-term employees over the past year. Last March the National Labor Relations Board authorized the issuing of a Complaint against Stardust owners for multiple violations of federal labor law, including dozens of retaliatory and unlawful terminations.

The settlement agreement also requires Stardust owners to mail official notices to all employees, informing them that the company will not violate federal law by engaging in certain unlawful practices such as surveilling and threatening workers, interfering with their use of social media, and discouraging them from taking action to improve working conditions."

"California's deadly hepatitis A outbreak could last years, official says",http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-hepatitis-outbreaks-20171006-htmlstory.html,"California’s outbreak of hepatitis A, already the nation’s second largest in the last 20 years, could continue for many months, even years, health officials said Thursday.

At least 569 people have been infected and 17 have died of the virus since November in San Diego, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles counties, where local outbreaks have been declared.

Dr. Monique Foster, a medical epidemiologist with the Division of Viral Hepatitis at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Thursday that California’s outbreak could linger even with the right prevention efforts.

“It’s not unusual for them to last quite some time — usually over a year, one to two years,” Foster said.

That forecast has worried health officials across the state, even in regions where there haven’t yet been cases.

Many are beginning to offer vaccines to their homeless populations, which are considered most at risk. Doctors say that people with hepatitis A could travel and unknowingly infect people in a new community, creating more outbreaks.

San Diego, Santa Cruz and L.A.

San Diego County declared a public health emergency in September because of its hepatitis A outbreak.

Since November, 481 people there have fallen ill, including 17 who died, according to Dr. Eric McDonald with the county’s health department. An additional 57 cases are under investigation, he said.

70 cases in Santa Cruz County

12 cases in L.A. County

6 cases elsewhere in the state Sources: County health departments, California public health departments

Hepatitis A is commonly transmitted through contaminated food. The only outbreak in the last 20 years bigger than California’s occurred in Pennsylvania in 2003, when more than 900 people were infected after eating contaminated green onions at a restaurant.

California’s outbreak, however, is spreading from person to person, mostly among the homeless community.

The virus is transmitted from feces to mouth, so unsanitary conditions make it more likely to spread. The city of San Diego has installed dozens of handwashing stations and begun cleaning streets with bleach-spiked water in recent weeks.

McDonald said county health workers have vaccinated 57,000 people in the county who are either homeless, drug users or people in close contact with either group.

“The general population — if you’re not in one of those specific risk groups — is at very low risk, and we’re not recommending vaccinations,” he said.

The outbreak has also made its way to Santa Cruz and L.A. counties, where 70 and 12 people have been diagnosed, respectively.

Officials from both counties say they’ve vaccinated thousands of homeless people and will continue to do so.

New cases linked to the outbreak might not appear for weeks, because it can take up to 50 days for an infected person to show symptoms, said Santa Cruz public health manager Jessica Randolph.

“I don’t think the worst is over,” Randolph said.

Where next?

Tenderloin Health Services, a clinic in the San Francisco neighborhood known for its large homeless population, has been offering hepatitis A vaccines to its patients for weeks. The clinic recently held an event in which workers gave shots to 80 people in three hours, said Dr. Andrew Desruisseau, the clinic’s medical director.

“The cases in San Diego and the magnitude of the epidemic there certainly set off alarms in the Bay Area,” he said. So far, there have been 13 hepatitis A cases in San Francisco, but none associated with the outbreak.

Desruisseau said 90% of the clinic’s patients are homeless and many also have other liver problems or are drug users, making the disease especially dangerous.

Typically, only 1 out of every 100 people with hepatitis A dies from the disease, but it appears to have killed a higher rate of people in San Diego because of the population affected, experts say.

All 17 people who have died in the San Diego outbreak had underlying health conditions, including 16 who had liver problems such as hepatitis B or C, McDonald said.

Desruisseau said he was particularly concerned about conditions on the streets in San Francisco.

“With all of the housing crisis and gentrification in San Francisco, we’re seeing a much more condensed homeless population,” he said. “We have a lot of obstacles in keeping it a very sanitary place for our clients.”

Doctors and nurses in several California counties are beginning to offer vaccines to their homeless populations, as recommended by the state health department. Typically only children and people at high risk are vaccinated for hepatitis A.

In Orange County, which has had two hepatitis A cases linked to the outbreak, public health workers have given out 492 vaccines, mostly to homeless people, officials said. County nurses have also been visiting shelters and parks to vaccinate people.

Some officials, including in Riverside and Sacramento counties, also said they were reviewing their sanitation protocols for homeless encampments. An L.A. councilman recently called for more toilets in neighborhoods such as skid row and Venice in light of the local hepatitis cases.

Many have blamed San Diego’s outbreak on a lack of public bathrooms near homeless encampments.

In Oakland, city workers, represented by SEIU Local 1021, sent a letter to City Hall last month saying they feared a hepatitis A outbreak in the region’s homeless community. So far, there haven’t been any cases in Oakland or the rest of Alameda County, but city safety steward Brian Clay said he believed the city has allowed unsanitary conditions in homeless encampments.

Oakland city officials did not respond to a request for comment.

“There’s syringes, there’s human feces, there are dead animals, rats alive, and dead rats … pee bottles, five-gallon buckets used as toilets,” Clay said. “We’re definitely concerned about this added threat of hepatitis A.”

Nobel prize in physics awarded for discovery of gravitational waves | Science,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/03/nobel-prize-physics-discovery-gravitational-waves-ligo,"£825,000 prize awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for their work on Ligo experiment which was able to detect ripples in the fabric of spacetime

Three American physicists have won the Nobel prize in physics for the first observations of gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime that were anticipated by Albert Einstein a century ago.

Rainer Weiss has been awarded one half of the 9m Swedish kronor (£825,000) prize, announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on Tuesday. Kip Thorne and Barry Barish will share the other half of the prize.

'A new way to study our universe': what gravitational waves mean for future science Read more

All three scientists have played leading roles in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or Ligo, experiment, which in 2015 made the first historic observation of gravitational waves triggered by the violent merger of two black holes a billion light years away.

Prof Olga Botner, a member of the Nobel committee for physics, described this as “a discovery that shook the world”.

The Ligo detections finally confirmed Einstein’s century-old prediction that during cataclysmic events the fabric of spacetime itself can be stretched and squeezed, sending gravitational tremors out across the universe like ripples on a pond.

Q&A What is a gravitational wave? Show Hide Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicts that the presence of mass causes a curvature in spacetime. When massive objects merge, this curvature can be altered, sending ripples out across the universe. These are known as gravitational waves.By the time these disturbances reach us, they are almost imperceptible. It was only a century after Einstein's prediction that scientists developed a detector sensitive enough - the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory or Ligo - and were able to confirm the existence of gravitational waves.

The direct detection of gravitational waves also opens a new vista on the “dark” side of the cosmos, to times and places from which no optical light escapes. This includes just fractions of a second after the Big Bang, 13.7 billion years ago, when scientists believe gravitational waves left a permanent imprint on the cosmos that may still be perceptible today.

Speaking at a press conference after the announcement, Weiss, an emeritus professor of physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the 2015 detection was the culmination of decades of work, involving more than 1,000 scientists. “It’s as long as 40 years of people thinking about this, trying to make a detections, sometimes failing … and then slowly but surely getting the technology together to be able do it,” he said, adding that receiving the phone call from the Nobel committee had been “really wonderful”.

The notion that spacetime is malleable was first predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. But Einstein himself was unsure whether this was merely a mathematical illusion, and concluded that, in any case, the signal would be so tiny that it would “never play a role in science”.

It was a significant career gamble then, when in the mid-1970s Weiss and Thorne, who is now the Feynman professor of theoretical physics at California Institute of Technology, began on the decades-long quest to detect gravitational waves, which they believed could revolutionise our understanding of the universe.

Weiss designed a detector, called a laser-based inferometer, that he believed would be capable of measuring a signal so tiny that it could easily be masked by the background murmur of the ocean waves. Thorne, a theorist, began making crucial predictions of what the signal of a gravitational wave emanating from two black holes colliding would actually look like.

Independently, Ronald Drever, a Scottish physicist, also began building prototype detectors in Glasgow and after moving to Caltech, he, Weiss and Thorne formed a trio that laid the groundwork for Ligo. Drever died in March after suffering from dementia, and while the Nobel prize is not normally awarded posthumously, he is widely recognised as having made a decisive contribution.

Barry Barish, a former particle physicist at California Institute of Technology (now emeritus professor) came to the project at a much later stage, but is often credited for making Ligo happen. When he took over as its second director in 1994, the project was at risk of being cancelled. Barish turned things around and saw it through to construction.

In the end, detection required a peerless collaboration between experimentalists, who built one of the most sophisticated detectors on Earth, and theorists, who figured out what a signal from two black holes colliding would actually look like.

Ligo’s twin detectors, two pairs of 4km-long perpendicular pipes, one in Hanford, Washington state, the other in Livingston, Louisiana, are so sensitive that they can spot a distortion of a thousandth of the diameter of an atomic nucleus across a 4km length of laser beam.

Weiss recalled that when the detection was eventually made, his initial response was disbelief. “It took us a long time, almost two months, to convince ourselves that we had seen something from the outside that was truly a gravitational wave.”

The phenomenon detected was the collision of two giant black holes, one 35 times the mass of the sun, the other slightly smaller, 1.3 billion light years away. At the start of the 20 millisecond “chirp” in the signal, the two objects were found to be circling each other 30 times a second. By the end, the rate had accelerated to 250 times a second before meeting in a violent collision.



Since then, three further black hole collisions have been made and rumours are afoot that the consortium may have also observed the collision of a pair of neutron stars. In the future, scientists hope to supernovae, pulsars and the insides of stars as they collapse into black holes. A network of gravitational-wave observatories could even allow us to gaze back to almost the beginning of time itself.

Thorne said: “The prize rightfully belongs to the hundreds of Ligo scientists and engineers who built and perfected our complex gravitational-wave interferometers, and the hundreds of … scientists who found the gravitational-wave signals in Ligo’s noisy data and extracted the waves’ information.”

Barish said he was humbled and honoured to receive the award. “The detection of gravitational waves is truly a triumph of modern large-scale experimental physics,” he added.

Sheila Rowan, director of the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow, said: “We are really on the threshold of a whole new way to study our universe and that’s hugely exciting.”

Prof Paul Hardaker, chief executive officer of the Institute of Physics, said: “For as long as we have had astronomy we have used light in some form or another to understand how our universe works. This significant result marked the beginning of another way of viewing the universe, using gravity, which is what makes it such a major step forward, and so deserving of a Nobel prize.”

Sir Martin Rees, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Cambridge, and the Astronomer Royal, said this year’s laureates are “outstanding individuals and whose contributions were distinctive and complementary”. However, he said the decision to award individuals rather than collaborations was increasingly problematic, and did not reflect the nature of modern science.



Last year’s prize went to three British physicists for their work on exotic states of matter that may pave the way for quantum computers and other revolutionary technologies.

General Motors Is Going All Electric,https://www.wired.com/story/general-motors-electric-cars-plan-gm/,"After more than a century peddling vehicles that pollute the atmosphere, General Motors is ending its relationship with gasoline and diesel. This morning, the American automotive giant announced that it is working toward an all-electric, zero-emissions future. That starts with two new, fully electric models next year—then at least 18 more by 2023.

That product onslaught puts the company at the forefront of an increasingly large crowd of automakers proclaiming the age of electricity and promising to move away from gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles. In recent months, Volvo, Aston Martin, and Jaguar Land Rover have announced similar moves. GM’s declaration, though, is particularly noteworthy because it’s among the very largest automakers on the planet. It sold 10 million cars last year, ranging from pickups to SUVs to urban runabouts.

“General Motors believes the future is all-electric,” says Mark Reuss, the company’s head of product. “We are far along in our plan to lead the way to that future world.”

Reuss did not give a date for the death knell of the GM gas- or diesel-powered car, saying the transition will happen at different speeds in different markets and regions. The new all-electric models will be a mix of battery electric cars and fuel cell-powered vehicles.

To be sure, GM’s sudden jolt of electricity is planned with its shareholders in mind. The Trump Administration may be moving to roll back fuel efficiency requirements in the US, but the rest of the world is insisting on an electric age. France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Norway have all said they plan to ban the sale of gas and diesel cars in the coming decades. More importantly, China—the world’s largest car market—and India, a rising star, plan to join them. No automaker can compete globally without a compelling stable of electric cars.

GM intends to grab as large a slice of the Chinese market as possible. It has previously announced plans to launch 10 electric or hybrid electric cars in the country by 2020. This summer, it started selling a two-seat EV there, for just $5,300. Last year, it sold more cars in China (3.6 million) than it did in the US (3 million).

The crucial question for the American automaker will be how, exactly, to make money from all these cars. By one report, GM loses $9,000 on each Chevy Bolt it sells. Reuss’ strategy hinges on bringing costs down thanks to steadily dropping battery prices, more efficient motors, and lighter cars. Massive scale and global supply chains helps, too. “This next generation will be profitable,” he says. “End of story.”

It's not impossible. “If they’ve really been laying this groundwork, they could be closer to not just having this tech but having a profitable and high volume way of supplying it,"" says Karl Brauer, an auto industry analyst with Kelley Blue Book.

General Motors’ history hasn’t been especially kind to electric mobility. Its invention of the automatic starter helped kill the first wave of electric cars at the start of the 20th century. This is the company that experimented with battery power in the EV-1, only to recall the two-seater from its owners, crush them all, and pile the carcasses up in a junkyard. In the first years of the 21st century, while Toyota was making hybrids popular with the Prius, GM was hawking the Hummer.

Over the past decade, the Detroit giant has positioned itself for a different sort of future. First came the hybrid electric Chevy Volt. Then came GM’s great coup, the Chevy Bolt, the 200-mile, $30,000 electric car that hit market long before Tesla’s Model 3. GM is seriously pursuing semi-autonomous and fully driverless cars. It offers the first car on US roads with vehicle-to-vehicle communication capability. Now, it talks about its plans to eliminate vehicle pollution, congestion, and traffic deaths.

“GM has the ability to get all of us to that future so much faster,” Reuss says. Now it just has to deliver—and make enough money doing it to stick around for that future.

Gunman fires upon Las Vegas concert",http://abcnews.go.com/US/50-dead-200-injured-las-vegas-deadliest-shooting/story?id=50223240,"Las Vegas shooting death toll rises to 59, no apparent connection to international terror The shooting happened across the street from a country music festival.

 -- At least 59 people were killed and 527 injured in Las Vegas Sunday night when a gunman opened fire on a music festival crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, in what is now the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.

The death toll from the incident could possibly go up, said Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg in a press conference Monday afternoon.

Jason Aldean was the headliner of Sunday night's concert; video showed him rushing off the stage amid the gunfire. Other performers from this weekend included country stars Jake Owen, Big & Rich, Luke Combs and Dylan Scott.

'Nonstop gunfire' sends concertgoers scrambling for cover

One witness described the shooting as ""nonstop gunfire.""

Terrified bystanders ducked and ran, while some sprang into action, frantically caring for the wounded. Concertgoers who had just been enjoying the final night of the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival, which was taking place across the street from Mandalay Bay, made makeshift stretchers out of police barricades.

An official with Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport said ""an airport perimeter fence near the concert venue was breached by people fleeing the scene of the incident,"" and airport staff ""transported those people to the designated evacuation site.""

A spokesperson for Allegiant Air said about 30 people who fled onto the airfield were sheltered overnight at one of the airline's facilities there. The airline said its staff helped people get clothes, charge their phones and contact loved ones.

First responders arrive to a bloody scene

As ambulances rushed to the scene, first responders plugged wounds with their bare hands and used their clothing to try to stanch each other's bleeding. At least one man described a stranger who died in his arms.

In addition to gunshot wounds, victim suffered injuries from shrapnel, from climbing fences and from being trampled, said Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell.

An off-duty Las Vegas police officer who was attending the concert is among the dead, police said. No on-duty emergency response personnel were injured, Cassell said.

23 firearms were found in shooter's hotel suite

Authorities said the suspected gunman -- 64-year-old Mesquite, Nevada, resident Stephen Paddock -- checked into the Mandalay Bay hotel Thursday and brought the numerous firearms found in his room himself.

Two sources familiar with the investigation said there was a combination of rifles and handguns at the scene, and one of the sources said there were 23 weapons in the room. While he used multiple rifles in the attack, it is not yet clear whether he utilized them all, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said in a press conference Monday afternoon, adding that some of the rifles had scope.

Ammunition and more than 10 suitcases were found in the room, Lombardo said. At one point, Paddock engaged with a security guard, who was shot in the leg through a doorway, Lombardo said.

In the wake of the shooting, the Las Vegas Police Department said authorities responded to a room on the 32nd floor of the hotel, where Paddock was found dead. Police said they believe Paddock killed himself prior to police entry.

Authorities believe Paddock used a device similar to a hammer to smash the windows of his two-room suite. After the shooting, Mandalay Bay and other hotels in the vicinity of the attack were placed on lockdown at the request of authorities, the resort said in a statement.

At least one gun dealer came forward to authorities to say that he sold weapons to Paddock, Lombardo said. Chris Michel, owner of Dixie Gunworx in St. George, Utah, told ABC News that Paddock came into his store three times -- always by himself. The first two times Paddock didn't buy anything, but the third time, he bought a shotgun. It is unclear is Michel is the gun dealer referenced by police.

Michel said Paddock seemed like ""an average, everyday"" guy and that his purchase was ""legal in every way."" He added that he does not know if the gun he told to him was used in the massacre.

A motive is still unclear

Police said Paddock had no criminal history, save a minor citation.

Eric Paddock, the suspected shooter’s brother, told ABC News, ""We have no idea how or why this happened.""

“As far as we know, Steve was perfectly fine,” he said.

Authorities initially said they were looking to speak with a companion of the shooter, Marilou Danley, whom Lombardo said he believes to be Paddock's girlfriend.

While Danley is out of the country, police said Monday morning that ""detectives have made contact with her and do not believe she is involved with the shooting.""

However, authorities will continue their investigation into Danley, Lombardo said. Police said she is out of the country and it's believed the suspect was using some of her identification.

The motive for the attack was unclear.

""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath,"" Lombardo said at a news conference this morning.

Officials said Monday morning they have found no connection between the shooting and any international terrorist group. Officials added that the suspect was not known to law enforcement.

Witnesses describe the attack

Mark Mullen -- who was staying on the 29th floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel -- told ABC News that when the shots broke out, he was sitting in his room and listening to the concert while doing prep work for a conference scheduled for Monday.

Mullen said he thought the noise was fireworks at first, but when he looked out the window, he couldn't see anything.

""The noise continued, but there were no fireworks, and it quickly became apparent what was happening,"" he said.

People in the crowd hunkered down as the shots rang out, and begin running again when they stopped, Mullen said. The crowd would then stop again as the gunshots resumed, he said.

From his vantage point, it wasn't clear where the shots were coming from, Mullen said. But his colleagues who were staying on the 32nd floor texted him when they heard the SWAT team arrive, so he knew that something was going on at the hotel, he said.

Mullen said he could see sheriff's officers walking through the hall with guns drawn through the peephole in his hotel room door. He could also see a police helicopter flying very close to the hotel and shining a light near the shooter's room, he said.

Videos filmed by onlookers gave a window into the chaos that ensued as the gunfire rang out, with some thinking that fireworks were going off.

Witness Brian Claypool, who was sitting in a VIP area near the near the stage, said on ""Good Morning America"" on Monday that after the first round of gunfire, he ran into a little room that he described as a production area.

""The hardest for me was, I saw six young women. They were maybe 20, 22. They were all crying on the ground. I was trying to be calm,"" Claypool said, appearing emotional.

""I thought [about] the Orlando shooting,"" he said of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting that left 49 people dead. ""Because we were in this room. We didn’t know where the shooter was. We thought he was going to jump the fence and come in this room and shoot us all... I’m thinking, 'Am I going to die in this room?'""

Claypool said he tried to bring comfort to the young women who were sheltering in the room with him.

""I said to myself, 'These girls aren’t going to die. I’m not going to die,'” he said. “'I need to get home to see my daughter. This is not happening.'""

""Then the shooting stopped,"" Claypool said, ""And I peeked out the front of the door ... police officers scream, ‘Go! Go!’""

Concertgoer Mike Cronk told ABC News that as Aldean was playing, it ""kind of sounded like some fireworks going off. I think there was the first kind of volley, and then all of the sudden second volley. My buddy's like, 'I just got hit, you know.' He got hit three times. Then people started diving for the ground.

""It was pretty much chaotic,"" Cronk continued. ""Lots of people got hit.""

Cronk said EMTs and ex-military members hunkered down to help his friend and other victims survive. Cronk said he started to staunch his friend's bullet wounds under the direction of a woman who was with them.

Stabilizing his friend as best he could, Cronk said he and four other people tending to the wounded attempted to get to a hospital by hopping into the bed of a pickup truck.

Cronk was beside himself with emotion as he described helping a badly injured man into an ambulance. The man ended up dying in Cronk's arms.

Jasmine Barbusca, a mother of two, told ABC News, ""All you heard were just gunshots. And every time the gunshots would come down, you just start getting to the ground. And when they would stop, you get up and you just try to climb the fence again. We finally made it over. We were running through the parking lot; everybody just ran through the streets.""

She said she was thinking, ""'I got to get out, I’m going to be dead in five seconds.'""

""There were men going over their wives, their girlfriends, to block them,"" she recalled. ""Unfortunately, those men got shot, but I mean, there were lives saved.""

Barbusca said she saw one man as he helped many women climb the fence to escape.

""I don’t know who the man was, but there was a man who probably saved a good 20 women’s lives. He was really brave,"" she said.

Tearing up, she said, ""How I did not get shot... by the grace of God. I honestly... we ran. I don’t know.""

The investigation into Paddock continues

By Monday afternoon, investigators had finished processing the hotel room at Mandalay Bay, the location of the music festival and Paddock's home in Mesquite, and SWAT officers were standing by another house in northern Nevada, Lombardo said.

Authorities found 19 additional firearms, explosive and some 1,000 rounds of ammunition at the Mesquite home, Lombardo said.

Police confirmed this evening that that they found several pounds of ammonium nitrate -- a material used to make explosives -- inside the suspect’s car.

Agents for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have responded to the scene and the FBI is assisting with the investigation. ATF said it is ""conducting an urgent trace"" on the recovered weapons.

Fasulo refuted rumors of a second shooter, saying there is ""no information or evidence"" to suggest that more than one shooter was involved. There is no ongoing threat to the Las Vegas area, he added.

Officials thank first responders and the community

Officials praised first responders, doctors and community members in the wake of the mass shooting.

Congresswoman Dina Titus, who represents the 1st district of Nevada, which includes Las Vegas, citing acts of heroism by community members and off-duty police officers during the attack and medical personnel caring for people in the parking lots of the overcrowded hospitals. Titus added that a friend of one of staff members was trampled, and a stranger pulled her up and took her to safety.

""Las Vegas is resilient,"" Titus said. ""With everybody pulling together, we will get through this.""

Lombardo said he was ""very proud"" of what the officers on the scene did, saying that while they train for active shooter situations, ""this is different than anything you train for because the active shooter is unreachable.""

A total of 108 firefighters from four different fire departments were on the scene, as well as several ambulances from private companies, Cassell said. People on the scene ""rallied everything they could"" to get the injured to the staging area, including vans and pickup trucks, Cassell said.

So many people have donated blood that officials informed the public not to go to the donation centers until at least Tuesday afternoon, saying that they have ""enough supply for the foreseeable future.""

Mandalay Bay Resort also thanked area first responders, tweeting, ""Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims of last night's tragic events. We’re grateful for the immediate actions of our first responders.""

Officials set up a family assistance center at the Las Vegas Convention Center, where family members can provide information about the identities of loved ones so authorities can identify the victims ""as fast as possible,"" Fudenberg said. The center is the best way for locals to get assistance, Fasulo said.

Police said family and friends looking for their loved ones can call 1-800-536-9488.

Area hotels, including MGM Resorts International, are coordinating rooms at no cost for families coming into town, and the American Red Cross established headquarters at the Circus Circus Hotel & Resort, Fasulo said.

A GoFundMe account started by Lombardo and Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak to help victims and their families pay for funeral and travel expenses received nearly $2.4 million in donations by Monday evening. One donor alone pledged $400,000, Sisolak said.

Multiple vigils will be held in the Las Vegas Monday afternoon.

Aldean, who performed at the country concert Sunday night, wrote on Instagram, ""Tonight has been beyond horrific. I still dont know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that Me and my Crew are safe. My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night."""

"Police will be deployed at polling stations to prevent people from voting in the Catalan independence referendum, the Spanish government has confirmed.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/26/spain-deploys-police-to-prevent-catalan-independence-vote-catalonia,"Police will be deployed at polling stations to prevent people from voting in the Catalan independence referendum, the Spanish government has confirmed.



Although the Catalonia regional government has insisted the unilateral poll will go ahead on Sunday, the Spanish government has vowed to stop the vote, which it says is a clear violation of the constitution. Spain’s constitutional court has suspended the legislation underpinning the referendum while it rules on its legality.

A spokesman for the Spanish government’s Catalan delegation said on Tuesday that the region’s prosecutor had ordered the Mossos d’Esquadra, Catalonia’s police force, to take control of polling booths and identify those in charge.

“The order has been conveyed and it will be executed with all normality,” he said.

The Spanish government said the steps it had taken over the past week, including raiding Catalan government offices, arresting 14 officials and seizing almost 10m ballot papers, meant the vote could not take place.

“Today we can affirm that there will be no effective referendum in Catalonia,” the Spanish government’s representative in Catalonia, Enric Millo, told reporters on Tuesday. “All the referendum’s logistics have been dismantled.”

Timeline Eight key moments in the Catalan independence campaign Show Spain’s constitutional court strikes down parts of a 2006 charter on Catalan autonomy that had originally increased the region’s fiscal and judicial powers and described it as a “nation”. The court rules that using the word “nation” has no legal value and also rejects the “preferential” use of Catalan over Spanish in municipal services. Almost two weeks later, hundreds of thousands protest on the streets of Barcelona, chanting “We are a nation! We decide!” At the height of Spain’s economic crisis, more than a million people protest in Barcelona on Catalonia’s national day, demanding independence in what will become a peaceful, annual show of strength. The pro-independence government of Artur Mas defies the Madrid government and Spain’s constitutional court by holding a symbolic vote on independence. Turnout is just 37%, but more than 80% of those who voted - 1.8 million people - vote in favour of Catalan sovereignty. Carles Puigdemont, who has replaced Mas as regional president, announces an independence referendum will be held on 1 October. Spain’s central government says it will block the referendum using all the legal and political means at its disposal. The Catalan parliament approves referendum legislation after a heated, 11-hour session that sees 52 opposition MPs walk out of the chamber in Barcelona in protest at the move. Spain’s constitutional court suspends the legislation the following day, but the Catalan government vows to press ahead with the vote. Police arrest 14 Catalan government officials suspected of organising the referendum and announce they have seized nearly 10 million ballots destined for the vote. Some 40,000 people protest against the police crackdown in Barcelona and Puigdemont accuses the Spanish government of effectively suspending regional autonomy and declaring a de facto state of emergency. Close to 900 people are injured as police attempt to stop the referendum from taking place. The Catalan government says 90% voted for independence on a turnout of 43%. Spanish government takes control of Catalonia and dissolves its parliament after secessionist Catalan MPs voted to establish an independent republic. Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, fires regional president, Carles Puigdemont, and orders regional elections to be held on 21 December.

In an order to police issued on Monday, the prosecutor’s office said it would take the names of anyone participating in the vote and confiscate relevant documents.



Anyone in possession of the keys or entrance codes to a polling booth could be considered a collaborator to crimes of disobedience, misuse of office and misappropriation of funds, the order said.

However, despite the words and actions of the Spanish government, not to mention the deployment of thousands of extra police officers to Catalonia, the regional government is adamant that the referendum cannot be stopped.

Catalonia’s regional president, Carles Puigdemont, has accused the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, of acting “beyond the limits of a respectable democracy” in his efforts to prevent the referendum.

He has also compared the Spanish government’s behaviour to the repression of the Franco era and said it is only serving to drive more Catalans towards independence.



In Huelva, in the south-western region of Andalucía, Guardia Civil officers dispatched to Catalonia for the referendum were draped in Spanish flags and cheered on by locals with cries of: “Go for them!”

In Barcelona, residents have been giving out red carnations to regional police, a nod to Portugal’s 1974 revolution that toppled its military dictatorship, when people put red carnations in the barrels of soldiers’ guns.

Q&A Why does the Spanish government say the Catalan referendum is illegal? Show The Spanish government argues that any referendum on Catalan independence would be illegal because the country’s 1978 constitution makes no provision for a vote on self-determination. The Spanish constitutional court, which has suspended the referendum law pushed through the Catalan parliament in September, is looking into whether the law breaches the constitution. In March this year, the former Catalan president Artur Mas was banned from holding public office for two years after being found guilty of disobeying the constitutional court by holding a symbolic independence referendum three years ago.

Speaking in Washington alongside Donald Trump, Rajoy said a unilateral declaration of independence would be “very wrong” and questioned the integrity of Sunday’s vote.

“There isn’t an electoral committee, there isn’t a team at the Catalan government organising a referendum, there aren’t ballots, there aren’t people at the voting stations,” he said.



The US president sided with Rajoy, saying it would be “foolish” for Catalans to try to leave Spain. “I think that Spain is a great country and it should remain united,” he said.

Trump repeatedly referred to Rajoy as “president”, even though he is prime minister of the country, which is a monarchy.

The US state department said recently that the White House has no position on the referendum and it would work with any government or entity that comes out of the vote.



Polls suggest that although more than 70% of Catalonia’s 7.5 million people are in favour of holding a referendum, they are fairly evenly divided on the issue of independence.

More than 80% of participants opted for independence in a symbolic vote three years ago, but only 2.3 million of the 5.4 million eligible voters took part."
US Army unprepared to deal with Russia in Europe: A self-assessment by the 173rd Airborne Brigade is called 'a real eye-opener' to how some critical capabilities to deter Russia have eroded.,http://www.politico.eu/article/us-army-unprepared-to-deal-with-russia-in-europe/,"Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, commanding general of the US Army in Europe, chats with soldiers during an exercise in July | Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images

The U.S. Army’s rapid reaction force in Europe is under-equipped, undermanned and inadequately organized to confront military aggression from Russia or its high-tech proxies, according to an internal study that some who have read it view as a wake-up call as the Trump administration seeks to deter an emboldened Vladimir Putin.

The Italy-based 173rd Airborne Brigade, a bulwark of the NATO alliance that has spent much of the last decade and a half rotating in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan, lacks “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed,” according to the analysis by the brigade, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the unit’s paratroopers were the first American troops to reach the Baltic states to deter another potential incursion on NATO’s eastern flank.

But the assessment details a series of “capability gaps” the unit has identified during recent training with Ukrainian troops with experience battling Russian-backed separatists, who have used cheap drones and electronic warfare tools to pinpoint targets for artillery barrages and devastated government armored vehicles with state-of-the-art Russian antitank missiles.

Some of the shortfalls, like the brigade’s lack of air defense and electronic warfare units and over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems, are the direct results of the Army’s years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the enemy has no air power or other high-end equipment and technology.

“The lessons we learned from our Ukrainian partners were substantial. It was a real eye-opener on the absolute need to look at ourselves critically,” Col. Gregory Anderson, who commissioned the report earlier this year during his stint as the brigade’s commander, told POLITICO after it had obtained a copy of the report. “We felt compelled to write about our experiences and pass on what we saw and learned.”

The report has so far been distributed only through internal channels to the Army staff and other military headquarters.

The analysis comes to light as Russia gears up for one of the largest military exercises in the post-Soviet era — a weeklong war game called Zapad that could involve as many as 100,000 troops and will be held later this month in Belarus. It also comes as the Pentagon seeks to step up its effort to deter Russia, including by rotating other American ground units on a temporary basis into Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries to demonstrate resolve. That’s part of an Obama administration effort known as the European Reassurance Initiative.

The 173rd Airborne Brigade, based in Vicenza, Italy, parachuted into Iraq in the early days of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and saw intense combat in Afghanistan. While its roughly 4,000 soldiers would be no match for a Russian assault on Europe on their own, the 173rd is considered a primary element in deterring Moscow from threatening NATO’s borders — particularly since the departure of two U.S. Army tank brigades from Germany was completed in 2013.

Yet years of deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, where the 173rd mostly confronted ragtag groups of insurgents, have dulled some of its skills in the type of higher-end combat that Russia has been sharpening in Ukraine, the report found.

Some of the problems the report identifies have low-tech solutions that the Army could implement relatively easily. Amazingly, camouflage nets to hide vehicles from enemy helicopters or drones are “hard-to-find luxuries for tactical units.”

The 173rd’s aging up-armored Humvees, designed to protect against roadside bombs in Iraq, would be “easy prey” for Russian armored vehicles, and the report recommends replacing them with the forthcoming Ground Mobility Vehicle, a much lighter-weight, more mobile truck. The Army announced this summer that it is buying nearly 300 of these vehicles from General Dynamics to equip the 173rd and stateside paratroop and special operations units, although none will carry the 30 mm guns that the report recommends some be outfitted with.

The report also calls for the brigade to be equipped with a small contingent of light tanks, which would offer much-needed protection to forward scouts against Russian anti-armor missiles. That solution is likely a ways off. The Army is only expected to issue a formal request for proposals for its light tank program later this year, a first step to developing a new weapon system.

Even if the service quickly settles on an already available prototype, it will be several years before the new vehicles reach the 173rd or other Army units. In the meantime, the brigade will have to rely on heavy armor units that rotate regularly from stateside bases.

The common thread running through the paper is the challenge posed by Russia’s jammers and other electronic warfare tools.

An enemy equipped with these “could effectively neutralize a GPS system from 50 miles away using one-fifth the power of a tactical radio,” the report estimates, so “we should assume that GPS will be either unavailable or unreliable for the duration of the conflict if the [brigade] faces a near-peer threat or sophisticated non-state actors.”

Here, too, some of the solutions are low-tech. High-frequency or HF radios are more difficult for enemy electronic warfare specialists to pinpoint and jam than the satellite radios that have become the norm for U.S. units over the past 15 years. HF radio equipment and training have fallen by the wayside in the American military during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but not in some allied militaries.

The shortfalls have required the 173rd to call on allies from Latvia to help it learn how to communicate in the face of Russian jamming — a stark indicator of how badly knowledge of a key communication method has degraded in the American force.

In February, according to the paper, a Latvian military communications specialist spent a week teaching HF techniques to the 173rd, and since then, the brigade’s paratroopers have honed their HF proficiency during a joint exercise with Latvian troops in Germany. To fix the problem, though, the Army needs to systemically resume teaching HF radio communications stateside, the report says.

U.S. artillery also relies heavily on GPS, and as the 173rd has learned during exercises in the Baltic states, there is more to breaking that dependency. Before GPS, artillerymen used a set of star charts called the Army Ephemeris to precisely estimate their positions before targeting the enemy — and the Army has not updated those charts in more than two decades.

To better protect against jamming and spoofing and go on the offensive against enemy drones, the brigade and other Europe-based units have recently bought off-the-shelf commercial systems, and a more capable Army system is scheduled to come online in 2023 — but the report says the 173rd needs better jamming gear sooner than that, along with 10 small teams of electronic warfare specialists to use it.

Meanwhile, according to a military source who spoke with POLITICO, a sister unit from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Poland has had to depend on Romanian troops to operate short-range anti-aircraft guns. And the paratroop brigade lacks “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed.

“These ideas and proposals are potentially useful for all airborne brigades, and for the Army writ large,” the report notes.

Some former Army officers who have read the report agree, and hope the document acts as an alarm bell for the service at a time of renewed focus on Eastern Europe and tension with Russia.

“The report is framed as being about the 173rd, but it’s really about more than the 173rd. It’s about what the Army needs to do,” said Adrian Bonenberger, a former infantry officer who fought with the brigade in Afghanistan and now lives in Ukraine, studying and writing about the conflict there. “If Russia uses electronic warfare to jam the brigade’s artillery, and its anti-tank weapons can’t penetrate any of the Russian armor, and they’re able to confuse and disrupt and quickly overwhelm those paratroopers, we could be in for a long war.”"

Texas Muslims are turning mosques into shelters for Hurricane Harvey victims,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/muslims-opening-mosques-hurricane-harvey-victims-islamic-society-greater-houston-m-j-khan-a7921901.html,"Mosques across the state of Texas are being turned into shelters for the victims of Hurricane Harvey.

The Islamic Society of Greater Houston (ISGH), which represents 21 Islamic centres in the area, has opened four of their properties as functioning 24-hour shelters.

They will provide “a dry place to stay, food and emotional support for displaced residents”, its website says.

The society is partnering with Muslim charity Baitulmaal, which is making hygiene products, food and water available to those in need.

M J Khan, president of ISGH told the Mic news website: ""This is an obligation, a religious obligation to help others. When you give you don’t give only to your own family… You give to anybody who needs help.”

In the beginning there was some difficulty, as many roads leading to the mosques were inaccessible. However Mr Khan made some phone calls, and volunteers soon arrived with bottled water, sleeping bags and supplies.

The numbers of Muslim volunteers grew so large that many were instructed to offer their services at local city shelters.

The ISGH have also been fundraising, and both money and additional supplies are making their way to Houston from the Muslim community across America.

In addition, 50 doctors from the community have offered their services, should anybody need it.

“We have mosques all over the greater Houston area,” Mr Khan said. “If you have no place to go, go to your neighbourhood mosque.”

"'Send prayers': Texas Secretary of State Rolando Pablos turns down donated blankets, beds, manpower from Canada",http://www.rawstory.com/2017/09/send-prayers-texas-republican-turns-down-donated-blankets-beds-manpower-from-canada/,"Those who have been impacted by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana are only beginning to see the way the flood waters have destroyed their homes. Many families tried to ride it out, only to be rescued when the rising waters forced them onto their roof. Thousands escaped with only their lives and the clothes on their backs, losing everything they own.

But according to Secretary of State Rolando Pablos (R-TX), they don’t need any help. As Patheos reported, they just need a little more Jesus.

Quebec’s Minister of International Relations Christine St-Pierre called Pablos to express her sorrow and condolences on behalf of the people of the Canadian province. She also offered equipment and manpower.

Pablos turned it down. Instead he asked for “prayers from the people of Quebec,” the minister relayed.

Understandably, the neighbor to the north was shocked.

“It was a conversation about how devastating the situation is and we want to express our support to the people of Texas,” she told CBC News in an interview.

This isn’t the first time the Canadians have stepped up with substantial donations. After Hurricane Katrina, they also sent the donation of blankets, beds, pillows, hygienic products as well as electricians to help restore power. Louisiana was more than grateful to accept. Texas was a no. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, by contrast, graciously accepted a generous offer from Mexico for assistance.

“He was very touched by the fact we called him,” she noted.

Germany achieves near record budget surplus of ?18.3bn,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/08/25/germany-achieves-near-record-budget-surplus-183bn/,"Germany achieved a near record budget surplus of €18.3bn (£16.8bn) in the first half of 2017, according to government figures released on Friday.

The timing of the figures could not be better for Angela Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term as chancellor in elections next month.

The surplus is the second largest Germany has recorded since reunification in 1990. The country recorded an even bigger surplus of €28.8bn in the second half of 2000, but that was boosted by a government windall from the sale of mobile phone licenses.

By contrast, the surplus for the first half of 2017 was fuelled by higher tax revenues than expected, as the German economy continues perform strongly.

Unemployment fell to just 3.8 per cent in June, when measured by the International Labour Organisation standards used in the UK.

High government spending on housing and integration for the more than 1m asylum-seekers who have arrived in Germany sincd 2015 is also believed to have driven the strong figures.

Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, has long insisted on a balanced budget — the “black zero”, as it is known is Germany.

An unconfirmed report in Bild newspaper this week claimed Mr Schäuble is working on a proposal to give southern Eurozone economies extra EU funding during recessions."

Malala Yousafzai has said she is “so excited” after gaining a place at the University of Oxford.

The 20-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner, who narrowly avoided death in 2012 after being shot by the Pakistani Taliban for her outspoken campaigning over girls’ rights to an education, tweeted a screenshot of the confirmation that she will study Philosophy, Politics and Economics.

She previously told a conference she had received an offer, which was conditional of achieving three As at A-Level, but did not reveal the institution.

So excited to go to Oxford!! Well done to all A-level students – the hardest year. Best wishes for life ahead! pic.twitter.com/miIwK6fNSf — Malala (@Malala) August 17, 2017

She said: “So excited to go to Oxford!!

“Well done to all A-level students – the hardest year. Best wishes for life ahead!”

Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, tweeted: “My heart is full of gratitude. We are grateful to Allah & thank u 2 al those who support @Malala 4 the grand cause of education.”

Ms Yousafzai will be following in the footsteps of world leaders by studying a course that has been dubbed the degree that “rules” Britain by the media.

Notable alumni include former premier of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto, a heroine of Ms Yousafzai, and Burma’s pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi as well as former British prime minister David Cameron and his one-time Labour opponent Ed Miliband.

Ms Yousafzai’s opportunity may have been unimaginable five years ago.

Her career as an activist began in early 2009, when she started writing a blog for the BBC about her life under Taliban occupation and promoting education for girls in Pakistan’s Swat Valley.

But her campaign angered local militants and she was shot in the head during an assassination attempt while taking the bus to school.

She was treated at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital and made the city her home, going on to study at Edgbaston High School in Birmingham since 2013.

Two years ago, Ms Yousafzai received 6A*s and 4As during her GCSEs.

The grades included A*s in maths, biology, chemistry and physics, and As in history and geography.

She also got an A* in religious studies and a maths IGCSE, as well as As in English language and literature.

In 2014 she became the youngest person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and her campaign for children’s rights to education across the world has seen her addressing the United Nations on the issue."

David Crosby has no time for Ted Nugent whining that he hasn’t been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame because of his conservative politics.

After the Trump-supporting rocker told a radio station that he thinks he’s been excluded from the Hall because of his outspoken support for the National Rifle Association, Crosby offered a different explanation, the Daily News reported.

“The a–hole just isn’t good enough,” Crosby responded to a fan on Twitter.

In a follow-up tweet, Crosby added that Nugent’s hit single, “Cat Scratch Fever,” didn’t qualify him for the honor.

Crosby, 76, has been inducted into the Hall twice for his contributions to the Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash.

Nugent, 68, is one of the few openly conservative musicians. He visited President Trump at the White House in April, along with Kid Rock and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. He has also been known to employ vitriolic rhetoric over politicians he doesn’t agree with, as when he defended the Second Amendment by saying that Barack Obama, while running for president the first time in 2008, should “suck my machine gun.”

When Obama was running for reelection in 2012, the rocker said during the National Rifle Association convention that, “If Barack Obama becomes the president in November, again, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year.” The statement attracted the attention of the Secret Service.

Nugent vowed to be “more selective with my rants and in my words” after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was critically injured by a gunman who targeted GOP lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice in June.

Last week, Nugent went off on Rolling Stone founder Jan Wenner during an interview with an Albany radio station. Wenner is also co-founder and vice chairman of the Hall of Fame.

Nugent said Wenner “hates freedom, he hates the Second Amendment, he hates me, because I’m on the board of directors — quite proudly — of the National Rifle Association for, like, 26 years.”

He said he’s as almost as popular among NRA members as the late Charlton Heston. “I couldn’t be more proud of that, ’cause the NRA is the ultimate family, grassroots organization that fights for the right to defend ourselves.”

“What kind of numbnut would be against that?” he continued. “And so I’m on the board of directors of the NRA, Jan Wenner hates the Second Amendment, so that’s the only reason I’m not in the Rock and Roll of Fame. And until they get their heads out of their ass, I’m more than happy to do what I do and do it with all the vim and vigor that I do it every night.”"
One billion trees planted in Pakistani province in two years,https://www.voanews.com/a/one-billion-trees-planted-in-pakistan-nw-province/3983609.html,"ISLAMABAD - Pakistan’s northwestern province, Khyber Pakhtunkhaw (KPK), has planted an unprecedented 1 billion trees in just more than two years and surpassed an international commitment of restoring 350,000 hectares of forests and degraded land.

The massive effort aims to turn the tide on land degradation and loss in the mountainous, formerly forested KPK, which lies in the Hindu Kush mountain range.

Imran Khan, head of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party governing the province, launched the reforestation campaign, dubbed “Billion Tree Tsunami,” in 2015.

?Goal reached early

The cricket-star-turned politician revealed to VOA that the goal of adding 1 billion trees by planting and natural regeneration has been achieved this month, well ahead of the original deadline of December 2017.

He says his party plans to organize a special event in Islamabad in late August to celebrate the successful completion of the project, and experts as well as foreign diplomats will be invited.

“We will show them by coordinates, on Google map you can go and see where these trees have been planted, 1 billion trees, this is now the model for the rest of Pakistan,” Khan said.

?High deforestation rate

Pakistan is seventh on the list of the countries mostly likely to be affected by global warming and has one of the highest deforestation rates in Asia. Decades of tree felling have reduced the country’s forests to less than 3 percent of its land area. About 40 percent of the remaining forests are in KPK.

Khan hopes his reforestation drive will decrease the effects of global warming and natural disasters like floods that cause devastation in KPK and elsewhere in Pakistan every year.

“If you plant trees, we have discovered, by the river banks it sustains the rivers. But most importantly, the glaciers that are melting in the mountains, and one of the biggest reasons is because there has been a massive deforestation. So, this billion tree is very significant for our future,” Khan said.

Watch: Imran Khan Discuss Initiative

Bonn Challenge

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in a statement Friday congratulated the Pakistani province on reaching the “momentous milestone.”

“This marks the first Bonn Challenge pledge to reach its restoration goal,” the organization noted.

The Bonn Challenge, set up in 2011, calls for the restoration of 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded lands by 2020, and 350 million hectares by 2030.

More than 20 countries have so far responded to the challenge, expressing an ambition to restore more than 60 million hectors by 2020 with more commitments expected.

KPK’s reforestation campaign made it the only province or subnational entity to be included in the Bonn Challenge.

“The Billion Tree Tsunami initiative is a true conservation success story, one that further demonstrates Pakistan’s leadership role in the international restoration effort and continued commitment to the Bonn Challenge,” acknowledged Inger Anderson, director general of IUCN.

Nurseries produce 25,000 saplings

Provincial officials say the campaign has achieved its restoration target through a combination of protected natural regeneration, 60 percent, and planned afforestation, 40 percent.

Many small-scale nurseries, producing up to 25,000 saplings each, have been set up with cash advances and a guaranteed purchase agreement from the provincial government.

The KPK government has invested $123 million to help establish 13,000 private tree nurseries in almost every district of the province, producing hundreds of thousands of saplings of local and imported tree varieties, including pines, walnuts and eucalyptus, officials say.

Local economies benefit

This has boosted local incomes, generated thousands of green jobs, and empowered unemployed youth and women in the province. An additional $100 million will be allocated to maintain the project through June 2020.

“This support makes the project one of the largest eco-investments ever made in Pakistan,” according to the IUCN.

It noted the newly planted trees are reinforcing riverbanks and add tree resources to agricultural lands engaged in farm forestry. They also improve biodiversity by restoring wildlife shelters and contribute to CO2 sequestration through new tree plantations.

“But we could not have done it if the local communities were not involved,” Khan said. “The local communities first grew the nurseries and then amongst them people who then protected the trees, the saplings when they were planted. It is one of the most successful experiments ever, and we have 85 percent survival rate.”

Experts at World Wildlife Fund-Pakistan, which is monitoring and auditing the tree-planting effort in KPK, say the project has been an environmental, economic and social success, with one of the highest survival rates of trees in the world, ranging from 70 to 90 percent.

“If the trend continues, there will be more birds, there will be more microbes, there will be more insects, so there will be more animals, so more habitats. The ecosystem will kind of literally revive in certain places. There will be more rains because we do need rains,” Hamaad Khan Naqi, WWF-Pakistan’s director general, told VOA.

PTI’s Khan says the provincial government has enforced a complete ban on the cutting and felling of trees in reserved forests across KPK.

Authorities have also curtailed activities of the powerful “timber mafia” by dismantling hundreds of illegal sawmills and arresting timber cutters.

At least two forest guards have been killed in such encounters while many braved injuries, Khan said.

The popularity and recognition of the provincial initiative has encouraged the central government last year to announce its own “Green Pakistan” program, with a goal to plant more than 100 million trees in the next five years."

"Earth's sixth mass extinction event already under way, scientists warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn,"Researchers talk of ‘biological annihilation’ as study reveals billions of populations of animals have been lost in recent decades

A “biological annihilation” of wildlife in recent decades means a sixth mass extinction in Earth’s history is under way and is more severe than previously feared, according to research.

Scientists analysed both common and rare species and found billions of regional or local populations have been lost. They blame human overpopulation and overconsumption for the crisis and warn that it threatens the survival of human civilisation, with just a short window of time in which to act.

The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, eschews the normally sober tone of scientific papers and calls the massive loss of wildlife a “biological annihilation” that represents a “frightening assault on the foundations of human civilisation”.

Prof Gerardo Ceballos, at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, who led the work, said: “The situation has become so bad it would not be ethical not to use strong language.”



Previous studies have shown species are becoming extinct at a significantly faster rate than for millions of years before, but even so extinctions remain relatively rare giving the impression of a gradual loss of biodiversity. The new work instead takes a broader view, assessing many common species which are losing populations all over the world as their ranges shrink, but remain present elsewhere.

The scientists found that a third of the thousands of species losing populations are not currently considered endangered and that up to 50% of all individual animals have been lost in recent decades. Detailed data is available for land mammals, and almost half of these have lost 80% of their range in the last century. The scientists found billions of populations of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have been lost all over the planet, leading them to say a sixth mass extinction has already progressed further than was thought.

A graphic showing wildlife population loss Billions of animals have been lost as their habitats have become smaller with each passing year.

The scientists conclude: “The resulting biological annihilation obviously will have serious ecological, economic and social consequences. Humanity will eventually pay a very high price for the decimation of the only assemblage of life that we know of in the universe.”

They say, while action to halt the decline remains possible, the prospects do not look good: “All signs point to ever more powerful assaults on biodiversity in the next two decades, painting a dismal picture of the future of life, including human life.”

Wildlife is dying out due to habitat destruction, overhunting, toxic pollution, invasion by alien species and climate change. But the ultimate cause of all of these factors is “human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich”, say the scientists, who include Prof Paul Ehrlich, at Stanford University in the US, whose 1968 book The Population Bomb is a seminal, if controversial, work.

“The serious warning in our paper needs to be heeded because civilisation depends utterly on the plants, animals, and microorganisms of Earth that supply it with essential ecosystem services ranging from crop pollination and protection to supplying food from the sea and maintaining a livable climate,” Ehrlich told the Guardian. Other ecosystem services include clean air and water.

“The time to act is very short,” he said. “It will, sadly, take a long time to humanely begin the population shrinkage required if civilisation is to long survive, but much could be done on the consumption front and with ‘band aids’ – wildlife reserves, diversity protection laws – in the meantime.” Ceballos said an international institution was needed to fund global wildlife conservation.

The research analysed data on 27,500 species of land vertebrates from the IUCN and found the ranges of a third have shrunk in recent decades. Many of these are common species and Ceballos gave an example from close to home: “We used to have swallows nesting every year in my home near Mexico city – but for the last 10 years there are none.”

The researchers also point to the “emblematic” case of the lion: “The lion was historically distributed over most of Africa, southern Europe, and the Middle East, all the way to northwestern India. [Now] the vast majority of lion populations are gone.”

Where lions used to live, and where they live now. Historically lions lived across Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, all the way up to Northwestern India. Today their habitat has been reduced to a few tiny pockets of the original area.

Prof Stuart Pimm, at Duke University in the US and not involved in the new work, said the overall conclusion is correct, but he disagrees that a sixth mass extinction is already under way: “It is something that hasn’t happened yet – we are on the edge of it.”

Pimm also said there were important caveats that result from the broad-brush approach used. “Should we be concerned about the loss of species across large areas – absolutely – but this is a fairly crude way of showing that,” he said. “There are parts of the world where there are massive losses, but equally there are parts of the world where there is remarkable progress. It is pretty harsh on countries like South Africa which is doing a good job of protecting lions.”

Robin Freeman, at the Zoological Society of London, UK, said: “While looking at things on aggregate is interesting, the real interesting nitty gritty comes in the details. What are the drivers that cause the declines in particular areas?”

Freeman was part of the team that produced a 2014 analysis of 3000 species that indicated that 50% of individual animals have been lost since 1970, which tallies with the new work but was based on different IUCN data. He agreed strong language is needed: “We need people to be aware of the catastrophic declines we are seeing. I do think there is a place for that within the [new] paper, although it’s a fine line to draw.”

Citing human overpopulation as the root cause of environmental problems has long been controversial, and Ehrlich’s 1968 statement that hundreds of millions of people would die of starvation in the 1970s did not come to pass, partly due to new high-yielding crops that Ehrlich himself had noted as possible.

Ehrlich has acknowledged “flaws” in The Population Bomb but said it had been successful in its central aim – alerting people to global environmental issues and the the role of human population in them. His message remains blunt today: “Show me a scientist who claims there is no population problem and I’ll show you an idiot.”

Earth’s five previous mass extinctions

End-Ordovician, 443 million years ago

A severe ice age led to sea level falling by 100m, wiping out 60-70% of all species which were prominently ocean dwellers at the time. Then soon after the ice melted leaving the oceans starved of oxygen.

Late Devonian, c 360 million years ago

A messy prolonged climate change event, again hitting life in shallow seas very hard, killing 70% of species including almost all corals.

Permian-Triassic, c 250 million years ago

The big one – more than 95% of species perished, including trilobites and giant insects – strongly linked to massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia that caused a savage episode of global warming.

Triassic-Jurassic, c 200 million years ago

Three-quarters of species were lost, again most likely due to another huge outburst of volcanism. It left the Earth clear for dinosaurs to flourish.

Cretaceous-Tertiary, 65 million years ago

An giant asteroid impact on Mexico, just after large volcanic eruptions in what is now India, saw the end of the dinosaurs and ammonites. Mammals, and eventually humans, took advantage."
Church of England votes to 'welcome and affirm' trans people,http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/10/church-of-england-votes-to-welcome-and-affirm-trans-people/,"(Drew Angerer/Getty)

The Church of England has voted to “welcome and affirm” transgender people in their parish churches.

The motion to move towards greater acceptance of trans people was voted on at the General Synod over the weekend.

It was presented by Reverend Chris Newlands who said that the church should act as a welcoming place for trans people during the “long and often complex process of transition”.

Along with the motion to increase acceptance, Newlands insisted that guidance should be distributed throughout the church on how best to provide service for trans people.

Newlands said at the meeting: “I hope that we can make a powerful statement to say that we believe that trans people are cherished and loved by God, who created them, and is present through all the twists and turns of their lives.”

He said to Press Association: “I’m euphoric and exhausted. I think it was a good debate with some excellent contributions.

“I did think there were some comments which reflect some of the extreme views which we would wish to counter.

He added that the vote was a move in the right direction.

“I’m getting so many messages from trans friends around the world. Synod has changed – we have turned a corner.

“Since the February decision on sexuality, bishops have realised they cannot continue to do what they have always done.”

During the General Synod, C of E members also voted for a ban on unethical “gay cure” therapy.

During a private member’s motion (PMM) the General Synod overwhelmingly backed a motion for a ban on the unethical practice.

The PMM said because “gay cure” therapy is seen as “harmful” by professionals, and those who largely force the practice are not professionals, it should not be permitted in the church.

“Given that many practitioners are non-medically trained religious leaders, it is imperative that the Church of England is unequivocal in its condemnation of such harmful practices,” they said in a statement.

Jayne Ozanne, the LGBT campaigner who presented the motion, said that “gay cure therapy” should have “no place in the modern world”.

Ozanne had been subject to “gay cure therapy” herself in the past.

She said to the Press Association: “I call it abuse. I believe it is spiritual abuse.

“It (sexual orientation) is a very delicate area that only true professionals should be dealing with. And they won’t try to change people’s sexual orientation, they will help them try to deal with it.

“What people don’t understand is that you can enter into this sort of practice willingly because you think it is the right thing to do because you have been told it is what God wants.

“It is only years later that the impact becomes apparent.”"
Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte to troops in terror war against ISIS-linked Maute group: Take no prisoners,http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/07/06/1716920/duterte-troops-terror-war-take-no-prisoners,"MANILA, Philippines - There’s no room in jail for terrorists.

President Duterte yesterday directed his troops not to take prisoner who took part in the rebellion and terrorism in Marawi, saying there were not enough detention centers in the war-torn city.

Speaking before troops of the 102nd brigade of the 10th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army in Sarangani, Duterte did not mince words when he indicated he wanted all suspects in the rebellion killed.

If the terrorists and their affiliates are allowed to live, Duterte said this would complicate things.

“Where will I put them? They have to be in the jurisdiction where they committed the crime. Simple as that. Kaya madagdagan ang problema (There will be more problems),” he said.

He explained the government would still need to feed the suspects in jail and bring them to court when the government has yet to rebuild the city.

“Dapat, every encounter, patay lahat. Ayoko magdala ng buhay, preso. Papakainin ko pa ‘yan (In every encounter, all should be dead. I don’t want them taken prisoners. I will have to feed them),” the Chief Executive said, after announcing that the soldiers’ basic pay would be doubled next year.

Noting the destruction caused by the battle in Marawi, Duterte said there is no longer any available jail in the city.

Since Marawi is in total disarray, bringing suspects to court is a big headache for the government, he added.

Duterte also expressed concern that their comrades might just spring the Maute terrorists and other suspects from detention once troops go back to normal operations.

During the ceremony, the President saluted the soldiers.

“Anyway, I’m happy. My snappy salute. Snappy one for awardees and to you,” he said. “Alam ko matitigas kayo. Matitigas ang ulo o matitigas ang t***? Depende diyan kung saan kayo gusto (I know you are hard. Hard in head or p***? It depends where you like it hard),” he said.

The commander-in-chief assured the military that their sacrifices would not go unnoticed by his administration. “Everybody will get a medal one of these days. I know, matitigas kayo and bilib ako sa sundalong Pilipino (You’re strong and I have confidence in the Filipino soldier),” the President said.

In another speech in Hagonoy, Davao last night, Duterte deplored the “vicious cycle of violence” that grips the nation “every now and then.”

“Although the fighting is winding up, maybe we need more time to really clean the place. I am very sad that this incident had to happen during my time as president… but then I am the second president to declare martial law,” he said.

He explained the present martial rule was different because abuses are not allowed, and the military and police are “now more educated and aware of their duties to the Filipino people.”

"Untreatable gonorrhoea 'superbug' spreading around world, WHO warns | World Health Organization tells of 'very serious situation' after confirming three known cases where all antibiotics were ineffective",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/07/untreatable-gonorrhoea-superbug-spreading-around-world-who-warns,"World Health Organization tells of ‘very serious situation’ after confirming three known cases where all antibiotics were ineffective

Untreatable strains of gonorrhoea are on the rise, the World Health Organization has warned, fuelling fears that last-resort drugs will soon be futile after three confirmed cases in which antibiotics were ineffective.

Gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the UK after chlamydia, with almost 35,000 cases reported in England in 2014. The WHO estimates that 78 million people worldwide contract the disease each year, with most cases affecting young men and women under the age of 25.



The latest warning is based on findings from two studies, co-authored by WHO researchers, looking at data from 77 countries; in more than 50, first-line antibiotics were ineffective.



Listerine gargle every day helps to slow spread of gonorrhoea, study finds Read more

“To control gonorrhoea, we need new tools and systems for better prevention, treatment, earlier diagnosis, and more complete tracking and reporting of new infections, antibiotic use, resistance and treatment failures,” said Marc Sprenger, director of antimicrobial resistance at the WHO. “Specifically, we need new antibiotics, as well as rapid, accurate, point-of-care diagnostic tests – ideally, ones that can predict which antibiotics will work on that particular infection – and longer term, a vaccine to prevent gonorrhoea.”



These concerns were echoed by others in the field.



“We are markedly concerned about the rise in antibiotic resistant gonorrhoea in the UK,” said Prof Claudia Estcourt, a member of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV. “In a very short space of time, we have seen changes in the bacteria at an unprecedented rate, which means that many antibiotics which used to work are no longer effective. We are running out of options.”



As well as widespread resistance to first-line antibiotics for gonorrhea, resistance is increasing against second and third-line treatments, too.



Gonorrhoea spreads through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex, as well as through the sharing of sex toys that have not been washed properly or covered with a new condom. Many of those who contract the disease experience no symptoms, but if left untreated the disease can cause infertility and, in pregnant women, puts babies at risk of blindness.

Since the introduction of antibiotics in 1930s, the bacteria responsible for gonorrhoea, neisseria gonorrhoeae, has shown a remarkable ability to stay one step ahead of our most effective antibiotics.

“Gonorrhoea is a very smart bug,” said Teodora Wi, a human reproduction specialist at the Geneva-based UN health agency. “Every time you introduce a new type of antibiotic to treat it, this bug develops resistance to it.”

Wi said one of two new studies on gonorrhoea published in the journal Plos Medicine had documented antibiotic-resistant cases in Japan, France and Spain.

“These are cases that can infect others. It can be transmitted,” she told reporters. “And these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg, since systems to diagnose and report untreatable infections are lacking in lower-income countries where gonorrhoea is actually more common.”

Experts added that funding issues were adding to the problem.

“We are concerned that at a time of increasing drug-resistant gonorrhoea and limited treatment options, overall funding for sexual health services [in the UK] is being reduced, and a quarter of local authorities have had to reduce spending on sexual health services,” said Estcourt.

Manica Balasegaram, director of the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, said the situation was “grim” and there was a pressing need for new medicines.

The pipeline, however, is very thin, with only three potential new gonorrhoea drugs in development and no guarantee any will prove effective in final-stage trials, he said.

“We urgently need to seize the opportunities we have with existing drugs and candidates in the pipeline,” he said. “Any new treatment developed should be accessible to everyone who needs it, while ensuring it is used appropriately, so that drug resistance is slowed as much as possible.”

Europol Discusses Bitcoin as Store of Value and Payment Method With the Industry,https://news.bitcoin.com/europol-bitcoin-store-of-value-legitimate-payment-method/,"Europol Discusses Bitcoin as Store of Value and Payment Method With the Industry

The European Union’s top law enforcement agency Europol recently hosted their 4th conference on digital currencies. According to the agency’s announcement on Wednesday, among the topics discussed this year was the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a store of value and as a legitimate payment method.

Europol Discusses Bitcoin’s Legitimate Uses This Year

Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) recently organized the “4th Virtual Currencies Conference,” hosted at the Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. EC3 was set up in 2013 as the EU’s cybercrime specialist unit to help law enforcement respond to cyber attacks.

The event, which took place on June 22 and 23, aimed “to further strengthen the fight against the abuse of virtual currencies for criminal transactions and money laundering.” This was also the same theme of the 3rd Virtual Currencies Conference which took place on July 14-15 last year.

However, unlike previous years, Europol has added other discussions to the conference. According to the agency’s announcement on Wednesday:

Another interesting topic covered was the legitimate use of Bitcoin technology, including the use of cryptocurrencies as a store of value, and as a payment method for legitimate goods and services.

Bitcoin Industry Experts Invited

The event was attended by over 150 experts from various fields this year. Many law enforcement authorities in both European countries and non-EU countries returned, but this time experts from the private sector were also invited. Many Bitcoin companies were chosen to attend because they specialize in “facilitating the lawful use of virtual currencies by providing online exchange, payment processing or wallet services.” According to Europol, the industry experts that attended include Bitcoin.de, Bitfinex, Bitpanda, Bitonic, Bitstamp, Bitpay, Coinbase, Cubits, Localbitcoins, Spectrocoin and Xapo.

The announcement states that “the participants shared their insights into criminal trends and the latest techniques used by criminals to hide their financial tracks and cash out criminal proceeds using bitcoins and other virtual currencies.”

EU’s Research on Bitcoin as Store of Value

The EU has done significant research regarding digital currency as a store of value. Over time, their researchers found that bitcoin has increasingly gained more acceptance as a store of value.

A 2015 European Commission report detailed how bitcoin has two features as a store of value, which differ substantially from traditional currencies. They are “non-inflationary supply and cyber security.” The author wrote, “bitcoin is the protection against inflation as a safe haven from government interference.” However, as a store of value, the report noted that “Bitcoin sensitivity to cyber-attacks and thefts reduces trust in bitcoin as a currency and hence impedes its growth and chances of becoming a global currency.”

Meanwhile, The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has noted that “non-payment uses of virtual currencies may include store-of-value products for savings or investment purposes, such as derivatives, commodities, and securities products.” This view has been referenced by the European Central Bank and other agencies.

Then in May this year, the European Parliament’s Directorate-General for Internal Policies report stated that “Once trading of the digital currency in exchange for sovereign currency begins, there will be a positive market price or exchange rate.” In addition, the report detailed “With digital currencies becoming more popular as a medium of exchange and also as a store of value, various asset substitutions take place. Households will reduce their cash holdings as they will start to make some payments with the digital currency.”

The U.S. Air Force's Unique Climate Testing Lab Has Blown Up,http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/12159/the-u-s-air-forces-unique-climate-testing-lab-has-blown-up,"Within its first 50 years, the McKinley Climate Lab – which is the largest insulated hangar in the world –had tested 300 different aircraft from the B-29 to the F-22, as well as 2,000 other pieces of equipment, munitions and vehicles. Next year the facility will celebrate its 70th year, and it is in as high demand as ever.

Foreign military customers have also tested their aircraft designs at the McKinley Climatic Lab, and so have some commercial and private aircraft companies. In the last decade, the 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 have been put through climatic torture tests there.

The 55,000-square foot insulated main chamber has an array of cooling and heating components available including mechanical cooling towers, large heading arrays and a steam plant. All types of conditions can be tested, from deep freezing to blowing rain to high humidity conditions to dust storms.

Also, different aircraft operations can be performed there, like running the aircraft under extreme thermal loads to test environmental control systems and cooling capacities. In all, the facility can provide testing environments with temperatures ranging from -70 to +180 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Amelia Earhart May Have Survived Crash-Landing, Newly Discovered Photo Suggests",http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/amelia-earhart-may-have-survived-crash-landing-never-seen-photo-n779591?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma,"A newly discovered photograph suggests legendary aviator Amelia Earhart, who vanished 80 years ago on a round-the-world flight, survived a crash-landing in the Marshall Islands.

The photo, found in a long-forgotten file in the National Archives, shows a woman who resembles Earhart and a man who appears to be her navigator, Fred Noonan, on a dock. The discovery is featured in a new History channel special, ""Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence,"" that airs Sunday.

Independent analysts told History the photo appears legitimate and undoctored. Shawn Henry, former executive assistant director for the FBI and an NBC News analyst, has studied the photo and feels confident it shows the famed pilot and her navigator.

""When you pull out, and when you see the analysis that's been done, I think it leaves no doubt to the viewers that that's Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan,"" Henry told NBC News.

Earhart was last heard from on July 2, 1937, as she attempted to become the first woman pilot to circumnavigate the globe. She was declared dead two years later after the U.S. concluded she had crashed somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, and her remains were never found.

But investigators believe they have found evidence Earhart and Noonan were blown off course but survived the ordeal. The investigative team behind the History special believes the photo may have been taken by someone who was spying for the U.S. on Japanese military activity in the Pacific.

It is not clear how Earhart and Noonan could have flown so far off course.

Les Kinney, a retired government investigator who has spent 15 years looking for Earhart clues, said the photo ""clearly indicates that Earhart was captured by the Japanese.""

Japanese authorities told NBC News they have no record of Earhart being in their custody.

The photo, marked ""Jaluit Atoll"" and believed to have been taken in 1937, shows a short-haired woman — potentially Earhart — on a dock with her back to the camera. (She's wearing pants, something for which Earhart was known.) She sits near a standing man who looks like Noonan — down to the hairline.

""The hairline is the most distinctive characteristic,"" said Ken Gibson, a facial recognition expert who studied the image. ""It's a very sharp receding hairline. The nose is very prominent.""

Gibson added: ""It's my feeling that this is very convincing evidence that this is probably Noonan.""

The photo shows a Japanese ship, Koshu, towing a barge with something that appears to be 38-feet-long — the same length as Earhart's plane.

For decades, locals have claimed they saw Earhart's plane crash before she and Noonan were taken away. Native schoolkids insisted they saw Earhart in captivity. The story was even documented in postage stamps issued in the 1980s.

""We believe that the Koshu took her to Saipan [in the Mariana Islands], and that she died there under the custody of the Japanese,"" said Gary Tarpinian, the executive producer of the History special.

""We don't know how she died,"" Tarpinian said. ""We don't know when.""

Josephine Blanco Akiyama, who lived on Saipan as a child, has long claimed she saw Earhart in Japanese custody.

""I didn't even know it was a woman, I thought it was a man,"" said Akiyama. ""Everybody was talking about her — they were talking about in Japanese. That's why I know that she's a woman. They were talking about a woman flyer.""

It is not clear if the U.S. government knew who was in the photo. If it was taken by a spy, the U.S. may not have wanted to compromise that person by revealing the image."

""Hawaii Five-0"" stars Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park have left the CBS show after the network refused to pay them as much as their white costars, Variety reports.

Sources told the outlet that Kim and Park were seeking salaries equal to those of stars Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan, but they were unable to reach a deal with the show's producer, CBS Television Studios.

CBS's final offer to the two actors was reportedly ""10-15% lower"" than the salaries of their two white costars.

A representative for the network told Variety in a statement: ""We are so appreciative of Daniel and Grace's enormous talents, professional excellence, and the aloha spirit they brought to each and every one of our 168 episodes.

Philippine police use hospitals to hide drug war killings,http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/philippines-duterta-doa/,"MANILA – The residents of Old Balara hid in their homes when gunfire erupted in their Manila district last September. They didn't see the police operation that killed seven drug suspects that night.

But they witnessed the gory aftermath and it haunts them still.

That night, Herlina Alim said she watched police haul away the men's bodies, leaving trails of blood. “They were dragged down the alley like pigs,” she said. Her neighbor Lenlen Magano said she saw three bodies, face down and motionless, piled at the end of the alley while police stood calmly by.

It was at least an hour, according to residents, before the victims were thrown into a truck and taken to hospital in what a police report said was a bid to save their lives. Old Balara’s chief, the elected head of the district, told Reuters he was perplexed. They were already dead, Allan Franza said, so why take them to hospital?

An analysis of crime data from two of Metro Manila’s five police districts and interviews with doctors, law enforcement officials and victims’ families point to one answer: Police were sending corpses to hospitals to destroy evidence at crime scenes and hide the fact that they were executing drug suspects.

Thousands of people have been killed since President Rodrigo Duterte took office on June 30 last year and declared war on what he called “the drug menace.” Among them were the seven victims from Old Balara who were declared dead on arrival at hospital.

A Reuters analysis of police reports covering the first eight months of the drug war reveals hundreds of cases like those in Old Balara. In Quezon City Police District and neighboring Manila Police District, 301 victims were taken to hospital after police drug operations. Only two survived. The rest were dead on arrival.

The data also shows a sharp increase in the number of drug suspects declared dead on arrival in these two districts each month. There were 10 cases at the start of the drug war in July 2016, representing 13 percent of police drug shooting deaths. By January 2017, the tally had risen to 51 cases or 85 percent. The totals grew along with international and domestic condemnation of Duterte's campaign.

This increase was no coincidence, said a police commander in Manila, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. In late 2016, he said, police began sending victims to hospitals to avoid crime scene investigations and media attention that might show they were executing drug suspects. A Reuters investigation last year found that when police opened fire in drug operations, they killed 97 percent of people they shot.

The Manila commander said police depended on emergency room doctors being too focused on the patients to care about why they were shot. The doctors “aren't asking any questions. They only record it: DOA,” he said.

But five doctors told Reuters they were troubled by the rising number of police-related DOAs. Four said many drug suspects brought to hospital had been shot in the head and heart, sometimes at close range – precise and unsurvivable wounds that undermined police claims that suspects were injured during chaotic exchanges of gunfire.

Oscar Albayalde, Metro Manila's police chief, said he had never heard of officers taking dead suspects to hospital to cover up crime scenes. “We will have that investigated,” he told Reuters. If that investigation showed police were “intentionally moving these dead bodies and bringing them to the hospitals just to alter the evidence, then I think we have to make them explain.”

Duterte’s office declined to expand on Albayalde’s response to Reuters’ questions.

According to police reports about the incidents, suspects shot during operations were “immediately rushed” to hospital. “The most important (thing) is the life of the person,” said Randy Llanderal, a precinct commander in Quezon City. The police reports reviewed by Reuters showed Llanderal had led or joined operations in which 13 drug suspects ended up dead on arrival.

Llanderal said all suspects were shot in self-defense during legitimate operations.

The Manila police commander, a retired senior officer and some doctors believe there is a cover up. Hospitalizing drug suspects who have been shot allows police to project a more caring image, said the Manila commander. The retired officer agreed. “It is basically a ploy to make the public believe that the police are mindful of the safety and survival of suspects,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The Manila commander said his officers were instructed to shoot at “sensitive areas.” Suspects who survived were shot again to finish them off or smothered with their own clothing, he said.

A Reuters examination of the Old Balara incident and similar operations also suggests that the purpose of hospital runs was to destroy evidence rather than save lives. Police manhandled gunshot victims and showed no urgency in getting them medical treatment, said three sets of family members and other witnesses.

“You obliterate the crime scene - the evidence.”

Removing bodies makes it harder to work out what really happened. “You obliterate the crime scene – the evidence,” said Rizaldy Rivera, an agent at the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation who has investigated allegations of police brutality. Police forensic investigators at the scene, said Rivera, must carry out their work on what is effectively a “tampered crime scene.”

Scene of Crime Operatives, or SOCO units as police forensic teams are called, process crime scenes and conduct autopsies. Aurelio Trampe, the police general who oversees SOCO, said police officers haven’t been removing bodies to alter crime scenes. He said they have the discretion to disregard crime-scene investigative procedures “just as long as they could save lives.”

SOCO can still collect evidence from bodies once they reach the hospital, but doesn’t always do so. Instead, said SOCO forensic chief Reynaldo Calaoa, that task falls to a police investigator assigned to the case. That investigator often hails from the same station as the colleagues who killed the suspect.

“All of them were cold to the touch.”

Such practices can leave the system open to abuse, said Raquel Del Rosario Fortun, an independent forensic scientist and chair of the University of the Philippines Manila pathology department.

“They do the shooting, they do the killing - and they investigate themselves,” she said. “Impunity, that's what's happening.”

Old Balara is part of Quezon City, the largest of the 17 cities and municipalities that make up Metro Manila, and the most populous city in the Philippines.

Old Balara district chief Franza said police insisted his staff of volunteer security guards bring drug-war casualties from operations to the hospital – even when it was clear they were dead. Because he has assisted the police by transporting casualties, the victims' families have accused him and his staff of complicity in the killings, he said.

In March, Franza decided he had had enough. Keep responding to police calls, he told his staff, but don't take a body to hospital without the go-ahead from SOCO crime scene investigators. “I decided not to take action which I think is not proper,” said Franza.

The seven victims from Old Balara arrived at East Avenue Medical Center stacked in a flatbed truck and another vehicle, said Jerome Paez, an attending physician at the emergency room that night. Most had been shot in the head and many also had multiple gunshots in their chests, he said. None were breathing or had a pulse.

“All of them were cold to the touch,” said Paez, who has dealt with 21 drug suspects pronounced dead on arrival.

The victims had been refused admission earlier at Quezon City General Hospital’s emergency room, a 15-minute drive away, because they were already dead, said district chief Franza. The hospital told Reuters it had no record of receiving patients from Old Balara that night.

The Old Balara bodies were already in the morgue of East Avenue Medical Center by the time the mother of victim Elmer Gayoso arrived. She asked Reuters to withhold her name, saying she feared retribution from the police.

Gayoso had been shot through the head and the heart, she said, and the headshot had destroyed his face. She said her husband identified him by scouring his corpse for familiar childhood scars. The wounds were so grave that she didn't believe that the police took Gayoso to the hospital to save his life.

“That was their pretense,” she said, weeping.

The killings also troubled Paez, the ER doctor. “We documented everything, just in case in the future it is needed for investigation,” he said.

Even if doctors at East Avenue Medical Center suspect a new arrival is dead, hospital protocol requires them to try to resuscitate the patient, said Paez. This is costly and wastes time at a big public hospital teeming with patients. In a recent visit by Reuters, old people wearing oxygen masks lay unmoving on gurneys. New patients arrived every few minutes.

Asked about the number of drug suspects arriving dead at hospital, the acting director of the East Avenue Medical Center, Victoria Abesamis, said: “I cannot categorically say that the police are bringing these dead bodies because they want to cover up. I think I will give them the benefit of the doubt.”

Lawrence Bello and three other doctors at East Avenue Medical Center interviewed by Reuters also expressed unease about handling dead-on-arrival cases from police operations.

Bello said the police would sometimes deliver bodies that were already displaying rigor mortis, which sets in several hours after death. East Avenue would get two or three such bodies per month, he said.

Bello has dealt with 20 cases where suspects were dead on arrival following a police operation, according to Quezon City Police District data. One of them, Bello said, had a single gunshot wound. The bullet had entered below the chin and exited through the top of the head. Bello said he found the injury “quite questionable.”

Such an injury is usually associated with victims of suicide or execution, said Homer Venters of Physicians for Human Rights, a group based in New York that investigates mass atrocities. “It is very hard for that to happen when a person isn't fully compliant,” he said. Venters didn't examine the body that Bello referred to.

Patel Mayuga, another ER doctor at East Avenue Medical Center, has pronounced 10 victims of police shootings dead on arrival, according to Quezon City Police District data. Suspects who are dead on arrival usually have “clean shots” in the forehead or chest, suggesting the killings were intentional, said Mayuga. “If they are shot in the chest or head, there was time for the attacker to prepare,” he said.

Many other drug suspects brought to hospitals in Quezon City by police were also shot in the head and heart, often from less than a meter away, four doctors told Reuters.

One January evening, police delivered five bodies in a small jeepney bus to the state-run Novaliches District Hospital in Quezon City. The floor of the jeepney bus was puddled with the victims' blood and excrement, recalled Lawrence Laguno, the ER doctor on duty. According to police, the victims had all pulled guns and opened fire on undercover officers during an anti-drug operation. They missed, and the police returned fire.

“All suspects were seriously injured,” said the police report. “Thereafter, wounded suspects were rushed to Novaliches District Hospital for medical treatment but pronounced dead on arrival by attending physician, Dr. Lawrence Laguno.”

Laguno told Reuters that all five men had been shot in the head and chest, with almost the same entry and exit wounds – injuries that looked to him both deliberate and impossible to survive. “It's unusual to have the same five patients with almost the same injuries,” said the doctor. “It was a trained shooter. They knew what they were doing.”

Venters of Physicians for Human Rights said it is “incredibly rare” to sustain a tight grouping of gunshot wounds in a shootout. Venters, a medical doctor, has overseen research and investigations into extrajudicial killings. When bullets enter a body from the same direction and plane, it shows the target wasn't moving, he said. “Either they were surprised and shot, or they were subdued and shot.”

Willie Saludares, acting chairman of the emergency room at East Avenue Medical Center, said doctors didn't follow up on questionable cases, since how patients were killed wasn't their concern. “I'm sorry to sound too cold, but that's the way it is,” he said. “I am only concerned about the health of the patient. I'm not doing investigative work.”

Nor, it seemed, were others. Saludares said that state agencies that investigate police killings, such as the Commission on Human Rights or the National Bureau of Investigation, didn’t come to interview him. Saludares also said he was uncomfortable speaking freely and feared losing his job.

Chito Gascon, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, said that if specific cases were brought to the agency’s attention, its investigators should pursue them and secure testimony from doctors. But the Commission was stretched, he added. “The CHR, given its current capacity constraints, is only able to investigate and document a fraction of all the deaths that have been reported by the media,” he said.

The National Bureau of Investigation didn’t comment.

“THEY WEREN’T BREATHING”

Police say they don't shoot to kill and that saving lives is paramount. But 17 witnesses interviewed by Reuters say their behavior at crime scenes suggests the opposite.

In September, in a district called Nagkaisang Nayon, precinct commander Llanderal led an operation that added six dead-on-arrival cases to the Quezon City body count. According to a police report, the suspects - five men and a woman - opened fire on undercover officers posing as drug buyers. They missed, and the officers returned fire.

“When the smoke cleared,” said the report, “all suspects sustained gunshot wounds on their body. Immediately thereafter, all suspects were rushed to Novaliches District Hospital for medical treatment but (were) pronounced dead on arrival.” None of the officers were injured.

Llanderal acknowledged that removing the bodies disturbed the crime scene, but insisted the suspects were alive. “They were still moving. All of them!” he said.

Bereaved relatives and other witnesses told Reuters the bodies were taken to hospital an hour or more after the shooting, and that none of the victims showed signs of life. “They weren't moving. They weren't breathing,” said Feliciano Dela Cruz, the local district chief.









“It's not possible they were alive,” said Jocelyn Ceron, 47, whose husband, Ronaldo, was among the dead. “We saw them thrown in the back of a truck.”

Ceron said Ronaldo's body had six bullet wounds: three in the chest or torso, one in the leg, and one in each hand. Relatives said the other bodies each bore at least six gunshot wounds. Ceron showed Reuters photos of the crime scene.

Llanderal confirmed that the photos were taken by police investigators and showed the immediate aftermath of his operation. One photo shows a woman lying face down in a blood-smeared alleyway. Others show a tiny room in which five men lie slumped in pools of blood or on the floor; two guns are clearly visible.

reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives

Reuters shared the crime scene photos with Fortun, the independent forensic scientist. “Based on the pictures, they are apparently very dead,” Fortun said of the six victims.

For so many bodies to be crammed into a tiny room “doesn't seem consistent” with police claims that the suspects were shot while fleeing during a gun battle, she added.

Relatives of Ronaldo Ceron believe the police executed him and others in cold blood. A neighbour called Maricol Amacna said she heard one of the men begging, “Don’t kill me, sir!” The Commission on Human Rights says it is investigating the killings.

The police have dismissed allegations of wrongdoing as “useless and baseless,” and have issued commendations to Llanderal and his men for “the extraordinary courage you have displayed in the successful operation . . . which resulted in the neutralization” of the suspects.

Llanderal denied executing drug suspects. “In police operations, we don't know where the bullets may hit,” he said. “Some suspects retaliate, fight us. We are only defending ourselves.”

"In Jharkhand, 15 policemen stave off 1,000-strong mob to rescue dairy farmer whose cow died",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/in-jharkhand-15-policemen-stave-off-1000-strong-mob-to-rescue-dairy-farmer-whose-cow-died-4726956/,"Usman’s house was targeted by the mob. (Source: Express photo by Prashant Pandey) Usman’s house was targeted by the mob. (Source: Express photo by Prashant Pandey)

A police team of just 15 managed to hold off a mob of around 1,000 people for around two hours before reinforcements from a CRPF camp nearby arrived to rescue a 60-year-old dairy farmer, who was attacked after the carcass of a cow was found outside his house at Barwabad village in Jharkhand’s Giridih district.

According to eyewitnesses and police, the mob also set fire to a portion of the house on Tuesday afternoon and wanted to throw the victim, Mohammad Usman, into the flames before police dragged him into their jeep and prevented attackers from pulling him out, twice.

“We were only 15 personnel. The crowd, which was there for the weekly bazaar, had swelled to a thousand. Our first aim was to take Usman in our custody. We managed that but were not able to take him out of the village. Then, we got information that his family members were holed up inside the house. We managed to enter the house through a staircase in the back and rescue them. By that time, Usman had been beaten up badly and was unconscious,” said Prabhat Ranjan Barwar, the sub-divisional police officer, who headed the team from Deori that reached the spot first.

Barwar’s version was corroborated by at least three eyewitnesses that The Indian Express spoke to at the village: Jawed Ansari, a watchman from Khasgodi village nearby; Nizamuddin, another watchman; and Manzoor Alam, pradhan of Barwabad village.

On Wednesday, these three were among a handful of men present in the village, which wore a deserted look — by evening, only a few shops had opened. Usman and his family were in Dhanbad, where he is under treatment at the BCCL central hospital.

“The bazaar was in full swing. I was getting a shave when I heard about a stampede-like situation. I rushed to the spot on my motorcycle because I needed to know what was happening before calling police. When I reached, I saw that Usman had already been cornered by the mob,” said Ansari, the watchman, who first alerted police.

“In this village, he is the only one rearing cows. He had eight cows and the family would supply milk in Barwabad and the neighbouring Mandro village. Usman was first asked by the mob whether the cow belonged to him, which he admitted. They took him to the exact spot where the carcass lay and made him swear that he did not kill it. Usman did that, too. We heard that some people wanted to throw him in the fire,” said Alam, the pradhan.

“The situation was highly intense. We somehow managed to stave them off. It was after the Deputy Commissioner arrived with additional forces that the mob could be dispersed,” said Barwar.

Giridih Deputy Commissioner, Uma Shankar Singh, who arrived with CRPF reinforcements, said: “The situation escalated suddenly. The initial presence of police, although outnumbered, helped us save lives. The injured is completely out of danger. We are probing the case from all angles.”

Speaking to The Indian Express at the Deori police station, Usman’s wife Amna Khatun said the cow had been ailing for a while and that she had called a local veterinarian to treat the animal before it died.

“The mob asked me the same questions they asked my husband. How could we deny that it was our cow? We told them that we did not slaughter her. But they were not ready to listen,” she said.

“The cow died on Saturday night. We could not get the body disposed of on Sunday because those who were to do this were busy handling another carcass in another village. Then, I told my son that the body would start rotting. On Sunday night, we dragged the carcass to an empty place. On Monday, I noticed some marks on the body and felt that it could be done by stray dogs,” she said.

“We were thinking about how to dispose it when the mob had reached our house and set on fire a small ration shop opened in the front portion by our son Saleem,” said Amna.

According to Ansari, the watchman, he along with police managed to enter the rear portion of the house using a staircase. “I opened the rear door that had been bolted from outside, and we rescued Amna, her sons Saleem and Alam, and Saleem’s wife,” he said.

Police said they were in the process of identifying the culprits and registering an FIR based on Amna’s complaint. A suspected member of the mob, Krishna Pandit, who sustained injuries as police fired in the air to disperse the mob, was out of danger, they said.

“It has come to light that the cow died of some illness. Whether somebody was involved in dismembering the body is being investigated. Around a dozen persons have been taken into custody and will be put under arrest after their involvement becomes clear,” said Singh, the Giridih DC.

Giridih SP Akhilesh B Verrior said, “This area has never been considered sensitive for such issues. A communal incident occurred some five years ago but we have not heard of any such case in Deori in the recent past. This will require a detailed probe. The carcass has been sent for post-mortem.”

ADG (Operations) and Jharkhand Police spokesperson R K Mullik said, “When officers at the headquarters got this news around 5 pm, we were conducting our daily crime meeting with the DGP. We immediately got in touch with the Ministry of Home Affairs to get permission for moving CRPF personnel based in Chatro, which is closer to the spot, to the troubled village.”

Under rules, the CRPF cannot engage in local law-and-order duty, unless express permission is taken — in this case, permission was given, with the DC accompanying around 100 Rapid Action Force personnel to the spot.

“It was a combination of immediate support from the top and ground officials taking pro-active action that turned the situation in our favour. Till then, our men had fought bravely but were hugely outnumbered,” said SP Verrior.

"The world has three years to start making significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or face the prospect of dangerous global warming, experts have warned in an article in the journal Nature.",http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/world-climate-change-save-humanity-experts-global-warming-rising-sea-levels-food-a7813251.html,"The world has three years to start making significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or face the prospect of dangerous global warming, experts have warned in an article in the prestigious journal Nature.

Calling for world leaders to be guided by the scientific evidence rather than “hide their heads in the sand”, they said “entire ecosystems” were already beginning to collapse, summer sea ice was disappearing in the Arctic and coral reefs were dying from the heat.

The world could emit enough carbon to bust the Paris Agreement target of between 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius in anything from four to 26 years if current levels continue, the article said.

Global emissions had been rising rapidly but have plateaued in recent years. The experts, led by Christiana Figueres, who as Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change played a key role in the Paris Agreement, said they must start to fall rapidly from 2020 at the latest.

“The year 2020 is crucially important for another reason, one that has more to do with physics than politics,” they said.

Citing a report published in April, they added: “Should emissions continue to rise beyond 2020, or even remain level, the temperature goals set in Paris become almost unattainable.

“Lowering emissions globally is a monumental task, but research tells us that it is necessary, desirable and achievable.”

The article was signed by more than 60 scientists, such as Professor Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, politicians, including former Mexican President Felipe Calderon and ex-Irish President Mary Robinson, businesspeople like Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, investment managers, environmental campaigners and others.

Since the 1880s, the world’s temperature has risen by about 1C because of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity – a process predicted by a Swedish Nobel Prize-winning scientist in 1895.

The Nature article laid out the effect of this sudden increase on the planet.

“Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are already losing mass at an increasing rate,” it said.

“Summer sea ice is disappearing in the Arctic and coral reefs are dying from heat stress – entire ecosystems are starting to collapse.”

And it added: “The social impacts of climate change from intensified heatwaves, droughts and sea-level rise are inexorable and affect the poorest and weakest first.”

Humanity is currently emitting about 41 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year, but if the Paris target is to be met it only has a carbon ‘budget’ of between 150 and 1,050 gigatonnes.

“If the current rate of annual emissions stays at this level, we would have to drop them almost immediately to zero once we exhaust the budget. Such a ‘jump to distress’ is in no one’s interest. A more gradual descent would allow the global economy time to adapt smoothly,” the experts wrote.

But they urged people not to abandon hope.

“The good news is that it is still possible to meet the Paris temperature goals if emissions begin to fall by 2020,” they said.

Donald Trump, the US President and climate science-denier, has pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, which will take until 2020.

The Nature article urged world leaders to take the opposite approach by using science to guide policy and defending scientists.

“Those in power must stand up for science,” it said.

“French President Emmanuel Macron’s Make Our Planet Great Again campaign [a deliberate play on Mr Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan] is a compelling example.

“He has spoken out to a global audience in support of climate scientists, and invited researchers to move to France to help accelerate action and deliver on the Paris agreement.”

We still don't know if Trump believes climate change exists

Any delay would pose a threat to human prosperity.

“With no time to wait, all countries should adopt plans for achieving 100 per cent renewable electricity production, while ensuring that markets can be designed to enable renewable-energy expansion,” the experts wrote.

Optimism was also important.

“Recent political events have thrown the future of our world into sharp focus,” they said. “But as before Paris, we must remember that impossible is not a fact, it’s an attitude. It is crucial that success stories are shared.

“There will always be those who hide their heads in the sand and ignore the global risks of climate change."
"World has three years left to stop dangerous climate change, warn experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/world-has-three-years-left-to-stop-dangerous-climate-change-warn-experts,"Avoiding dangerous levels of climate change is still just about possible, but will require unprecedented effort and coordination from governments, businesses, citizens and scientists in the next three years, a group of prominent experts has warned.

Warnings over global warming have picked up pace in recent months, even as the political environment has grown chilly with Donald Trump’s formal announcement of the US’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement. This year’s weather has beaten high temperature records in some regions, and 2014, 2015 and 2016 were the hottest years on record.

But while temperatures have risen, global carbon dioxide emissions have stayed broadly flat for the past three years. This gives hope that the worst effects of climate change – devastating droughts, floods, heatwaves and irreversible sea level rises – may be avoided, according to a letter published in the journal Nature this week.

The authors, including former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, argue that the next three years will be crucial. They calculate that if emissions can be brought permanently lower by 2020 then the temperature thresholds leading to runaway irreversible climate change will not be breached.

Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, under whom the Paris agreement was signed, said: “We stand at the doorway of being able to bend the emissions curve downwards by 2020, as science demands, in protection of the UN sustainable development goals, and in particular the eradication of extreme poverty. This monumental challenge coincides with an unprecedented openness to self-challenge on the part of sub-national governments inside the US, governments at all levels outside the US, and of the private sector in general. The opportunity given to us over the next three years is unique in history.”

Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, added: “The maths is brutally clear: while the world can’t be healed within the next few years, it may be fatally wounded by negligence [before] 2020.”

Scientists have been warning that time is fast running out to stave off the worst effects of warming, and some milestones may have slipped out of reach. In the Paris agreement, governments pledged an “aspirational” goal of holding warming to no more than 1.5C, a level which it is hoped will spare most of the world’s lowest-lying islands from inundation. But a growing body of research has suggested this is fast becoming impossible.



Paris’s less stringent, but firmer, goal of preventing warming from exceeding 2C above pre-industrial levels is also in doubt.

The authors point to signs that the trend of upward emissions is being reversed, and to technological progress that promises lower emissions for the future. Renewable energy use has soared, creating a foundation for permanently lowering emissions. Coal use is showing clear signs of decline in key regions, including China and India. Governments, despite Trump’s pronouncements, are forging ahead with plans to reduce greenhouse gases.

The authors called for political and business leaders to continue tackling emissions and meeting the Paris goals without the US. “As before Paris, we must remember that impossible is not a fact, it’s an attitude,” they wrote.

They set out six goals for 2020 which they said could be adopted at the G20 meeting in Hamburg on 7-8 July. These include increasing renewable energy to 30% of electricity use; plans from leading cities and states to decarbonise by 2050; 15% of new vehicles sold to be electric; and reforms to land use, agriculture, heavy industry and the finance sector, to encourage green growth.

Prof Gail Whiteman said the signs from technical innovation and economics were encouraging: “Climate science underlines the unavoidable urgency of our challenge, but equally important is the fact that the economic, technical and social analyses show that we can resoundingly rise to the challenge through collective action.”

While the greenhouse gases poured into the atmosphere over the last two centuries have only gradually taken effect, future changes are likely to be faster, scientists fear. Johan Rockström of the Stockholm Resilience Centre said: “We have been blessed by a remarkably resilient planet over the past 100 years, able to absorb most of our climate abuse. Now we have reached the end of this era, and need to bend the global curve of emissions immediately, to avoid unmanageable outcomes for our modern world.”"
Gunshots are the third leading killer of children in the US,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/guns-kill-nearly-1300-kids-in-the-us-per-year-and-suicides-are-on-the-rise/,"Nearly 1,300 children aged 0 to 17 are killed by gunshots each year in the US, and nearly 5,800 more suffer from non-lethal gunshot wounds, researchers estimate in a study published Monday in Pediatrics.

In all, about 19 children die or are wounded each day from firearms, either by homicide, suicide, or unintentional shootings. Firearm-related deaths are now the third leading cause of death among US children and the second leading cause of injury-related deaths, behind car crashes. The grim national statistics are even more startling when considered from an international perspective: the US now accounts for 91 percent of all child firearm-related deaths (aged 0 to 14) among high-income countries.

In addition to the broad figures compiled by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the study also provides one of the most comprehensive looks yet at the factors surrounding those deaths and injuries.

For the study, researchers tapped into national databases on firearm deaths and nonfatal injuries, including data on gunshots from handguns, rifles, and shotguns. Information was scraped from death certificates, hospital reports, medical examiner reports, and law enforcement reports. The researchers also collected demographic data, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and age.

Fowler et al.

Fowler et al.

Fowler et al.

Fowler et al.

The latest annual death estimate breaks down to: 53 percent from homicide, 38 percent from suicide, six percent unintentional, and the remaining three percent were either from unknown intentions or legal intervention. Boys made up 82 percent of those fatally shot, and older children (aged 13 to 17) were 12 times more likely to die from firearms than younger children (0 to 12).

African-American children had the highest overall rates of firearm deaths (4.1 per 100,000). But white and Native American children had the highest rates of firearm suicides (2.2 per 100,000 each).

While firearm homicides and unintentional fatal shootings appear to be declining recently, the researchers found that firearm suicide deaths have increased 60 percent between 2007 and 2014. This is in line with a larger nationwide trend in suicide increases, influenced by the economic downturn around 2007.

Now more than ever, the data should be a call to action for pediatricians to discuss with parents how to best protect children, pediatrician Eliot Nelson of the University of Vermont, Burlington, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Though he cautioned:

“... Although we may legitimately support our American Academy of Pediatrics policy’s assertion that the safest home is one without firearms, we should be mindful that this message may be off-putting to parents who keep guns for hunting or self-protection, and who are part of a widespread and deeply rooted social gun culture in our country, especially in rural states.‍ We do need to try to engage those gun owners.”

Nelson notes that the stakes can be particularly high for teenagers, who are often risk-takers and impulsive. Earlier research has suggested that teenagers spend 10 minutes or less debating suicide before making an attempt. Yet, suicide attempts with firearms are far more successful and irreversible than other methods.

When approaching parents, Nelson recommends that pediatricians note the unpredictability of teenagers and the craftiness of younger children, which parents may underestimate. Discussions should cover supervision and safe storage.

“However difficult it may be to confront the problem of firearm injuries in our children, youth, and families, we cannot ignore the magnitude of this ongoing public health crisis,” he concludes.

Mexico Legalizes Medical Marijuana ; a decree issued by Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto today confirmed that Mexico has legalized cannabis for medicinal use after overwhelming support from Mexico's Lower House of Congress.,https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/mexico-legalizes-medical-marijuana,"Politics Mexico Legalizes Medical Marijuana Lisa Rough June 19, 2017 Principal Square with Flag in Mexico City

A decree issued by Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto today confirmed that Mexico has legalized cannabis for medicinal use after overwhelming support from Mexico’s Lower House of Congress.

Peña Nieto was once a vehement opponent of cannabis legalization, but has since called for a re-examination of global drug policy after a nationwide public debate on legalization in early 2016. “So far, the solutions [to control drugs and crime] implemented by the international community have been frankly insufficient,” Peña Nieto told the 2016 United Nations General Assembly Special Sessions in April 2016. “We must move beyond prohibition to effective prevention.”

Last year, Peña Nieto even went so far as to introduce a measure that would allow Mexican citizens to possess up to an ounce of cannabis without repercussions, but the bill stalled in Congress.

The medical marijuana bill sailed through the Senate with ease in December 2016, and Mexico’s lower house in parliament passed the bill in April with a vote of 347-7 in favor of approval. Mexico’s Secretary of Health, Dr. José Narro Robles, voiced his support for the measure, saying, “I welcome the approval of the therapeutic use of cannabis in Mexico.”

The decree was issued by the president today and specifies that the Ministry of Health will be tasked with drafting and implementing the regulations of “public policies regulating the medicinal use of pharmacological derivatives of cannabis sativa, indica and Americana or marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinol, its isomers and stereochemical variants, as well as how to regulate the research and national production of them.”

Peña Nieto’s decree effectively eliminates the criminalization of the medicinal use of cannabis, THC, CBD, and all cannabis derivatives, as well as legalizing the production and distribution of cannabis for medicinal and therapeutic uses.

“The ruling eliminates the prohibition and criminalization of acts related to the medicinal use of marijuana and its scientific research, and those relating to the production and distribution of the plant for these purposes,” stated the Lower House of Parliament, known as La Cámara de Diputados.

Currently, the only cannabis that will be permitted must contain 1% or less of tetrahydrocannabinol, and the Ministry of Health will be required to study the medicinal and therapeutic effects of cannabis before creating the framework for a medical marijuana program infrastructure.

There will certainly still be hurdles to overcome on the bumpy road to medical marijuana, but Mexico just surpassed the biggest obstacle so far.

Russian military halts Syria sky incident prevention interactions with US ? Moscow,https://www.rt.com/news/393028-syria-russia-us-plane/,"The Russian Defense Ministry announced it is halting cooperation with its US counterparts in the framework of the Memorandum on the Prevention of Incidents and Ensuring Air Safety in Syria following the coalition’s downing of a Syrian warplane.

The ministry has demanded a thorough investigation by the US military command into the incident with the Syrian government military jet, with the results to be shared with the Russian side.

“In the areas of combat missions of Russian air fleet in Syrian skies, any airborne objects, including aircraft and unmanned vehicles of the [US-led] international coalition, located to the west of the Euphrates River, will be tracked by Russian ground and air defense forces as air targets,” the Russian Ministry of Defense stated.

Downing the military jet within Syrian airspace “cynically” violates the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic, Russian military said.

The actions of the US Air Force are in fact “military aggression” against Syria, the statement adds.

The ministry emphasized that Russian warplanes were on a mission in Syrian airspace during the US-led coalition’s attack on the Syrian Su-22, while the coalition failed to use the communication line to prevent an incident.

“The command of the coalition forces did not use the existing communication channel between the air commands of Al Udeid Airbase (in Qatar) and the Khmeimim Airbase to prevent incidents in Syrian airspace.”

The ministry considers the move “a conscious failure to comply with the obligations under the Memorandum on the Prevention of Incidents and Ensuring Air Safety in Syria,” and is thus halting cooperation with the US within the memorandum framework as of June 19, the statement concluded.

At the moment of the attack the jet was carrying out operations against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) some 40km from Raqqa, the Russian Defense Ministry said. The pilot ejected from the plane above IS-controlled territory and is still missing."

"Grenfell Tower fire is 'corporate manslaughter' and arrests must be made, MP David Lammy says",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/grenfell-tower-fire-corporate-manslaughter-arrests-david-lammy-mp-labour-london-kensington-a7790911.html,"Labour MP David Lammy has labelled the Grenfell Tower fire as “corporate manslaughter” and called for arrests to be made over the disaster.

The Tottenham MP described the fire as an “outrage”, stating: “This is the richest borough in our country treating its citizens in this way.

“We should call it what it is, it's corporate manslaughter, that's what it is and there should be arrests made, frankly,"" he added, without referring to any individuals specifically.

Mr Lammy, who was speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, also said he had heard nothing from family friend Khadija Saye, 24, since the fire. The photographer lived on the 20th floor of the Tower bloc with her mother, Mary Mendy.

“As the seconds pass we grow more sad and bleak every second,” he said.

He added: “Many of us across the country have been caught up in an election, knocking on housing estate doors right across the country, travelling up to the the top floors of tower blocks and we know as politicians that the conditions in this country are unacceptable. We built buildings in the 70s, those 70s buildings – many of them should be demolished.

Grenfell Tower fire: How the community responded

“They haven’t got easy fire escapes, they’ve got no sprinklers, it’s totally, totally unacceptable in Britain that this is allowed to happen and people lose their lives in this way. People should be held to account.”

Speaking about his “dear friend”, Ms Saye, who worked for his artist wife for a number of years, Mr Lammy added that she was a “beautiful young woman with an amazing career ahead of her, wonderful artist, her work is on show in Venice at the moment, and we've heard nothing”.

“We hope and pray that she is amongst them [in hospital] and not perished in that building as I suspect hundreds will have done by the end of this count.”

It is expected that Theresa May will visit the scene of the tragedy later on Thursday to speak with emergency services and ensure that they have the resources they need to deal with the situation.

There are still “unknown numbers” of bodies in the tower bloc following the inferno, London fire commissioner Dany Cotton said on Thursday. But at least 12 have already been confirmed dead after the fire ripped through the building in north Kensington, where the flames could still be seen burning more than a day after the disaster."
"Legalising marijuana will boost California's economy by $5 billion, study finds",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/legalising-marijuana-california-economy-5-billion-study-state-drugs-a7786026.html,"The economy of California - poised to create a market for legal marijuana - could see its economy boosted by as much as $5bn, according to a new study.

The report by the University of California Agricultural Issues Centre, says that the legalisation of the drug will provide the state a further reason for tourists - or at least some tourists - to visit.

Yet it also warns that around 30 per cent of people who use cannabis may remain in the illegal market, in order to avoid the financial impact of regulations that require marijuana to be tested, tracked and taxed at 15 per cent of its retail value.

The Los Angeles Times said that state officials developing the regulations, hope they will be able to persuade the majority of cannabis users to go through the legal market.

Lori Ajax, director of the state Bureau of Marijuana Control, which commissioned the report, told the newspaper: “It’s going to take some time. While it’s unlikely that everyone will come into the regulated market on Day One, we plan to continue working with stakeholders as we move forward to increase participation over time.”

The survey has calculated that once California, which has the word's fifth largest economy, adopts the new regulations, legal recreational cannabis use will make up 61.5 per cent of the total market, illegal cannabis will account for 29.5 per cent, with nine per cent coming from legal medical marijuana.

“We projected that when legally allowed, slightly more than half of the demand currently in the illegal adult-use segment will quickly move to the legal adult-use segment to avoid the inconvenience, stigma, and legal risks of buying from an unlicensed seller,” says the study.

In 2012, the states of Colorado and Washington because the first in the US to pass laws legalising recreational cannabis. Research released last year found that it had contributed $2.39bn to Colorado’s economy in 2015.

The report from the Marijuana Policy Group, a Denver-based economic and market research firm, said it had also created more than 18,000 jobs.

“By legalising, the state has gained a windfall more or less for free,” Miles Light, one of the report’s authors said."
Georgian satire Rap Duo facing the life imprisonment just for posting a satirical music video mocking the police.,http://www.tabula.ge/en/story/120968-birja-mafia-rap-members-arrested-for-possession-relatives-say-it-was-planted,"Law enforcement agents in Georgia arrested two members of the satirical parody hip-hop group “Birja Mafia” in the evening of June 8th, on charges of purchasing and possessing large amounts of the drug MDMA.

The relatives of the two arrested men, however, strongly deny the drug possession allegations. They believe the hip-hop artists were arrested because of a Birja Mafia music video which shows a policeman tied up with a leash. In the video, the policeman on the leash is now blurred over.

According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia, police searched Mikheil “Mishka” Mgaloblishvili, also known by his stage name “Young Mic,” and found 1.4965 grams of MDMA on his person. Giorgi Keburia, also known as “Kay G,” was found with 2.3342 grams of MDMA.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs has opened an investigation under Article 260 of the Criminal Code, part 6, for the purchase and possession of large amounts of illegal drugs.

If convicted, Mgaloblishvili and Keburia could face an 8-20 year prison sentence, or even a life sentence.

The President’s Parliamentary Secretary, Ana Dolidze, announced that the presidential administration will examine the case.

“Due to our recent history, we need to look closely at the situation of any accused individual if such case involves the limitation of human rights, especially in regards to violence and crackdowns,” Dolidze said.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs reports that Giorgi Keburia has admitted to the charges.

Mikheil Mgaloblishvili’s trial was held at 16:00 at Tbilisi City Court today. Mgaloblishvili denied the charges against him and accused police of planting the drugs on him. He linked his detention to the Birja Mafia video where a policeman is seen on a leash and on all fours.

Mgaloblishvili told the court that when he was arrested, law enforcement agents told him that, ""someone is annoyed and you will be punished for it. Anyone who represents police in such a manner will be punished."" Mgaloblishvili says the law enforcement agents talked about his music video, confiscated his phone so that he could not contact anyone, and verbally and physically insulted him. Mgaloblishvili said he can identify the persons.

Mgaloblishvili also said he was pressured to take a drug test; that he was tested for various kinds of drugs, and that there were no signs of drugs in his blood.

Mgaloblishvili says he was made to sign a document pleading guilty, out of pressure and fear; he says he was promised to be released in three days in exchange for signing the document.

The defense requested a 50,000 dollar bail. Tbilisi City Court Judge Badri Shonia sentenced Mgaloblishvili to temporary detention as a ‘preventive measure,’ satisfying the solicitation of the Prosecutor's Office. According to the prosecution’s argument, ""we have uncontrolled borders and he [Mgaloblishvili] can run away from the country.” The next trial is scheduled for June 27th.

Giorgi Keburia’s trial will be held separately, according to the MIA."
Berlin police 'covered up missed chance to prevent Christmas market attack',http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/18/berlin-police-covered-missed-chance-prevent-christmas-market/,"“It would have served as the basis of an arrest warrant that could have prevented the attack.”

But there was a second version of the report in which Amri’s involvement was downplayed. “This version no longer refers to professional and organised trafficking, but only to drug dealing,” Mr Geisel said.

Crucially, the minister said the second version of the report was drawn up on Januray 17 — almost a month after the attacks — but “clearly backdated to November 1”.

Mr Geisel has filed criminal charges against two officers in the Landeskriminalamt, the Berlin police equivalent of CID.

There has already been public anger that police and intelligence agencies were unable to identify the threat from Amri, a rejected Tunisian asylum-seeker, despite a trail of evidence linking him to extremist circles and tip-offs from informants that he had talked of carrying out an attack.

But if it now transpires Berlin police missed the chance to take him off the streets six weeks before the attack it will raise serious questions.

“This is a new dimension. It would be devastating if a chance for an arrest was missed,” Burkard Dregger, a high-profile regional MP from Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) said."
India cancelling huge coal power station because it wants to focus on renewable energy,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-cancels-huge-coal-power-station-renewable-energy-solar-power-gujarat-a7741801.html,"A planned coal fired mega power plant in India has been scrapped because the government wants to focus on green energy.

Gujarati state officials had planned a 4,000-Megawatt ultra-mega power project (UMPP).

It would have been the state of Gujarat’s second UMPP.

But the government decided the state was already sufficiently supplied with energy and focusing on renewables was a better longer term strategy.

“Gujarat had proposed the UMPP last year but we now feel we do not need more,” energy minister Chimanbhai Sapariya told the Business Standard. “We already have more than sufficient generation capacity.

“Our focus is now on renewable energy. The government will encourage solar power.""

Aspiring heart surgeon who stabbed boyfriend in England may avoid jail because she's 'extraordinary',http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/92665906/aspiring-heart-,"Lavinia Woodward, 24, punched and stabbed her then-boyfriend during an alcohol-and-drug-fuelled row.

An Oxford University student who stabbed her boyfriend with a bread knife may not go to jail because it would damage her future career as a heart surgeon.

Lavinia Woodward, 24, punched her boyfriend, who she met on dating app Tinder, and then stabbed him in the leg during an alcohol-and-drug-fuelled row at England's Christ Church College on September 30, The Guardian reported.

Woodward then hurled a laptop, glass and jam jar at him.

LAVINIA WOODWARD/FACEBOOK Woodward is studying to be a heart surgeon at Oxford University.

At Oxford crown court on Tuesday (NZT) Judge Ian Pringle QC said he would take the ""exceptional"" step of defering Woodward's sentencing for four months.

The Guardian reported that Pringle hinted that Woodward will not be jailed because of her talent.

LAVINIA WOODWARD/FACEBOOK Woodward was described as an extraordinary talent who has had articles published in medical journals.

""It seems to me that if this was a one-off, a complete one-off, to prevent this extraordinary able young lady from not following her long-held desire to enter the profession she wishes to would be a sentence which would be too severe,"" Pringle said.

""What you did will never, I know, leave you, but it was pretty awful, and normally it would attract a custodial sentence, whether it is immediate or suspended.""

The court was told that Christ Church would allow her to return in October because she ""is that bright"" and has had articles published in medical journals.

Woodward's lawyer James Sturman QC said she'd had a very troubled life and was abused by a previous boyfriend."
Chinese appetite for totoaba fish bladder kills off rare porpoise - Only 30 vaquita are left in Gulf of California as pirate fishermen net them when fishing for highly valued totoaba maws,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/16/chinese-appetite-totoaba-fish-bladder-threatens-rare-vaquita,"Only 30 vaquita are left in Gulf of California as pirate fishermen net them when fishing for highly valued totoaba maws

The world’s rarest marine mammal is on the verge of extinction due to the continuing illegal demand in China for a valuable fish organ, an undercover investigation has revealed.

There are no more than 30 vaquita – a five-foot porpoise – left in the northern Gulf of California today and they could be extinct within months, conservationists have warned. The population has been all but eradicated by pirate fishermen catching the large totoaba fish and killing the vaquita in the process.

The totoaba, which is itself highly endangered, is caught for its swim bladders which are smuggled to China for sale on the black market. Undercover investigators found the swim bladders, called maws, for sale in Shantou in Guandong province, at an average price of $20,000 per kilogram. The cost has led to the maws being dubbed “aquatic cocaine”.

China's craze for 'aquatic cocaine' is pushing two species into oblivion Read more

“The demand is still strong and stable – it is not going down – and prices are climbing again,” said Andrea Crosta, from the Elephant Action League, an intelligence-led group now targeting all wildlife crime and which conducted the totoaba investigation.

“Because it is very expensive, it remains a product for wealthy people,” he said. “The law enforcement is very weak because it is not top priority and probably because it involves rich and powerful people.”

One trader in the illegal maws told the investigators: “When the government comes to check, they call and inform us earlier and we will hide them when they come.” However, the trade is less open than it once was. Chinese buyers of maws prefer those from domestic waters but these are exceedingly rare now, having been intensively fished for many decades.

The demand for totoaba maws is driven by its use as a business gift, investment or wedding dowry, as well as its supposed medicinal benefits, the investigation found.

The fish are captured in gillnets, which the Mexican government has banned although illegal fishing persists. The ban will expire at the end of May and the conservation group WWF called on Tuesday for Mexico to introduce and enforce a permanent ban on all gillnets.

“Time is rapidly running out for the vaquita – we could tragically lose [it] in a matter of months,” said WWF’s Chris Gee. “The last hope for the species is the Mexican government immediately putting in place and properly enforcing a permanent ban.”

The WWF is also urging the Chinese and US governments to collaborate with Mexico to intercept and halt the illegal transport and sale of totoaba maws, which are thought to be moved via drug-smuggling routes or hidden in legal fish products.

In 2015, Mexico’s federal environment agency Profepa revealed the totoaba maws were more valuable than cocaine in the country, with a kilogram selling for the same as 1.5kg of the drug. The price uncovered by EAL investigators make the swim bladders 10 times more valuable than caviar and 30 times more than elephant ivory.

With the extinction of the vaquita looming, an $4m emergency plan is being put in place to round up a few individuals, with the help of US navy-trained dolphins, and place them in a sanctuary. However, capturing vaquita has not been attempted before, meaning the success of the plan is uncertain.

• This article was amended on 16 May 2017. An earlier version gave the location of the vaquita as the Gulf of Mexico. This has been corrected to say the Gulf of California."

"Cable lobby conducts survey, finds that Americans want net neutrality",https://arstechnica.com/?post_type=post&p=1095139,"As US cable companies push to eliminate or change net neutrality rules, the industry's primary lobby group today released the results of a survey that it says shows ""strong bipartisan consensus that the government should let the Internet flourish without imposing burdensome regulations.""

But proponents of keeping the current rules can find plenty to like in the survey conducted by NCTA—The Internet & Television Association. A strong majority of the 2,194 registered American voters in the survey support the current net neutrality rules that prohibit ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing online content in exchange for payment. While most opposed price regulation, a majority supported an approach in which regulators take action against ISPs on a case-by-case basis when consumers are harmed—the exact same approach the Federal Communications Commission uses under its existing net neutrality regime.

Full results of the NCTA survey conducted with Morning Consult are available here.

About 61 percent of respondents either ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" support net neutrality rules that say ISPs ""cannot block, throttle, or prioritize certain content on the Internet."" Only 18 percent oppose net neutrality, as the rest don't know what it is or had no opinion.

Technically, this doesn't contradict the official position of major cable companies like Comcast and Charter. These companies say they support the core net neutrality rules, while merely opposing the FCC's use of its common carrier authority under Title II of the Communications Act to enforce them. But the net neutrality rules imposed in 2015 depend on Title II because of a 2014 court decision that prevented the FCC from enforcing the rules without reclassifying ISPs as Title II common carriers.

Support for protecting consumers

The first slide in the NCTA survey results trumpets broad support for ""light touch"" regulation. But instead of signaling broad opposition to Title II, the wording of the question shows that Americans support an approach that's consistent with the one taken by the FCC's then-Democratic leadership in 2015 (and which the FCC's current Republican leadership wants to overturn).

The survey asked, ""When it comes to the role of the federal government in regulating access to the Internet, which of the following comes closest to your view, even if none are exactly right?"" Just 12 percent answered that ""the government should have the ability to set specific prices, terms, and conditions for Internet access,"" while 53 percent said, ""the government should have a light-touch approach to the Internet that allows regulators to monitor the marketplace and take action if consumers are harmed."" The only other option people could choose was, ""the government should not regulate the Internet at all.""

The problem with the ""ability to set specific prices"" and ""take action if consumers are harmed"" survey answers is that both of them accurately describe the current federal system. The FCC does have the ability to set specific Internet prices, but it doesn't do so and has no intentions of doing so. The FCC's 2015 net neutrality order did not set specific prices for home and mobile Internet service but used Title II authority to let consumers complain about prices and practices that are unjust or unreasonable. In other words, the FCC's current approach is to ""monitor the marketplace and take action if consumers are harmed,"" the approach supported by the majority of people in the cable survey.

NCTA spokesperson Brian Dietz defended the survey, claiming that the FCC actually ""didn't forbear from price regulation."" To prove his point, he linked to an article which notes that the ""Commission declined to forbear from Sections 201 and 202, which prohibit 'unjust or unreasonable' charges, practices, and classifications, and which prohibit 'unjust or unreasonable discrimination.'""

But the same article points out that the FCC did ""forbear from pre-existing tariffing requirements and its rules governing rate regulation,"" meaning the FCC did not impose rate regulation. The FCC uses Section 201 and 202 to take action if consumers are harmed, but has not ""set specific prices, terms, and conditions for Internet access."" While the Title II order enables a complaint system for consumers to object to unjust or unreasonable prices, we're not aware of any cable company being ordered to lower its prices as a result of that process. Even if companies were occasionally forced to lower prices in response to complaints, that would be consistent with the case-by-case system supported by the majority of people in the cable industry survey.

Fear of price regulation based on hypotheticals

NCTA's concerns about price regulation thus have nothing to do with the current FCC system. Instead, they are focused on what a hypothetical future FCC leadership might do. Dietz said that the NCTA is worried that ""Any FCC can decide to use preemptive price reg[ulations] allowed by Title II. Just because [former Chairman Tom] Wheeler said he wouldn't, others can easily.""

That's true, but that was also true before the 2015 decision to reclassify ISPs as common carriers.

Dietz argued that the FCC ""couldn't use [price regulation] authority on broadband until it was reclassified to Title II in 2015."" But the authority to use Title II and impose price regulation doesn't come from decisions made by the FCC. The authority to classify telecommunications companies as common carriers comes from Congress, via the Communications Act of 1934, and was upheld by a federal appeals court last year when the NCTA and others unsuccessfully sued the FCC to overturn the current net neutrality rules. The FCC's legal authority to reclassify Internet service however it wishes is exactly what current Chairman Ajit Pai is banking on in his proposal to undo the Title II classification.

Whether the FCC currently treats ISPs as common carriers or not doesn't change the fact that the FCC has the underlying authority to do so, and that authority also lets the FCC impose price regulation. The FCC can also reclassify ISPs as common carriers without imposing any price limits on Internet service, as it did in 2015. Having the Title II classification of ISPs on the books in advance could make it easier for a future FCC to impose price limits on broadband. But an FCC intent on using rate regulation could use its reclassification powers at any time it deems fit as long as it follows the appropriate process.

The FCC could even try to impose price caps on Internet service without using Title II. That's because of a 1996 addition to the Communications Act, authorized by a Republican-led Congress, that says the FCC may use ""price cap regulation"" to encourage broadband deployment.

None of this changes the fact that the FCC has not told cable companies what prices they are allowed to charge for home Internet service. One can oppose price regulation and support keeping the current system in place.

Pai and other net neutrality opponents claim that the rules are an overreaction to theoretical harms, rather than actual occurrences. Advocacy group Free Press has an answer for that, with this list of actions by the likes of Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon that either blocked or impeded access to certain online services.

Treating cable like a utility

The most convincing part of the cable survey for the anti-Title II side is that 51 percent of respondents said, ""Internet access should not be considered a public utility regulated by the federal government."" Only 33 percent said Internet access should be a regulated utility, and 16 percent didn't know or had no opinion. This came in response to the question, ""As you may know, a public utility is an essential public service, such as electricity, water, or gas, that is regulated by government. Knowing this, which of the following do you agree with more, even if neither is exactly right?""

Pluralities of survey respondents also agreed that utility-style regulation for ISPs would ""worsen tech innovation"" and ""decrease private sector tech investments.""

But while the cable lobby argues that the FCC currently treats ISPs as utilities by virtue of the Title II classification, people answering these survey questions probably wouldn't see much similarity between the current state of cable company regulation and regulation of electricity, water, and gas service. Sure, the FCC could theoretically regulate cable Internet prices, but it doesn't, whereas the prices of utilities like electricity and gas are commonly set by the government in order to let utilities recover costs while protecting consumers from monopolistic pricing. Utilities are also generally required to serve everyone, whereas ISPs pick and choose where to go and sometimes demand tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars from homeowners in exchange for extending their networks to unprofitable areas.

The FCC does have price caps for certain business broadband services, but last month the commission voted to eliminate those caps throughout much of the US. Those caps also applied only to traditional phone companies, like AT&T and Verizon, and not the cable companies represented by the NCTA.

Regardless of the NCTA's survey results, cable companies are almost certainly going to get what they want. The FCC has scheduled a vote for May 18 to start the process of undoing the Title II classification and net neutrality rules. The FCC will accept comments on the proposal until August 16 (or at least when the FCC's website is working), but Pai has already made it clear that he intends to reverse the Title II classification and is not committing to any rules against blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization."
Tennessee makes community college free for all adults,http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/11/pf/college/tennessee-free-community-college/index.html,"Tennessee is about to become the first state in the nation to make community college free for all adults.

Lawmakers approved legislation Wednesday that will expand the Tennessee Promise program that launched in 2014. It made tuition and fees free for recent high school graduates enrolled in a community college or technical school. Now, adults who don't already have an associate's or bachelor's degree can go for free, too, starting in the 2018 fall semester.

Governor Bill Haslam is expected to sign the bill into law. He proposed the legislation in his State of the State address earlier this year. It's a cornerstone of his initiative to increase the number of residents with a college education to 55% by 2025. Last year, less than 39% of residents had gone to college.

""If we want to have jobs ready for Tennesseans, we have to make sure that Tennesseans are ready for jobs, and there is no smarter investment than increasing access to high-quality education,"" Haslam said in a statement.

To be eligible, students must have been a state resident for at least a year before applying, maintain a 2.0 GPA, enroll in enough classes to be a part-time student, and complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

Expanding the free-tuition program will cost about $10 million once fully implemented. But it will be funded by the state's lottery account, just like the rest of Tennessee Promise.

Students will save about $3,700 a year, which is the average cost of tuition and fees at Tennessee's 13 community colleges. If they already receive a need-based Pell Grant from the federal government, Tennessee will cover any remaining cost.

Since Haslam, a Republican, pushed for the Tennessee Promise program in 2014, the idea of tuition-free college has gained some traction. Oregon has made community college free for recent high school grads and GED recipients, too. San Francisco will make community college free for all residents starting this fall.

In April, New York made tuition free at two- and four-year colleges for students whose families earn no more than $125,000 a year. Lawmakers in Rhode Island are also considering a proposal to make two years of college tuition-free.

More than 33,000 students have benefited from the Tennessee Promise program in its first two years, raising enrollment among first-time freshmen by 30%, according to the governor's office. The first group of eligible students are graduating this year."
An Arab First: Major Lebanese Company Features Same-Sex Couple in an Ad,https://stateofmind13.com/2017/05/10/a-first-for-lebanon-crepaway-features-same-sex-couple-in-their-beautiful-new-ad/,"Make sure you download this blog’s iOS app to stay up to date! (Link).

Earlier today, Crepaway released a new ad to celebrate them turning 33 years, along with their famous tagline: #ComeAsYouAre.

The ad is exactly what you’d expect from the phrase “Come As You Are,” except it’s taken to a whole other level with some Lebanese taboo-breaking as Crepaway features a same-sex couple for the first time ever in an ad made for a Lebanese company. It’s also just in time before Lebanese LGBT NGOs start a week-long campaign to fight homophobia in the country.

Some people might gullibly think that the two women in question are just best friends and brush it off, but it’s far from the case. The voice over says: “And here’s to never hiding your love-bites,” as two women cuddle by the sea, come sunset time.

I was completely taken off guard by them including such a moment. I never expected a high profile company like Crepaway to go there, but I’m glad they did because it raised the quality of their ad’s message so much more.

The ad itself is as “woke” as that moment which is bound to have some people talking in the next few days: it is inclusive, features all kinds of kinds of Lebanese people you’d encounter on a daily basis, and celebrates all those differences that make each one of us, us.

Crepaway, I salute you for the courage you’ve put forth into making and approving such an ad to be how you represent your message in 2017, as you turn 33.

Puerto Rico's $123 Billion Bankruptcy Is the Cost of U.S. Colonialism,https://theintercept.com/2017/05/09/puerto-ricos-123-billion-bankruptcy-is-the-cost-of-u-s-colonialism/,"Last week Puerto Rico officially became the largest bankruptcy case in the history of the American public bond market. On May 3, a fiscal control board imposed on the island’s government by Washington less than a year ago suddenly announced that Puerto Rico’s economic crisis had “reached a breaking point.” The board asked for the immediate appointment of a federal judge to decide how to deal with a staggering $123 billion debt the commonwealth government and its public corporations owe to both bondholders and public employee pension systems. The announcement sparked renewed press attention to a Caribbean territory that many have dubbed America’s Greece. The island’s total debt, according to the control board, is unprecedented for any government insolvency in the U.S., and it is certain to mushroom quickly if no action is taken. Detroit’s bankruptcy, by comparison, involved just $18 billion — one-ninth the size of Puerto Rico’s. Within days, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, acting under a provision of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (known as PROMESA), which was enacted last June, appointed federal Judge Laura Taylor Swain from the Southern District of New York to take over the Puerto Rico case. A former bankruptcy court judge who was appointed to the federal court by President Clinton, Swain famously presided over the long criminal trial of employees of the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. Few press reports on Puerto Rico’s troubles, however, have bothered to examine the deeper issues behind this crisis.

First, the colonial relationship that has prevailed between the U.S. and Puerto Rico since 1898 is no longer viable. Puerto Rico is the largest overseas territory still under the sovereign control of the United States, and it is the most important colonial possession in this nation’s history. That relationship produced uncommon profits for American subsidiaries on the island for more than a century, even as the federal government kept claiming that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, created in 1952, was a self-governing territory. But now, with a Washington-appointed board directly overseeing the island’s economy, and with a pivotal Supreme Court decision last year affirming that Congress continues to exercise sovereign power over Puerto Rico, the mask of self-governance has been removed. The old commonwealth is effectively dead. Absent a huge infusion of U.S. public dollars to prop up its collapsing economy, a scenario that is nearly impossible with a Trump White House and a Republican-controlled Congress, that relationship cannot be revived. Political leaders in both Washington and San Juan, whether they like it or not, are being propelled to fashion a new political and economic status for the territory. They will have to finally decide whether to completely annex Puerto Rico as the 51st state or acknowledge that it still remains a distinct nation, with the right to its own sovereignty and independence. Second, the impact of Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy will continue to reverberate throughout the U.S. bond market, far more than most Wall Street analysts have so far acknowledged. The PROMESA control board has warned that even with massive cuts to government services and new projected revenues from higher taxes and fees, Puerto Rico will still generate slightly less than $8 billion in budget surpluses over the next 10 years, when some $35 billion in debt service comes due. In other words, three-quarters of the debt cannot be repaid. That is not just a haircut for bondholders; it is a head-shaving, one that will send shock waves throughout the municipal bond market. After all, bonds backed by the full faith-and-credit of local government entities have long been considered among the safest of investments. Years of court battles between Puerto Rico and contending groups of creditors are now certain. “The economy of Puerto Rico will be put on hold for years,” Andrew Rosenberg, adviser to the Ad Hoc Group of Puerto Rico General Obligation Bondholders, told the Associated Press. “Make no mistake: The board has chosen to turn Puerto Rico into the next Argentina.”

The Debt Is Not Payable Civil society groups contend that the plunder of the Puerto Rican people through predatory and even illegal bond deals that island politicians concocted together with top Wall Street firms will now be exposed. Amazingly, the 23-page petition that the federal government’s own financial control board filed in U.S. District Court in San Juan reached the exact same conclusion that Puerto Rico’s former Gov. Alejandro García Padilla reached back in June 2015 — that the island’s debt is “not payable.” In the nearly two years since García Padilla sounded the alarm, however, Washington has done almost nothing to alleviate the economic catastrophe afflicting 3.4 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, except to establish the control board by enacting PROMESA. On an island that has lost 10 percent of its population in the last 10 years, where 46 percent of the population lives below the U.S. poverty level, where the unemployment rate is more than 11 percent, and where the labor force participation hovers around 40 percent, lawmakers in Congress have kept insisting on greater austerity from Puerto Rico’s population. The reality is such dire conditions would never be tolerated among U.S. citizens in any other jurisdiction, yet they are allowed to persist in Puerto Rico. During the past two years, the commonwealth government has sharply raised electricity and water rates. It has increased the sales tax (now a value added tax) to 11.5 percent. It has proposed ending all pensions for new workers and cutting existing benefits by an average of 10 percent. And last week, it announced the closing of 179 public schools for the coming school year. In addition, the control board has called for a $450 million cut over the next four years to the island’s 70,000-student public university. Under the control board’s pressure, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who took office in January, is eyeing the privatization of the government-owned electric company, the water and sewer authority, even the public transit system. But even massive cuts and selling off public assets can’t solve the problem that there aren’t enough jobs on the island, that young people keep fleeing to the United States, and that Puerto Rico’s government is powerless to fashion its own economic and trade policy independently from the U.S.

Hacker group Anonymous warns that World War Three is 'looming' on the Korean peninsula.,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4488488/Hacker-group-Anonymous-says-World-War-Three-looming.html,"The hacker collective Anonymous has issued a new video warning that World War Three could soon break out as tensions rise on the Korean peninsula.

The video, released Saturday by the loose collective of affiliated hackers, attempts to connect the geopolitical dots, concluding that 'all the signs of a looming war on the Korean peninsula are surfacing.'

Using the group's signature computerized voice and shadowy figure clad in a Guy Fawkes mask, the roughly seven-minute video highlights American military buildup in East Asia and warnings from the Chinese and Japanese government to their citizens, among other developments, as evidence that global war is inching closer.

'Watching as each country moves strategic pieces into place, but unlike past world wars, although there will be ground troops, the battle is likely to be fierce, brutal and quick,' the Anonymous video prognosticates.

The US missile defense system THAAD is seen being installed on a golf course in South Korea. This is just one military move that Anonymous says points toward a looming global war

Anonymous, a decentralized group that grew out of the imageboard 4chan in the 2000s, has a history of using hacked data, targeted harassment, and publicity campaigns in a self-described effort to spread 'information and facts the government doesn't want you to know.'

'With three superpowers drawn into the mix, other nations will be coerced into choosing sides,' the group says in its latest video, although it isn't clear which three nations the group is referring to. The video makes no mention of Russia.

The video goes on to highlight several recent developments in East Asia. First, it points to the recent roll-out of the American THAAD ballistic missile defense system in South Korea, a move condemned by the Chinese.

China's recent warning to its citizens to leave North Korea, and military buildup at the North Korean border in anticipation of a potential flood of North Korean refugees, also merit attention, according to Anonymous.

'The pragmatic Chinese, it seems, are starting to lose their patience,' the group says.

As further evidence of looming war, Anonymous points to a recent warning the Japanese government gave its citizens living near military bases, alerting them that they could only have a 10 minute warning in the event of a nuclear attack from North Korea.

Life expectancy gap between rich and poor US regions is 'more than 20 years',https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/may/08/life-expectancy-gap-rich-poor-us-regions-more-than-20-years,"While overall life expectancy is rising in America, the size of the gap between its most affluent and impoverished counties demands urgent action, say researchers

Your average life expectancy now varies by more than 20 years depending on where you live in the United States, according to an in-depth study by the University of Washington.

America’s “life expectancy gap” is also predicted to grow even wider in future, with 11.5% of US counties having experienced an increase in the risk of death for residents aged 25–45 over the period studied (1980-2014). No previous study has put the disparity at even close to 20 years.

“This is way worse than any of us had assumed,” said Ali Mokdad, professor of global health at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and one of the authors of the study, published by the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.

The researchers found that while residents of certain affluent counties in central Colorado had the highest life expectancy at 87 years, people in several counties of North and South Dakota, typically those with Native American reservations, could expect to die far younger, at only 66.

I hope policymakers will look at this and say it's not about politics any more, but the future of the United States Ali Mokdad

“The magnitude of these disparities demands action, all the more urgently because inequalities will only increase further if recent trends are allowed to continue uncontested,” the report states.

Overall, the study puts average life expectancy in the US at 79.1 years, an increase of 5.3 years from 1980 – the start of a 35-year period for which the university team compared death records, census returns, the human mortality database and figures from the National Center for Health Statistics on a county-by-county basis. But it concludes that this 5.3-year increase “masks massive variation at the county level”.

“Counties in central Colorado, Alaska and along both coasts experienced much larger increases, while some southern counties in states stretching from Oklahoma to West Virginia saw little, if any, improvement over this same period,” the report says.

“Similarly, there was considerable variation among counties in the percent decline in the mortality risk within each age group. While all counties experienced declines in mortality risk for children 0 to five years, and nearly all experienced declines in the mortality risk for adolescents and older adults 45 to 85, 11.5% [of counties] experienced increases in the risk of death between ages 25 and 45 years.”

If the figures are surprising, the factors cited in the study to explain the “large and increasing” geographic inequalities perhaps are not. The authors point the finger at differences in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, the availability of – and access to – quality healthcare and insurance, and “preventable risk factors” such as smoking, drinking and physical inactivity.

“You expect disparities in any country, but you don’t expect the disparities to be increasing in a country with our wealth and might,” Mokdad said. “We spend more money on healthcare than anybody else, and we debate the hell out of healthcare more than anybody else, and still the disparities are increasing.

Guns, car crashes and drugs cut US male life expectancy by a year, research says Read more

“Everybody, in Europe and elsewhere, is increasing life expectancy at a greater pace than we are, so that’s also disappointing and not acceptable for a country like the US.

“Compare us to Australia – a young country, lots of immigrants, a native population – and they have been more aggressive than us in many of the laws for prevention. On gun control, on drinking and driving, they’re ahead of us. On tobacco – their packaging on tobacco, their advertisements – we’re not even close to them right now.”



Analysis of county-by-county statistics allowed the study team to identify the areas of greatest inequality and incorporate their findings into a colour-coded map of the US, where counties in which life expectancy at birth is low are shaded in red, and those with longer expectations are blue.

As well as the pockets in the Dakotas, swaths of dark red are particularly prevalent in rural western Mississippi, eastern Kentucky and southwestern West Virginia – areas that are all considered to be generally economically challenged.

Meanwhile, the darkest blue covers most of central Colorado, western Wyoming and Texas, the majority of the coastal counties of California and southwestern Florida, with a concentration also seen in southern Minnesota.

According to Mokdad, the ongoing wrangling in the US Congress over health insurance reform perfectly showcases one of the factors cited for the inequality. “Many people don’t have health insurance, but even among those who do it’s misleading,” he said.

Inequality index: where are the world's most unequal countries? Read more

“My insurance, for example, allows me to go to a doctor for an exam and a blood test and they’ll tell me if I have a problem early on. Many don’t have that luxury, only catastrophic insurance, so if they’re hit by a car they’ll be treated.

“There are disparities by race, by economy, by geography. In Seattle there’s a good medical centre but if I have a heart attack and I’m two hours away in the mountains, it’s going to take me longer to get good care.

“If you decide to eat right it’s so expensive. We’re one of the richest cities in the country – we have Amazon, Boeing, Microsoft, headquartered here among many other companies – but if you go into some stores here in the poor areas south of the city, you can’t buy fresh fruit, vegetables and salads.

“We have places where there’s an obesity epidemic, and we have an epidemic of smoking that’s coming down but still as high in some rural areas as Europe and the Middle East.”

Previous studies recorded lower variations ranging from 12 to 17 years between counties, with the highest and lowest life expectancies in both 2007 and 2010. These were an underestimation, according to the University of Washington team, because data from smaller counties was either combined with others or excluded altogether.

Mokdad said he was looking for the report to start a conversation between communities, healthcare experts and policymakers about narrowing the inequality gap.

“In the US, do we want to wait for people to come to the hospital so we can treat them? That’s a failure,” he said. “We need to make an investment in prevention.

“People who are sick need the best treatment, we all agree, but that investment shouldn’t be at the expense of what is really important: planning the health of a nation and prevention of disease. I’m hoping the policymakers will look at this and say whatever we are doing is not about politics any more, it’s about the future of the United States.”

Horrific phone calls reveal how Italian Coast Guard let dozens of refugees drown,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italian-navy-lets-refugees-drown-migrants-crisis-asylum-seekers-mediterranean-sea-a7724156.html,"Horrific phone calls which reveal how the Italian Coast Guard let dozens of refugees drown in the Mediterranean Sea in 2013, have been obtained by an Italian newspaper.

In previously unheard audio, Italian authorities tell a caller from the sinking refugee ship to ""call Malta,"" despite an Italian Navy patrol boat being miles away.

As the fishing boat began to take on water, it was around 61 miles away from the Italian island of Lampedusa and within the territorial waters of Malta, which was 118 miles away.

During the distress call, released by the Italian magazine L'Espresso, a man who identifies himself as a Syrian doctor named Mohamed Jammo can be heard asking for help as he tells authorities the boat is taking on water and sinking.

""Please hurry,"" Mr Jammo repeats. ""The boat is going down.""

When he later calls the Coast Guard to ask if they had sent anyone, an operator tells Mr Jammo to call Malta.

""Because you are near Malta,"" the man explained. ""Call Malta directly very quickly, they are close, OK?""

Mr Jammo then called the Italian Coast Guard again to tell them he had called Malta and been told the boat was closer to Lampadusa than Malta.

""We are dying, please,"" he added.

But the operator repeated the instruction, telling him: ""You have to call Malta, sir.""

During the ordeal, the Italian Navy's patrol boat Libra was awaiting orders between 10 to 19 miles away.

In a call to the operations room of the Armed Forces of Malta, an Italian coast guard operator voiced his concern that if the patrol boat was dispatched it would have to transfer the refugees to the nearest coast, which would have been Lampedusa.

""I think it is not the best way to operate,"" he explains, going on to say it would mean the loss of an ""asset in the area"" to spot other ""targets,"" presumably refugee boats.

The Maltese authorities clearly told the Italian Coast Guard their navy's boat was the closest to the refugees.

Five hours after Mr Jammo's initial call to the Italian Coast Guard, the fishing boat capsized, sending over 260 people, including 60 children, into the Mediterranean Sea.

Tales of trauma from Syria's refugee children

There is yet to be an official investigation into the 11 October sinking, with reports stating at least 34 refugees were confirmed dead.

Around 147 survivors were taken to Malta and a further 56 taken to Italy.

Some of the Syrian refugees reported the boat had been fired upon by Libyan militiamen during a trafficking gang dispute.

The Independent has contacted the Italian Coast Guard for comment.

Texas governor signs into law bill to punish 'sanctuary cities',http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-texas-idUSKBN18402L?il=0,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed into law on Sunday a measure to punish “sanctuary cities,” despite a plea from police chiefs of the state’s biggest cities to halt the bill they said would hinder their ability to fight crime.

The Texas measure comes as Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has made combating illegal immigration a priority. Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants and the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, has been at the forefront of the immigration debate.

“As governor, my top priority is public safety, and this bill furthers that objective by keeping dangerous criminals off our streets,” Abbott said in a statement. The law will take effect on Sept. 1.

The Republican-dominated legislature passed the bill on party-line votes and sent the measure to Abbott earlier this month. It would punish local authorities who do not abide by requests to cooperate with federal immigration agents.

Police officials found to be in violation of the law could face removal from office, fines and up to a year in prison if convicted.

The measure also allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention, even for minor infractions like jaywalking.

Any anti-sanctuary city measure may face a tough road after a federal judge in April blocked Trump’s executive order seeking to withhold funds from local authorities that do not use their resources to advance federal immigration laws.

Democrats have warned the measure could lead to unconstitutional racial profiling and civil rights groups have promised to fight the Texas measure in court.

“This legislation is bad for Texas and will make our communities more dangerous for all,” the police chiefs of cities including Houston and Dallas wrote in an opinion piece in the Dallas Morning News in late April.

They said immigration was a federal obligation and the law would stretch already meager resources by turning local police into immigration agents.

The police chiefs said the measure would widen a gap between police and immigrant communities, creating a class of silent victims and eliminating the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving or preventing crimes.

One of the sponsors of the bill, Republican state Representative Charlie Geren, said in House debate the bill would have no effect on immigrants in the country illegally if they had not committed a crime.

He also added there were no sanctuary cities in Texas at present and the measure would prevent any from emerging."

Internet privacy provisions removed from Minnesota bill,http://www.twincities.com/2017/05/01/internet-privacy-provisions-removed-from-minnesota-bill/,"Both the Minnesota House and Senate voted this year to limit what internet service providers can do with their customers’ data. But those provisions have been dropped from a compromise bill unveiled Monday.

Lawmakers say the language could still be added back into the bill in the three weeks remaining before this year’s legislative session ends

“It is a work in progress,” said Sen. David Osmek, the Mound Republican who co-chairs the committee negotiating a final language.

The internet provider privacy language was included as part of a much larger bill: the $378 million budget for jobs, commerce and energy programs. A bill combining the different House and Senate versions of the budget was unveiled Monday, but has not yet been finalized.

State Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, authored the Senate version of the privacy language, and said he was “shocked” that it had been removed from the bill.

“Every place I go… the first thing someone tells me is, ‘Thanks for protecting my privacy on the Internet,’ ” Latz said. “This really touched a nerve with the public. I think the Legislature ought to respect that.”

In the final months of President Barack Obama’s administration, the Federal Communications Commission passed rules that would have limited what ISPs could do with their customers’ data. But Congress voted to prevent this rule from taking effect early this year. That spurred Minnesota lawmakers to vote near-unanimously to pass state versions of the protections.

Osmek was the lone vote against the privacy provision on the Senate floor, but later introduced a similar stand-alone bill. On Monday, he argued for patience.

“Every Minnesotan’s privacy rights are the same today as they were on January 1 (and) as they were in 2016,” Osmek said.

State Rep. Paul Thissen, the Minneapolis Democrat who introduced the House language, said he’s told there’s still a chance the privacy language could be put back in.

“From what I hear it’s still a subject of conversations,” Thissen said. “I still think we’re going to be able to get work done on it.”"

“The Chinese have a very ambitious moon programme already in place,” Mr Hvistendahl said. “Space has changed since the space race of the Sixties. We recognise that to explore space for peaceful purposes, we do international cooperation.”

Johann-Dietrich Wörner, the director general of the 22-member ESA, has described its proposed “Moon Village” as a potential international launching pad for future missions to Mars and a chance to develop space tourism or even lunar mining.

China arrived relatively late to space travel but has ramped up its programme since its first manned spaceflight in 2003, more than 42 years after a Soviet cosmonaut became the first to reach orbit.

Last week, the China National Space Administration launched an unmanned spacecraft on a mission to dock with its currently unoccupied space station. It plans to launch a mission to collect samples from the moon by the end of this year and conduct the first mission to the moon’s far side to bring back mineral samples next year.

The ESA hopes to conduct a mission analysis on samples brought back by this year’s Chinese mission, known as Chang’e 5, and also have a European flying on the Chinese space station at some future date, Mr Hvistendahl said. Neither prospect has been finalised.

China was excluded from the International Space Station mainly due to US legislation barring such cooperation and concerns over the Chinese space programme's strong military connections."
Unusual love story of French presidential front-runner and wife who is his former teacher and 25 years his senior,http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/unusual-love-story-french-presidential-10284722,"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inbox Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email

If Emmanuel Macron defeats far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in May's showdown for the French presidency, the country will have perhaps its most unexpected first lady ever.

Macron's wife, Brigitte Trogneux, was his drama teacher in high school and is 25 years his senior. He's 39, she's 64.

The front-runner was just 16 when he vowed to marry Trogneux - a married mum-of-three at the time - and his parents even tried to put a stop to the schoolboy love affair, according to a new book.

The unusual love story has captivated French tabloids and magazines, and emerged as a major storyline during Macron's rapid rise towards the Elysee Palace, with both husband and wife hitting back at critics.

Throughout the campaign Macron, an independent centrist, and Trogneux have been photographed embracing and kissing, including during Sunday night's celebration after he advanced to the May 7 run-off election against Le Pen .

Macron, who quit the Socialist Party to run for president and founded the party En Marche! in April last year, has repeatedly paid tribute to his wife and told his supporters she would play a major role as France's first lady if he's elected.

The May-December romance blossomed as Trogneux taught Macron when he was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit college in Amiens.

A new book says he defied orders from his parents to end the romance and his father ordered Trogneux to stay away from his son until he reached 18.

A tearful Trogneux, then known as Brigitte Auziere (her married name), replied: ""I cannot promise you anything.""

Last year she told a French documentary that he wasn't like the other teenagers in her classes, BBC News reported.

She recalled how he proposed writing a play together, adding: ""I didn’t think it would go very far.

""I thought he would get bored. We wrote, and little by little I was totally overcome by the intelligence of this boy.”

At 16, Macron's parents sent him to Paris to continue his studies but he vowed to marry Trogneux, who was around 40.

Trogneux told the documentary: “We’d call each other all the time and spend hours on the phone.

""Bit by bit, he defeated all my resistance, in an amazing way, with patience.”

The relationship continued after he left for Paris, became an adult and graduated from university, and eventually moved into investment banking, although it was unclear when the romance became a full-blown love affair.

Trogneux joined him in Paris and the couple married in 2007 - she did not take his name - after she divorced her first husband. The pair have not had any children together.

New details about their romance emerged in journalist Anne Fulda's timely book, ""Emannuel Macron: A Perfect Young Man"".

She interviewed Macron, Trogneux and both of his parents, and said they were shocked when they found out he was pursuing his teacher.

Macron's mother was quoted as saying: ""We couldn't believe it. What is clear is that when Emmanuel met Brigitte we couldn't just say: 'That's great!'""

She later confronted Trogneux saying: ""Don't you see. You've had your life. But he won't have children with you.""

Fulda said Macron's parents have since accepted the relationship and his mother has since described her as ""adorable"".

In the book, Trogneux was discreet about the origins of the affair.

She was quoted as saying: ""Nobody will ever know at what moment our story became a love story. That belongs to us. That is our secret.""

Macron, who could become France's youngest ever president, hit back at critics, saying: ""Nobody would call it unusual if the age difference was reversed. People find it difficult to accept something that is sincere and unique.""

Fulda said the couple once avoided publicity but that changed once Macron started running for president.

She told BBC News: ""He wants to give the idea that, if he was able to seduce a woman 24 years his senior and a mother of three children, in a small provincial town... despite opprobrium and mockery, he can conquer France in the same way.""

In November 2016, Macron declared that he would run in the election under the banner of En Marche! , a centrist political movement he founded in April 2016."
How US nuclear force modernization is undermining strategic stability: The burst-height compensating super-fuze,http://thebulletin.org/how-us-nuclear-force-modernization-undermining-strategic-stability-burst-height-compensating-super10578,"The US nuclear forces modernization program has been portrayed to the public as an effort to ensure the reliability and safety of warheads in the US nuclear arsenal, rather than to enhance their military capabilities. In reality, however, that program has implemented revolutionary new technologies that will vastly increase the targeting capability of the US ballistic missile arsenal. This increase in capability is astonishing—boosting the overall killing power of existing US ballistic missile forces by a factor of roughly three—and it creates exactly what one would expect to see, if a nuclear-armed state were planning to have the capacity to fight and win a nuclear war by disarming enemies with a surprise first strike.

Because of improvements in the killing power of US submarine-launched ballistic missiles, those submarines now patrol with more than three times the number of warheads needed to destroy the entire fleet of Russian land-based missiles in their silos. US submarine-based missiles can carry multiple warheads, so hundreds of others, now in storage, could be added to the submarine-based missile force, making it all the more lethal.

The revolutionary increase in the lethality of submarine-borne US nuclear forces comes from a “super-fuze” device that since 2009 has been incorporated into the Navy’s W76-1/Mk4A warhead as part of a decade-long life-extension program. We estimate that all warheads deployed on US ballistic missile submarines now have this fuzing capability. Because the innovations in the super-fuze appear, to the non-technical eye, to be minor, policymakers outside of the US government (and probably inside the government as well) have completely missed its revolutionary impact on military capabilities and its important implications for global security.

Before the invention of this new fuzing mechanism, even the most accurate ballistic missile warheads might not detonate close enough to targets hardened against nuclear attack to destroy them. But the new super-fuze is designed to destroy fixed targets by detonating above and around a target in a much more effective way. Warheads that would otherwise overfly a target and land too far away will now, because of the new fuzing system, detonate above the target.

FIGURE 1. The deployment of the new MC4700 arming, fuzing, and firing system on the W76-1/Mk4A significantly increases the number of hard target kill-capable warheads on US ballistic missile submarines.

The result of this fuzing scheme is a significant increase in the probability that a warhead will explode close enough to destroy the target even though the accuracy of the missile-warhead system has itself not improved.

As a consequence, the US submarine force today is much more capable than it was previously against hardened targets such as Russian ICBM silos. A decade ago, only about 20 percent of US submarine warheads had hard-target kill capability; today they all do. (See Figure 1.)

This vast increase in US nuclear targeting capability, which has largely been concealed from the general public, has serious implications for strategic stability and perceptions of US nuclear strategy and intentions.

Russian planners will almost surely see the advance in fuzing capability as empowering an increasingly feasible US preemptive nuclear strike capability—a capability that would require Russia to undertake countermeasures that would further increase the already dangerously high readiness of Russian nuclear forces. Tense nuclear postures based on worst-case planning assumptions already pose the possibility of a nuclear response to false warning of attack. The new kill capability created by super-fuzing increases the tension and the risk that US or Russian nuclear forces will be used in response to early warning of an attack—even when an attack has not occurred.

The increased capability of the US submarine force will likely be seen as even more threatening because Russia does not have a functioning space-based infrared early warning system but relies primarily on ground-based early warning radars to detect a US missile attack. Since these radars cannot see over the horizon, Russia has less than half as much early-warning time as the United States. (The United States has about 30 minutes, Russia 15 minutes or less.)

The inability of Russia to globally monitor missile launches from space means that Russian military and political leaders would have no “situational awareness” to help them assess whether an early-warning radar indication of a surprise attack is real or the result of a technical error.

The combination of this lack of Russian situational awareness, dangerously short warning times, high-readiness alert postures, and the increasing US strike capacity has created a deeply destabilizing and dangerous strategic nuclear situation.

When viewed in the alarming context of deteriorating political relations between Russia and the West, and the threats and counter-threats that are now becoming the norm for both sides in this evolving standoff, it may well be that the danger of an accident leading to nuclear war is as high now as it was in periods of peak crisis during the Cold War.

How the new accuracy-enhancing fuze works. The significant increase in the ability of the W76-1/Mk4A warhead to destroy hardened targets—including Russian silo-based ICBMs—derives from a simple physical fact: Explosions that occur near and above the ground over a target can be lethal to it. This above-target area is known as a “lethal volume”; the detonation of a warhead of appropriate yield in this volume will result in the destruction of the target.

The recognition that the killing power of the W76 warhead could be vastly increased by equipping it with a new fuze was discussed in a 1994 alternate warhead study conducted by the Defense and Energy departments. The study calculated the number of warheads that would be needed for the W76 to attack the Russian target base, if START II were implemented. At the time, W76/Mk4 warheads had a fixed height-of-burst fuze (meaning the fuze could not adjust its detonation at an optimal location if it were falling short or long of a target). With those fixed-height fuzes, submarine-launched nuclear missiles were mainly aimed at softer targets such as military bases.

But the study found that an enhanced Mk4A reentry-body with a new fuze that provided for an adjustable height-of-burst as it arrives would have significant capabilities against harder targets, compared to warheads with the earlier fuzes. The study assumed that a smaller number of Mk4 nuclear warheads with higher killing power per warhead could cover the Russian target base and be more effective than multiple attacks on targets with less destructive warheads. In other words, an enhanced fuze would allow the United States to reduce the number of warheads on its ballistic missile submarines, but increase the targeting effectiveness of the fleet.

Figure 2 illustrates the kill distribution of US submarine-launched nuclear missiles equipped with the earlier, fixed height-of-burst fuzes. The dome-shaped volume outlined in gray shows the lethal volume within which a 100-kiloton nuclear explosion will generate 10,000 pounds per square inch or more of blast pressure on the ground. In other words, if a target on the ground cannot survive a blast of 10,000 pounds per square inch or more, it will be destroyed if a 100-kt nuclear weapon detonates anywhere within that dome-shaped volume.

FIGURE 2. Missiles with fixed height-of-burst fuzes can overshoot or undershoot the “lethal volume” (shown here by a gray, dome-shaped line), limiting their ability to destroy hardened targets.

To show the physical relationship of the lethal volume for a particular ground target of interest—in this case a Russian SS-18 ICBM silo—Figure 2 was drawn to scale. Also shown to scale is the approximate spread of warhead trajectories that correspond to a missile that is accurate to 100 meters, a miss distance roughly the same as what is achieved by the Trident II sea-launched ballistic missile.

Miss distances are typically characterized in terms of a quantity called the “circular error probable,” or CEP, which is defined as the radius of a circle around the aim point within which half of the warheads aimed at a target are expected to impact. In the case of a Trident II 100-kt W76-1 ballistic missile warhead, the lethal distance on the ground and the CEP are roughly equal. As a result, roughly half of the warheads equipped with the old, fixed-height fuze system could be expected to fall close enough to detonate on the ground within the lethal range.

The new super-fuze for W76-1/Mk4A has a flexible height-of-burst capability that enables it to detonate at any height within the lethal volume over a target. Figure 3 shows how the new fuze vastly increases the chances that the target will be destroyed, even though the arriving warheads have essentially the same ballistic accuracy.

The super-fuze is designed to measure its altitude well before it arrives near the target and while it is still outside the atmosphere. This measurement would typically be taken at an altitude of 60 to 80 kilometers, where the effects of atmospheric drag are very small. At this point, the intended trajectory is known to very high precision before the warhead begins to substantially slow from atmospheric drag. If the warhead altitude measured by the super-fuze at that time were exactly equal to the altitude expected for the intended trajectory, the warhead would be exactly on target. But if the altitude were higher than expected, the warhead could be expected to hit beyond the intended aim point. Likewise, if the altitude is lower than that expected, the warhead would likely hit short of the intended aim point.

Testing has established the statistical shape and orientation of the expected spread of warhead locations as they fly towards the target. In the case of Trident II, the spread of trajectories around the intended trajectory is so small that the best way to increase the chances of detonating inside the lethal volume is to intentionally shift the aim point slightly beyond the location of the target. (Note that the intended trajectory in Figure 3 is shifted slightly down range.)

By shifting the aim point down range by a distance roughly equal to a CEP, warheads that would otherwise fall short or long of the target using the conventional Mk4 fuze instead will detonate—at different heights dictated by the super fuze—within the lethal volume above a target. This shift in the down-range aim point will result in a very high percentage of warheads that overfly the target detonating in the lethal volume. The end result is that with the new Mk4A super-fuze, a substantially higher percentage of launched warheads detonate inside the lethal volume, resulting in a considerable increase in the likelihood that the target is destroyed.

FIGURE 3. The tilted ellipse in the left upper corner of Figure 3 depicts the spatial distribution of incoming warheads at the time the super-fuze measures its altitude. In this particular case, the orientation of the ellipsoid indicates that the errors leading to a miss at the target are mostly due to a mix of small discrepancies in the velocity and direction of the warheads when they are deployed from the rocket upper stage outside the atmosphere. The orientation and dimensions of this ellipse are well known to a ballistic missile designer, so the altitude measurement can provide information that leads to an estimate of the distance from the lethal volume above the target.

The ultimate effect of the super fuze’s flexible burst-height capability is a significantly increased target kill probability of the new W76-1/Mk4A warhead compared with the conventional warhead of the same type. Figure 4 shows the probability that warheads will detonate close enough to destroy the ground-target for both the conventional fuze and the super-fuze.

FIGURE 4. The probability of destroying a fully hardened Russian target with the super-fuzed W76-1/Mk4A warhead atop an American submarine-launched ballistic missile is about 86 percent—far higher than would be the case with the previous fuzing for the warhead.

As can be seen from figure 4, the probability of kill using a submarine-launched warhead with the new super-fuze (W76-1/Mk4A) is about 0.86. This 86 percent probability is very close to what could be achieved using three warheads with conventional fuzes to attack the same target. To put it differently: In the case of the 100-kt Trident II warhead, the super fuze triples the killing power of the nuclear force it has been applied to.

Many Russian targets are not hardened to 10,000 pounds per square inch blast overpressure. Figure 5 shows the same probability of kill curves for the case of a target that is only hard to 2,000 pounds per square inch or more of blast overpressure, which is the actual case for almost all targets hardened to nuclear attack—ICBMs and supporting command posts, hardened structures at strategic airbases, submarines at pierside or in protected tunnels, hardened command posts at road mobile missile bases and elsewhere, etc. In this case, the super-fuze achieves a probability of kill of about 0.99—or very near certainty. This case also is equivalent to achieving a probability of kill associated with using three warheads with a 0.83 probability to achieve a 0.99 probability of kill.

FIGURE 5. The likelihood that a submarine-launched ballistic missile will destroy all but the most hardened targets approaches 100 percent.

The probability of kills revealed by figures 4 and 5 have enormous security ramifications.

The US military assumes that Russian SS-18 and TOPOL missile silos are hardened to withstand a pressure of 10,000 pounds per square inch or more. Since with the new super-fuze, the probability of kill against these silos is near 0.9, the entire force of 100-kt W76-1/Mk4A Trident II warheads now “qualifies” for use against the hardest of Russian silos. This, in turn, means that essentially all of the higher-yield nuclear weapons (such as the W88/Mk5) that were formerly assigned to these Russian hard targets can now be focused on other, more demanding missions, including attacks against deeply-buried underground command facilities. In effect, the significant increase in the killing power of the W76 warhead allows the United States to use its submarine-based weapons more decisively in a wider range of missions than was the case before the introduction of this fuze.

The history of the US super-fuze program. The super-fuze is officially known as the arming, fuzing and firing (AF&F) system. It consists of a fuze, an arming subsystem (which includes the radar), a firing subsystem, and a thermal battery that powers the system. The AF&F is located in the tip of the cone-shaped reentry body above the nuclear explosive package itself. The AF&F developed for the new W76-1/Mk4A is known as MC4700 and forms part of the W76 life-extension program intended to extend the service life of the W76—the most numerous warhead in the US stockpile—out to the time period 2040-2050.

The new super-fuze uses a technology first deployed on the high-yield W88/Mk5 Trident II warhead. The Navy’s Strategic Systems Program contracted with the Lockheed Missile and Space Corporation in the early 1980s to develop a new fuze that included “a radar-updated, path-length compensating fuze … that could adjust for trajectory errors and significantly improve the ability to destroy a target. This was an early and sophisticated use of artificial intelligence in a weapon.”

It was the radar-updated, path-length compensating fuze—combined with the increased accuracy of the Trident II missile—that gave an SLBM the ability to hold a hardened target at risk.

Efforts to incorporate the W88/Mk5 fuze capability into the W76/Mk4 was part of the Energy Department’s Warhead Protection Program in the mid-1990s to permit “Mk5 fuzing functionality (including radar-updated path length fuzing, and radar proximity fuzing) as an option to replacement of the much smaller Mk4 AF&F,” according to the partially declassified 1996 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (emphasis added).

Apart from the inherent drive to improve military capabilities whenever possible, the motivation for increasing the target kill capability of the submarine-borne W76 was that the Air Force’s hard-target killer, the MX Peacekeeper ICBM, was scheduled to be retired under the START II treaty. The Navy only had 400 W88 hard-target kill warheads, so a decision was made to add the capability to the W76.

In an article in April 1997, Strategic Systems Program director Rear Adm. George P. Nanos publicly explained that “just by changing the fuze in the Mk4 reentry body, you get a significant improvement. The Mk4, with a modified fuze and Trident II accuracy, can meet the original D5 [submarine-borne missile] hard target requirement,” Nanos stated.

Later that same year, the Energy Department’s Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan formally described the objective of the fuze modernization program “to enable W76 to take advantage of [the] higher accuracy of [the] D5 missile.”

FIGURE 6. The first of the new MC4700 AF&F super-fuzes for the W76-1 were completed at the Kansas City Plant in 2007. Delivery of the W76-1/Mk4A warhead to the Navy began in 2009.

By 1998, the fuze modernization effort became a formal project, with five SLBM flight tests planned for 2001-2008. Full-scale production of the super-fuze equipped W76-1/Mk4A began in September 2008, with the first warhead delivered to the Navy in February 2009. By the end of 2016, roughly 1,200 of an estimated 1,600 planned W76-1/Mk4As had been produced, of which about 506 are currently deployed on ballistic missile submarines.

The implications. The newly created capability to destroy Russian silo-based nuclear forces with 100-kt W76-1/Mk4A warheads—the most numerous in the US stockpile—vastly expands the nuclear warfighting capabilities of US nuclear forces. Since only part of the W76 force would be needed to eliminate Russia’s silo-based ICBMs, the United States will be left with an enormous number of higher-yield warheads that would then be available to be reprogrammed for other missions.

Approximately 890 warheads are deployed on US ballistic missile submarines (506 W76-1/Mk4A and 384 W88/Mk5). Assuming that the 506 deployed W76-1s equipped with the super-fuze were used against Russian silo-based ICBMs, essentially all 136 Russian silo-based ICBMs could be potentially eliminated by attacking each silo with two W76-1 warheads—a total of 272 warheads. This would consume only 54 percent of the deployed W76-1 warheads, leaving roughly 234 of the 500 warheads free to be targeted on yet other installations. And hundreds of additional submarine warheads are in storage for increasing the missile warhead loading if so ordered. The Trident II missiles that are deployed today carry an average of four to five W76-1 warheads each. However, each missile could carry eight such warheads if the US were to suddenly decide to carry a maximum load of W76 warheads on its deployed Trident II ballistic missiles. And the missile was tested with up to 12 warheads.

Essentially all the 384 W88 “heavy” Trident II warheads, with yields of 455 kt, would also be available for use against deeply-buried targets. In addition, about 400 Minuteman III warheads, with yields of about 300 kt, could be used to target hardened Russian targets. In all, the entire Russian silo-based forces could potentially be destroyed while leaving the US with 79 percent of its ballistic missile warheads unused.

Even after Russia’s silo-based missiles were attacked, the US nuclear firepower remaining would be staggering—and certainly of concern to Russia or any other country worried about a US first strike.

Because of the new kill capabilities of US submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), the United States would be able to target huge portions of its nuclear force against non-hardened targets, the destruction of which would be crucial to a “successful” first strike. One such mission would likely involve the destruction of road-mobile ICBMs that had left their garrisons to hide in Russia’s vast forests in anticipation of attack. The garrisons and their support facilities would probably be destroyed quickly, and some of the dispersed road-mobile launchers would also be quickly destroyed as they were in the process of dispersing. To destroy or expose the remaining launchers, United States planners would have the nuclear forces needed to undertake truly scorched-earth tactics: Just 125 US Minuteman III warheads could set fire to some 8,000 square miles of forest area where the road-mobile missiles are most likely to be deployed. This would be the equivalent of a circular area with a diameter of 100 miles.

Such an attack would be potentially aimed at destroying all road-mobile launchers either as they disperse or after they have taken up position some short distance from roads that give them access to forested areas.

Many of the nearly 300 remaining deployed W76 warheads could be used to attack all command posts associated with Russian ICBMs. A very small number of Russia’s major leadership command posts are deeply buried, to protect them from direct destruction by nuclear attack. The US military would likely reserve the highest-yield warheads for those targets. Figure 7 below shows an example of a structure that is roughly the size of the US Capitol building that is postulated to have rooms and tunnels as deep as 800 feet or more. Shelters that have rooms and tunnels at even greater depths could be sealed by using multiple nuclear warheads to crater every location where an entrance or exit might conceivably have been built.

FIGURE 7.

The situation with regard to the retaliatory potential of Russia’s ballistic missile submarines is problematic from the point of view of a conservative Russian planner. Although Russia currently has 11 ballistic missile submarines, currently two or three of these missile-carrying submarines are in overhaul and do not carry nuclear warheads. If the full force of available operating submarines not in overhaul could be deployed to sea, Russia could deliver roughly 592 of the full 768 warheads theoretically deployed in its submarine force. At some as yet unforeseen time in the future, Russia might be able to deploy 600 to 700 submarine-based warheads to sea, but a realistic number given the limited availability of crews and equipment might instead be 400 to 500 warheads.

By 2030 to 2040, the United States could easily have built enough Aegis ships to carry 500 to 700 of the newly introduced SM-3 Block IIA interceptor. These new interceptors have a 50 percent higher burnout speed than the older SM-3 Block IA interceptors, giving the Block IIA a greater engagement range and theoretically making it possible to provide missile defense for the continental United States via Aegis ships stationed off the country’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

For all practical purposes, the intercept capability of the SM-3 Block IIA is negligible. Both the infrared homing sensors on these interceptors and the US early warning tracking radars that cue the interceptors to their targets have no practical ability to distinguish between warheads, pieces of rocket upper stages, and decoys. But the appearance created by the vast expansion of this missile defense program can and will contribute to perceptions among Russians that the United States is seeking nuclear dominance.

The Russians have most recently reacted to this ongoing program by publicly displaying and implementing a new and novel sea-based nuclear weapons delivery device as a hedge against US missile defenses.

In particular, Russia is now in the process of testing a 40-ton nuclear-powered underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) that could robotically deliver, across thousands of kilometers, a 100-megaton nuclear warhead against the coastal cities and ports of the United States. The technical details of this bizarre system were released by Putin himself in September 2015—apparently intentionally—and testing began in December 2016. Such actions by the Russian government clearly indicate a grave concern about the unpredictable character of ongoing US missile defense programs.

In addition to upgrading the hard-target kill capability of the W76 warhead, the US military also appears to be working to increase the targeting capability of the warheads on the land-based Minuteman III ICBM force. The Minuteman III is much less accurate than Trident II, with a CEP of about 160 meters, compared to the roughly 100-meter CEP now achieved by Trident II. These differences mean that the probability of kill could be two to two-and-a-half times higher for the same weapon carried by a Trident II with a 100-meter CEP versus a Minuteman III with a 160-meter CEP. Without a major guidance upgrade, Minuteman III could not be expected to achieve nearly the nuclear warfighting capacity of the Trident II.

The Air Force is working on an upgrade to the AF&F used on the Mk21 reentry vehicle containing the W87 warhead. The W87/Mk21 warhead arms about half of the ICBM force, with the other half carrying the W78/Mk12A.

Our analysis shows that fitting Minuteman III warheads with super-fuzes will give the Minuteman III essentially the same hard target kill capability as the MX had with its cutting-edge Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere (AIRS) guidance system; the MX was retired in 2005. The first production unit Mk21 fuze is planned for early 2020s with production expected to continue through 2029. The Air Force is planning to use the W87/Mk21 on a new ICBM planned for deployment in 2030.

Shortfalls in Russia’s early warning system. In January 1995, a lone sounding rocket was launched from an isolated Island off the Northwest Coast of Norway. Even though the rocket was heading toward the North Pole, not at Russia, we now know that as it rose over the horizon of the curved Earth, it was tracked by the Russian early warning radar on the Kola Peninsula at Olenegorsk. Because it was on a near-vertical trajectory, the automated tracking algorithms utilized by the radar interpreted the characteristics of the trajectory as matching a Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile on a mission to detonate a nuclear weapon in front of the radar’s field of view, making the radar incapable of detecting nuclear warheads coming from longer range.

That the Russian early warning system reacted to this innocuous launch unambiguously indicates that the Russian warning system has at least some measures within it to alert Russian forces to events that could indicate an evolving US nuclear preemptive attack.

If the United States were to execute such an attack against Russia, Russia would certainly know that the most dangerous and most quickly arriving nuclear warheads would come from US submarine-launched ballistic missiles on station in the North Atlantic. Given the extremely high lethality of essentially all US submarine-based warheads, a well-coordinated US attack would not need to employ US land-based Minuteman ICBMs if its initial aim was to simply destroy Russia’s silo-based ICBMs before they could be launched.

Such a “warfighting attack” would likely begin with the detonation of a nuclear warhead in front of key early-warning radars. An explosion of a 455 kiloton Trident II warhead at an altitude of 1,300 to 1,400 kilometers would create an area of radar “blackout” that would prevent all Russian radars looking toward the United States and into the northern parts of the North Atlantic from observing US ballistic missiles as they rose over the radar horizon.

US missile launches from the North Atlantic would be coordinated to rise over the radar horizon only after the Russian radars had been blinded. Even if the radars were not rendered ineffective, the Russians could reasonably expect to have no more than seven to 10 minutes of warning before Moscow was destroyed. (See the table showing decision-making timelines below.)

The false alert of 1995 would not have occurred if Russia had a reliable and working global space-based satellite early warning system. Russian analysts would have been able to observe that there were no US ballistic missile launches from the North Atlantic. The availability of such a system would have caused the initial alert to be called off within minutes or even more quickly.

Detailed analyses, initially stimulated by questions about why the alert went on for so long, showed that a specialized space-based Russian early warning system called Prognoz was then under development. Analysis of the Prognoz satellite constellation and of available Russian infrared sensor technologies indicated that even if the satellite system had been working, it would not have been able to provide surveillance of the North Atlantic. Today, Russia has stopped launching satellites into this constellation and has instead focused enormous resources exclusively into building a highly robust and redundant network of ground-based radars. It is now very clear that Russia’s extreme de-emphasis on satellite early warning systems and its extreme focus on building numerous, technologically varied ground-based radar warning systems is due to the lack of critical technologies needed to implement a space-based ballistic missile warning system.

Facing the existential threat of a short-warning attack with accurate and powerful sea-launched, nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and no ability to quickly detect their launch with space-based early warning systems, Russian leadership would seem to have little choice but to pre-delegate nuclear launch authority to lower levels of command. Many possible ways of pre-delegating authority are possible, but none of them are free of dangers that could increase the chances of accidents that could ultimately result in the mistaken launch of Russian nuclear forces. Forcing this situation upon the Russian government seems likely to be detrimental to the security interests of the United States and its Western allies.

Our conclusions. Under the veil of an otherwise-legitimate warhead life-extension program, the US military has quietly engaged in a vast expansion of the killing power of the most numerous warhead in the US nuclear arsenal: the W76, deployed on the Navy’s ballistic missile submarines. This improvement in kill power means that all US sea-based warheads now have the capability to destroy hardened targets such as Russian missile silos, a capability previously reserved for only the highest-yield warheads in the US arsenal.

The capability upgrade has happened outside the attention of most government officials, who have been preoccupied with reducing nuclear warhead numbers. The result is a nuclear arsenal that is being transformed into a force that has the unambiguous characteristics of being optimized for surprise attacks against Russia and for fighting and winning nuclear wars. While the lethality and firepower of the US force has been greatly increased, the numbers of weapons in both US and Russian forces have decreased, resulting in a dramatic increase in the vulnerability of Russian nuclear forces to a US first strike. We estimate that the results of arms reductions with the increase in US nuclear capacity means that the US military can now destroy all of Russia’s ICBM silos using only about 20 percent of the warheads deployed on US land- and sea-based ballistic missiles.

Eventually, super-fuze upgrades will make it possible for every SLBM and ICBM warhead in the US arsenal to perform the hard-target kill missions that were initially envisioned to be exclusively reserved to MX Peacekeeper ICBM warheads.

The W76 upgrade reflects a 25-year shift of the focus of US hard-target kill capability from land-based to sea-based ballistic missiles. Moreover, by shifting the capability to submarines that can move to missile launch positions much closer to their targets than land-based missiles, the US military has achieved a significantly greater capacity to conduct a surprise first strike against Russian ICBM silos.

The decision by the Obama administration in 2009 to deploy the Aegis ship-based European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) missile defense system has created a program under which the United States could eventually have between 500 to 700 anti-missile interceptors that could in theory be used to defend the continental United States from ships off the country’s coasts. In spite of its severe limitations, this growing defense system could appear to both Russia and China as a US attempt to reduce the consequences of a ragged Russian or Chinese retaliation to a US first strike against them.

We cannot foresee a situation in which a competent and properly informed US president would order a surprise first strike against Russia or China. But our conclusion makes the increased sea-based offensive and defensive capabilities we have described seem all the more bizarre as a strategy for reducing the chances of nuclear war with either Russia or China.

That Russian silos are more vulnerable to W76-1/Mk4A warheads will not come as an earth-shattering revelation to Russian military officials; they would have to expect that the silos would be destroyed anyway, by US land-based ICBMs. But the growing capability of the US forward-deployed sea-based nuclear missiles could raise serious questions in the minds of Russian military planners and political leadership about US intentions—especially when seen in context of growing US cyber, advanced conventional, and missile defense capabilities—almost certainly deepening mistrust and encouraging worst-case planning assumptions in Moscow.

We end this article with quotes from Vladimir Putin, talking impromptu to a group of journalists during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June 2016. His unrehearsed remarks are clear and candid predictors of how he will assess the implications of the super-fuze:

No matter what we said to our American partners [to curb the production of weaponry], they refused to cooperate with us, they rejected our offers, and continue to do their own thing.

… They rejected everything we had to offer.

… the Iranian threat does not exist, but missile defense systems are continuing to be positioned…

That means we were right when we said that they are lying to us.

Their reasons were not genuine, in reference to the “Iranian nuclear threat.”

Your people [the populations of the Western alliance] … do not feel a sense of the impending danger—this is what worries me.

A missile defense system is one element of the whole system of offensive military potential.

It works as part of a whole that includes offensive missile launchers.

One complex blocks, the other launches high precision weapons, the third blocks a potential nuclear strike, and the fourth sends out its own nuclear weapon in response.

This is all designed to be part of one system.

I don’t know how this is all going to end.

What I do know is that we will need to defend ourselves."

"Tesla factory workers intensify unionization efforts, alleging illegal surveillance, coercion, intimidation and prevention of worker communications by Tesla in an effort to prevent or otherwise hinder unionization of the Fremont factory.",https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-factory-workers-file-charges-labor-board/,"For Tesla to become and remain one of the great companies of the 21st century, we must have an environment that is as safe, fair and fun as possible. It is incredibly important to me that you look forward to coming to work every day. For that, we must be a fair and just company – the only kind worth creating.

This is vital to succeed in our mission to accelerate the advent of a clean, sustainable energy future. The forces arrayed against us are many and incredibly powerful. This is David vs Goliath if David were six inches tall! Only by being smarter, faster and working well as a tightly integrated team do we have any chance of success. We should never forget the history of car startups originating in the United States: dozens have gone bankrupt and only two, Tesla and Ford, have not. Despite the odds being strongly against us, my faith in you is why I am confident that we will succeed.

That is why I was so distraught when I read the recent blog post promoting the UAW, which does not share our mission and whose true allegiance is to the giant car companies, where the money they take from employees in dues is vastly more than they could ever make from Tesla.

The tactics they have resorted to are disingenuous or outright false. I will address their underhanded attacks below. While this discussion focuses on Fremont, these same principles apply to every Tesla facility worldwide.

Safety First

The workplace issue that comes before any other is safety. If you do not have your health, then nothing else matters. Simply due to size and bad luck, there will always be some injuries in a company with over 30,000 employees, but our goal is simple: to have as close to zero injuries as possible and be the safest factory in the auto industry by far. The Tesla executive team and I are absolutely committed to this goal.

That is why I was particularly troubled by the safety claim in last week’s blog post, which said: “A few months ago, six out of eight people in my work team were out on medical leave at the same time due to various work-related injuries. I hear the ergonomics are even more severe in other areas of the factory.”

Obviously, this cannot be true: if three quarters of his team suddenly went on medical leave, we would not be able to operate that part of the factory. Furthermore, if things were really even worse in other departments, that would mean something like 80% or more of the factory would be out on injury, production would drop to virtually nothing and the parking lot would be almost empty. As you know firsthand, we have the *opposite* problem – there is never enough room to park! In fact, we are working at top speed to build more parking. Also, hopefully our darn BART train station will open before all hell freezes over!

After looking into this claim, not only was it untrue for this individual’s team, it was untrue for any of the hundreds of teams in the factory.

That said, reducing excess overtime and improving safety are extremely important. This is why we hired thousands of additional team members to create a third shift, which has reduced the burden on everyone. Moreover, since the beginning of Tesla production at Fremont five years ago, there have been dedicated health and safety experts covering the factory and we hold regular safety meetings with operations leaders. Since the majority of the injuries in the factory are ergonomic in nature, we have an ergonomics department focused exclusively on this issue.

The net result is that since January 1st, our total recordable incident rate (TRIR) is under 3.3, which is less than half the industry average of 6.7.

Of course, the goal is to have as close to zero injuries as humanly possible, so we need to keep improving. If you have a safety concern or an idea on how to make things better, please let your manager, safety representative or HR partner know. You can also send an anonymous note through the Integrity Hotline (this applies broadly to any problems you notice at our company) or you can email [email protected]

Compensation

At Tesla, we believe it is important for everyone to be an owner of the company. This is your company. That is why, unlike other car companies, everyone is awarded shares and you get to buy stock at a discount compared to the public through the employee stock purchase program. Last year, stock equity grants were increased significantly and it will happen again later this year once Model 3 achieves high volume.

The chart below contrasts the total comp received by a Tesla production team member who started on January 1, 2013 against the total comp received over the same period at GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler. A four year period is used because that’s the vesting length of a new hire equity grant. I believe the equity gain over the next four years will be similar. As shown below, a Tesla team member earned between $70,000 and $100,000 more in total compensation than the employees at other US auto companies!

Work Hours

Another issue raised in the UAW blog was hours worked. First, I want to recognize how hard you worked to make our company successful. Those hours mattered to you, to your family and to our company, and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate them.

However, the pace needs to be sustainable. This is why the third shift was established and why we created alternate work schedules based on feedback from various teams in the factory.

These changes have had a big impact. The average amount of hours worked by production team members this year is about 43 hours per week. The percentage of overtime hours has declined by almost 50% since the super tough time we had last year achieving rate on the Model X, which is probably the hardest car to build in history. What an amazing accomplishment! It is also a lesson learned, which is why Model 3 is designed to be dramatically easier to manufacture.

Fun

As we get closer to being a profitable company, we will be able to afford more and more fun things. For example, as I mentioned at the last company talk, we are going to hold a really amazing party once Model 3 reaches volume production later this year. There will also be little things that come along like free frozen yogurt stands scattered around the factory and my personal favorite: a Tesla electric pod car roller coaster (with an optional loop the loop route, of course!) that will allow fast and fun travel throughout our Fremont campus, dipping in and out of the factory and connecting all the parking lots. It’s going to get crazy good ?

Thanks again for all your effort and I look forward to working alongside you to create an amazing future!

"US Preps Arrest Warrant for Assange, thereby threatening press freedom for all",https://www.democracynow.org/2017/4/21/glenn_greenwald_trumps_doj_prosecuting_wikileaks,None
Trump signs exec order signaling foreign H-1B visa techie crackdown,http://theregister.co.uk/2017/04/18/trump_shakes_up_h1b_visa_progam/,"Updated President Trump today signed an executive order that may lead to an overhaul of the H-1B visa system used by US technology giants to draft in cheap foreigner workers.

The exact text of the order has yet to be published on the White House website. So far, all we have are comments from administration officials and the commander in chief himself – and so far, we're told the order calls for investigations into changes to government rules on issuing visas.

“This does nothing,” thundered Charles Schumer (D-NY), the Senate minority leader. “Like all the other executive orders, it’s just words — he’s calling for new studies. It’s not going to fix the problem. It’s not going to create a single job.”

While visiting a factory in Wisconsin a few hours ago, Trump signed the order, and slammed abusers of the visa system, accusing them of cheating Americans out of jobs. He also had a pop at Canadian dairy farmers (Wisconsin is a big dairy state), threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and promised to take ""a sledgehammer"" to regulations – as well as criticizing NATO for not allegedly ""paying its bills.""

""We are going to take bold new steps on our pledge to buy American and hire American,"" he said. ""We don't have a level playing field for our workers, but you're going to have one very soon. We're going to make sure more products are stamped with those wonderful words 'Made in the USA'.""

(Many of Donald's products are not made in the USA.)

Trump complained that today's H-1B visa system is a mess, with visas being awarded at random in a lottery. He pledged that from now on they will only be granted to the most skilled and highly paid workers, and won't be used to oust American citizens from their jobs so they can be replaced with cheap and less-able foreign labor.

If those promises come through, it's going to be bad news for consultancy giants like Tata, Infosys, and Cognizant, which were named by senior administration officials as top targets for today's order. These organizations are massive users of the H-1B system: they grab bundles of visas and jet in cheap techies to bang out projects for clients. They'll now find it a lot tougher to bring in the kind of entry-level IT staff they've been snatching visas for.

Which is no bad thing, since the abuse of the H-1B visa program by some companies has been rampant. IT staff are brought in, typically from India, paid lower wages than other staff, and ""encouraged"" to work long hours because they know that if they displease their masters and their company withdraws their visa, they will have to leave the country quickly.

Silicon Valley loves the H-1B visa system because it helps depress wages and allows rich corps to bring in obedient talent from overseas. But the vast majority of visa holders are no more skilled than US workers and are being hired solely because they will work harder for less.

America's immigration officials issue 85,000 H-1B visas a year – and those numbers aren't going to change. The executive order, however, could end up raising the costs of applying for a visa as well as the barrier for entry.

Interestingly, the reforms are not targeting the H-2B visa program, which allows US organizations, including Trump's swanky bolthole at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, to bring in overseas workers for menial jobs to meet seasonal demands.

The other part of Trump's executive order will force federal agencies to buy from American companies when spending tax dollars. Existing rules for federal contractors on buying American have been weakly enforced, Trump said, and that was going to change.

""With this action we are sending a powerful message to the rest of the world,"" he said. ""This historic action declares we will aggressively promote and use American-made goods and ensure American labor is hired to do the job. It's time."" ®

"Kazakhstan, Reversing Itself, Embraces 'Borat' as Very Nice",http://nytimes.com/2020/10/26/business/kazakhstan-embraces-borat.html,"In 2005, Dennis Keen, a high school junior in Los Angeles, was applying for a summer exchange program. After not much deliberation, he decided it would be punky and funny to forgo France and Spain and go to Kazakhstan. “People didn’t know where it was,” Mr. Keen said. “In Kazakhstan, there’s pre-Borat and post-Borat.”

He was referring, of course, to “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,” the Sacha Baron Cohen comedy that hit theaters a year later, in 2006. In the movie, Mr. Cohen pretends to be a television reporter visiting America from the former Soviet republic, whose people supposedly drink horse urine, consider women property and celebrate an anti-Semitic version of the running of the bulls. (The bulls are replaced by Jews.) The authoritarian Kazakh government banned the film, threatened to sue Mr. Cohen and took out a four-page advertisement in this newspaper defending the country’s honor.

And so when Mr. Cohen released a trailer on Sept. 29 for a “Borat” sequel, which he developed in secret and which debuted on Friday on Amazon, the satirist was prepared for another fight with the Kazakh government.

It never came. “It was like, ‘Oh, again?’” said Kairat Sadvakassov, the deputy chairman of Kazakhstan’s tourism board, who has a master’s degree in tourism management from New York University. The board was determined to avoid overreacting and letting Mr. Cohen make it look foolish once again. “The decision was made to let it die its natural death and not respond,” Mr. Sadvakassov said."

"Blind, Deaf Pup Named Piglet, Beloved for Teaching Acceptance, Is Coming Out with His Own Book",http://people.com/pets/blind-deaf-pink-dog-piglet-releasing-book/,"Piglet is starting a new chapter of his life, literally.

The blind, deaf, and pink pooch, known to many as a canine teacher that helps kids celebrate their differences, is about to have his own book. PIGLET: The Unexpected Story of a Deaf, Blind, Pink Puppy and His Family (from Simon & Schuster/Atria Books). is due to hit shelves on August 3, 2021, but PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the cover of the book right now.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

The cover features a stunning shot of Piglet himself donning a blue shirt and a serious look. While Piglet may be alone on the cover, the dog isn't taking on this big step solo, his upcoming book is a family affair. Melissa Shapiro, a Connecticut veterinarian and Piglet's owner, is writing the story of Piglet's life, a fitting choice since she has such a big part in it.

When Piglet was just a puppy, Shapiro got a call from his rescuers at Colbert Veterinary Rescue Services asking if she would foster the blind, deaf dog, who wasn't even two pounds when he first met Shapiro. The vet quickly accepted the offer to take Piglet, and just as fast the little dog changed her life. Upon his arrival at Shapiro's home, which she shared with her husband, three college-aged kids, and 6 rescue dogs at the time, Piglet was one of the most anxious and traumatized dogs the vet ever met.

""He screamed his way through the first few weeks of our 'foster project'. We held him, taught him tap signals, and reassured him with a comfortable, reliable routine. In turn, Piglet connected with his human and dog family, gained confidence, and started to settle down,"" Shapiro told PEOPLE about her first few weeks with the pup, who was rescued from an animal hoarding situation.

Through patient, consistent, and compassionate work, and with plenty of help from her family and other dogs, Shapiro was able to help Piglet emerge from his shell and gain confidence and strength. This partnership also formed a bond between the pair that is so strong, they don't need visual or sound cues to communicate.

Thanks to this love and support from Shapiro and her family, Piglet grew into a vibrant and caring 6-pound pet, and by the time Piglet was ready to be adopted, Shapiro knew she was willing to rearrange her life to make Piglet a part of it forever.

""It became very clear that he was already home,"" she added.

Over three years later, Piglet is still ""profoundly disabled,"" which requires Shapiro to center her life ""around his need to be cuddled, his basic day to day routine, and his active social calendar."" But she is more than happy to put in the work since Piglet shows up and does the same every day too. All of the details of this amazing story of survival and sweet success are shared in PIGLET: The Unexpected Story of a Deaf, Blind, Pink Puppy and His Family, which also covers the canine's rise to social media fame after Shapiro started posting peeks at Piglet's positive world view on Facebook. Now, Piglet has thousands of followers on Facebook and Instagram, who learn about all kinds of important animal causes from the pooch's pages.

""I made a promise to myself, that I would make sure Piglet would have a meaningful, productive life. Since Piglet’s Facebook following was already growing into the thousands, I saw his popularity as an opportunity to raise awareness and funding for special needs dog rescue groups,"" Shapiro said.

And this public platform opened up even more opportunities to do good. In 2017, a Facebook comment from a 3rd-grade teacher on Piglet's page inspired Shapiro to create the Piglet Mindset Educational Outreach Program, which provides teaching resources that help kids learn how to accept and work through life challenges with a positive attitude, just like Piglet!

Only three-and-a-half years old, Piglet is just getting started on his quest to make the world a better place with Shapiro's help. Along with PIGLET: The Unexpected Story of a Deaf, Blind, Pink Puppy and His Family, which is available from pre-order, Shapiro and her pup are working on another book, Piglet Comes Home, which is Shapiro’s picture book for children that comes out in Fall 2021 from Simon & Schuster Children’s Publishing/Aladdin Books."

Joe Biden's polling better than any challenger since 1936,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/11/politics/biden-best-position-challenger/index.html,"(CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden is dominating President Donald Trump in the latest polls. No, the election is not over yet, and Trump still has a non-negligible chance of winning.

But a look through history reveals that Biden is in a better position at this point than any challenger since 1936, when the first scientific polls were taken in a presidential race.

The ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday was the latest poll to indicate Biden's strength. Biden led Trump by a 55% to 43% margin among likely voters. The poll was the third high quality national poll published this week that had Biden up by at least 10 points and above 50%. The other two being from CNN/SSRS and Fox News

Indeed, the average of polls has Biden at around 52% or 53% and up by somewhere between 10 and 11 points. This is an unprecedented position for a challenger with a mere 23 days to go until Election Day.

In the 21 previous presidential elections since 1936, there have only been five challengers who led at this time. Of those five, only one (Bill Clinton in 1992) was ahead by more than 5 points. None of those five were earning more than 48% of the vote in the polls.

In other words, Biden is the first challenger to be above 50% at this late juncture in the campaign.

This also continues to mark a massive difference with the 2016 campaign. While Hillary Clinton was ahead of Trump by as high as 7 points in October 2016 , she never came anywhere close to approaching 50% of the vote. Trump merely had to win the lionshare of the undecided or third party voters (who would bolt their candidate) to earn a victory in 2016.

Even if every undecided or current third party voter went to Trump now, he'd still be down about 5 to 6 points nationally. That's never been the case with an incumbent since 1936 at this point.

Of course, it's the Electoral College that matters. There are very few universes in which Trump could win the Electoral College, if he were to lose nationally by 5 to 6 points.

New polls out on Sunday from CBS News/YouGov demonstrate that Biden's above 50% in some key battlegrounds. He leads 52% to 46% in Michigan and Nevada. In Iowa, a state that Trump took by 9 points in 2016 and is not anywhere close to must win for Biden, the race is tied at 49%.

A look under the hood reveals why Biden is in such a strong position. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, Covid-19 has either been, or been within the margin of error of being the nation's most important problem in Gallup polling

The three challengers in the polling era (Jimmy Carter in 1976, Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Bill Clinton in 1992) who defeated incumbents have all been trusted more than the incumbent to deal with what Americans thought was the nation's most important problem. None, however, were trusted by more than 50% of the voters.

Today, Biden has a huge advantage over Trump when it comes to the pandemic. The clear majority (59%) of likely voters in the last CNN poll said Biden would better be able to handle the outbreak. Just 38% said Trump would do a better job than Biden.

As I noted in July , the only issue that really matters is Trump's handling of the coronavirus. He's failing in the minds of voters right now.

The result of which is a majority of those same voters favor Biden to be the next president of the United States."
"This gorgeous songbird is half male, half female",http://nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/10/rose-breasted-grosbeak-half-male-half-female/,"Researchers with a team monitoring bird populations at Powdermill Nature Reserve, in Rector, Pennsylvania, netted a surprise on September 24: a rose-breasted grosbeak with bizarre coloring. It had the bright scarlet feathers of a male grosbeak on one side of its body and the canary yellow plumage of a female on the other.

When they saw the robin-size songbird’s split coloring, it was immediately clear that the grosbeak was what scientists call a bilateral gynandromorph—an animal that appears half male and half female.

“There was no question about it,” says Annie Lindsay, bird banding program manager at Powdermill.

Measurements also revealed that the bird’s right wing was slightly longer than the left, typical of the difference between male and female grosbeaks.

While gynandromorphy simply means that an animal has both female and male characteristics, bilateral gynandromorphs often appear more dramatically different because those characteristics are separated down the middle of their body; the separation may be internal as well as external. And bilateral gynandromorphy is different from hermaphrodism, in which an organism has both male and female reproductive organs but may appear on the outside to be either male or female.

View Images The bird’s right wing is longer and has dark feathers, characteristic of male rose-breasted grosbeaks. Its left wing is smaller and brown, characteristic of females. Its tail feathers are also split in color. Photograph by Annie Lindsay

In fact, since Powdermill began keeping records nearly six decades ago, Lindsay says, only five of roughly 800,000 captured birds have been documented as likely gynandromorphs. The only other bird with bilateral gynandromorphy Lindsay says she’s seen during the past 15 years was also a rose-breasted grosbeak.

“I think this time around I have more knowledge about just how rare this is,” she says. “Just watching everyone else react—it was like pure joy.”

One in a million?

“That bird is quite famous,” says Danny Bystrak, a wildlife biologist at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center’s Bird Banding Laboratory, in Maryland, a branch of the U.S. Geological Survey that serves as the central clearinghouse for data from bird banding operations across the country.

Looking back at all the records for the past 15 years, the odds of discovering a gynandromorph in a bird-banding operation seem to be “almost exactly one in a million,” Bystrak said in an email.

But there’s a caveat to those long odds. Not all bird species have males and females with noticeably different plumage, Lindsay says. More gynandromorphs likely are flying around out there than we realize.

Bird collections in museums also shed light on the phenomenon. Over his career, Stephen Rogers, collection manager for the Section of Birds at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has prepared some 16,000 birds for the museum’s collections. That entails drying and preserving the birds and taking notes on each specimen’s physical appearance, outside and inside, including its reproductive organs.

Among the museum’s more than 27,000 specimens, Rogers found records for only four gynandromorphs—three of them birds of species that have no color differences between males and females.

“The one-in-a-million figure would only be for birds that show distinct differences,” Rogers says. “Cardinals, grosbeaks, and the like.”

If you add in all the gynandromorphs that are hiding in plain sight, the odds go up to around 146 in a million.

Gynandromorph mysteries

Gynandromorphs make headlines when they’re discovered, such as a bilateral gynandromorphic cardinal from 2019 and the honeybee with the eyes of a male and the body of a female found earlier this year, but the phenomenon is difficult to study.

Bystrak says he can find no record of a gynandromorph ever being re-captured by a banding operation, so it’s unclear, for example, if the color differences persist after the birds molt.

There’s also the question as to what sort of future the grosbeak might have. Female birds, like humans, have two ovaries, but only the left one is functional in songbirds. Since the grosbeak’s left side seems to be female, Lindsay says it’s possible that the bird could reproduce—though it would also have to behave like a female to attract a mate.

Not much is known about the behavior of gynandromorphs, but in 2009 and 2010, scientists were able to observe a northern cardinal in Illinois with bilateral gynandromorphy and noted that it seemed to survive into adulthood without difficulties. Yet the cardinal never seemed to perform any songs or vocalizations, nor was it seen with a mate."
"Contrary to popular belief, letting your mind wander on the job does not necessarily hurt your work. When people feel a strong personal identification with their profession, daydreaming can actually boost creative problem-solving.",http://journals.aom.org/doi/full/10.5465/amj.2017.1283.summary,"Contrary to popular belief, letting your mind wander on the job does not necessarily hurt your work. When people feel a strong personal identification with their profession, daydreaming can actually boost creative problem-solving, according to an Academy of Management Journal article.

“The assumption in almost all jobs is, ‘You better pay attention at all times’—which, number one, is impossible and, secondly, has led to a lot of research that assumes daydreaming is counterproductive,” said Markus Baer of Washington University in St. Louis.

People spend nearly half of each day mind wandering, Baer explained. But we tend to think of that as a bad thing, equating reveries with laziness and an inability to complete our tasks at hand.

But the flipside is just as true.

In “Zoning out or Breaking Through? Linking Daydreaming to Creativity in the Workplace,” Baer and coauthors Erik Dane, also of Washington University in St. Louis, and Héctor P. Madrid of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile found that workers were more prone to daydreams when they had been working hard on tasks that demanded high levels of focus. “In short, cognitively demanding work has the quality of a stimulant—it serves to spark daydreams around the very tasks and problems it involves,” they wrote.

Mind wandering is different from recognized efficiency killers, such as distraction and multitasking. In the latter two, people seek to engage in their surroundings, but have trouble focusing because of competing stimuli or priorities. Mind wandering is different because it involves disengaging from people’s physical surroundings.

Additionally, daydreaming is only one way in which the mind may wander during demanding activities. Baer outlined three major ways in which the mind tends to wander:

Mental time travel. This involves the resurfacing of details of past events or imagining future events, such as an upcoming vacation.

Updating goal hierarchies. This kind of mind wandering focuses on specific tasks people want to accomplish. For example, an employee might be reading an article that triggers a mind wandering episode, reminding the person to complete a presentation before heading home. At work, this type of mind wandering may help boost performance by nudging workers to complete tasks, but it was not evaluated in this study.

Daydreaming. This is the most imaginative form of mind wandering and was the focus of this study. Some daydreams can be classified as problem-oriented daydreams, or imaginative thoughts related to problems a person faces in day-to-day life, or as bizarre daydreams that “might delight a writer of fantasy or science fiction,” the authors wrote.

One famous example of the interplay of daydreams and problem-solving is Albert Einstein’s development of the theory of relativity. Einstein was taking a break from focused calculation when his wandering mind created an image of a moving train. He used that image to ponder the relationship between distance and time, ultimately ushering in a new era of physics.

""Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."" ""We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them."" —Albert Einstein

“If you're stuck on a problem and your mind starts to wander, no need to feel guilty and to re-engage the problem. Some daydreams might just help you crack the problem,” Baer said.

“I don't want to say to you that every daydream brings a solution,” he said. “On average, those daydreams may have something in them that might be useful. We should give a little bit more credit to the mind and the daydreams that we have. That's really the point of our article.”

To better understand the relationship between daydreams, creativity, and job performance, the authors conducted two studies among employees and managers in South America:

In the first study, they gathered daily questionnaires from 169 professionals who recorded time spent on cognitively demanding work and daydreaming. Participants were also asked to indicate how creative and productive they felt each day.

The second study surveyed 117 lower-level employees and 46 of their supervisors at three technology consulting companies. The surveys measured the cognitive demands on employees, the frequency and attributes of their daydreams, and their level of identification with their profession. Supervisors rated employees on aspects of their creativity and performance.

The researchers found that daydreaming was more common when cognitive demands at work were high, and that it can boost creative problem-solving “when professional identification was high,” they wrote. This was true for problem-oriented daydreams, or imaginative thoughts related to problems a person faces in daily life (such as Einstein’s reverie about the train) and for bizarre daydreams, though not as strongly for the latter.

And despite time spent daydreaming, there was no drop in efficiency or productivity among the employees.

But this was not true for all workers. For individuals whose identities were less tied to their profession and its associated problems and challenges, daydreaming had no effect on work-related creativity—and it was related to poorer overall performance.

What accounts for the difference between these groups? People who are personally invested in their work “are more likely to consider their daydreams as valuable inputs,” Baer said. “They're more likely to be open to them, and are probably more likely to do something with them. Even if something is a bit bizarre, they may not dismiss it. They think about the relationship between the daydreams and what they have to do.”

“Think about the opportunity cost,” Baer explained. “Imagine you’re trying to push through a problem, and you keep coming up to the same barrier. The mind may decide, ‘I could stay here, or I could do something more productive. Yeah, let me take a detour, because obviously what this person is doing is not working.’ And then you start to think about other possibilities. You start drawing up images and you’re playful. You think about what those images may mean. And in the end, it may lead to an idea.”

For less invested workers, however, mind wandering may simply be a way to take a break.

If employers want to harvest the value of daydreams, they would do well to create a culture that tolerates daydreaming, at least among its employees who are professionally identified, Baer said. High levels of professional identification are more likely “where people have a sufficient amount of freedom, they don't have to adhere to rigid ways of executing work, and they have work that is a bit more challenging and has more meaning to them. All of these are engagement factors that can have positive returns in the form of the creative solutions daydreams produce.”"
"Neil Gaiman & Stephen King come out swinging with forceful pushback to J.K. Rowling's transphobia ""Your pronouns matter. You matter. You are loved.""",http://lgbtqnation.com/2020/10/neil-gaiman-stephen-king-come-swinging-forceful-pushback-j-k-rowlings-transphobia/,"Authors Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Margaret Atwood have joined with other American and Canadian writers and editors to support transgender and non-binary people in the face of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling’s continual attacks on the community.

“We are writers, editors, journalists, agents, and professionals in multiple forms of publishing,” the wrote in a statement. “We believe in the power of words. We want to do our part to help shape the curve of history toward justice and fairness.”

“To that end,” the statement continues, “we say: non-binary people are non-binary, trans women are women, trans men are men, trans rights are human rights.”

“Your pronouns matter. You matter. You are loved.”

Hundreds of literary professionals have signed on to the open letter, penned shortly after a similar statement by British and Irish authors.

Over 50 British media figures signed an open letter defending Rowling in the face of criticism over her war on transgender people, spurring the response.

Neither of the pro-transgender letters mentions Rowling by name.

While Rowling has been tweeting about transgender people for months, she faced increased criticism last month when her new crime novel Troubled Blood was published. The book is about two detectives who investigate a cisgender man who wears women’s clothes to get close to women and kill them.

A week later, Rowling was promoting an online store that sells transphobic buttons, mugs, and other merchandise to her 14 million Twitter followers."
Looks promising!,http://pcmag.com/news/native-american-tribe-gets-early-access-to-spacexs-starlink-and-says-its,"(Credit: Washington State Department of Commerce)

SpaceX’s upcoming satellite internet service can indeed supply fast internet to remote areas, according to a Native American tribe in Washington state.

On Wednesday, the Hoh tribe tweeted that SpaceX’s Starlink network has been supplying fast broadband to local residents in the area. “Our children can participate in remote learning, residents can access healthcare,” the tribe said. “SpaceX Starlink made it happen overnight.”

The tribe is based on the state’s coast, about a three to four hour drive west of Seattle. Residents typically only get internet speeds at an astonishing slow 0.3 to 0.7Mbps, the tribe said in a follow-up tweet.

The Washington State Department of Commerce also published a video documenting how Starlink has boosted the tribe’s internet speeds.

“The last eight years I feel like we have been paddling up river with a spoon, and almost getting nowhere with getting internet to the reservation,” Melvinjohn Ashue, vice chairman of the Hoh Tribe, said in the video.

Knowing the problems, the department introduced SpaceX’s Starlink team to the tribe, which prompted the company to provide early access to the satellite network. “It seemed like out of nowhere SpaceX just came up and catapulted us into the 21st century,"" Ashue said of the speed increase.

The tribe hasn’t said how fast the Starlink internet speeds have been for the reservation. But SpaceX says the satellite network is currently capable of delivering 100Mbps download speeds at a latency below 30 milliseconds, which is on par with ground-based internet.

For now, Starlink remains unavailable to the public. But on Monday, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said the company plans to kick off beta trials soon for residents based in the northern US and possibly southern Canada. You can currently sign up for email updates from SpaceX to learn about beta availability.

Starlink currently operates over 700 satellites in low orbit around the planet, largely across the higher latitudes. But the company’s goal is to launch thousands of satellites, enabling Starlink to offer 1Gbps internet speeds to most places across the planet.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis told a group of children with autism and spectrum disorders Monday that they are beautiful, unique flowers in the eyes of God.

Francis met with members of an Austrian center for autism, Sonnenschein (“Sunshine”), in an audience at the Vatican. He told them that the center’s name evoked a flower-filled lawn in the sun “and the flowers of this house are you!”

Speaking to the children, their parents and caregivers from the center, Francis said: “God created the world with a great variety of flowers of all different colors. Each flower has its unique beauty. And each one of us is beautiful in the eyes of God, who loves us.”

Francis has a particular soft spot for children, allowing himself even amid coronavirus social distancing protocols to greet and pat them on the head during his public audiences.

He has frequently met with groups of children and parents who are experiencing difficulties in caring for them, hoping to encourage them through sickness, disability, poverty and other challenges."

Ewan beats Bennett in thrilling sprint in Poitiers. Lotto Soudal's Caleb Ewan snatches victory on stage 11 of the Tour de France as the sprinters go toe to toe in a thrilling finish.,https://bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/54093786,"Last updated on .From the section Cycling

The victory is Caleb Ewan's second stage win of this year's Tour

Lotto Soudal's Australian rider Caleb Ewan snatched victory on stage 11 of the Tour de France as the sprinters went toe to toe in a thrilling finish.

Seven-time green jersey winner Peter Sagan crossed second but was relegated to last and docked 13 sprint points for muscling past Wout van Aert late on.

Irishman Sam Bennett was promoted into second and leads the points classification by 68 points from Sagan.

Jumbo-Visma's Primoz Roglic remains 21 seconds clear in yellow.

""It was very, very hectic,"" said Ewan after Wednesday's win.

""I knew to keep calm and wait for the right gap to open - and it did, quite late.

""I did a big throw and then you're basically looking down at the ground, so I wasn't sure I won.""

The stage was started by former French rider Francois Lemarchand, in place of race director Christian Prudhomme, who is quarantined after testing positive for coronavirus.

Bennett had already strengthened his grip on the green jersey when he claimed second spot behind breakaway leader Matthieu Ladagnous at the intermediate sprint.

Even so early in the Tour's three-week itinerary, the pressure seemed to tell on Sagan and his team after Landagnous was swallowed up and the finish loomed.

Sagan's Bora-Hansgrohe team-mate Lukas Postlberger shot off the front with 6km to go in an attempt to disrupt their rivals' plans before the Slovak barged Van Aert to clear his route in the tightly contested finish.

His manoeuvre was subsequently punished by the race judges to leave him with it all to do to overhaul Bennett as the race heads for the mountains.

The peloton was also reduced in number with Astana's Ion Izaguirre suffering a nasty crash in the final 30km and Bora-Hansgrohe's Gregor Muhlberger feeling increasingly unwell at the back of the pack. Both subsequently abandoned.

Thursday's stage features four categorised climbs as the race takes a 218km route from Chauvigny to Sarran in the heart of the France.

A diverse collection of textures will not only change the way your home feels to the touch but also improve how it looks to the eye,http://mrglitterati.com/how-to-introduce-more-texture-into-your-home/,"Smooth furnishings and decorations give your home a refreshingly clean atmosphere, but they can also become monotonous. You can create greater depth and engaging variation throughout your rooms by making use of texture. A diverse collection of textures will not only change the way your home feels to the touch, but also improve how it looks to the eye. Discover how to introduce more texture into your home with our recommendations

Bring in Accessorizing Fabrics

Using a variety of fabrics is an easy way to increase the texture in your home. In practice, it can be as simple as draping knitted blankets over the back of the sofa or covering a table with a tablecloth. The noticeably complex patterns of the fibers will make plain furniture pieces more interesting. You can also choose to change the covers of throw pillows from plain versions to ones that incorporate different types or that possess a pile.

Add Plant Life

The organic structure of plants—in which leaves, stems, and flowers are arranged in a pleasing way—can also contribute texture to an otherwise plain interior ensemble. Place plants in a range of shapes and sizes around your home to capitalize on their intricacy. You can hang them from high places, set them on counters and tabletops, put them on windowsills, and let them rest on the floor. They can add a tangible coarseness and fine curves that juxtapose beautifully with your walls and blockier, flatter furniture.

Cover the Floor with Rugs

For hard floors, rugs are natural choices when you’re figuring out how to introduce more texture into your home. Look into the rug pile choices you have and go for either a thick, fluffy rug or a more uniform one that still maintains a clearly perceptible texture. Even flat rugs can supply a room with a varied texture due to their intertwined threads. For extra impact, you can layer multiple rugs so that different sections of different rugs are visible, working together to form a unique air that’s greater than the sum of their parts."
Incredible Look At Ice Covered Moon NASA Says 'May Be Friendly To Life' - Saturn's ENCELADUS...,http://technews.city/2020/08/incredible-look-at-ice-covered-moon.html?=watch,"High-density polyethylene is one of the most frequently used plastics in the manufacture of containers for the storage of hazardous substances. After their use, these containers are classed as hazardous waste. In order to recycle them, any remaining hazardous residues must first be eliminated.

In Europe, traditional cleaning systems involve a three-step cleaning and rinsing process that is applied to the ground plastic waste, known as triple washing and rinsing procedure. The process uses large quantities of water, a large amount of energy, chemical cleaning products. This procedure thereby generates a large volume of wastewater that requires subsequent treatment. At the end of this process, the ground plastic material is free of hazardous substances and ready for use, yet the aggressive nature of this cleaning procedure usually undermines the quality of the plastic itself. This is why this treated plastic is often used in applications of low added value.

LIFE EXTRUCLEAN: Project was launched in order to mitigate the drawbacks of this conventional recycling process, improve the final quality of the plastic and enable the material to be used in its original application.

LIFE EXTRUCLEAN: is a European project involving five Spanish companies, which have joined forces to develop a more efficient decontamination and recycling process for polyethylene plastic packages that have contained hazardous substances.

This technology is based on the use of supercritical carbon dioxide; supercritical fluids have been successfully used by the food, wood and leather industries in extraction processes. Supercritical carbon dioxide is inert, inexpensive, highly-available and is not harmful to the environment. It has also been shown to be highly efficient in the removal of hazardous substances, arising from organic solvents and pesticides. This makes this technology perfect for the removal of contaminating substances.

In the LIFE EXTRUCLEAN process, two of the three washing and drying stages, used on the traditional decontamination methods have been eliminated, employing supercritical carbon dioxide at the extrusion stage during the polyethylene recycling process.

This new process reduces water consumption, the use of cleaning agents and energy use. It results in less wastewater and its associated sludge. After being used, the CO2 is purified and reused in the cleaning process, preventing further emissions into the atmosphere. Because carbon dioxide is an inert gas, most of the mechanical properties of the decontaminated plastic are conserved. This means that it can be reused in applications calling for better quality plastic, such as in manufacture of new containers for hazardous materials.

These helps to close the life cycle of these plastic materials. At the pilot plant scale, this new technology was found to be nearly 70 % more effective than other traditional decontamination procedures.

These results will be corroborated at the last phase of the project, where the process will be applied at the industrial scale.

President Jair Bolsonaro (without a party) has the highest approval ratings since he became president. According to Datafolha, 37% of Brazilians consider their government to be excellent or good, compared to 32% who found it in the previous survey on June 23 and 24.

Even more pronounced was the drop in the rejection curve: those who considered it bad and terrible fell from 44% to 34%. They consider the government to be regular, 27%, compared to 23% in June. The institute interviewed 2,065 people by telephone from 11 to 12 August, with a margin of error of two percentage points, more or less.

The emergency aid program for the most impoverished population increased the visibility of government actions in the Northeast—an opposition stronghold. Rejection of Bolsonaro fell from 52% to 35% in the region, in which he maintains the worst rating: 33% excellent and good, a six-point increase compared to June. The correlation with the R $ 600 aid distribution is suggested, although not directly.

Bolsonaro inspires more confidence among men, people aged 35 to 44, and those who earn between 5 and 10 minimum wages. Mistrust is greater among women, young people, and those with higher education. In racial terms, the president is better evaluated among those who declare themselves white or yellow (40%), oscillating to 37% among browns and falling to 25% among blacks.

"The old ice cream jingle was racist, so Good Humor asked RZA to write a new one",http://news.avclub.com/the-old-ice-cream-jingle-was-racist-so-good-humor-aske-1844716420,"RZA Photo : Michael Loccisano ( Getty Images )

America’s recent reckoning with the way racism has wormed its way into every aspect of our lives (at least in cases where it wasn’t baked in from the very beginning) has been long overdue, and now these heavy conversations have evidently reached the ice cream industry. As reported by Rolling Stone, the Good Humor ice cream company has decided to retire its old ice cream truck jingle “Turkey In The Straw” because of the song’s racist history. As Rolling Stone explains, the song initially gained popularity through blackface minstrel shows, and if that’s not enough of a justification to toss it into the garbage bin of history, the song’s Wikipedia page has a special section for “racist versions.” (And they are very racist.)

So with that song out, Good Humor did what any ice cream company would do in a similar situation: It called up RZA and asked him to write a new one. The new melody blends “traditional ice cream truck sounds with jazz and hip-hop elements,” and RZA explains that he wanted to write this new song so it would be “good for every driver” and “every kid.” On top of that, for what is apparently “the first time in a long time,” RZA’s tune is going to be made available to all ice cream trucks in the country “in perpetuity.” In other words, this could theoretically be the ice cream song forever—and honestly, if you can get RZA to write your jingle, why would you bother ever replacing it?

Now we just need to see how the ice cream truck industry survives in a post-COVID society. Maybe they could add some kind of catapult that safely tosses ice cream into people’s hands? Until that happens and its safe for ice cream trucks to roll down our streets again, you can hear RZA’s melody below (and below that is a video he made talking about it).

The test has the potential to make diagnosis simpler, more affordable and widely available.

The test determined whether people with dementia had Alzheimer’s instead of another condition. And it identified signs of the degenerative, deadly disease 20 years before memory and thinking problems were expected in people with a genetic mutation that causes Alzheimer’s, according to research published in JAMA and presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.

Such a test could be available for clinical use in as little as two to three years, the researchers and other experts estimated, providing a readily accessible way to diagnose whether people with cognitive issues were experiencing Alzheimer’s, rather than another type of dementia that might require different treatment or have a different prognosis. A blood test like this might also eventually be used to predict whether someone with no symptoms would develop Alzheimer’s.

“This blood test very, very accurately predicts who’s got Alzheimer’s disease in their brain, including people who seem to be normal,” said Dr. Michael Weiner, an Alzheimer’s disease researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study. “It’s not a cure, it’s not a treatment, but you can’t treat the disease without being able to diagnose it. And accurate, low-cost diagnosis is really exciting, so it’s a breakthrough.”"
'I Love JK Rowling' Billboard Removed From Edinburgh Rail Station For Being 'Too Political',http://sputniknews.com/uk/202007301080018583-i-love-jk-rowling-billboard-removed-from-edinburgh-rail-station-for-being-too-political/,"Harry Potter author, JK Rowling has been widely criticised recently over comments she made online that many have described as transphobic and offensive. Several actors who starred in adaptations of her novels including Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Eddie Redmayne have spoken out against her.

A billboard which reads “I love JK Rowling” at Edinburgh’s Waverley train station has been removed by Network Rail for being too “political.”

The poster was designed and installed by Kelly-Jay Keen-Minshull, a campaigner against reform of gender recognition laws and free speech warrior, who often uses the pseudonym Posie Parker.

​It was erected on 27 July to celebrate JK Rowling’s upcoming 55th birthday on 31 July and women had been invited to take photographs with the poster to wish the Harry Potter author a Happy Birthday.

However Network Rail said that “the poster in question is against our code of acceptance for advertising in our stations owing to its political nature.”

​JK Rowling has recently come under fire for posting comments on Twitter that many described as transphobic. The author retweeted an opinion piece about menstruation with a comment suggesting that only women menstruate.

‘People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?

​The author was heavily criticised online as people pointed out that trans men also menstruate. She went on to then write an essay on her website outlining her views on sex and gender issues.

At the time the poster was unveiled Keen-Minshull said, ""It's important to bolster women in the public eye who speak up for women and girls.

""JK Rowling has shown incredible compassion and concern for women and girls, who are the ultimate victims of this culture war.

Reportedly successful COVID-19 vaccines in the works.,http://sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response,"More coronavirus vaccine candidates have passed initial safety tests and induce immune responses that might protect against the virus.

All volunteers in a small clinical trial who were given an experimental vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Oxford made antibodies against a protein the virus uses to break into cells. Those participants also produced immune cells called T cells that are important for long-lived immunity, the researchers, working with the global pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, report July 20 in the Lancet.

Levels of neutralizing antibodies, which can block viral entry into cells, were at levels on par with those from people who have recovered from COVID-19. No serious side effects were seen, particularly when volunteers took acetaminophen after getting an injection.

“The results so far are encouraging,” says Mark Poznansky, a vaccinologist who directs the Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the study. The researchers won’t truly know whether the vaccine is safe and effective until many more people get it.

Work on other viruses suggests that neutralizing antibodies and T cells in people’s blood should offer protection against infection or serious illness. But “a fundamental point about COVID-19 is that we don’t yet know what constitutes a protective [immune] response to the virus,” Poznansky says. “We’re not yet 100 percent clear about how those antibodies contribute to protection in the context of a vaccine.”

The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine starts with a chimpanzee adenovirus engineered so that it cannot replicate itself, making it safe to use. The virus can infect human cells, and delivers DNA instructions for making the coronavirus’ spike protein — the knobby protein studding the virus’s outer shell. Once inside a human cell, the DNA integrates, and the cell produces the spike protein, which the immune system then gears up to attack by producing antibodies and training white blood cells known as T cells to recognize the coronavirus.

This delivery system was used to make a still-experimental vaccine against the coronavirus behind MERS, so researchers at Oxford were able to quickly design the new vaccine.

In the clinical trial, more than 1,000 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 got either the new coronavirus vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or a vaccine against meningococcal bacteria. The meningococcal vaccine is safe and was used as a comparison group instead of a placebo so that volunteers got sore arms and other side effects that wouldn’t give away that they were in a comparison group.

Side effects to the coronavirus vaccine include pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, chills and feeling feverish. Most of those were reduced when volunteers took acetaminophen.

The researchers measured levels of neutralizing antibodies in the blood of the participants using three different tests. Those tests all produced different absolute antibody counts, but, overall, showed that the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the vaccine group were similar to levels seen in patients that had recovered from COVID19.

After one dose, 32 of 35 participants for whom data are available had neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein. After two doses, all 35 had the antibodies, the researchers found. How long any protection from those antibodies lasts is not yet known.

Although most people made antibodies after a single dose of vaccine, the researchers plan to give two, high-dose injections in further efficacy trials. “We want to maximize our chance of getting an efficacious readout,” Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca’s Executive Vice President of BioPharmaceuticals R&D said July 20 in a news conference.

Almost 200 vaccine candidates are in the works, with more than 20 in clinical trials around the world, according to a vaccine tracker maintained by the Milken Institute think tank. A vaccine candidate devised by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the biotechnology company Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., also recently reported safety and antibody data (SN: 5/18/20). That mRNA vaccine candidate was the first to be tried in people.

Clinical trials of other vaccine candidates are finding similar promising results. CanSino Biologics Inc., a company based in China, previously reported early safety data on its hybrid adenovirus vaccine (SN: 7/10/20). That vaccine has already been approved by the Chinese government for temporary use by its military. The company also reported data from a larger, Phase II safety trial of more than 500 volunteers on July 20 in the Lancet. A high dose of the vaccine produced severe side effects such as fever in 9 percent of volunteers, but a lower dose produced a severe side effect in only 1 percent of people. Both types of doses stimulated antibodies and T cells against the virus.

And global pharmaceutical company Pfizer working with the German biotech company BioNTech also reported preliminary results July 20 at medRxiv.org of a 60-person clinical trial in Germany. Like an earlier U.S. study of the vaccine, the companies report that two doses of their mRNA vaccine appear safe and stimulate antibodies. The new study shows that the vaccine also produces T cells against the coronavirus spike protein.

Both CanSino and Pfizer say they will begin Phase III clinical trials to test for efficacy.

AstraZeneca and Oxford have committed to providing 2 billion doses of their candidate vaccine should it be shown to work. Phase III clinical trials to further test that vaccine’s efficacy have begun. In the United Kingdom, almost 10,000 volunteers have been vaccinated. In Brazil, a 5,000-person trial is under way, and a 30,000-volunteer trial is set to begin in the United States by the end of July. How soon scientists know how well the vaccine candidate works depends upon infection rates in communities where the studies are taking place.

“It’s the irony of ironies that where the virus spread is out of control may be the optimal place to test the vaccine,” Poznansky says.

Researchers need a sufficiently high infection rate to make sure that differences between vaccine and comparison groups is really due to protection from the vaccine and not just because the vaccinated volunteers never encountered anyone with the virus.

Further results from these and other vaccine candidate front-runners may be known by the end of the year."
Adorable photos released as Prince George turns 7,http://cnn.com/2020/07/21/uk/prince-george-photos-seven-gbr-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge released two photos of Prince George to mark his seventh birthday on Wednesday.

This Promising New COVID-19 Treatment Could Reduce Patient Deaths,http://sciencealert.com/promising-new-covid-19-treatment-slashed-death-risk-in-randomised-trial,"An aerosol-based treatment could drastically reduce the number of new coronavirus patients dying from the disease or requiring intensive care, according to preliminary results released Monday by a British biotech firm.

In a randomised trial of 100 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, those who received an inhaled formula of the protein interferon beta were at 79 percent lower risk of developing severe disease compared to those who received a placebo.

They were also more than twice as likely to make a full recovery compared with the control group.

The firm behind the treatment, known as SNG001, said the preliminary results suggested ""a major breakthrough"" in the pandemic.

""We are all delighted with the trial results announced today, which showed that SNG001 greatly reduced the number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients who progressed from requiring oxygen to requiring ventilation,"" said Richard Marsden, CEO of Synairgen.

The results published Monday have not yet been peer-reviewed and the sample size is relatively small.

But if confirmed the treatment could revolutionise the way COVID-19 is dealt with in hospitals.

Game changer

Interferon beta is a naturally occurring protein, commonly used to treat multiple sclerosis.

It forms part of the body's natural fight against infection, and the novel coronavirus suppresses its production in an attempt to evade an immune response.

Delivering the protein directly into the lungs of patients is designed to trigger a robust immune response to the virus, even in patients whose immune system is already weakened by infection.

""The results confirm our belief that interferon beta... has huge potential as an inhaled drug to be able to restore the lung's immune response,"" said Tom Wilkinson, professor or respiratory medicine at the University of Southampton.

He said the trial showed SNG001 was effective in ""enhancing protection, accelerating recover and countering the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus.""

Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow said the new treatment ""could be a game changer"".

""With small (trial) numbers comes less certainty on the true level of benefit, or whether benefits vary between people with differing risk characteristics,"" said Sattar, who was not involved in the research.

""Such work would require a larger trial but, even so, these results are very exciting.""

There are currently a number of treatments available for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.

Last month a Britain-based team of researchers lead by the University of Oxford announced they had successfully reduced the risk of death among seriously ill patients by administering the commonly available steroid dexamethasone.

Several countries have also issued the emergency authorisation for treatment with anti-viral remdesivir.

"James Harden wears 'thin blue line' mask, and the reaction is swift",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/james-harden-wears-thin-blue-line-mask-reaction-swift-n1234178,"The Houston Rockets posted a photo to its social media accounts Thursday of star player James Harden wearing a ""thin blue line"" mask, and the reaction was swift.

""Mask Up,"" reads the photo caption.

The ""thin blue line"" flag is a sign of support for law enforcement that has amid Black Lives Matter protests come to signal opposition to the racial justice movement and support for white supremacy. The phrase can be traced back to an 1854 British battle formation, a “thin red line,” during the Crimean War, according to The Marshall Project.

Matthew Cherry, a Black filmmaker and Academy Award winner, was among those to respond to the team's tweet. Cherry tweeted a GIF of Michael Jordan looking perplexed.

Singer Trey Songz, who is also Black, weighed in too, tweeting an image of a raccoon and saying: ""This certified clown sh--. I'll say it for everybody who scared to. FOH."" (FOH is slang for f--- outta here.)

Harden said Friday that he was not trying to make a political statement and he was unaware of what the mask represented.

""I felt like it was just something to cover my whole face and my beard,"" he said, adding that face coverings he has worn previously have not.

Harden told reporters that, as he said Thursday, he was in the process of finding a way to show his support for the Black Lives Matter movement, whether it was with his jersey name or by other means.

Harden, who is Black, had earlier Thursday praised protests spurred by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, calling them ""amazing.""

""I think the world saw it,"" Harden told reporters. ""You know, how so many people could come together so close. Obviously, it was for a tragic reason. But you know, the marching and everything that we're standing for is very powerful.""

Unlike some other star NBA players, such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry, Harden, the league's scoring leader, has not been notably vocal about political or social justice issues.

Rapper Young Thug, a friend of Harden's, tweeted that the NBA player did not know the connotations carried by ""thin blue line.""

""Just so u know James harden is my brada...,"" he tweeted, ""btw he don’t have internet so he obviously don’t know what’s right or wrong if he posted something that’s against US...""

Some others on social media seemed to see Harden's wearing the mask as a sign of support for police and posted their gratitude with hashtags #bluelivesmatter and #alllivesmatter. The photo was liked more than 14,000 times on Twitter, where Harden's name was trending Friday morning, and more than 85,000 times on Instagram."
"After years of violence, a Kenyan village enjoys precious peace",http://reuters.com/article/us-kenya-turkana/after-years-of-violence-a-kenyan-village-enjoys-precious-peace-idUSKCN24E1BH,"TURKANA, Kenya (Reuters) - Most of the men in the village of Lorengippi in northwestern Kenya are scarred.

Slideshow ( 5 images )

Almost everyone has a tale of a relative killed in the cycle of violence over the years. But that is changing now.

Village tradition demanded every boy over the age of 11 train to fight. By 16, they would carry a weapon to protect the livestock - valuable commodities in Turkana, Kenya’s poorest region.

“We were fighting over livestock, we were fighting over grazing land, we were fighting over water,” said Kokoi Namojong, 59. His older sister was among those killed.

Then a clash between Lorengippi’s Turkana residents and neighbouring Pokot killed 23 people in 2013, said Nathan Ekal, the village chief. Their bodies are buried in a mass grave on the outskirts of Lorengippi.

The bloodshed shocked government officials, despite the region’s long history of deadly cattle raids and inter-ethnic violence.

Police mounted an operation to collect weapons, established a base and built a checkpoint on the border with West Pokot. Most importantly, said Ekal, the communities formed peace committees to resolve disagreements right after the 2013 killings.

The new security ushered in some development - a school, a small clinic and a new road connecting the village to the county capital of Lodwar, 90 km (55 miles) away.

Cross-border raids still take place but for now the committees are resolving the issues. Livestock are being returned and there have been no mass killings in recent years.

The Kenyan police are also present there in force

“Now there is lasting peace,” said Namojong, who is a chairman of one of the peace committees. “We do business with the Pokot and inter-marry with the Pokot.”"

Lockdown has prompted many people to reflect on past relationships that ended badly.

Here is a selection of stories sent in by people who read A surprise lockdown apology from my ex (8 June 2020)

We forgive each other for the past and now might have a future

I was contacted in early May by my ex-girlfriend. A simple ""Hi"" on WhatsApp. She had taken a gamble that I hadn't changed my number in the past eight years, and she was right.

My ex-girlfriend and I were together for a year in 2009 and then spent a couple of years in a complicated status. We had not parted on the best of terms.

I have had other relationships before and since, but she was always the one that got away, the one I would have settled down with, the one who made me feel things nobody else ever has.

That simple WhatsApp message started a conversation which, during the past six weeks has only paused for sleep. We have sent messages, shared video calls and even met up once (adhering to lockdown rules). Sometimes we've chatted long past sunrise.

It seems that everything that went wrong all those years ago has long since been forgiven on both sides. We are both a little bit older, more mature and able to admit our mistakes.

Things have certainly moved at quite a pace over the last couple of months. It's too soon to predict the future but, for the moment at least, it seems that we actually have one.

It's looking likely that we will get back together, but we've decided to wait and see how things go once we both go back to work full-time. The pandemic may have brought about untold suffering and misery, but somehow, it has brought two people back together who should never have been apart.

I had to reach out to my ex after a lockdown dream

In 2009 I met a guy. It happened out the blue. I was walking to the shop across the road from where I live. He said, ""Hi"" and so did I, then when I got home I went straight back out again as I knew he liked me. I made it look like I'd forgotten something from the shop and we stopped and he asked for my number.

We fell in love with each other, but he said he was bisexual - although he later admitted he was gay, like me, but could never come out as he was scared of what his family and friends would say. Even though I had never met James before, I discovered that I knew his dad - he lives on my estate.

After meeting up in secret for years, all of a sudden he disappeared and I didn't see him for over two years.

Then, out the blue, he got in touch. We met up and he confessed he had met a girl and was due to marry her.

Anyway, one thing led to another, and we kissed, had sex, and started seeing each other again - although he said his fiancée must not find out.

One day he was on his way round to see me and we were messaging each other saying how much we wanted each other and exchanging explicit messages. But he had left his Facebook logged on at his fiancée's house and she saw our messages in real time.

They split up and we continued to see each other, but he went into denial about his sexuality. I ended it because he wasn't prepared to come out and since then he's back with her and had two kids.

Three weeks into lockdown I had a dream about him, even though I haven't seen him in eight years. I discovered I still had all the messages from when she found out, and his old number.

I texted him and asked him how he was. Two days later I had a call from a withheld number and it was him. We chatted for nearly 30 minutes and I said to him, ""I just had to call"".

He said we shouldn't really be talking and had his missus never seen the Facebook messages then we would still be seeing each other now. He said he never regretted anything we did. He said he understood why I contacted him and maybe we would talk in another eight years.

I forgave my ex to release him from the guilt

I contacted a significant ex to tell him I had forgiven him - he didn't ever do anything particularly awful, but we were together for five years, 15 years ago, and he put me through a lot of heartache.

Oddly, although I was the one who was heartbroken at the time, he was the one who carried the pain - I knew he had always felt terrible about it. I moved on, went wild, and then settled down.

I have been married for more than 10 years and have three children, he is just beginning his ""family life phase"" and I feel a deep, probably everlasting, warm love and fondness for him, and genuine care.

At the start of Covid-19 I felt not everyone would be untouched by this virus, and I wanted him to know that I had moved into a platonic, positive form of ""memory love"" for him and that he was absolutely forgiven.

I didn't use quite such blunt words, but I told him what truly great, formative memories I had from our time together and essentially released him from the weight of the guilt that I knew he carried.

His response was the most open-hearted, vulnerable, loving (not romantic love), grateful and moving email I have ever received. He was always emotionally unavailable when I knew him, and I hadn't quite expected it to mean so much to him.

It then opened up more communication where I was able to be a support to him.

It's fascinating how Covid-19 has reached its tendrils right into the core of who we are. I love these small little shifts in our human behaviour, little clicks in the cogs of time, etching our stories as part of an enormous whole.

It took courage to suggest he might want my forgiveness - he could have come back all cool and brushed me off, but I didn't really mind taking the risk. If one of us dies unexpectedly that experience is now just a positive, loving part of our lives.

I don't forgive him, but I respect him for finally apologising

image copyright Somsara Rielly

I received a WhatsApp apology whilst in lockdown from my ex-husband who I divorced two years ago. It was completely out of the blue - the only communication we've had in the last 18 months has been short, sharp and only related to pick up arrangements for our son.

He had an affair on-board his ship with another naval officer. They maintained the affair for five months before I found out and confronted him - I was at home with our two-year-old son, patiently awaiting his arrival home from deployment.

We had been together for 10 years when I filed for divorce.

He moved in with her, they got engaged and we were abandoned.

It was brutally heart-breaking, but I never let my emotions get the better of me, and maintained decorum throughout. He never explained, and certainly didn't apologise for his actions. It made the recovery for me much harder and longer, and when she dumped him 18 months later I hoped he would swallow his pride and admit he did wrong.

Then suddenly, two weeks ago, I got a message saying he was so sorry for everything. It was long and well thought through. I actually cried when I read it as it felt like I was finally able to close the lid on the divorce box and completely mentally move on.

It came from nowhere - must be all the isolation and time he has to think about where he is in his life. I don't forgive him, but he earned some respect back.

Thirty-two years have passed, but I'd like to apologise to someone I cared about for hurting them

I grew up in an industrial area of the country and on leaving school I found a dreary position of employment in a local factory.

With each year that passed I found the area to be increasingly insular and claustrophobic. I wanted more than weekends spent drinking and enduring my life in a grey factory.

I found planning my working tour of Australia liberating and enjoyed the fact I had an escape plan. It was 1988, I was 21 and on arrival in Perth I felt exhilarated and elated. Everything seemed new, colourful, fresh and exciting.

I found the different nationalities of the people in the backpackers' hostel just as interesting as the new country I was in. Everyone seemed to have a buzz, a plan, and a destination. I felt at home instantly.

Debah was from Yugoslavia - dark-haired, with olive skin and beautiful. We embarked on a casual relationship. Between work, going out with new mates, and generally living it up we saw each other. Debah wanted to get to know me better and become more of a couple. I decided against this and we went our separate ways.

The rest of the year passed by like a wonderful dreamlike experience.

On my return I went to university. A profession, house in a pleasant suburb, and family followed.

I usually sleep quite well. Lockdown for Covid-19 had barely been in place and I awoke in the middle of the night thinking of Debah after almost 32 years. Gradually conversations that we had came back. They weren't good. I found these quite unsettling and somewhat shameful.

Whilst out as a group in a club she had come over to me and asked if I would like to go back with her later that evening, to which I replied, ""I'll see what's on TV first.""

She didn't swear or glare, she just went back to join her friends with a quiet dignity. I remember being happy at the time with the comment as it got some cheap laughs.

After a few days of deliberately avoiding Debah at the hostel, she sought me out and stated that she knew I didn't want to see her and that she didn't want there to be any bad feeling between us. Later that month I continued travelling without saying goodbye.

The truth is if we had got any closer I couldn't have left her without a traumatic upheaval later. I found it easier to put up a front of indifference and belittlement than to take a chance of there being a greater hurt later. I don't know why it's taken 32 years to rise to the surface.

Since the literal awakening at the start of Covid-19, it was constantly on my mind why I treated Debah so appallingly. It's not a comfortable feeling at all knowing that I deliberately hurt someone whom I cared about. It's not someone I recognise as me. But, unfortunately, it was me.

I don't have Debah's address but I do have a strong desire to apologise. I hope she stayed in Australia and avoided the Balkans conflict that ripped apart her country. Wherever she is I know she will be living with dignity.

Reaching out to my ex is bad for my mental health

image copyright Somsara Rielly

I was on a bus and the song Hello by Adele came on my headphones and I had this urge to find my ex, Mark, who had totally wrecked me when I was in my early 20s. We'd gotten engaged at his suggestion, but the whole relationship was plagued with red flags I missed from behind rose-tinted glasses.

I'd found myself back home in Wales and more than a bit lost having dropped out of university. I now know that I was experiencing the first flushes of the clinical depression that has dogged me for decades. I manage it much better today.

Mark had broken things off after a period of cruel behaviour. He strung me along for a good few weeks until I finally realised he was done with me. I was truly broken. He was my first real love and I never really gained the closure I wanted. I found him on Facebook but his profile was shared with a woman.

In 2015 I emailed an old address I had for him but got no response. Then in lockdown I once again had that pull, but this time it felt self-destructive. Whenever I look for him it feels like picking at an old scar that hasn't quite healed properly, reopening a wound that should have closed years ago.

I searched on Facebook but the old joint profile was gone. I found a profile for him alone. I saw his face and again my insides twisted like I was going to throw up. I sent a message, one simple sentence, ""Is that really you?""

I'm not sure why I still look back at him. He hurt me so completely it's taken me all this time to really let myself feel ready to seek a relationship.

The profile disappeared. He'd clearly blocked me once he saw the message, so I still don't get my closure, and I likely never will. Maybe he's actually ashamed of what he did but isn't ready to connect.

Whatever it is, I'm still forging on. I have a good job and my mental health is much better. I have an excellent group of friends and whilst I am still utterly single, I don't mind. I'm happy with who I am these days and each day things get a little better. The pain isn't gone. I've just moved much further from it.

Rhian, UK

By the time I decided to apologise it was too late

With lots of time during lockdown I looked back on my life and thought of my first boyfriend who, after three intense years when we were teenagers, decided he didn't want to spend the rest of his life with me and I never heard from him again.

I recently felt like contacting him to say that, in retrospect, it was the right decision to go our separate ways and I have had a happy life, hope he had too. But then I found he was no longer alive. I would say to get in touch if it will not upset anyone, but don't delay as long as I did - I waited 62 years!"
If you're ever feeling down just remember you are human and you're unique,http://singularityhub.com/2017/12/28/what-is-it-that-makes-humans-unique/,"If an extraterrestrial civilization were to observe and study our planet from an objective perspective, there is no doubt that among the millions of species on Earth, homo sapiens stands out. This species sits on top of the food chain, has extended its habitats to the entire planet, and in recent centuries, experienced an explosion of technological, societal, and artistic advancements.

It’s remarkable how far we’ve come in what is a short period of time from an evolutionary perspective. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has a superb analogy to highlight this fact: Stretch your arms out to represent the span of the history of life on Earth, from the origins of life to where we are today. With this scale, the whole history of our species is represented by the thickness of one fingernail clipping. All of recorded human history is represented by the dust from one light stroke of a nail file.

One can’t help but wonder: how did our species get so far? 99.9 percent of all the species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct. Not only have we survived, we have also seen intellectual and technological progress beyond any other form of life.

So, what is it that makes us unique?

What’s Not Unique

In his intellectually stimulating book, Human Purpose and Transhuman Potential, Ted Chu points out that many differences between us and other mammals are differences of degree. In other words, many of our seemingly unique traits are just exaggerated versions of traits that are already identified in other mammals and animals.

For instance, chimps kiss, laugh, lie, have in-group politics and show goal-directed action. Ants, wolves, and dolphins all have social traits. Many primates are self-aware. Elephants cry. Capuchin monkeys have forms of monetary exchange, and so on. These are just a few examples, but the point is that many of our behaviors are actually much more advanced versions of innate “animal instincts.”

What Is Unique

In his book, Chu identifies three “revolutionary” traits that make us unique. Naturally, there is a decent amount of debate on this topic, but many other biologists and scientists agree with him.

Symbolic abstract thinking: Very simply, this is our ability to think about objects, principles, and ideas that are not physically present. It gives us the ability for complex language. This is supported by a lowered larynx (which allows for a wider variety of sounds than all other animals) and brain structures for complex language.

But this trait not only gives us the ability to communicate symbolically, it also allows us to think symbolically, by allowing us to represent all kinds of symbols (including physical and social relationships) in our minds, independent of their presence in the physical world. As a result, internal associations of novel kinds become possible.

In Chu’s words, as a consequence of this “our mind acquires the ability to imagine, to reason, to choose among various motives, and to evaluate alternative plans to actions.” Symbolic abstract thinking has a crucial role to play in allowing us as individuals—and as a species—to be imaginative and solve complex problems.

Structure building: The ability to build physical and social structures, in addition to mental models. An extension of this ability is our capacity to share these structures or models with other members of our society—a critical component of cultural transmission.

Instead of relying on procreation to pass them on, memes (a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices) can be transmitted much faster than genes, through writing, speech, gestures, or rituals. They allow for cumulative knowledge and experiences that can serve as a powerful force throughout human progress.

Many of the structures we’ve built have also been used to expand our mental models beyond our biology. According to philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers’ theory of “the extended mind,” we use technology to expand the boundaries of the human mind beyond our skulls. We use tools like machine learning to enhance our cognitive skills or powerful telescopes to enhance our visual reach. Technology has become a part of our exoskeleton, allowing us to push beyond our limitations.

Higher consciousness: The very fact that we as human beings can write and read articles like this one and contemplate the unique nature of our mental abilities is awe-inspiring.

Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran said it best: “Here is this three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand…it can contemplate the meaning of infinity, and it can contemplate itself contemplating the meaning of infinity.”

Such self-reflective consciousness or “meta-wondering” boosts our ability for self-transformation, both as individuals and as a species. It contributes to our abilities for self-monitoring, self-recognition and self-identification.

Where Does This Leave Us?

Our revolutionary traits stand out even more when we take a cosmic perspective. Everything in our world, including us, is made up of stardust, clumps of matter that originated in the crucibles of stars.

We are not only in the universe, but the universe is also within us. Our brains, as an extension of the universe, are now being used to understand themselves. That is why Carl Sagan has famously said “we are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” We are the only living being on Earth that can do this.

We know these are uniquely human traits. But as Chu points out, they also represent untapped potential. Some of us possess higher consciousness than others. The question that we now have to ask ourselves is, how do we cultivate higher consciousness, structural building, and symbolic abstract thinking among the masses?

The documentary Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo is truly inspirational.,http://friendsofcc.com/2020/07/08/focc-review-inmate-1-the-rise-of-danny-trejo/,"By Jason Delgado

Film can provide a window into the human soul in a way that no other medium does. Words can be beautiful (or destructive), and they paint a picture, but the old saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” is amplified when those pictures are moving at twenty-four frames per second.

Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo answers an immensely important question on life that people continue to heatedly debate, ever since the dawn of the law of man. Can the so-called “worst of us,” (aka the criminals, murderers, drug addicts, etc.) be rehabilitated and redeemed? The answer to that question is yes, because Danny did it.

I didn’t know the story of Danny Trejo’s personal life before this documentary, and I won’t go into many details on the Machete star, so as to not spoil the movie, but It is truly amazing, like the man himself. I can tell you that in the brief time that I met Trejo in person, he gave off a gentle soul-like vibe, which is almost unfathomable, considering how his early life played out.

The film does a good job of showing how a rough environment shaped Danny Trejo’s life, like it does for so many others who grow up around addiction and poverty. It’s a sobering thought to ponder that countless people in life are typecast because of the way they look, just as Trejo was for decades in many of his roles as the tough, scary inmate #1, before he finally broke out as Machete.

In a day and age where the death penalty is still around, and there is so much strife going on in our country (and around the world) we need to let love in to replace the hate. Trejo did that, and completed the ultimate redemption story in the process, by way of kindness and constantly giving back to the people who could use it the most.

I give Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo five out of five hot sauce packets. The Punisher is wrong; even the most hardened criminals deserve a second chance, and some even become a Mexican-American screen icon in the process.

Inmate #1 is available now on Digital retailers including Apple TV, Vudu, Google Play, Xbox, Playstation Video, Amazon Video and more.

Chance The Snapper Is Living His Best Life In Florida One Year After Stealing Chicago's Heart,http://blockclubchicago.org/2020/07/08/chance-the-snapper-is-living-his-best-life-in-florida-one-year-after-stealing-chicagos-heart/,"HUMBOLDT PARK — A year ago Thursday, before the coronavirus pandemic and the economic fallout, Chicago was gripped by a small alligator.

It was a national story. An alligator was spotted prowling the otherwise quiet Humboldt Park lagoon, setting off a week-long search that quickly brought on gator fever. A Block Club Chicago subscriber saw him while on a walk that morning and tipped us off.

For days, people from all over the city crowded the lagoon, hoping to get a glimpse of the gator and to enjoy a Chicago summer as the wayward reptile evaded capture. In states loaded with gators, people laughed at Chicago’s fascination — the same way we laugh when an inch of snow shuts down their cities.

It was love at first sight for Chicago, a weird, happy summer story the city could all get behind.

News crews flocked to the lagoon every morning. Music blared. Street vendors made cash. T-shirts were sold. Adults and kids alike craned their necks trying to spot him.

The gator, nicknamed Chance the Snapper by Block Club readers, was eventually caught by Florida gator trapper Frank Robb, who became an overnight sensation.

With Thursday marking one year since Chance was first spotted in the lagoon, we caught up with Robb to find out how Chicago’s favorite gator is doing and how Robb’s life has changed since the heroic capture.

Robb took his newfound celebrity well — and ran with it.

“I always knew I was a blessed person, I always knew that everything I had was due to the guy upstairs. It just reaffirmed that,” Robb said.

“I’m not that fancy. This is a lot more than me. I truly believe it’s all been the grace of God. I can’t be more thankful for the situations I’ve been put in.”

Much Bigger, More Active — But His Snout Remains Bent

When Chance was caught, he measured about 4 feet long. He had a bent snout and a shyness found in gators confined to small spaces. Robb and other experts have said Chance was someone’s pet gator, unleashed into the lagoon sometime shortly before he was spotted last summer.

Chance didn’t stay in Chicago long. After charming his way through a Humboldt Park Lagoon press conference with Robb and posing for pictures at the city’s Animal Care and Control center, he headed to Florida.

And since arriving at St. Augustine Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida, last summer, Chance has become a different animal.

Chance is no longer shy. In fact, it only took him a couple of weeks to warm up to people, Robb said. Now he’s “super active.”

“When he first got there, he was very, very, very shy. You could tell he had never been around people,” Robb said. “Once he got used to people, holy moly. I got a little worried wearing flip flops. He’ll trim your toenails for you. He comes right up to you. He’ll put his chin on the bank right beside you.”

Because Chance is fed and trained consistently, he has gotten a lot bigger — about 6 inches in length, which is a lot of growth for one year, Robb said. Gators grow to be 9-10 feet long, and Robb said Chance could grow to be 7-and-a-half feet long in a couple years if he continues on this track. Chance has also gained weight.

“In the wild, that might take 20 years, but whenever you’re getting fed right away and taken care of, he’s going to bulk up really fast,” Robb said.

“I went two-and-a-half months without seeing [Chance] and I was like, ‘Whoa, this guy’s been hitting the steroids.'”

John Brueggen, director of St. Augustine Alligator Farm, said Chance has taken to training “very well.”

“He responds very well when we go in there for food. He comes directly over and we can hand feed him,” Brueggen said.

Chance still has a bent snout — and that’ll never change, Robb said. But Robb said there are no disadvantages to having a bent snout. All it does, he said, is make Chance easy to identify.

Over the last year at the farm, Chance has spent his days basking in the sun, eating food pellets and working with trainers. Up until about a month ago, he was on exhibit with a few other gators at the very front of the farm.

Chance has easily been one of the biggest attractions at the Florida alligator farm since he arrived last summer, Robb said. Robb helps out at the farm and visits frequently.

“People are still asking about him nonstop. … There’s so much love for the little fella, but he’s not exactly a little fella anymore,” Robb said with a laugh.

All of the love could be getting to his head. The farm recently had to move Chance to his own pen after he started biting his “roommates” at feeding time. Robb said Chance had gotten much bigger than the other gators in his pen and was trying to show them who’s boss. The biting was playful — “like dogs playing” — but it warranted a break from other gators, Robb said.

“He just made sure they knew it all the time. Reminder: My name is Chance and I run this show. Y’all can visit, but I run the show,” Robb said.

Robb’s Journey

Robb’s life changed when he pulled Chance out of the sleepy lagoon. “Alligator Robb” suddenly became a household name and the object of every news outlet in town.

The gator trapper was a Chicago hero and was treated as such. He was asked to throw out the first pitch at a Cubs game and to turn on Buckingham Fountain.

Robb said the strangest media request he received was from NBC. The TV station asked for pictures after he shaved his signature beard, to which Robb remembers replying, “I guess you can.” The story’s headline was See It: Gator Robb Nearly Unrecognizable Without His Beard.

Robb went on to visit Chicago 11 times, after never having stepped foot in the Midwest before Chance. He even started dating a woman in Chicago, which was also covered by the news.

Robb declined to say whether he still has a Chicago girlfriend, but he gushed about all of the people he’s met in Chicago, some of whom he’s stayed in contact with.

“I found nothing but kindness from every person I met. People in the parks department, law enforcement and people in the media. I’m still a nobody. They had no reason to to want to talk to me and everybody was kind. It was kindness, nothing but kindness,” Robb said.

Now Robb considers Chicago a “second home.” He even finds himself defending Chicago when people in Florida denigrate the city.

“It’s the same thing you hear about New York, L.A. — people there aren’t friendly, it’s a rough place, there’s a lot of crime,” Robb said. “There’s a lot of crime everywhere. There’s bad people everywhere. There’s great people everywhere. It’s what you make of it.”

Robb still primarily works as a gator trapper. He said this year has been busier than ever, perhaps because Florida saw a drought and then a huge dose of rain. (You can follow Robb’s trapper work here.)

But Chicago fame allowed Robb to pursue personal projects he never thought possible. He published a Chance the Snapper coloring book and is now in the middle of publishing a second book, an educational book about alligators.

He’s using crocodilian vocals to create music with a friend who’s a sound producer. The music, which is dropping soon, will benefit St. Augustine Alligator Farm.

At one point, Robb even teamed up with a production company on a TV show, but that deal has since fallen through due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said he’s “back looking for options on that again.”

Robb said he still routinely fields calls and messages about Chance even a year later. Over the holiday weekend, someone sent him a photo of the “Alligator Robb” bobblehead, asking why he wasn’t in Chicago anymore.

“Me and that little guy are connected forever,” Robb said of Chance. “I’ll always make sure he’s safe. He isn’t going anywhere. He’ll never have any worries.”

"Gorgeous New Footage Lets You Fly Over a Vast, Ice-Filled Crater on Mars",http://sciencealert.com/new-mars-footage-let-s-you-take-a-flight-over-the-korolev-crater-on-mars,"We love flyover videos from other worlds. These stunning videos, created from imagery gathered by orbiting spacecraft, can give us a sense of what it would be like to fly in an airplane on another planet.

This latest flyover video from the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft, provides a stunning view of one of Mars' most eye-popping craters.

This movie was created using an imagery from Mars Express' High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC).

The images are normally taken looking straight down (nadir), and the video combines topography information from the stereo channels of HRSC to generate a three-dimensional landscape, which was then recorded from different perspectives, as with a movie camera, to render the flight shown in the video.

Korolev Crater is 82 kilometers (50 miles) across and at least 2 km (1.25 miles) deep. This well-preserved crater is located the northern lowlands of Mars, just south of a large patch of dune-filled terrain that encircles part of the planet's northern polar cap (known as Olympia Undae).

Overhead view of Korolev Crater on Mars. (ESA/DLR/FU Berlin)

That's not snow you're seeing, but this crater is constantly filled with water ice, and its central mound is about 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) thick all year round. It's one of the largest reservoirs of non-polar ice on Mars.

This view reminds me of a flight I took where I flew over Meteor Crater in Arizona USA. But for comparison, Meteor Crater is less than a mile across (.737 miles/1.186 km) and just 560 feet (170 m) deep.

You may be thinking, how can this ice remain stable in Korolev Crater; doesn't water ice sublimate away in Mars thin atmosphere?

Just like dry ice does here on Earth, water ice on Mars usually goes from solid to gas with the low atmospheric pressure. (Mars has approximately 8 millibars while on Earth the average, atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1013.25 millibars, or about 14.7 pounds per square inch.)

But temperature can influence ice stability as well. Water ice is permanently stable within the Korolev Crater because the deepest part of this depression acts as a natural cold trap.

The scientists at ESA explain that the air above the ice cools and is thus heavier compared to the surrounding air: since air is a poor conductor of heat, the water ice mound is effectively shielded from heating and sublimation.

The name of the crater may be familiar. It's named after Russian rocket engineer and spacecraft designer Sergei Pavlovich Korolev (1907-1966). He developed the first Russian intercontinental rocket R7, the precursor of the modern Soyuz rockets that are still operated today.

With his rocket and spacecraft design, he was also responsible for the first human-made satellite (Sputnik in 1957) and for the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin in 1961).

"Fans love musicians' personalities as much as their music - ""By analyzing the public personas of famous musicians and bands, and the personality traits of their fans, the team showed that people prefer the music of artists whose public personalities are similar to their own""",http://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-07/bu-flm070120.php,"Why do you like the music you do? You would think that it is because of the music itself. But that's only half the story. Surprisingly, the other half of the story doesn't have much to do with music at all. A new Big Data study from Bar-Ilan University and Columbia Business School found that the musician's personality plays a large role, as well, in listener preferences.

The study, published today in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, was conducted by team of psychologists from four major universities and led by Zuckerman Scholar and musician Dr. David Greenberg, from the Interdisciplinary Department of Social Sciences and Department of Music at Bar-Ilan University, and Assistant Professor at Columbia Business School Dr. Sandra Matz. By analyzing the public personas of famous musicians and bands, and the personality traits of their fans, the team showed that people prefer the music of artists whose public personalities are similar to their own - an experience they've dubbed the ""self-congruity effect of music.""

In three separate studies of more than 80,000 people, the researchers looked at several factors: persona ratings of 50 of the most famous musicians in the Western world, listener reactions to actual musical stimuli, and the lyrics in the artists' music. The musicians studied were diverse, ranging from Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Whitney Houston, The Rolling Stones to Beyoncé, Coldplay, Dave Matthews Band, Maroon 5, Taylor Swift, and Ozzy Osbourne.

The results from the three studies show that the fit in personality between the listener and the musician predicts musical preferences similar to the fit for gender, age, and even the audio features of music. It's important to note that the perceived personality or public ""persona"" of the musicians were measured--not their actual personalities. The findings are a major advance in this area of research and show that musical preferences are driven by social, psychological and group dynamics.

The findings highlight the social powers of music and how music gives fans a sense of pride and belonging to a social world. Even more, the results shed light on the evolutionary origins of music, which say that music evolved as a way to communicate groups characteristics which helped tribes determine whether or not to cooperate with each other.

Dr. David Greenberg, a Zuckerman Scholar at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, an honorary research associate at Cambridge University in England, and a professional musician, says, ""In today's world, where social divisions are increasing, our studies are showing us how music can be a common denominator to bring people together.""

Dr. Sandra Matz, Assistant Professor at Columbia Business School, says, ""The findings can pave the way for a new approaches for record companies or music management to target and build audiences.""

Dr. H. Andrew Schwartz, Assistant Professor at Stony Brook University, says, ""The findings can be applied to situations involving mental health. For example, in times of stress and uncertainty, listeners can seek music of artists with similar personalities to themselves and feel understood and a sense of connectedness.""

"Pfizer reports encouraging, very early vaccine test results",http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pfizer-reports-encouraging-early-vaccine-test-results-71555594,"Pfizer reports encouraging, very early vaccine test results Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech are reporting encouraging signs from its very early testing of a possible COVID-19 vaccine

The first of four experimental COVID-19 vaccines being tested by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech showed encouraging results in very early testing of 45 people, the companies said Wednesday.

Study volunteers given either a low or medium dose, in two shots about a month apart, had immune responses in the range expected to be protective, when compared to some COVID-19 survivors, according to the preliminary results.

Side effects were typical for vaccines, mostly pain at the injection site and fever.

The report has been submitted for publication in a scientific journal but not yet reviewed. With its other potential candidates still in the earliest stage of testing, Pfizer aims to open a large-scale study this summer but can't yet say which shot is best to include.

But researchers didn’t administer a second shot of the highest dose initially tested, sticking with the low and medium doses. The higher-dose shot caused more injection reactions without apparent added benefit.

About 15 different COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in human testing worldwide, with several poised to begin huge, last-stage studies to prove if they really work.

Different companies are pursuing different types of vaccines, boosting the odds that at least one approach might work — although there's no guarantee. The Pfizer and BioNTech candidates use a piece of the coronavirus genetic code to prime the body to recognize and attack the virus.

Earlier this week, Inovio Pharmaceuticals issued a news release saying its gene-based vaccine candidate showed encouraging results in similar early testing in 40 volunteers.

Spectacular Maya Wall Paintings Discovered in Guatemala,http://sci-news.com/archaeology/chajul-maya-wall-paintings-guatemala-08558.html,"An unparalleled set of Maya wall paintings, most probably from the 17th to 18th centuries CE, discovered in a local house in the Guatemalan city of San Gaspar Chajul (further referred to as Chajul) blends pre-Columbian with imported European elements, making them a unique example of Colonial art from Latin America.

Central America is home to Maya populations speaking a variety of related languages. Despite the Spanish conquest of the 16th century CE, these populations have persisted, maintaining many traditions and their sense of cultural identity.

Today, the total Maya population is estimated at 8 million, most of whom (around 6.2 million) live in Guatemala.

One of the Maya groups of south-central Guatemala are the Ixils. Today, the three largest Ixil cities are Chajul, Santa Maria Nebaj and San Juan Cotzal.

In 2003, renovation of one of the local houses in Chajul revealed a set of Maya wall paintings.

The murals were then studied by Jagiellonian University researcher Jarosław Źrałka and his colleagues from Poland, Germany, Spain and Guatemala.

“The paintings decorate the north, east and west walls of the main, central room. They probably also once covered the south wall, but this has been demolished and rebuilt,” they said.

One of the best-preserved and most interesting scenes, over 2 m in length, is on the western wall.

The 4.3-m-long panel on the northern wall seems to be a continuation of the scenes depicted on the western wall.

The eastern wall is adorned with two panels, one at either end. If there were any paintings between these two panels, they have not survived.

The murals were probably made by indigenous artists using traditional colors and painting techniques.

According to local inhabitants of Chajul, they represent scenes from either the Baile de la Conquista (Dance of the Conquest) or the Baile de los Moros y Cristianos (Dance of the Moors and Christians).

“Our research to date, including interviews with Chajul inhabitants about local history and tradition, suggests that houses with murals were originally owned by important members of the local community, possibly members of the cofradías,” the scientists said.

“These individuals were involved in the organization of religious events, both those connected with Catholicism and those linked with costumbre (or Maya spirituality, related to the cult of the Maya pre-Columbian calendar and to agrarian rituals).”

“The discovery of a Chajul wall painting tradition adds significant new information to the history of Colonial-period Mesoamerican art, and contributes to our understanding of local, indigenous expressions of art and ritual in the context of foreign influences,” they concluded.

The team’s paper was published in the journal Antiquity.

"It Just Hit 100 Degrees Fahrenheit in Siberia, the Hottest Temperature on Record So Far North in the Arctic",http://weather.com/news/climate/news/2020-06-21-siberia-russia-100-degrees-heat-record-arctic,"At a Glance One city in northern Russia soared to 100 degrees Fahrenheit on June 20.

If that data is found to be accurate, it would be the hottest on record anywhere in the Arctic.

Siberia has seen the planet's largest temperature anomalies so far in 2020.

This is an area more known for its extreme winter cold, rather than searing heat.

A Russian heat wave smashed an all-time record high in one Siberian town this weekend, possibly the hottest temperature on record so far north in the Arctic, continuing an off-the-charts warm year in what is typically one of coldest places on Earth.

The high temperature in Verkhoyansk, a town in northeast Russia about 260 miles south of the Arctic coast and about 6 miles north of the Arctic Circle, topped out at 38 degrees Celsius, or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, Saturday.

If that reading is found to be correct, that would smash the town's all-time record of 37.3 degrees Celsius - 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit - set on July 25, 1988. Temperature records in Verkhoyansk date to 1885.

It would also be the hottest temperature on record north of the Arctic Circle, according to Etienne Kapikian, a meteorologist with Meteo France.

The average high in late June in Verkhoyansk is only in the upper 60s, or around 20 degrees Celsius.

Let that soak in for a moment.

Siberia, one of the world's coldest places in winter, just reached 100 degrees (F) this year before Dallas or Houston did.

To escape the heat, children were seen swimming in a lake near Verkhoyansk, Sunday, a lake that would be frozen solid in the depths of winter, when average temperatures in Russia's ""Pole of Cold"" typically plunge into the minus 40s and 50s Celsius.

Verkhoyansk once plunged to minus 67.8 degree Celsius - minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit - on Feb. 5 and 7, 1892.

This is 105.8 degrees Celsius colder than its just-recorded all-time record high. That's a difference in extremes larger than the difference between water's freezing and boiling points, likely the largest spread between all-time record high and low temperatures anywhere on Earth.

Advertisement Expansive blocking high pressure aloft over Siberia was responsible for this latest heat wave, which has been in place since June 12.

This blocking high hasn't allowed colder air to push south from Russia's Arctic coast.

The blocking high-pressure ridge responsible for record heat in Siberia on June 20-21, 2020.

And this is continuing a trend so far in 2020.

Berkeley Earth lead scientist Robert Rohde noted Russia clobbered its record warmest January - May period in 2020 by a whopping 1.9 degrees Celsius over the previous record warmest first five months of a year, 2016.

By far and away, Russia has been the epicenter of the planet's most expansive and extreme warm anomalies in 2020.

The persistent warm and dry weather fueled wildfires which already began scorching parts of northern Russia in April and are continuing to burn in this latest heat wave.

It's also no surprise Arctic sea ice coverage along the coast of Siberia is also at a 41-year record low for this time of year, as pointed out by climate scientist Zach Labe.

Even more troubling is these temperatures appear to be occurring decades ahead of climate change projections, according to climate specialist Jeff Berardelli.

A diesel fuel spill earlier this month in Norilsk, Russia, was found to be caused by supporting pillars of a storage tank sinking into thawing permafrost, causing the tank to collapse.

Chinese Media Is Very Interested in the Origins of COVID-19. As Long as It's Not China,http://vice.com/en_asia/article/ep4vdj/chinese-media-propaganda-origin-coronavirus,"For all the world has come to learn about the novel coronavirus, which has been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, one thing scientists still haven’t been able to determine for certain is where exactly it came from.

Though the current COVID-19 pandemic is generally traced back to a cluster of cases linked to a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, questions remain as to where it came from before that—something Chinese state media has steadily amplified.

Following a string of successes fighting the virus at home, even as it continues to wreak havoc overseas, Chinese state media outlets are increasingly seizing on the characteristically slow moving nature and equivocating language of scientific research to sow doubt on whether the outbreak originated in China at all.

“The possibility cannot be ruled out,” runs a common refrain through much of the coverage, “that the novel coronavirus may have come from outside China.”

An article in nationalist state-run tabloid Global Times on Monday cited research into a recent cluster of new cases in Beijing to insinuate that imported goods may have in fact been responsible for the initial outbreak in Wuhan.

“Evidence shows that the source of infection in Beijing’s new coronavirus outbreak points at Europe, seemingly casting new doubt over the origins of the COVID-19 epidemic, with some netizens and experts speculating the outbreak that occurred in Wuhan's Huanan seafood market may also relate to imported food or animals,” the first line of the article reads.

Wu Zunyou, an expert at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), told state broadcaster CGTN that research “clearly indicated” that the virus strain involved in the new outbreak in Beijing belongs to a ""major epidemic strain in the European countries,"" concluding that the virus responsible was ""from outside of China.”

The virus could have been brought to Beijing “from any of the European countries, or maybe from the United States, or from Malaysia,” Wu elaborated in the interview.

“The European strain is very prevalent in many many different countries,” he said, but “it’s not in… China.”

The Global Times, while stopping short of explicitly saying Europe had imported the virus to Wuhan, did strongly suggest as much, saying “suspicions are mounting” over imported goods, citing “some experts” as saying “the possibility cannot be ruled out,” and pointing to past comments by China CDC head Gao Fu that the seafood market in Wuhan ""is more like a victim"" of an imported coronavirus than its originator.

Only in the last few paragraphs of the story is any countervailing evidence mentioned, namely that vendors in Wuhan said most of the produce sold there came from nearby, and the contention from two prominent experts that COVID-19 almost definitely originated in wild animals, most likely bats.

Outside of Chinese state media, meanwhile, the theory that even the Beijing outbreak was imported in a shipment of contaminated seafood was met with skepticism, with academics and the head of the World Health Organization suggesting the outbreak was more likely caused by human-to-human transmission.

As the actual scientists the Global Times story belatedly quoted pointed out, the slowly accumulating scientific consensus surrounding the origins of COVID-19 suggests that it mutated from similar coronavirus strains found in bats.

But a separate story, also published by the Global Times, took pains to suggest that these may not have been Chinese bats.

“The novel coronavirus appears to have originated in horseshoe bats and the possibility cannot be ruled out that it may have come from outside China from Southeast Asian countries,” the June 4 article begins, citing a joint study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology and foreign researchers.

While horseshoe bats are indeed found across Southeast Asia, as the Global Times article noted in the very first line, they are also native to southern China, and the study itself pointed to Yunnan as the likely origin of the coronavirus strain most closely matching that responsible for COVID-19.

Oddly, the Global Times story also ultimately acknowledges that all the samples came from Yunnan, despite choosing to hone in on the acknowledgement by the researchers that the same species of bats is present in other nearby countries.

Just last week, meanwhile, fellow state media outlet Xinhua ran a story of its own about Thai authorities testing bats for COVID-19 that fit snugly into the Southeast Asian bat theory alluded to in the Global Times.

On the whole, the coverage of the virus’ origins by Chinese state media hasn’t trafficked in outright falsehoods—after all, it is true that “the possibility cannot be ruled out” that the virus originated elsewhere. And others around the world, most notably U.S. President Donald Trump, have certainly not been above circulating other widely discredited conspiracy theories as to the virus’ origins. (Some Chinese officials haven't been above it either.)

Rather, Chinese media’s coverage appears to rely on scientists’ innate reluctance to make definitive statements in the absence of overwhelming evidence to create a counter-narrative deflecting attention away from China’s botched response to early indications of an outbreak.

In February, China’s top leadership was forced to acknowledge its own missteps, which included ordering one Chinese doctor who tried to warn of the disease late last year to stop making “false statements” and cease his “illegal activity.”

Not only did the revelations rattle the global community’s trust in China, they also proved vastly damaging to the Chinese Communist Party on the domestic front, something party leadership may now be trying to correct, according to Dr. Lee Jonghyuk from the China Programme at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

The Chinese Communist Party may be pursuing a strategy of “distraction and flooding.” That is, by inundating domestic readers with a ""massive amount of biased information,” it’s actually distracting the public from the ""actual target” of their dissatisfaction—in this case, the party itself.

The culpability of the government in the country’s first outbreak was a subject of rare open criticism among Chinese citizens, but rather than censoring debate about mishandling of the epidemic, it’s easier to redirect public debate towards the origins of the coronavirus—and to anywhere in the world but Wuhan and China, Lee told VICE News."
Here is a great read on the differences that make science as tool for understanding definitively superior to postmodern interpretations of the world.,http://areomagazine.com/2020/06/11/postmodernism-isnt-a-scourge-on-civil-society-its-just-a-pointless-indulgence/,"Postmodernism has taken some heat in recent years. Anyone with the capacity to say I don’t know who has taken a close look at it since it first emerged from mid-twentieth century France has considered it, at best, very silly, and some of them have bothered to say as much publicly.

Folks across the political and intellectual spectrum have sought to lay all sorts of crimes at the feet of this odd brand of gibberish. Everything from the rise of Donald Trump to the erosion of democratic order has been linked to the scourge of postmodern pedantry. I myself have joined in the abuse.

Practitioners have found their egos pricked. Understandably. For a variety of reasons, they have dedicated their lives to a field that relishes in obfuscation and obscurantism.

Anthropologist Stuart Chambers thinks the critics have got it all wrong. His defense of postmodernism is a well written piece, which eschews the tortuous linguistic gymnastics widely recognized as emblematic of postmodern thinking. Instead, Chambers makes his case in clear, simple prose. It inspired me to interrogate my own position. In clear, simple prose, Chambers makes a solid case for the idea that a lot of the criticism has been hyperbolic.

However, Chambers fundamentally mistakes the nature of the scientific process and, ultimately, fails to advance a convincing case that postmodernism is useful. While Lyotard and Barthes might not be among the four horsemen of the apocalypse, they have produced a body of work that can—relative to the basic aim of questioning assumptions about the world and finding out what is true—most charitably be described as worthless.

Objectivity, Crackpots and Science

Is science objective? The simplistic view is that science is the uncorrupted pursuit of unassailable truth. Most scientists, however, have spent enough time immersed in the messy, hardscrabble world of scientific practice to recognize that such a view is, at best, a caricature and, at worst, leads non-scientists to fundamentally mistake the nature and scope of the scientific enterprise.

Science is first and foremost a cultural phenomenon. Individual scientists are riddled with biases and blind spots. Their views are subtly influenced by their sociopolitical contexts. The scope of their thought and investigation is substantially curtailed by the limits of extant knowledge and technology, some of which might well be faulty. But science is also a structured in a way that imbues it with peculiar properties. It can produce mistakes, but, to a degree unmatched by any other discipline, it is uniquely designed to identify those mistakes. Though imperfect, science is—by a considerable margin—the most powerful knowledge-gaining mechanism humans have ever devised.

Many of those with an ideological axe to grind against science like to point out the historical flaws in scientific thought and the failings of individual scientists. Chambers bases the core of his critique on this approach. For him, the history of scientific racism belies any claim to objectivity. Blinkered by the prevailing wisdom of their times, plenty of nineteenth and early twentieth-century scientists saw race as part of the natural order—with white people at the top of the racial hierarchy.

But scientific racism was abandoned as scientists learned more about the world. The assumptions that inspired racist thought were undermined by improved understandings of human genetics and culture. Race science wasn’t cast into the colossal dustbin of failed ideas because critical studies scholars told scientists that they should question their assumptions—it was repudiated because the scientific enterprise itself revealed those assumptions to be untrue.

The same is true of Chambers’ other examples. Conversion therapy was tossed out—alongside that whole slippery mess folks call psychoanalysis—when it was recognized to be a pseudoscientific monstrosity. It is true that coalitions of doctors opposed physician-assisted suicide in Canada. Note here that, outside of research institutions, doctors are not engaged in the business of discovering or refining ideas about how the world works and are not, therefore, scientists. But, even if they were, that some individuals disguise their theological preferences as scientific reasoning is nothing new. This doesn’t undermine any claim to disciplinary objectivity. It simply restates the obvious: individual scientists are human beings and, like other human beings, they are sometimes wrong.

Why Science Is Special

Criticism of this sort is superficial. Chambers does not seem to know what science is or how it operates. This is understandable—few people do.

Most of us have been taught about something called the scientific method. It goes something like this: do a bit of research, form a hypothesis, perform an experiment, then check whether or not the results of your experiment match what you’d predict from your hypothesis. Someone who knows only this understands the scientific process roughly as well as someone who knows the basic elements of story—character, setting, plot, conflict—understands literature.

Science can never be fully understood without first recognizing that it is a process. Individual scientists participate in that process. They study for years until they are ready to keep up with the process as it currently stands. Then they hop in and try to contribute to science, perhaps by speeding things up or pointing them in a subtly different direction. Rarely, they’ll completely reorder an entire paradigm, sending their discipline in a completely new direction. Sometimes, they’ll even retard the process by stubbornly refusing to relinquish harebrained ideas. Whatever their contribution, all scientists eventually get old and retire or die, but the process continues, always seeking new evidence and rooting out conceptual errors. It never arrives at a final destination. Absolute certainty is nowhere to be found.

This is true even in the most robust sciences. In a mature science like physics, all theory is boiled down to the rigorous language of mathematics. That means that, when it is time to experiment, expectations can be expressed with extreme precision. To a degree, this makes the relationship between prediction and observation axiomatic: if a physicist has done her mathematics and calibrated her instruments correctly, a result can say something definitive about the theory it’s designed to interrogate: a result that deviates substantially from predicted values tells researchers that something is amiss. With highly corroborated and heavily mathematized theories, tolerances can get really tight, with p-values in the thousandth—or even billionth—decimal place.

But, even with a theory like general relativity, whose predictions have been tested and confirmed countless times, scientists still don’t claim to have discovered the final, unimpeachable description of space and time. In fact, most physicists will probably tell you that, at very vast or very tiny scales, the physics of general relativity is useless, if not entirely wrong. General relativity is one of the most successful theoretical frameworks ever devised, but it is not true beyond all doubt. There’s more reason to be confident in general relativity than there is to be confident about any of the comforting assumptions we use to get through the day—my spouse loves me, my job is secure, I’ll see my family again in the evening—but, in the strictest sense, it is not true beyond doubt.

All this uncertainty amplifies as you alter your level of description from that of the world of massive objects and elementary particles. At other levels of resolution—where things become looser, more dynamic and complicated—our picture of the world gets a whole lot fuzzier. By the time you get to the science of human behavior, things start getting incredibly messy.

For social and behavioral scientists, the sort of precision available to hard science seems almost unattainable. Provisionality here isn’t just a tacit understanding or a way of reconciling the tools we’ve got with the universe we inhabit. When it comes to questions about what people do and why they do it, even our best explanations are provisional. Psychologists, anthropologists and sociologists accept that the best that they can do will probably only result in a loose approximation of the full truth.

They forge ahead knowing that even their failures will be instructive. Science is all about asking are you sure? As David Hull argues—in line with earlier thinking by Imre Lakatos, Paul Thagard and Thomas Kuhn—the whole thing unfolds in a pseudo-Darwinian process. Scientists are embedded in incentive structures that reward them for poking holes in one another’s thinking, even if they are too biased to spot fatal weaknesses in their own output. Scientists work toward a shared goal—to build or discover increasingly faithful descriptions of and explanations for the world we inhabit—within a complex environment of competition and cooperation.

What Is Postmodernism Good For?

Science is an imperfect and sometimes clumsy process. Entire disciplines can be temporarily misled or even completely derailed by cultural biases that individual researchers fail to spot. Fortunately, the process of scientific discovery prevents erroneous thinking from remaining hidden for long. Misguided schools of thought are always eventually identified and discarded. Not because cultural critics tell scientists they are on the wrong track, but because the process of scientific discovery is remarkably adept at continually asking itself are you sure? and rooting out rotten ideas.

Nothing like this can take place in the world of postmodernism. Because postmodernists reject the idea of a final arbiter, such as a universally accessible and ultimately knowable reality against which claims can be evaluated, when postmodernists ask themselves are you sure? they can never really know the answer. Postmodernism lacks an anchor point for error correction. As a result, it is fundamentally illegitimate—and ultimately pointless—as an intellectual enterprise. It is, at best, a self-perpetuating indulgence, ostensibly doing the work scientific disciplines naturally do on their own.

But, while good scientists always strive to make their work both useful and intelligible to a world beyond their native disciplines, postmodernists and critical studies enthusiasts are perpetually engaged in a convoluted, circular performance for the like-minded. They play what appears to be an esoteric and sophisticated game, which, on closer inspection, turns out to be hide and seek—with a rulebook written in High Elvish and riddled with redundancies, contradictions and extraneous passages.

In repudiating the notion that truths are fixed for eternity, postmodernism denies itself the capacity to course correct. Its students may pay lip service to the crude notion that some truths are better than others. But, without recourse to something universal and knowable outside their individual and social contexts, they’ll never be able to tell which truths those are.

This is true even for conditional facts and the explanations they feed. Many realities are highly conditional. The idea of human rights, for example, is a relatively recent invention, which emerged in a specific cultural and historical context. That doesn’t mean that the value and consequences of the idea aren’t open to careful empirical evaluation, even if the idea itself might morph and expand over time. However, without recourse to something universal and knowable—something that can be accessed, shared and understood, despite the influence of cultural context and individual personality—such a reckoning becomes impossible.

Postmodernism has yet to state any epistemological footing or methodological toolkit that gives it special license as a way of asking, are you sure? There’s nothing to suggest it is a useful approach. Scores upon scores of essays have advanced the field no further than the principles articulated by René Descartes 380 years ago, in the opening chunk of his Meditations on First Philosophy. Postmodernism has nothing to offer that improves upon reflection, reason and dialogue—tools fully accessible to everyone, even if they’ve never cracked open a work by Foucault or Derrida or occupied a university position. Identifying what postmodernism is good for is incredibly tricky. From the outside, that entire school of thinkers looks like a bunch of naked emperors arguing over who has the best outfit.

Ways of Knowing Versus Ways of Confusing

Science recognizes that our understanding of truth is conditional, approximate and uncertain, but that it rests on the fundamental, commonsensical and thoroughly parsimonious contention that truths exist and that we can, with practice, use the data provided by our senses to tell when we’ve got a little closer to them. Biological evolution is not a conditional truth. Our conception of it may grow and change as we come to understand more about how it works, but the process itself is a non-negotiable fact of the natural universe. The same is true of fundamental physics. F=MA will remain a valid description of the way material objects behave, regardless of how society shifts and changes.

What we need to ask ourselves is not whether science is a perfectly objective machine for generating irrefutable truths. It isn’t. No scientist worthy of the name would argue otherwise. The real questions are: is science more objective than other methods?; is it better at describing and explaining observations than other methods?; and does it get closer to objective truth than other methods? The answer to all of the above is a resounding yes!

There’s no room for serious debate on this point. When we seek to treat or cure a disease, do we turn to the Pope? When we want to put a satellite into orbit or a human on the moon, do we consult critical studies professors? When we want to investigate the high energy world of elementary particles, do we pour over the wisdom of ancient mystics? When we want to develop alternatives to burning hydrocarbons for energy—or get a sense of what will happen if we don’t—do we give funding to postmodern scholars?

Individual scientists are not perfectly objective. They apply an often ad hoc, continuously evolving assemblage of imperfect methods to their pursuit of truth. But they are constantly asking themselves and each other, are you sure?—and the fundamental structure of the scientific process makes them better at both asking and answering that question than anyone else. Their enterprise demands humility before the unknown as its basic entry requirement. Scientists work at the frontiers of knowledge, knowing full well they may never make any headway.

As Richard Feynman put it, “science is the belief in the ignorance of experts … the first principle is not to fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.” Science is about setting a community of very smart people the task of figuring out what is true and holding their feet to the fire. This last task is easier said than done, but it ultimately boils down to comparing scientific ideas to the observable world and asking whether or not they hold up. With science, we take a good look at how we think the world works and ask ourselves, are you sure?

The history of science has been one long series of debunking assumptions. We take many scientific truths for granted today, but very few of science’s robust explanations are intuitively obvious or self-evident. The earth is 4.6 billion years old. The landmasses we inhabit are cosmically ephemeral and constantly moving. All known life is derived from a single common ancestor, which lived more than 3.5 billion years ago. Time is not a physical constant, but speeds up or slows down according to the relative motion of observers. The universe is almost unfathomably ancient, and everything in it was once compressed into a single dense, hot singularity. Everything—including us—is made up of a modest handful of elementary fields and particles. The behavior of those particles is probabilistic. Objects we interact with on a daily basis are, like us, mostly empty space. All scientific progress has come from asking ourselves are you sure? and bravely admitting that no, we are not.

Science is not a perfect method for finding the truth. But it is the only method we have for getting anywhere close to it. Postmodernism, on the other hand, is just a way of getting paid to churn out badly written academic essays that no one who doesn’t also call herself a postmodernist will ever read."

"Finally, some good news",http://cnet.com/news/murder-hornet-munchies-the-horrifying-insect-makes-a-tasty-treat/,"Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET

News of insects nicknamed murder hornets invading the US might feel like the plot to a horror film, but maybe you'll feel better knowing the pests make for a tasty snack.

The Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia) is described as 1.5 inches to 2 inches long with an orange-yellow head and black stripes on its abdomen. The stinger is long enough to poke through protective beekeeper suits, and kills up to 50 people a year in Japan alone.

Yes, the large hornets have been spotted in the Pacific Northwest, most notably Washington State, but that doesn't mean residents of the area are doomed. The Asian giant hornet is apparently considered a delicacy in its native Japan. If you can't beat them, eat them?

People living in the central Chubu region of Japan so love eating the murder hornets -- as well as wasps and bees -- they throw an edible-wasp festival every year.

The murder hornets' bodies are light and crunchy, and ""leave a warming, tingling sensation when eaten,"" according to a New York Times piece on Tuesday. It's worth noting that eating insects is nothing new. People have been chowing down on insects for centuries. Even the philosopher Aristotle enjoyed munching on cicada larvae.

The Asian giant hornet larvae are often steamed with rice to make a traditional dish called hebo-gohan -- also called hachinoko gohan. Chefs also place the dead Asian giant hornets (stingers included) on a skewer and grill them over hot coals.

Not only do these large hornets make for an interesting snack, they also add pizzazz to liquor. Live Asian giant hornets (and sometimes wasps) are drowned in a clear distilled beverage called shochu. When the hornets drown, they release their venom into the liquid.

The mixture is sealed in a container and left to ferment for a few years until the shochu turns a dark amber color. This allows the venom to dilute so it doesn't send any future drinkers to the hospital.

Mixing the murder hornet shochu in with cocktails creates a buzz, so to speak. A bee-themed bar in Fukuoka, Japan, called Suzumebachi serves the hornet-infused booze to locals and tourists alike. According to one journalist who tried the unusual giant hornet drink, it tasted ""ashy in flavor, almost like sipping on charcoal.""

While foodies in Japan might enjoy seeking out murder hornet nests for snacks and cocktails, it's worth noting that the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) doesn't advocate approaching these deadly pests, which were officially spotted in Washington in December.

The WSDA warns to ""use extreme caution near Asian giant hornets. The stinger of the Asian giant hornet is longer than that of a honeybee and the venom is more toxic than any local bee or wasp. If you find a colony, do not attempt to remove or eradicate it. Report it to WSDA (or your local state's department of agriculture) immediately."""
"People overwhelmingly chose to be generous to others -- even to strangers, and even when it seems one motivation to help might crowd out another. It is the first study to examine how all the established motivations to be generous interact with one another.",http://news.osu.edu/people-try-to-do-right-by-each-other-no-matter-the-motivation-study-finds/,"People want to help each other, even when it costs them something, and even when the motivations to help don’t always align, a new study suggests.

In research published today in the journal Science Advances, sociologists found that people overwhelmingly chose to be generous to others – even to strangers, and even when it seems one motivation to help might crowd out another.

It is the first study to examine how all the established motivations to be generous interact with one another.

“We wanted to do an exhaustive study to see what the effects of those motivations would be when combined – because they are combined in the real world, where people are making choices about how generous or kind to be with one another,” said David Melamed, lead author of the study and an associate professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. Melamed is also affiliated with Ohio State’s Translational Data Analytics Institute.

The study involved more than 700 people, and was designed to help researchers understand prosocial behavior.

“It means doing something for someone else at a cost to yourself,” Melamed said. “So one example would be paying for the person behind you’s order at the coffee shop. Or right now, wearing your mask in public. It’s a cost to you; it’s uncomfortable. But you contribute to the public good by wearing it and not spreading the virus.”

Scientists previously had determined that four motivators influenced people to behave in a way that benefited other people.

One: The recipient of a kindness is inclined to do something nice for the giver in return. Two: A person is motivated to do something nice to someone that she saw be generous to a third person. Three: A person is likely to do good in the presence of people in their network who might reward their generosity. And four: A person is likely to “pay it forward” to someone else if someone has done something nice for her.

Those four motivators had all been studied isolated from one another, and some had been studied as a pair. But until this experiment, scientists had not conducted a comprehensive study about how the four motivators might affect one another in the real world, where the motivation to be kind to others might be influenced by multiple factors.

“In the real world, the conditions under which people are nice to each other are not isolated – people are embedded in their networks, and they’re going about their daily lives and coming into contact with things that will affect their decisions,” Melamed said. “And these experiments show that all the motivations work. If you want to maximize prosocial behavior, it was a really great thing to see.”

For this study, which was done online, participants had to decide how much of a 10-point endowment to give to other people. The points had monetary value to the participants; giving cost them something.

Then the researchers created different scenarios that combined one or all four of the potential motivators for giving.

Melamed said that prior to the experiment, he thought the motivations for kindness might crowd one another out.

For example, a person may be less apt to indirectly reward another’s generosity toward a third person when he is focused on directly giving back help that he received.

“People have a self-bias,” he said. “If you do something nice for me, I may weigh that more than if I see you do something nice for someone else. But we found that all the motivators still show up as predictors of how much a person is willing to give to someone else, regardless of how the differing motivators are combined.”

This research helps us understand the remarkable quantity and diversity of prosocial behavior we see in humans, Melamed said.

“From an evolutionary perspective, it’s kind of perplexing that it even exists, because you’re decreasing your own fitness on behalf of others,” Melamed said. “And yet, we see it in bees and ants, and humans and throughout all of nature.”"
S&P 500 Index's rally in the last 50 days is greatest ever,http://cnbc.com/2020/06/03/this-is-the-greatest-50-day-rally-in-the-history-of-the-sp-500.html,"The S&P 500 has returned 37.7% over the last 50 trading days, making it the benchmark index's largest 50-day rally in history, according to LPL Financial.

And if history is any indication, there could be more gains ahead.

Looking at the other largest 50-day rallies, the firm found that stocks were higher 100% of the time six and 12 months later. The average 6-month return was 10.2%, while the average 1-year return was 17.3%.

The firm crunched the data going back to 1957, which is when the index moved to a 500-stock model.

The S&P 500 has steadily climbed higher after dropping to an intraday low of 2,191.86 on March 23 — putting to an end the longest bull market in history — as Covid-19 battered global markets. The benchmark index is now 41.7% above that low, and less than 9% from its February all-time high level.

A number of factors have contributed to the rapid run higher.

For one, the government and Federal Reserve have stepped in in a big way. In March, President Donald Trump signed into law a record $2 trillion federal stimulus package known as the CARES Act, while the Federal Reserve has said that it will engage in unlimited asset purchases."
The Best Trump Can Do Now Is to Do Nothing,http://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/trump-riots-leadership-bunker.html,"Over the weekend, as protests brought on by Minneapolis police officers’ killing of George Floyd turned into nightly violent clashes between police and demonstrators, President Donald Trump had little to offer. The metaphors weren’t subtle: He fled to the White House bunker for a spell; the White House went dark. The president’s decision to do, essentially, nothing wasn’t an oversight. It was the product of a cost-benefit analysis by Trump and his senior White House staff, who know their man.

“Trump and some of his advisers calculated that he should not speak to the nation because he had nothing new to say and had no tangible policy or action to announce yet, according to a senior administration official,” the Washington Post reported. “Evidently not feeling an urgent motivation Sunday to try to bring people together, he stayed silent.”

Trump’s advisers could only keep him silent—or limited to a few unhelpful tweets a day, at least—for so long. The problem with keeping Trump silent as a deliberate strategy is that it means the news will treat him as a secondary actor, a status that Trump is psychologically incapable of permitting for more than a few hours. He became president, after all, to ensure the news centered on him. So, on Monday morning, he reinserted himself into the center of the news by pressing his one available crisis-response button, provocation, during a call with governors and national security officials.

“You have to dominate,” Trump said on the call, recordings of which were shared with countless reporters before it had even concluded. “If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you. You’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.” He told the governors that “most of you are weak,” and that “you have to arrest people, and you have to try people, and they have to go jail for long periods of time.” He went on a side rant encouraging the governors to pass laws banning flag burning.

This sentence could have been written at any point since 2017, but it seems important to emphasize it today: The United States is, somehow, going to have to make it until at least Jan. 20, 2021, under a situation in which the elected leader, in the best-case scenario, just keeps quiet and, in the average- to worst-case scenario, creates more trouble.

Trump gave a national Oval Office address to the country early in the coronavirus outbreak. Either he or his advisers got the unfortunate idea in their head that anything he said could “calm” the nation. It was a disaster, during which he made significant policy errors that sent people into a panic, when all he had to do was read. The administration had more success when it would launder its leadership responsibilities through capable civil servants, like Anthony Fauci. But Trump couldn’t allow Fauci, or Deborah Birx, or even Mike Pence to have the spotlight for too long, and repeatedly big-footed precious moments of calm by picking fights with governors, who had temporarily filled the political leadership void, or pushing untested medical remedies. The coronavirus crisis is very much ongoing, the president rarely speaks with Fauci anymore, and unemployment is in the double digits for the foreseeable future. The country might need leadership, but the best it can hope for is presidential silence.

The country needs leadership following the death of George Floyd and the ensuing protests, riots, and police provocation. Leadership in this case is someone who can speak to all viewpoints and convince everyone to work on a productive way forward. This isn’t easy, but neither is being president, and it’s why we used to try to vet presidents to detect in them the qualities necessary to do the job. The best our current president was able to offer—and I do mean that, it was his best possible offering, and he should have stuck to it—was nothing. It was hiding in the White House bunker and going dark. Either stay down there or set up a tee time, truly. These are the United States’ best options for surviving the next seven months (and four years, potentially) whenever moments requiring the president to act as president arise.

This is not even a personal criticism of Donald Trump, or some fleeting hope that he can show something he previously has not shown. He is wired the way he is, and he cannot change. Asking Trump to step up and provide leadership in a moment of crisis is like asking a banana peel to step up and fly to the Moon. No one even expects him to try. The absence of leadership has always been part of Trump’s presidency, but it’s being felt most acutely in Year Four, when there are presently multiple reasons for many, many Americans to feel endangered walking out their front doors and living their lives. Trump isn’t capable of making any of this better, only worse, so please—please—don’t ask him to try."

Show Caption Hide Caption Coronavirus: Survivors who fought for their lives share their stories These individuals, from six to 95-year-old, fought the coronavirus and won.

EASTON, Mass. – Shelley Gunn describes her Polish grandmother, Jennie Stejna, as having a feisty spirit. Stejna certainly displayed that spirit as the 103-year-old woman recently survived a bout with the coronavirus.

Three weeks ago, Gunn said Stejna was the first to test positive for coronavirus in her nursing home. She had a low-grade fever and was moved to a separate ward.

Stejna didn’t really grasp or understand COVID-19, Gunn said, but did know she was very ill. Gunn said there was always a staff member by her side.

As Stejna’s condition worsened, Gunn said they called to say what they thought were their final goodbyes. She thanked Stejna for everything she had done for her. When Shelley's husband, Adam Gunn, asked whether Stejna was ready to go to heaven, she replied, “Hell yes.”

But on May 13, Gunn said she got good news — Stejna had recovered.

“This feisty old Polish grandmother of ours officially beat the coronavirus,” Adam Gunn, said.

“We’re truly very thankful.”

The staff gave Stejna an ice cold Bud Light to celebrate, something she loved but hadn’t had in a long time, Gunn said.

Stejna was the first resident in the nursing home to recover. They still have 33 cases of coronavirus, Gunn said.

Stejna has lived all her life in Massachusetts. Her husband, Teddy, died in 1992 at age 82. Married in 1938, they were together for 54 years.

She was an avid bingo player, enjoyed reading and loved to crochet until she got arthritis. Gunn said she has quite a few blankets Stejna made. She is also a “hardcore Boston sports fan.”

“She used to sit outside and listen to the Red Sox on the radio,” Gunn said.

Stejna has two children, three grandchildren, four great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren, Gunn said.

CDC: COVID-19 Does Not Spread Easily By Contaminated Surfaces! Woohoo!,http://flagstaffbusinessnews.com/cdc-covid-19-does-not-spread-easily-by-contaminated-surfaces/,"For those of you still wiping down groceries and packages amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, breathe a sigh of relief: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now says the novel virus “does not spread easily” from “touching surfaces or objects” — but experts warn that doesn’t mean it’s no longer necessary to take “practical and realistic” precautions in stopping the spread of COVID-19.

Though it’s not exactly clear when, the federal health agency appears to have recently changed its guidelines from early March that simply said it “may be possible” to spread the virus from contaminated surfaces. The CDC now includes “surfaces or objects” under a section that details ways in which the coronavirus does not readily transmit.

Other ways in which the virus does not easily spread is from animals to people, or from people to animals, the federal agency said on its updated page.

“COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads. It may be possible for COVID-19 to spread in other ways, but these are not thought to be the main ways the virus spreads,” said the CDC.

The CDC did, however, remind citizens that the virus does mainly spread person-to-person, noting the virus that causes a COVID-19 infection, SARS-CoV-2, “is spreading very easily and sustainably between people.”

More specifically, the agency said the virus primarily spreads from person-to-person in the following ways:

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within 6 feet)

Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs

COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms

The change comes after a preliminary study from March suggested that the novel coronavirus can remain in the air for up to three hours, and live on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to three days, prompting many to take to wiping down packages and other items. However, at the time, the study was yet not peer-reviewed, and did not determine if people could be infected from touching certain surfaces analyzed.

Dr. John Whyte, the chief medical officer for the healthcare website WebMD, called the CDC’s changes an “important step in clarifying how the virus is spread, especially as we gain new information.”

“It also may help reduce anxiety and stress. Many people were concerned that by simply touching an object they may get coronavirus and that’s simply not the case. Even when a virus may stay on a surface, it doesn’t mean that it’s actually infectious,” Whyte told Fox News.

“I think this new guideline helps people understand more about what does and doesn’t increase risk. It doesn’t mean we stop washing hands and disinfecting surfaces. But it does allow us to be practical and realistic as we try to return to a sense of normalcy,” he added.

Dr. William Schaffner, the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, echoed Whyte.

“The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person (within about 6 feet). Person-to-person contact is a highway. Touching infected surfaces are little paths, but they don’t carry the big viral traffic,” he told Fox News. “To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the safest thing is to continue social distancing, wear masks, and wash hands frequently and thoroughly.”

Indeed, the CDC on its updated page reiterated important steps to take to prevent exposure to the virus. Maintaining a “good social distance,” (keeping 6 feet away from others while in public), as well as washing hands often and “routinely” cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces were listed as key precautions.

The news comes after The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in mid-April issued a statement saying that there’s no need to wipe down food packaging after you’ve returned home from the grocery store.

“We want to reassure consumers that there is currently no evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19,” the FDA said at the time."
Joe Biden Looked Good in His Mask,http://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/joe-biden-looked-good-in-his-mask.html,"A recent Washington Post–University of Maryland poll showed that 80 percent of Americans believe it’s “necessary” at the moment to wear a mask if you’re going to come in close contact with strangers. The other 20 percent, though, has proved to be a very vocal minority.

While some object to wearing masks because they believe the entire pandemic is a Bill Gates lizard-people conspiracy, the most common case they make is that covering your face expresses fear and weakness and that real American macho men don’t admit that they’re afraid (of spreading a deadly virus). There is some logic to this. It wasn’t “cool” to wear a bike helmet in junior high in 1995—maybe it is now, I don’t know what kids do, I’m 160 years old—because it showed you were still being coddled and controlled by your parents and that you were not committed to seeking the extremes of human experience. Wearing a mask in 2020 is an acknowledgment that you respect the advice and expertise of epidemiologists, and for some of our American brothers and sisters, acknowledging the authority of anyone besides Ted Nugent demonstrates “beta” status.

On Monday, Joe Biden wore a mask, pictured above, to attend a Memorial Day event in Delaware. While a few right-wing contrarians suggested otherwise, even many of those who have been less than enthusiastic about the Biden campaign felt that the the accessory created a “look” that was not just safe and responsible but outright sharp and commanding. For Biden, putting on the mask turned out to be an “alpha” move.

Why does it work for him? A few possibilities:

• Thanks to the Trump administration, the sight of an authority figure meeting even the most basic standards of appropriateness now registers, perversely, as a guerrilla-like act of iconoclasm. This is why some people have somehow found themselves sexually attracted to Andrew Cuomo.

• Standard hospital masks are white or light blue, which matches well with hospital scrubs, but not necessarily with outfits worn in nonmedical settings. Biden, however, has chosen a color that goes with the rest of his outfit. He’s also wearing it pulled tightly across his face, which matches the trim cut of his suit. Black is also a color generally associated with power, as demonstrated by the SUV behind him. And it resonates with the badass persona of the Onion’s Joe Biden character, who, e.g., uses the White House driveway to polish his Trans Am.

• Masks are a personal safety item, which means that, like the aviator shades that the presumptive Democratic nominee is also wearing, they’re often used by physically courageous individuals in dangerous situations. Bank robbers and Navy SEALs use masks to do their jobs, but the CEOs of golf resorts don’t.

• By sealing the Democratic nomination, Biden became the singular vessel for the hopes of every American voter who would like Donald Trump removed from office. There are two statistically significant possibilities for what will happen in November: Either Biden will win or Trump will. The brains of the many millions of people who believe that it is imperative to achieve the first outcome are biased toward perceiving anything he does, even something as simple as wearing a mask, as evidence of his superiority as a leader.

"Stronger than aluminum, a heavily altered wood cools passively | Boiled in hydrogen peroxide and compressed, the wood can passively manage heat.",http://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/chemically-treated-wood-could-send-excess-heat-to-space/,"Most of our building practices aren't especially sustainable. Concrete production is a major source of carbon emissions, and steel production is very resource intensive. Once completed, heating and cooling buildings becomes a major energy sink. There are various ideas on how to handle each of these issues, like variations on concrete's chemical formula or passive cooling schemes.

But now, a large team of US researchers has found a single solution that appears to manage everything using a sustainable material that both reflects sunlight and radiates away excess heat. The miracle material? Wood. Or a form of wood that has been treated to remove one of its two main components.

With the grain

Wood is mostly a composite of two polymers. One of these, cellulose, is made by linking sugars together into long chains. That cellulose is mixed with a polymer called lignin, which is not really a single polymer. The precise chemical formula of its starting material can vary among species, and it typically contains multiple places where chemical bonds can form, turning the polymer into a chaotic but extremely robust mesh.

Lignin creates a lot of problems for biofuels production, since its variability makes it difficult to digest (cellulose, by contrast, can be broken down into simple sugars given time). But lignin provides a toughness to wood that cellulose alone wouldn't.

Or at least cellulose wouldn't in its native form in wood. The new chemical treatment essentially removes the lignin from wood. The precise nature of the process isn't mentioned in the paper, which suggested it might be nightmarishly complex or involve extremely toxic chemicals. But a check of the supplemental material shows that the process involves dumping the wood in concentrated hydrogen peroxide and boiling it. While I wouldn't want to drink boiling, concentrated hydrogen peroxide, it's not an especially difficult chemical to handle safely.

Based on the description of lignin, you'd expect the resulting wood would be weaker. But the chemically treated wood is then compressed. With no cells or lignin to keep them apart, the many oxygen/hydrogen groups that hang off sugars are free to interact with each other, creating a dense hydrogen bonding mesh. This ultimately makes the material much stronger than wood (though the researchers don't compare its strength to that of pressure-treated lumber, which is also stronger than untreated wood).

There are myriad ways to measure toughness: resistance to bending, stretching, impacts, etc. The researchers measured a number of these, and the modified wood came out ahead of untreated wood by large margins—anywhere from three to 10 times wood's value. Strikingly, for at least one of these measures (tensile strength), it edged out some types of steel and titanium. All of which means that it should be possible to use this material in places where wood wouldn't normally be considered.

It’s cool stuff

But rather than simply being structurally useful, the wood has some properties that could make it extremely useful as cladding, covering the exterior of a building. While most of the cellulose fibers are aligned along the grain of the wood, that alignment is very rough—there's plenty of variability in their orientation. That means light that strikes the processed wood will bounce around within a dense mesh of cellulose fibers, scattering widely in the process. The end result is a material that looks remarkably white, in the same way a sugar cube looks white even though each sugar crystal in it is transparent.

As a result, the material is really bad at absorbing sunlight, and thus it doesn't capture the heat in the same way regular wood does.

But it gets better. The sugars in cellulose are effective emitters of infrared radiation, and they do so in two areas of the spectrum where none of our atmospheric gases is able to reabsorb it. The end result is that, if the treated wood absorbs some of the heat of a structure, wood can radiate it away so that it leaves the planet entirely. And the wood is able to do so even while it's being blasted by direct sunlight; the researchers confirmed this by putting a small heater inside a box made of the treated wood and then sticking it in the sunlight in Arizona.

In the heat of the day, a square meter of the wood could radiate away about 16W of power. At night, that figure shot up to 63W, for a 24-hour average of 53 Watts per square meter. At mid-day, if there was no source of heat in the box, its ambient temperature was over 4°C lower than the surrounding air. This is all the result of the fact that the treated wood emits energy in the infrared more efficiently than it absorbs energy in the visible wavelengths.

Around the country

What could this do for a building? To find out, the researchers used a model of a typical apartment building that included sources of heat like lights and occupants and tracked radiative heat transfer using ray tracing. They then placed the building in 16 different US cities and tracked its energy balance over the course of a year using historic weather data. In cities in the West and South, like Atlanta, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, the material cut down on the amount of energy needed for cooling considerably.

The researchers estimate that covering an apartment building with the treated wood could save about 35 percent of the energy used for cooling. In a dense urban setting, that number goes up to over half. Plus, it also has the strength to handle some of the internal structure of the building. And while forestry can create environmental issues, it is certainly possible to manage it in a way that is sustainable.

All of which makes the wood—the researchers refer to it as ""cooling wood""—a very promising looking material. So it's no surprise to see that three of the team members behind the new paper have a patent out to commercialize the tech.

There are positive early results from Moderna's coronavirus vaccine trial,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/18/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna-early-results/index.html,"(CNN) Volunteers who received Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine had positive early results, according to the biotech company, which partnered with the National Institutes of Health to develop the vaccine.

If future studies go well, the company's vaccine could be available to the public as early as January, Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer, told CNN.

""This is absolutely good news and news that we think many have been waiting for for quite some time,"" Zaks said.

These early data come from the Phase 1 clinical trial, which typically studies a small number of people and focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and elicits an immune response.



The results of the study, which was led by the National Institutes of Health, have not been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of eight developers worldwide doing human clinical trials with a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization . Two others, Pfizer and Inovio, are also in the United States, one is at the University of Oxford in Britain, and four are in China.

Moderna has vaccinated dozens of study participants and measured antibodies in eight of them. All eight developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus at levels reaching or exceeding the levels seen in people who've naturally recovered from Covid-19, according to the company.

Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus, disabling it from attacking human cells.

""We've demonstrated that these antibodies, this immune response, can actually block the virus,"" Zaks said. ""I think this is a very important first step in our journey towards having a vaccine.""

A vaccine specialist who is not involved in Moderna's work said the company's results are ""great.""

""It shows that not only did the antibody bind to the virus, but it prevented the virus from infecting the cells,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the NIH panel that's setting a framework for vaccine studies in the US.



While the vaccine had promising results in the lab, it's not known if it will protect people in the real world. The US Food and Drug Administration has cleared the company to begin Phase 2 trials, which typically involve several hundred of people, and Moderna plans to start large-scale clinical trials, known as Phase 3 trials, in July. These typically involve tens of thousands of people.

Offit said before the pandemic, vaccine developers would usually test out their product in thousands of people before moving on to Phase 3, but said Moderna is ""extremely unlikely"" to have vaccinated that many by July, since they've only vaccinated dozens so far.

He said it makes sense to Moderna to move into Phase 3 without vaccinating that many people, given that Covid-19 is killing thousands of people each day.

""This is a different time,"" Offit said.

In January, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it would take about 12 to 18 months to get a vaccine on the market. Zaks said he agreed with that estimate for Moderna's vaccine, putting a delivery date somewhere between January and June of next year.

In the Moderna study, three participants developed fever and other flu-like symptoms when they received the vaccine at a dose of 250 micrograms. Moderna anticipates the Phase 3 study on dosage will be between 25 and 100 micrograms.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

So far, the Moderna study subjects who were vaccinated even at 25 and 100 micrograms achieved antibody levels similar to or even higher than people who naturally became infected with coronavirus.

But it's not clear whether natural infection confers immunity to re-infection, and so similarly it's not clear whether vaccination confers immunity.

""That's a good question, and the truth is, we don't know that yet,"" Zaks said. ""We are going to have to conduct formal efficacy trials where you vaccinate many, many people, and then you monitor them in the ensuing months to make sure they don't get sick."""
I'm not sure if this belongs here but I found it inspiring. My writer just made 7 months sober and wrote about her struggles fighting her alcohol addiction. I'm immensely proud of her and I wanted to share her accomplishments.,http://anextraordinarylife.online/lifestyle/road-to-recovery,"I moved in with two females who were in their twenties. Although I didn’t know much about them, we did get really close, really fast. We did everything together. We shopped, we watched television series, we went to concerts, we cooked meals, we traveled, but most importantly we drank...and we liked it. It felt as if every weekend after a long shift we were out with friends and coworkers. After a long night out, I’d show up to work countless times hungover, and one time I arrived at work still drunk and it is not something I am proud of. I’ve done many things while intoxicated that I am not proud of. While living in this house, even though I lived with other people, there were nights I was home alone, and I continued to drink by myself. It got to the point where I felt as if I had to have a glass of wine with dinner and a cocktail while doing homework. On the night of October 5, 2019, my coworkers and I were at a local bar and after it closed, some of us decided to go back to our house to hang out. I continued to drink and the next thing I knew I was on my dining room floor listening to music and crying. My friend asked me what’s wrong and I said, “I feel like 2017 Morgan.” He then told me it’s time for me to go to bed, it was 4 a.m. after all.

I proceeded to tell him I was perfectly fine with sleeping on my dining room floor. I then blacked out and woke up in my bed the next morning. I rolled out of bed, hopped in the shower, got dressed for work, and headed out the door with a mean hangover. When I got to work, the friend who was with me that night checked up on me and told me I got up from the dining room floor around 6 a.m. and went to my bed. I do not remember doing so. I shook my head and teared up because I was tired of feeling this way and using alcohol to cope with all of my underlying mental issues. I had another friend who noticed me being hungover all the time and mentioned that she had been sober for two years.

I decided on October 6, 2019, to get sober. To this day, I have not had a drop of alcohol. I am seven months sober and could not be more blessed. I am able to focus more on the good things in life. I mended my relationship with my higher power whom I call God the Universe, and He guides me every day in my recovery. I am able to see things I have never seen before with a clearer mind. I can face my problems without having to reach for a bottle and drown my perception. Being sober has taught me that the universe is not against me and it wants the best for me. Since being sober, I have written articles, short stories, poetry, and even started on a book. God knew I needed to get sober in order to continue on the path that has been written for me. In my recovery, I have been able to express my feelings and not be scared. I have helped other individuals struggling with addiction. I am not ashamed to be sober, because this is the path that has been intended for me to help others in their struggles. I can tell you that things have been much better, and I have the biggest support system. I have not been ridiculed or belittled for my sobriety, I have only been accepted and welcomed with open arms. If you or someone you know is struggling with alcoholism or addiction, do not be afraid.

The 10 Best Books About Donald Goddamn Trump,http://medium.com/@ReviewsAudio/the-10-best-books-about-donald-goddamn-trump-c9a9e17358d8?sk=508b91562d752b02d2d66fb5c07eecb0,"I’m not sure what is wrong with us all but the last three years when we should have been working to improve ourselves and help those around us, we’ve been obsessed with anything and everything Donald Trump.

Four years ago I wanted to know everything I could about him. Where his money came from, where he came from, what he was like as a boss, what he’s like as a person, hell, I ever read Stormy Daniels book to try and find out what he was like in bed! Of course I read The Art of the Deal and pre-election bios like TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald but quickly moved into the deep analysis with books like, It’s Even Worse Than You Think and gobbled up books like, Collusion the day they came out.

At first it was out of fear. I was scared of what Trump would do to the country. The second half of November 2016 I was sure nuclear war was on the immediate horizon. The obviousness of his incompetency grew and so did my concerns. As I learned more about the man behind the big red button and my early unfounded fears became very much founded.

I don’t think of myself as “pro” or “anti” Trump but I do recognize him to be a threat to democracy around the world and no less than an economic terrorist. He is a self-centered histrionic and pathological liar who can only see the world from his own perspective. That is just about the most dangerous type of person to have in any position of power (or be married to).

All these books later Trump still scares the hell out of me but the fear has transformed into a more mundane cynicism about society and America. In short, we suck. DJT is the lowest of the low and here are ten of the best books that seem to best describe and illustrate the man and his administration.

The TL:DR list.

1. A Warning

2. It’s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America

3. Everything Trump Touches Dies: A Republican Strategist Gets Real About the Worst President Ever

4. Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House

I have read dozens of Trump books the last few years and by far, A Warning is the most important and influential one I’ve read yet.

Anonymous did what Omarosa and Andrew McCabe should have done with their voices of reason from inside the White House. I had high hopes for Omarosa’s book which unfortunately turned out to be a complete flop. However, Anonymous seems to have actually had the attention of Donald Trump at least for some time and reveals what it was like to work directly under him.

Omarosa on the other hand offered little more than what we’ve seen on the nightly news.

A Warning, the book, is exactly that, a warning from within the “deep state” itself.

If you want to know anything about Donald Trump and the inner workings of his mind and administration, A Warning is the one and only book you need to read. No other Trump book has done as good a job as identifying the problem and potential solutions. Every American should stop what they are doing and read or at least put this book at the very top of your to read list.

This book is number two because hands down, no journalist knows Donald Trump better than David Cay Johnston. He has been following him since 1988. It’s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America goes inside the administration to show how the federal agencies that touch the lives of all Americans are being undermined. Here is just some of what you will learn:

The Wall. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto told President Trump that Mexico will never pay for the border wall. So, Trump is proposing putting a tariff on Mexican imports. But a tariff will simply raise the price of Mexican goods in the US, meaning American consumers will end up paying for the wall — if it ever gets built.

Climate Change. Welcome to the new EPA, run by Scott Pruitt, a lawyer who has spent much of his career trying to destroy the agency he now heads. Secrecy reigns at the new EPA because Pruitt meets with industry executives to find out which clean air and clean water provisions they most want to roll back, and keeps staffers in the dark to make sure these pro-pollution plans don’t leak prematurely.

The Kleptocracy. Under Donald Trump conflict of interest is passé. When Trump isn’t in Washington, he stays at one of his properties, where the taxpayers pick up the tab for staffers, Secret Service, and so on, all at full price. And back in Washington, everyone now knows that the Trump International Hotel is the only place to stay if you want to do business with the administration. Meanwhile sons Donald Jr. and Eric run an eyes-wide-open blind trust of Trump holdings to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest — but not the reality.

4.7 out of 5 stars 951 ratings

This was not a good book. So why is it at number 3? Because it was written by a longtime Republican strategist, political commentator and Daily Beast contributor, an “insider” so to speak. Rick Wilson delivers a seemingly honest, and almost comprehensive answer to the question we find ourselves asking most mornings: ‘What the hell is going on?’. Everything Trump Touches Dies gives more unvarnished truths about Donald Trump than anyone else in the American political establishment has offered. Wilson never holds back and mercilessly exposes the damage Trump has done to the country, to the Republican Party and to the conservative movement that has abandoned its principles for the worst President in American history.

4.0 out of 5 stars 11,285 ratings

I love these characters! They are impulsive, exciting, daring and most of all, a bunch of idiots, like watching the first or second season of Survivor when it was still good. If you keep up with the news cycle there is nothing new to surprise you in this insider account by author Michael Wolff. This is a fun and personal look into the workings of the Trump White House and the mind of the man himself where the bottom line seems to be that, really, there is just nothing there. When Kellyanne says that there is nothing going on with “the Russia stuff”, that is probably true, there is nothing going on with anything, everything in the Trump world is minute by minute, second by second, there is no plan, no goal because exactly 0 members of the Trump team ever though there was a chance they would win.

For me, this books is really just about how stupid an otherwise functioning human being can be and how many of them there are. By all accounts it is looking like about 30% of American’s have some mental disability, couple that with the electoral college, an epic amount of Republican gerrymandering and Russian Internet Trolls we are left with a commander in chief who seems to not be fully literate and thinks that global warming is a Chinese hoax. There is nothing good or interesting going on with this administration, they bumble from one crisis to the next with no short term memory and a general aim of just doing the opposite of whatever the last President did. My personal opinion is that Trump is bad but not nearly as bad as Bush II was and for all his faults Trump comes off as a nothing President who is probably just going to fade away (I hope). If his handlers were to lose control of him, Trump may end up being the worst thing to ever happen to this country but for now, this was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone with the extra time to “get to know” our 45 President.

Another book that is on this list not so much because of what is written about but because of who wrote it. By the time Comey was fired we all knew what was going on and this book does nothing than to give another perspective to the same shit show we were all watching.

The book is written in a very clear and lucid style. Comey’s narrative is easy to follow and for the most part humble and believable. He definitely faced more agonizing decisions during the late months of the presidential campaign than most people will face in a lifetime, mostly due to the imbroglio surrounding Hillary Clinton’s e-mails. And life didn’t get any easier once Trump took office. The closing chapters of the book stand out as an important telling of seminal events in US history. His meetings and interactions with the new president were carefully documented. Comey clearly sensed the darkness that had descended on the country, and he struggled with the dishonesty emanating daily from the White House.

This was by far my personal favorite Trump Book. I loved it because more than any other it really captured who Trump IS. Nothing is this book was clouded by the nonsense electioneering for 2015 and 2016. It is the most honest look at Trump that I have read.

Timothy L. O’Brien was granted unprecedented access, traveled across the country with Trump on his private jet and spent hours interviewing him in his home, office and on the golf course. Here are a few key Trumpisms from the Donald himself:



Trump on the public’s enduring fascination with Trump: “There is something crazy, hot, a phenomenon out there about me, but I’m not sure I can define it and I’m not sure I want to.”



Trump on naysayers: “You can go ahead and speak to guys who have four-hundred-pound wives at home who are jealous of me, but the guys who really know me know I’m a great builder.”



Trump on the art of self-promotion: “You might as well tell people how great you are, because no one else is going to.”

If for some reason you have been living in a cave since 2015 are only going to read one book about the first three years of the Trump Presidency this is the PERFECT book for you. The authors essentially do nothing more that run through the Trump headlines from 2016 to late 2019 chronologically. If you were alive at this time and don’t suffer from any form of extreme memory loss this book is at best a fun stroll down nightmare memory lane. They do a great job as historians but as far as offering any insight you would be just as well off watching CNN once a week for a few hours.

A sad thing about the alt-right movement is that so many of the Trump attendees are simply being taken for a proverbial ride. For many they are only looking for what Obama supporters wanted a decade ago, hope. They are guilty only of being desperate for a better tomorrow and it is the number one reason they were so easily duped by this horrible con man.

“American Carnage” is a Steve Bannon phrase taken from Trump’s inaugural address as well as the title of this great book all about how Donald Trump became president. This books is just barely about Trump, the focus is the Republican party 2016–2017 and its complete and utter destruction. The reasons Trump became president turn out to be relatively straightforward and simple, foremost Hillary was without question the worst candidate ever put forward by the Democratic party. With her long history of corruption and abuse of power it is no wonder she was so well hated. Second was the ability of the Republican party and more than anyone Republican strategists like Frank Luntz and Karl Rove who were able to boil down exactly where and when Trump needed to spend his time campaigning. Along with the decades long perverse work of The GOP all over the country in gerrymandering their districts in order to maximize the poll of each Republican voter while minimizing Democrats influence.

Republicans are the party of do anything, say anything to win, in this case all they had to do was pledge loyalty to Donald Trump, one of the most repugnant men in American History. More than anything what put Donald over the top was middle class voters who’s number one issue in this last election was reportedly the nomination of Supreme Court Justices. His first nomination was only possible because of Mitch McConnell’s blocking of Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in a completely insane and unheard of manner. The lesson of American Carnage is that luck favors the prepared and the Republicans had been preparing for well over 8 years. The bad news is, it worked they were exceedingly successful in mobilizing their base on the most important issues for them, Mitch McConnell’s Supreme Court nominee and forcing women to have babies they don’t want.

February 19, 2019

4.7 out of 5 stars 1,169 ratings

If you want to read a great fluff piece about and by Andrew McCabe this is the book for you. If you were looking to get your hands on McCabe’s resume, this book will do just fine. The Threat was a well written memoir from a white color lawyer turned FBI douche bag. It was well worth the time invested to hear a few stories from the “inner” FBI, but overall, McCabe is a jackass, a clever jackass, so we are better off not completely trusting any of his perspectives. Two good examples, McCabe glancingly addresses the Snowden revaluations and the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal. As far as the Snowden issues go, the author was clearly on the side that wanted Edward not only apprehended but saw him as a terrorist of the worst kind. You can feel the hate McCabe and his kind have for Snowden in the way he talks about the “damage” done by Snowden releasing classified documents. The man shows his true colors and it seems clear that McCabe is a fascist in the sense that he expects the government should have full access to any aspect of all Americans’ lives at all times.

At no point does he attempt any apology for being a part of pre-Snowden law enforcement. Never does he or does he sound capable of questioning the mass illegal spying programs the FBI used and profited from so eagerly and calls Snowden a criminal, of all things. He says there is no reason for private citizens to expect ANY privacy from the US government, and scoffs at the idea of companies like Apple encrypting uses’ data and then refusing to give the FBI the cryptographic key to EVERY single customer. Like I say, the man is a self proclaimed fascist.

It is great to hear McCabe stumble over himself as he tries to explain and justify what happened with Hilary Clinton and her lost e-mails. Until this book I had taken the e-mail “scandal” as nothing more than idiot Fox News Pizza Gate nonsense. But it turns out, Hilary made a massive mess for the FBI. McCabe tells how when Hilary started at the State Department she was issued a government email address and told to use it for all official communication. Instead she choose to pay a private company to run her email for her, not the us government. There was no reason to do this, it cost a lot of money and the only reason to do it would be to keep data private. After she did this for years against all requests and recommendations it turns out that about ½ of her emails had gotten lost my her own employees, a mistake that would never happen had she done what she was told she needed to. Now the FBI didn’t just throw up their hands and say oh well, guess ½ of the Secretary of State’s emails are gone forever, no, its the fucking FBI, they go and get those fucking emails, and thats hard.

McCabe tells about how they had to painstakingly get court ordered access to every email address mailbox that Hilary had potentially sent email to from her officail account, then sort through ALL the emails from ALL the people that she MIGHT have sent an email to. A massive efforts that cost a lot of money explains McCabe, so while not enough to “lock her up”, it was a huge time and money waster and still ended up with thousands of “missing” emails. It did not even end there, the FBI also had to get access to ALL laptops or devices Hiliary might have used, then recovered as much deleted data off the hard drives, another huge effort that should never had to have happen. Comey could have done little else than stating publicly what happened, if anyone else did what Hilary did they would have been disqualified from ever handling secret information ever again, let alone be allowed to hold public office. McCabe makes clear that the email scandal was real and and the FBI did what they did in the best interest of Hilary Clinton, did their best to cover for a massive screw up.

Luke Harding

4.6 out of 5 stars 136 ratings

We got him. According to author Luke Harding it is already too late for The Donald, the dossier is real and since the late 1970’s Donald has been courted by and intimately associated with Russian finance by laundering money through his real estate properties. The only reason Donald Trump has had any measurable success is because the Russian government has in the past seen it fit to prop up his shoddy business deals with cheap loans or outright free money. If the reporting here is true, nearly every move Donald Trump has made is designed to please, or at least not disrupt, Russian interests. Taken as a hypothesis, that one of Trump’s main aims is to please the top Russian leadership, the facts of the case make more sense. Nearly every odd staffing choice he has made from Manafort “working for free”, to the creepy bald skeleton guy, to the no-soul skeleton lady, to the weird right wing nationalist creeps… They all have some seemingly exploitable Russian connection that has either been sought after by Trump directly, or in the opinion of the author, these people are being put together, and their connections are all tied to Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

There is no conspiracy theorizing needed in the case of the American People vs. Donald J. Trump, his actions demonstrate (1) a clear intention to collude with Russia for gaining ground in the 2016 election and (2) clear cases of money laundering through his multiple international properties, specifically revealed in the Panama Papers recently. The guy is a dirt-bag and my only guess is that Bob Muller right now is just so baffled as to how such a degenerate got to the White House the FBI is taking more time than they obviously should be just catching up.

By the accounts in this excellent book, Trump should be arrested immediately, so is it that either the book is simply not accurate, Trump is somehow above the law, or something else is going on, probably it is the something else thing. No matter what, this is a great book, Luke Harding is an amazing author/journalist/detective. Please read this book and please, VOTE!

Scientists get their best-ever look at Jupiter's atmosphere and storms,http://space.com/jupiter-storm-observations-hubble-and-juno.html,"It's always dark and stormy on Jupiter — and now, scientists have gotten their most detailed view of the wild storms that swirl through the gas giant's atmosphere.

Those observations are thanks to a very powerful partnership that stretches from Earth's surface to Jupiter itself. Start with NASA's Juno probe , which has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016, then recruit NASA's Hubble Space Telescope , which has checked in on the solar system's largest planet throughout its three decades of operation. Finally, add in the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii to support the observations from Earth.

""Because we now routinely have these high-resolution views from a couple of different observatories and wavelengths, we are learning so much more about Jupiter's weather,"" Amy Simon, an astronomer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland who focuses on planetary atmospheres and took part in the new research, said in a NASA statement . ""This is our equivalent of a weather satellite. We can finally start looking at weather cycles.""

And there's plenty of weather on Jupiter to look at. Although the Great Red Spot is the most famous storm on the giant world, all of the gas giant's storms are impressive, with clouds stretching five times higher than Earth's equivalent and lightning three times more powerful than the strongest bolts on Earth.

Every 53 days, Juno skims over Jupiter's cloud tops in a close approach called a perijove, gathering data all the while. Among the spacecraft's instruments is a microwave radiometer, which is tuned to identify lightning strikes and study what ammonia and water vapor are doing in the gas giant's atmosphere.

The scientists behind the new research arranged to target Hubble and Gemini to study Jupiter in coordination with Juno's schedule. So while Juno studies a swath of the gas giant as it passes overhead, Hubble and Gemini study the bigger picture of atmospheric activity on Jupiter.

Specifically, Hubble images the planet in visible light and lets scientists measure the height of convective towers. Meanwhile, Gemini looks in infrared light to peer through gaps in high-level clouds, where scientists suspect drier air is sinking, to the water clouds hidden deep below.

The upper right shows the spot in infrared as seen by Gemini, showing the tendency for bright infrared areas to align with dark visible-light areas. (Image credit: NASA, ESA, and M.H. Wong (UC Berkeley) and team)

If that doesn't sound sufficiently impressive, consider the detail that Gemini was able to identify in its infrared observations, spotting features on Jupiter 300 miles (500 kilometers) across. ""At this resolution, the telescope could resolve the two headlights of a car in Miami, seen from New York City,"" Andrew Stephens, a Gemini Observatory astronomer who led the observations, said in an observatory statement .

Juno has made 26 flybys of the gas giant to date, which means the trio of observatories have built up quite a data set about Jupiter's atmosphere, and scientists have only released the most preliminary findings to date.

But those findings already suggested that lightning was most common in a feature that scientists call a filamentary cyclone. ""These cyclonic vortices could be internal energy smokestacks, helping release internal energy through convection,"" Michael Wong, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author on the new research, said in the NASA statement.

That convection pulls layers of Jupiter's atmosphere up and down depending on factors like temperature and humidity. Earth's atmosphere does this as well, but not in exactly the same way.

""Scientists track lightning because it is a marker of convection, the turbulent mixing process that transports Jupiter's internal heat up to the visible cloud tops,"" Wong said in the Gemini statement. ""Ongoing studies of lightning sources will help us understand how convection on Jupiter is different from or similar to convection in the Earth's atmosphere.""

In the meantime, the researchers behind the observatory collaboration have already answered one longstanding question about Jupiter's atmosphere, specifically the Great Red Spot storm that has roiled for centuries. Astronomers had long wondered whether transient seemingly dark spots in the storm are caused by a different compound in the atmosphere or by gaps in the cloud cover.

And combining the data gathered in close succession by Hubble and Gemini allowed scientists to answer that question: because the dark spots shine brightly in infrared, as deep water clouds do, they seem to represent gaps in upper clouds.

""It's kind of like a jack-o-lantern ,"" Wong said. ""You see bright infrared light coming from cloud-free areas, but where there are clouds, it's really dark in the infrared.""

The scientists are also using the data set to analyze zonal winds, atmospheric waves, convective storms, cyclonic vortices and polar atmospheric phenomena like hazes — and, of course, they anticipate that plenty of other scientific puzzles will benefit from the observations as well.

Juno's next perijove takes place in early June; the mission is scheduled to continue at least through next summer .

The research is described in a paper published April 1 in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series."

Jupiter, which lords over our solar system like Winston lords over The Continental in John Wick, is famous for the immense super-storm swirling in its gaseous atmosphere known as the Great Red Spot. Centuries of observation have revealed scant details about the gas giant's pockmark, but thanks to the work of two telescopes and the enterprising Jovian spacecraft, Juno, astronomers have been able to peer into the Red Spot with unprecedented clarity and reveal some of its inner workings.

A study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series in April, utilized images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, the Gemini Observatory and observations by Juno over a period of three years to examine the Great Red Spot, the biggest storm in the solar system, in ultraviolet and infrared light.

""We want to know how Jupiter's atmosphere works,"" said Michael Wong, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley and first author on the paper, in a press release. ""This is where the teamwork of Juno, Hubble and Gemini comes into play.""

The Gemini Observatory, which is located in Hawaii, was able to collect some of the highest resolution infrared images from a ground-based telescope yet by using a technique known as ""lucky imaging"". Images from ground-based telescopes can sometimes be blurred because of atmospheric effects, but lucky imaging can capture brief moments when those effects are at a minimum. The end result is images with a clarity rivalling the output of telescopes in space.

International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA, M.H. Wong (UC Berkeley)

The unprecedented analysis shows the Spot, visible as a swirl of colour on Jupiter's face, looks ""kind of like a jack-o-lantern"" in infrared light, according to Wong. Thick clouds cover most of the planet's surface, so infrared light emanating from the heat generated deep inside Jupiter can't always escape. Hubble and Juno's imagers can't ""see"" as far into the planet as Gemini, so the ground-based telescope was critical to understanding what lurks within the Great Red Spot.

Now playing: Watch this: NASA video gives a Juno's-eye view of the approach to...

Hubble has imaged the region many times and noticed a dark band -- a sliver of black against the deep reds of the storm. Astronomers weren't sure exactly what this black band represented. With Gemini pointed at the Spot, the researchers were able to confirm these aren't different types of clouds, but holes. That's where the jack-o-lantern notion comes from.

Gaps in the immense storm allow for bright infrared light to beam out across the solar system. Thanks to the giant telescopic eyes at Gemini, we were able to see them.

""These coordinated observations prove once again that ground-breaking astronomy is made possible by combining the capabilities of the Gemini telescopes with complimentary ground- and space-based facilities,"" said Martin Still, an astronomy program director at the National Science Foundation, which funds the operation of Gemini."
"'Never give up, never despair': Queen praises Britons on VE Day. Britain's Queen Elizabeth honoured those who died in World War Two on Friday, the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, and used the occasion to say she was proud of how people had responded to the coronavirus pandemic.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ww2-anniversary-britain-victory-day-q/never-give-up-never-despair-queen-praises-britons-on-ve-day-idUKKBN22K2R5,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Queen Elizabeth honoured those who died in World War Two on Friday, the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, and used the occasion to say she was proud of how people had responded to the coronavirus pandemic.

Slideshow ( 13 images )

In a televised message, the 94-year-old monarch said those who had served during the conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1940s would admire how their descendants were coping with COVID-19 and the lockdown imposed to curb its spread.

“Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish,” Elizabeth said, reflecting on the scaling down of events to mark the VE Day anniversary because of a ban on social gatherings, with a veterans’ parade cancelled and street parties scrapped.

“Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. But our streets are not empty. They are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.

“When I look at our country today and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride, that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.”

Britain has the highest death toll in Europe from COVID-19 at more than 30,000, a number second only to the United States.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has likened the fight against the coronavirus to a war, and the queen’s words about the conflict of 75 years ago appeared applicable today.

“It had affected everyone and no one was immune from its impact. Whether it be the men and women called up to serve, families separated from each other or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play,” the queen said.

“At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain,” she added. “Never give up, never despair, that was the message of VE Day.”

Elizabeth, who delivered her address exactly 75 years to the hour after her father George VI gave his victory speech to the nation, was a teenager during the war and as a member of the women’s Auxiliary Territorial Service, she learned to drive military trucks.

As Britain celebrated victory on May 8, 1945, she and her late younger sister Margaret famously slipped out to join the throng outside Buckingham Palace, believed to be the only time during her 68-year reign she has been among the public unrecognised.

“I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace,” the queen said.

“A sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound.”

She said the greatest tribute to those who gave their lives was that countries that were enemies during the war were now friends."

"'Ramayan' breaks all records, becomes world's most-watched show",http://cnbctv18.com/buzz/ramayan-breaks-all-records-becomes-worlds-most-watched-show-5816381.htm/amp,"Ramanand Sagars popular TV serial 'Ramayan' which is re-airing on Doordarshan became the world's most-watched show on April 16 with 7.7 crore viewers, DD India posted on its official Twitter handle on late Thursday night.

'Ramayan' is being telecast again since March 28 on public demand. In fact, when it was telecast for the first time, the serial had broken all records of popularity, and the show has repeated its history again.

Ramanand Sagar had made a total of 78 episodes of this serial based on Valmiki's Ramayana and Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas.

For the first time in the country, the serial was originally broadcast from January 25, 1987 to July 31, 1988. Then, every Sunday, at 9.30 a.m. the show was aired on TV.

From 1987 to 1988, 'Ramayan' became the most-watched serial in the world. Till June 2003, it remained recorded in the Limca Book of Records as ""the most-watched mythological serial in the world"".

Interestingly, when the serial started airing in the country for the first time, people used to remain glued to the TV sets. Since there were fewer TVs at homes then, most of the people used to gather at some neighbour's place to watch 'Ramayan'."
"Breakthrough for Norfolk Island's morepork owl, one of the world's rarest species",http://abc.net.au/news/2020-04-17/norfolk-island-morepork-owl-new-generation/12150012?fbclid=IwAR3bVmLJ9JX5D7_QTNTNC9PdxoJIcQTu2PBR6tpz9qRz1CJCux5h-Ke7Lno,"Researchers say one of the world's rarest owl species has a chance at survival after a breakthrough discovery on a remote Australian island.

Key points: The first Norfolk Island morepork owl chicks in more than a decade have survived to become fledglings

The first Norfolk Island morepork owl chicks in more than a decade have survived to become fledglings There are less than 50 of the species left in the world

There are less than 50 of the species left in the world In the 1980s the owl population declined to a single female

For the first time in almost a decade, a pair of Norfolk Island morepork owl chicks have been located.

Rohan Clarke, an avian ecologist from Monash University, said the chicks represented the future of the species, given there were less than 50 individuals left on Earth.

""It's super exciting,"" Dr Clarke said.

""It's the best outcome we could have hoped for.""

The owls only live on Norfolk Island which sits in the Pacific Ocean, more than 863 nautical miles east of Byron Bay.

Back from the brink

Researchers have worked for more than 40 years to save the dark, spotty owl species.

Work began in the 1980s after the island's population declined, leaving all-but one female.

""We knew we had to save it … and there follows an incredible history,"" Dr Clarke said.

In 1989, the last remaining owl was successfully paired with a male from a New Zealand subspecies.

The cross-Tasman relations meant that all subsequent generations of moreporks on Norfolk Island were now a unique hybrid.

""Now, as far as we know, the entire population on Norfolk have descended from that pair,"" Dr Clarke said.

Crisis huddle held

Dr Clarke works alongside Norfolk Island National Park rangers and says the new chicks are a delight to see.

But their arrival was hard earned.

Unexpectedly, the owls stopped breeding in 2012 and the dry spell continued until 2019.

At that point, crisis talks were held.

""We were really concerned because there was every chance that the existing owls would get old and lose their reproductive ability,"" Dr Clarke said.

At the emergency meeting a plan was hatched to build more nesting boxes throughout the island's national park.

Extra field staff were also allocated to monitor the owls' movements.

""Now, we're on the front foot to work with these birds and find a solution to keep them going,"" Dr Clarke said.

'As important as koalas'

Dr Clarke said saving the Norfolk Island morepork owl was vital work, despite their tiny stature and population.

""Norfolk Island, like many islands, has really unique biodiversity,"" he said.

""And it's the sum of all these small species that makes our region so biodiverse."

A homage to the photojournalists lost to decades of war in Vietnam. Really striking photos displaying the insanity of war.,http://southeastasiaglobe.com/vietnam-war-photographers/,"Each came for a reason and died taking a chance. They were veterans and amateurs, staff shooters and independents, gun-toters and pacifists. One never sold a photograph; two had won Pulitzer prizes. Some were buried with honours and mourned by nations; others simply disappeared. They came from around the globe to become the greatest assemblage of photojournalists in history.

If they’d all been gathered together on the Continental Palace’s terrace, watching beautiful women in ao dais glide by, they wouldn’t have been able to speak one another’s mother tongue. But in the field, in the mud and blood and monsoon, they found a common language through the lens.

Some stayed on for the glory, the money, the thrill. Others returned, again and again, because it was the place to be. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong shooters didn’t have a chance: their orders said stay until victory or death. All lived for the next picture; it could be the best one of all.

Sean Flynn, below, a Vietcong suspect cries as he is interrogated by Vietnamese Nung tribesmen, who were on the side of the government

‘Stick close to him,’ one youngster would whisper to another, pointing to François Sully or Larry Burrows or Henri Huet. ‘He’s lucky. He’ll keep you alive‘

“Got another Time cover; I think it’s the eighth picture I’ve had in Time and Newsweek since July,” the American Dana Stone said into a tape recorder in 1967. “That’s a lot; that’s more than I could’ve gotten anywhere else in the world, so I guess it pays off.”

“If you hear that I’m coming back soon, forget it,” Oliver “Ollie” Newton wrote home to America shortly after his arrival in what was then called Saigon. “I like this place. It’s really great over here for a newspaperman.” Like those who had arrived before him and those who would come after his death in a helicopter crash in 1969, Noonan relished the camaraderie and the competition.

Rookie photographers, like second lieutenants, had a life expectancy of 15 minutes. Some survived just long enough for colleagues to learn their names. Others were not who they seemed. After the Englishman James Gill was killed in Vietnam in 1972, friends were sent to his apartment to pack up his possessions and discovered that he was a deserter from the British marines named James Cattell.

Some photographers carried guns, others smoked opium, many drank. Some spent all their money when they got it; a few got rich off spoils. Some won every major award in photojournalism; some barely sold a single photo. To live in a war zone is to live on top of the world; friendships are closer, love deeper, fear stronger. Vietnam was not a cautionary tale. All that mattered was the work and staying alive to get it out.

Some survived only weeks. Those who lived long enough became legends. Old Vietnam hands were pied pipers to newcomers. Cults sprung up around them. “Stick close to him,” one youngster would whisper to another, pointing to François Sully or Larry Burrows or Henri Huet. “He’s lucky. He’ll keep you alive.” Everybody knew it was nonsense, but …

Longevity in war isn’t just luck. Survivors are smart, superstitious, careful. Sometimes that still isn’t enough.

Henri Huet: bomb craters from B-52 strikes pockmark the landscape near Saigon

Robert Capa epitomised the experienced professional in Vietnam. He was covering his fifth war when he set out with French troops in 1954 to photograph a story in the Red River delta near Hanoi. He spent the day in late May photographing rice paddies surrounded by tanks. Routine. There was a false step. Only the legend remains.

Everette Dixie Reese, a Texan working as a freelancer and for the US Information Agency, covered Dien Bien Phu and the ceasefire following France’s defeat. He captured rare images of peace between the two Indochina wars.

His landscapes reveal rainforests before defoliants, rice fields without B-52 craters, marketplaces free of barbed wire. Some of his favourite shots were of Cambodia’s Elephant Brigade and the Laotian royal family.

A civilian pilot was flying Reese above Saigon for aerials of an attempted coup when their tiny L-5 Stinson was shot down on April 29, 1955.

Civilian cameramen, sound men, correspondents for radio, television and newspapers, special writers for magazines, even newsreel cameramen with the French in the first Indochina war – members of every journalistic medium lost their lives from 1945 to 1975. Death was not discriminatory or selective.

That year [1970] 24 Western journalists died or disappeared in Cambodia

Cameraman Terry Khoo and his replacement, Sam Kai Faye decided, on the spur of the moment, to leave Hue on the morning of July 20, 1972. Engaged to be married in a week, Khoo was leaving Vietnam the next day, after seven years, to take a plum job in ABC News’s Bonn bureau in Germany. Faye, a veteran, had just returned to Vietnam for another tour. Both cameramen already were celebrated still photographers; Faye had won the British Commonwealth photo contest twice and Khoo’s photos were printed in Asia.

A sniper shot Faye first. Khoo stayed with him, calling out “I’m okay” to a soundman who escaped. A sniper then killed Khoo. Their bodies weren’t recovered for several days. A Vietnamese army cameraman was killed with them in the same open field near Quang Tri, one of dozens of military photographers who perished during the war.

Some photographers were highly educated, even scholars; others came without formal schooling to find an education in life.

Kyoichi Sawada was an orphan who discovered photography as a clerk in a camera shop. His UPI bosses in Tokyo wouldn’t assign him to Vietnam, so he went there on vacation; his pictures from that trip landed him a permanent staff job in Vietnam, where he won the 1966 Pulitzer prize for news photography.

A cautious man who always wore a helmet, he reluctantly agreed in 1970 to introduce an eager new UPI bureau chief to Cambodia’s Route 2. Twenty six miles out of Phnom Penh both were shot in their rented blue Datsun. That year 24 Western journalists died or disappeared in Cambodia.

The Missing Seventeen journalists went missing in Cambodia over the course of only two months during 1970, after the coup d’etat that ousted the government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Many searched for them; everybody hoped they would return. There but for the grace of God was the fate of everyone who covered the conflict. But in a war with few clearly delineated frontlines, final sightings of many of them were the last fleeting memories people had as they went into battle with their cameras and notebooks. Many of them disappeared on their way to Kampot and Takeo and all efforts by the press corps to locate them were to no avail.

Because they spoke the language, knew the terrain, had the contacts and worked cheap, Vietnamese photographers were the backbone of coverage for the Western news organisations.

Huynh Thanh My set the standard for the rest of his countrymen, including his younger brother. After Thanh My was killed in 1965, his brother Huynh Cong Ut hung around the AP office begging to be taught how to take pictures. Eventually the kid, dubbed Nick by the AP staff, was hired full time by the wire service. In 1972, Nick Ut took the Pulitzer prize-winning photo of the little girl burned by napalm and running down a road.

In Ho Chi Minh’s army, photographers were soldiers first, then journalists. They carried light arms at most times, used rocket launchers, mortars and threw grenades and often had to fight their way out of tight spots. They wore uniforms and were often seen with AK-47s slung over their shoulders and a camera around their necks. Two of the 72 communist photographer-correspondents killed in the war were women, Le Thi Nang and Ngoc Huong.

The circle closed. A war that began with the death of the French photographers Raymond Martinoff and Jean Peraud in 1954 ended with the loss of their countryman Michel Laurent on the eve of the end of the war.

Between November 24, 1945, and April 30, 1975, 135 combat photographers died in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. They were all loved; they were all unlucky. None lived to grow old.

It is for their photographs, not their dying, that the world remembers them.

Luck favours the brave A wartime survivor speaks out for the first time about his role as a Cambodian war photographer and his escape from the killing fields Mao Run is possibly the only photojournalist remaining in Cambodia to have survived the Indochina wars and has lived through six Cambodian regimes. A quiet, stocky man with thinning hair, he tells his story to the sound of gentle wind chimes in the otherwise empty restaurant. Mao Run was named Chey Sarun when he was born on June 5, 1945, and educated in French and Khmer. At the age of 21 he went to work delivering three state-controlled magazines: Kambuja, Le Sangkum and Phseng Phseng. He had been passionate about photography since childhood, so when his brother bought him his first camera he taught himself photography. By 1971, he was working as a photographer for the state-sponsored Interest Khmer newspaper and United Press International (UPI). Mao Run: looked through Requiem and saw many friends who disappeared after the fall of Phnom Penh Sou Vichith: Psar Damkor in Phnom Penh. Vichith disappeared in 1975. Mao Run was there minutes later (below) When he received his foreign and national press accreditation he immediately joined the Cambodian army in the frontline. “At UPI we competed with AP. We sent out 30 stories a day,” Run says. His favourite photo opportunities were when soldiers on the battlefield would break for lunch and he would walk freely between the enemy lines to photograph the government soldiers . . . or when the Khmer Republic army flushed Khmer Rouge soldiers out of a bunker and he was able to capture their frightened expressions. He says he enjoyed his life as a photojournalist because he got to meet so many powerful people. “Once during a meeting between General Lon Nol and Sisowath Sirimatak, the two hugged and my flash didn’t work. I asked them to hug again so I could take the photo. I dared to ask these two powerful leaders to do something for me, and they did!” Five days before the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh he managed to get to meet a number of American diplomats at their embassy. “I went to the ambassador’s [John Gunther Dean] final press conference where he delivered the now famous line of: ‘I have no further comments for you all. I have to go now and would like to say goodbye’.” Run refused to be evacuated from Phnom Penh and worked until the Khmer Rouge marched into the city. He shot seven rolls of film, which included photographs of government soldiers taking off their uniforms and throwing down their guns near the Japanese Bridge. That afternoon he sent his last news report to UPI from Phnom Penh to Saigon: “SOS. Today it is finished for Phnom Penh and the Lon Nol regime. Now the Khmer Rouge are occupying Phnom Penh and the people are leaving. Please help me.” If UPI responded, Run was not there to receive it. He left the city four days later with his wife and four children, the youngest of which was 13 days old. The 100km trek to Kampong Thom took Run and his family a month because of illness, frequent stops to gather food and through congestion on the road where events foreshadowed the hardships and lucky breaks to come. Goodbye: US ambassador Dean, above, with Cambodian troops. Lon Nol before his departure from Cambodia. Mao Run found only two rolls of film when he returned to Phnom Penh Luck came in the form of a Khmer Rouge soldier who told him that if he wanted to live, he should pretend he was a farmer. Grief struck when his four-year-old son died from a lack of medication and Run came down with malaria. Fortunately his wife’s grandparents picked them up in an ox cart 30km from their destination. “Otherwise I would not have made it,” he says. His journalistic background prepared Run for the tough and dangerous years ahead under the Khmer Rouge. “I knew from talking to their prisoners what life was like in the Khmer Rouge-controlled areas,” Run says. His wife’s grandfather also warned him how to behave. “After one day the Angkar will win. For sure. You must close your mouth and your ears if you want to survive.” Run changed his name to the one he uses now. “I chose Mao Run,” he says, “because it sounds like a farmer’s name.” While in Kampong Thom he worked on the First January dam project for four months, barefoot on sharp stone chips. It was his hard work that prevented him from being sent to the killing fields. “My name was on the list to go, but my district representative recognised me from my work on the First of January dam.

More Good News on Remdesivir's Power to Treat COVID-19,http://usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-04-21/more-good-news-on-remdesivirs-power-to-treat-covid-19,"By Robert Preidt, HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, April 21, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary data from two clinical trials using the antiviral drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients is encouraging, researchers report.

One trial is providing the drug to patients with moderate illness and the other focuses on patients with severe illness.

A number of the patients are now recovering and have been released from the hospital. While it's too early to tell, the researchers said there are also indications that remdesivir can possibly stave off being put on a ventilator.

""Early results are promising, and that is important right now. Much of what we are learning about COVID-19 management is centered around preventing quick deterioration. Timing is everything. I can't say for certain they [patients] would have been intubated otherwise, but it's encouraging,"" said Katherine Perez, an infectious diseases pharmacist who is co-leading the trials.

Houston Methodist Hospital was the fifth site in the United States to join the clinical trials with remdesivir, and it began enrolling and treating patients in mid-March. Now, these Phase 3 trials will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir. Both trials are registered with the federal government's clinical trial registry.

The patients with moderate illness receive either five or 10 days of remdesivir treatment, while those with severe illness receive 10 days of treatment with the drug.

Quick treatment is critical, said Dr. Kevin Grimes, an infectious diseases physician and co-leader of the trials.

""If given early enough, we're hoping that remdesivir interferes with the virus and blocks its ability to replicate in patients' cells,"" Grimes said in a Houston Methodist news release. ""The goal is that it staves off the deadly inflammatory cascade that leads to respiratory failure and the need to be intubated and put on a ventilator.""

Remdesivir was originally developed to treat Ebola more than a decade ago. It's known to be generally safe in humans, the researchers said, and is backed by a large body of preclinical research, and a number of studies have shown it stops SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), the viral cousins of COVID-19.

And other studies have suggested that it's effective against the new coronavirus.

A study in China earlier this year showed that remdesivir could block COVID-19 from replicating in human cells, and a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) focused on the man in Washington state who was the first known U.S. COVID-19 patient. He received remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, and he started improving within 24 hours.

The first results from one of Gilead's compassionate-use trials was published earlier this month in the NEJM. The study showed clinical improvement in two-thirds of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 who received the antiviral.

Meanwhile, forthcoming reports from several ongoing clinical trials -- including the ones at Houston Methodist -- will provide more evidence-based data about the use of remdesivir for treating COVID-19 patients.

India Can Take Over China as COVID-19 Leaves Gaps in Manufacturing. An interesting read.,http://thepositiveindian.in/on-indian-economy-india-take-over-china-in-manufacturing/,"As the world struggles to deal with coronavirus, many nations have become economically hampered. But while everyone tries to get normal, China might take the brunt of companies moving away from their country. As the virus takes over all the Tiger economies such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan, companies are slowly realizing their dependence on these nations, especially China. As companies from around the world struggle to find newer pastures, the biggest impact may be on Indian economy. No, not negatively, but positively.

It must be noted that most multinationals depend on China even for their raw materials, not just for manufacturing. It is India which seems to be in the pole position to be an alternative to China. This talk, which has been going on since the US-China trade war began is now catching even more attention thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Forbes, US companies are already moving out of China. The COVID-19 crisis has made this move more imminent than ever. According to experts, the biggest positive impact of this will be on Indian economy.

While India does struggle with its own issues such as complex labour laws, official paperwork jargons and red-tapism, it has slowly and steadily been improving itself as a business destination. Also known as an emerging market by most multinational companies’ top executives, that definition of India has changed quite a bit over this past century. Though certainly not as lucrative a destination as China, India has improved considerably. One proof of this improvement is the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. The Asian country, which was ranked a lowly 100th in 2017 jumped 23 places to 77th in 2018. In 2019, the country again made big leaps and was ranked 63rd out of 160 nations. While the index is certainly not the most precise, it does show an image which the current regime wants for India.

Changes in India’s Ease of Business Index vver the last decade

According to the Index’s report on Indian economy, India still lags behind on certain important key factors such as starting a business and contract enforcement. But huge improvements have been made in other key areas, especially insolvency. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which has made the process of filing for bankruptcy easier for businesses has done great work for this rank improvement. Not only that, India has even bettered itself in terms of reductions in bad loans. But this still doesn’t make up for India’s discrepancies.

A recent example of this discrepancy arose recently in the context of Apple Inc. Some years ago, when Apple tried to see if some components of their most valued product, the iPhone could be made in India, they were pushed back due to lack of positive results. The main component which they wanted to manufacture in India was phone speakers and headphone components. None could make that. Truly speaking, the investment that was to be required for this project would have been too large. The already established manufacturers failed on a lot of standards such as environmental norms, quality standards, health and safety standards among others. One manufacturer which was selected had some potential. But when Apple executives decided to visit his factory in Karnataka, they found out that all of the factory’s workers were on a strike. This example does present a stark reality about the condition of manufacturing sector in India.

Today, Apple has finally established a factory in India, but it is an assembly plant. The workers there only assemble the components and that too, of a very cheaper version of their iPhone. But one might say that a lot has changed as of now. Almost an year before the COVID-19 outbreak, the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum’s (USISPF) had informed that about 200 US companies were looking to shift their production bases from China to India. As the US-China Trade War intensified and India’s relations with the US bettered, India had made itself a lucrative destination for US multinationals even before the coronavirus outbreak. When one sees all this in light with the pro-business attitude of the current regime, one can just get lost in the endless manufacturing possibilities which India can make for itself. Even though the current Finance Ministry of India, headed by Nirmala Sitharaman is critisized (duly a lot of times), the truth is that the corporate tax rate in India is now on par with most Tiger economies of South East Asia.

Changes in Indian Corporate Tax Rate over the last decade

As the Indian retail sector braces for a big loss due to the lockdown, for some manufacturing sector companies, this global lockdown has actually been a blessing in disguise. One such sector is the Pharmaceutical sector. The Indian Pharmaceutical sector accounts for a huge share in India’s global exports. Many western developed powers depend on India for their medicinal supplies. This dependency was seen recently when many world leaders thanked India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for supplying them hydroxychloroquine, a drug which was found effective in treating coronavirus. Interestingly, India had initially blocked its export until US President Donald Trump made some remarks about it in a press conference. Since then, 28 nations have gotten its hydroxychloroquine supplies from India.

Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten! Thank you Prime Minister @NarendraModi for your strong leadership in helping not just India, but humanity, in this fight! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2020

But a different issue crops up when you see the Indian Pharmaceutical industry in a different light. Most Indian medicine manufacturers actually depend on China for their raw material supplies. The experts say that India does have the capacity to arrange these raw materials by itself, but is not willing to do that. This is in no way a positive reflection on Indian economy. India should realize that this is an opportunity to develop their manufacturing capacity, reduce Chinese dependencies and become a Pharma hub in itself.

While most Indians who have little idea about factors of production but have varied political opinions want India to manufacture electrical equipment, what they do not realize is that there are much more lucrative nations such as Vietnam who have already become the first choice after China for manufacturing these things. India neither has the infrastructure nor such low priced labour which can work in those factories. Instead, what India must do is focus on industries that already have an established base in India. One such important industry in context of India is its textile industry.

Though China produces finished garments cheaply, India also has a goodwill in the textile sector. The quality of Indian garments is also considered to be better than the China produced one. This is a good time for India to find out the issues which they face in this sector and make improvements. Cost cutting techniques on a national scale can work wonders, plus capacity building for garments will have a very positive impact on Indian economy. India must have learnt its lesson now about how a policy of export promotion is better than import substitution. For this, improvising the textile sector is a great way forward for Indian manufacturing sector, and for creating a positive impact on Indian economy.

It seems that the luck of Prime Minister Modi always seems to bring a big opportunity with problems. Recently, Japan is also planning to make many of their big industries out of China. In fact, the Japanese government is paying those companies $3.5 billion to do it. If India, who is on the good books of Japan, can get any big Japanese manufacturer to manufacture their automobile components in India, it would be a big win for the NDA government, who seem to have a below par performance as far as the economy is concerned. Now as all the major world economies struggle due to their high Debt to GDP ratio, India has a great chance to become an economic and manufacturing powerhouse.

Just yesterday, news came in that major Korean multinational players were keen to move out of China, to India. As we fight and support our brave coronavirus warriors and follow coronavirus prevention tips, now is the time for certain government institutions to start backdoor negotiations with big companies, make a roadmap for attracting them to manufacture in India, and boost India’s production capacity so much that it becomes an independent economic powerhouse.

Chocolate for breakfast (but not for dinner) is good in experimental models of jet-lag and shift-work,http://nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63227-w?utm_source=etoc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=toc_41598_nature&utm_content=etoc_nature_BS_7_20200414&sap-outbound-id=E03C3759E771254CE84114F317C8AE4F8A5FC057,"Animals and general housing

All animals were maintained in a 12:12 h LD cycle [lights on at 07.00 h, Zeitgeber time (ZT0)], constant temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and free access to food (Rodent Laboratory Chow 5001) and water, unless otherwise stated. Experimental procedures used in this study were in strict accordance with the Mexican norms for animal handling, Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-062-ZOO-1999, which conforms to international guidelines for animal handling, and were approved by the Ethics Committee (063/2016) in the Faculty of Medicine UNAM. Experiments conform to international guidelines on the ethical use of animals; procedures were aimed at minimizing the number of animals used and their suffering.

Re-entrainment with chocolate after acute jet-lag

To determine whether a piece of chocolate can aid to re-entrain in jet-lag conditions, rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups that were exposed to a sudden 6 hour phase advance (6PA): 1. The control group (n = 8), exposed to the 6PA, with ad libitum regular food access and NO chocolate; 2. the chocolate-previous rats (CH-P; n = 8); starting with the day of 6PA they received daily a piece (5 g) of milk chocolate (Kinder chocolate Maxi, Ferrero) coinciding with the onset of the previous night; 3. the chocolate–new rats (CH-N group n = 8), starting with the day of 6PA they received daily a piece (5 g) of milk chocolate coinciding with the start of the new night. after 10 days of baseline in an LD cycle (lights on at 1900 h, = ZT0), rats were exposed to the 6PA by turning off the light 6 h earlier, at 1300 h external time. The chocolate administration continued for the 12 days following the 6PA shift. After the 6PA, the following 12 days were monitored and the number of transitory cycles for achieving the new expected acrophase were determined for general activity and core temperature using a cosinor analysis (see cosinor analysis). The new expected acrophase for each group was estimated by subtracting 6 hours from the values obtained in the baseline. The daily new acrophases were statistically compared with the expected acrophase using a one-way ANOVA for repeated measures followed by a Dunnett´s post hoc test. Data that resulted statistically different from the expected acrophase were classified as transitory cycles, whereas when data were statistically similar to the expected acrophase for 3 consecutive days, the re-entrainment to the new phase was classified as reached. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare the number of days required by each group to achieve re-entrainment to the new acrophase for general activity and core temperature.

Re-entrainment with food after acute jet-lag

Rats exposed to a sudden 6 hour phase advance (6PA) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups: Food access in previous night (Food-P) or Food access in the new night (Food-N). After 10 days of baseline in an LD cycle with lights-on at 0700 h and lights-off at 1900 h, all rats were exposed to a 6 hours phase advance (6PA) as previously described. The shift was accomplished by ending the light period 6 h earlier, resulting in lights-off at 1300 h new ZT12 and lights-on at 0100 h external time (new ZT0). After the 6PA both groups were exposed daily to a restricted food access of 12 h food and 12 h fasting during 10 days. The Food-P group (n = 12) were fasted for 12 h and received food during 12 hours in the time of their previous night, while the Food-N group (n = 12) were fasted for 12 h previously to 6PA, received food during 12 hours in the new night (geographic time: 1300 h to 0100 h) for 10 days after the 6PA.

The number of transitory cycles necessary for re-entrainment was determined for general activity and temperature using a cosinor analysis as described before.

Re-entrainment with the chocolate components after acute jet-lag

Rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups exposed to a 6PA: the control group receiving ad libitum food and was not exposed to other feeding conditions, experimental rats after the 6PA received daily either 5 g of chocolate or pellets containing the separate elements of a chocolate bar; gelatin was used as the base to prepare all the pellets, therefore, one group received only gelatin, other group received the smell and fat of chocolate provided by cocoa butter, the calories of chocolate were mimicked with sugar and the chocolate flavor was accomplished by adding cocoa flavor with Splenda to gelatin. After 5 days in this protocol rats were left in constant darkness for 24 hours without chocolate access to determine the endogenous circadian phase. The daily phase after the 6PA was compared with the expected acrophase by sustracting 6 h form the baseline acrophase. A one-way ANOVA for repeated measure was used followed by a Dunnett´s pos hoc test to determine significant differences, as described for experiment 1. On day 6 under DD the achieved acrophase was compared with the expected acrphase and the difference was used as indicator of the re-entrainment effect of the element using a cosinor analysis as previously described.

Chocolate effects in the experimental shift-work condition

Rats were randomly assigned to a Control (CNT) or a Shift-work (WRK) condition. These groups were further subdivided in: the control group (CNT) receiving regular chow ad libitum during the entire experiment, the control-chocolate for dinner group (CH-D) receiving daily 5 g of chocolate immediately after lights on (ZT0) and the control-chocolate for breakfast group (CH-B) receiving daily 5 g of chocolate immediately after lights off (ZT12). In a similar way the WRK rats were subdivided in three groups: The WRK group received chow ad libitum during the entire experiment, the work rats receiving chocolate for dinner (WCH-D) received daily 5 g of chocolate 10 minutes before entering to the slow rotating wheel for (ZT2); the work rats receiving chocolate for breakfast (WCH-B) received daily 5 g of chocolate at ZT 12. Rats assigned to the shift-work protocol were placed in slow rotating drums (1 revolution / 3 min) that are normally used for sleep deprivation (33 cm diameter, 633 cm wide) from Monday to Friday for 8 h (from ZT2 to ZT10) during 4 weeks, as previously reported54. The scheduled chocolate was only provided from Monday to Friday associated with the shift-work protocol. During weekends, all rats remained undisturbed in their home cages. Rats were weighed before starting the baseline and once / week during the first 3 week of the experimental manipulations. Body weight gain was calculated for this interval and for each group. At the end of the 3rd working week rats underwent surgery to implant a jugular cannula (n = 4–6 per group) in order to obtain blood samples for a 24 h cycle.

Rats were allowed to recover during the weekend and continued their work protocol during week 4. One series of rats was used to evaluate postprandial thermogenesis. At the end of week 4 the change in core temperature was compared between WRK rats and WRK rats receiving chocolate either for breakfast or dinner.

Monitoring of general activity and core temperature

All rats were housed in individual cages (45 × 30 × 35 cm) placed on plates with tilt sensors, in soundproof lockers with controlled lighting conditions. General activity in the home cage was continuously monitored with the tilt sensors. Behavioral events were collected with a digitized system and automatically stored every minute in a PC for further analysis SPAD9 (Data processing system, 1.1.1 version; Omnialva SA. De CV. Mexico City, Mexico) based on MATLAB. Double plotted actograms were obtained for each animal by collecting the sum of activity for 15 min intervals. Daily activity counts were fitted to a nonlinear cosinor analysis for estimating daily individual acrophases (see cosinor analysis below). For each rat, normalized activity counts for the last day of the base line, and for the following days after the 6PA were analyzed individually with the cosinor analysis, to obtain the daily acrophases. In order to evaluate core body temperature, rats underwent a brief surgery to receive intra-abdominal temperature sensors (iButton Sensor- Temperature Logger; Maxim integrated products, USA) as previously described55. Briefly, one week before starting baseline, rats were anaesthetized with an intramuscular dose of xylazine (Procin 8 mg/kg) and ketamine (Inoketam 40 mg/kg). Under anesthesia a small incision was performed in the abdominal cavity and the temperature sensor, previously sterilized, was introduced in the peritoneum. Abdominal muscles were sutured with absorbable catgut (000) and skin was sutured with surgical suture (Atramat, International Farmaceutica, SA. de CV. Mexico). Rats were left for 1 week to recover before starting the baseline. Temperature sensors were programmed to store samples every 30 min. Data for the baseline and for the 12 following days after the 6PA were analyzed with the cosinor test to obtain acrophases as described for general activity. The acrophase for the last day of the base line was compared with the acrophases following the 6PA a one way ANOVA for repeated mesurements followed by a Dunnett’s pos thoc test for general activity. For daily temperature profiles data in the shift-work model data are presented as average per hour. Postprandial thermogenesis in response to chocolate was evaluated at the end of week 4, in a normal work day. The postprandial response was compared between WRK rats and rats receiving chocolate (WCH-B and WCH-D). The temperature change was determined every 30 min. by comparing temperature prior chocolate presentation with the temperature of the 5 h after chocolate intake for WCH-B and WCH-D rats.

Metabolic and hormonal rhythms

At the end of week 3 of the work protocol, animals in the shift-work protocol and their controls were anesthetized with an intramuscular dose of xylazine (Procin 8 mg/kg) and ketamine (Inoketam 40 mg/kg) and cannulated in the internal jugular vein with a polyethylene silicon tube (0.025 in. i.d. and 0.047 in. o.d.; Silastic Laboratory tubing; Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI, USA) filled with heparin (500 U/ml) as anti-coagulant as previously reported54. The outer end of the cannula was fixed in the back between both shoulder blades and clotted with a small needle. Rats were allowed to recover during the weekend and on Monday the work protocol was reinitiated. At the end of the 4th working week blood samples were obtained distributed in 2 days (Thursday and Friday) to cover a 24 h cycle with 3 h intervals; 4 samples were obtained one day at ZT0, ZT6, ZT12 and ZT18 and the other 4 samples were obtained the next day (ZT3, ZT9, ZT15, AND ZT21) Blood samples (500 ul) were collected in Eppendorf tubes (1.8 ml) containing a clot-activator gel and were centrifuged at 2500 r.p.m. during 10 min, serum was stored in 100 µl aliquots at −45 °C until assay. Aliquots were processed with colorimetric methods for determination of glucose, triglycerides (TG) and melatonin.

Glucose was measured using a commercial colorimetric kit (GPSL-0507, ELI Tech Clinical Systems). TG were assessed with a commercial kit (TGML-0427, ELI Tech Clinical Systems), melatonin was determined by the ELISA method, with a commercial kit (Enzyme immunoassay for the direct, quantitative determination of melatonin; of IBL International, Germany). A cosinor analysis was used to obtain daily acrophases of the metabolic variables/ individual (see cosinor analysis).

Immunohistochemical staining

One series of the groups employed for the jet-lag study was used to obtain the brains in two time points. Brains were obtained 1 day after the 6PA either at their new ZT1 (one hour after the lights onset) or new ZT13 (one hour after the light offset). ZT13 also corresponded to one hour after chocolate intake for the CH-N group. For the CH-P group, night sampling was performed at ZT19, one hour after chocolate intake.

One series of rats for the shift-work protocol was used for brain collection and immunohistochemistry. On week 4 of the shift-work protocol, rats were perfused one hour after chocolate intake (ZT1) or 12 h later (ZT13) to obtain a day-night pattern.

Rats were anaesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Sedalphorte 65 mg/ml, Pisa, Mexico) and were perfused transcardially with 250 ml of 0.9% saline followed by 250 ml of fixative 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.2).

For the night-time points rats were anesthetized under dim red light and their eyes covered. The time between anesthesia and the start of fixation was of 5–6 min. Brains were removed and post fixed for 24 h in paraformaldehyde 4%. After post fixation they were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 3–4 days. Brains were frozen and cut in sections of 40 μm at −18 °C. Sections were collected in four series; one series was processed for c-Fos as previously described36. Free floating sections were incubated in c-Fos antibody raised in rabbit (1:2500; Santa Cruz biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) in phosphate buffer 0.1 M, pH 7.2 with 0.9% saline 1% (PBS) 0.25% gelatin (G), and 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBSGT) for 72 h in 4 °C. This was followed by incubation in secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories, California USA), 1:200 in PBSGT for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation in avidin–biotin complex (0.9% avidin and 0.9% biotin solutions; Vector Laboratories, California, USA) in PBSGT for 2 h at room temperature. Between incubations sections were rinsed three times for 10 min in PBS. Tissues were reacted with diaminobenzidine (0.01%), nickel (0.05%) and hydrogen peroxide (35 μl,/ 100 mL 30% H2O2) to obtain a blue color. Tissues were mounted, dehydrated and cover slipped with microscopy Entellan (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

SCN c-Fos quantification in Jet-Lag and Shift-work animals

One medial section of the SCN per animal was selected, images were digitalized with Leica camera ICC50 HD attached to a Leica DM500. Picture were taken with an objective 20X and analyzed with ImageJ software by determining SCN ventral and dorsal regions bilaterally of the SCN. For counting c-Fos positive cells background was subtracted (50%); threshold was determined, and particle analysis was set for particles of 1.0–2.0 circularity and 20–150 pixels. The counts of the dorsal and the ventral regions were added to determine the total amount of c-Fos in the SCN. The results were graphed as total, dorsal and ventral cFos expressing cells and were compared with a two-way ANOVA for the factors groups and time (day-night).

Cosinor analysis

The cosinor analysis was used to obtain daily acrophases for each individual, mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) were obtained / group. The cosinor analysis was performed with MATLAB version 5.3 using the least square method to fit a sine wave to a time series (in this case to 24 h). The formula used was: Y(t)=M + Acophase (2πt/τ + φ) + e(t); Y = collected data; M = mesor; A = amplitude; φ = acrophase; T = period; e = error at each time. The obtained acrophase/day was compared with the expected acrophase using the Student “t” test (significant values set at p < 0.05). Days when the acrophase was statistically different (indicated with asterisks) from the new expected acrophase were considered transitory cycles, while re-entrainment was achieved when no statistical difference between the mean daily acrophase and the expected new acrophase was indicated.

Finally We May Have a Path to the Fundamental Theory of Physics and It's BeautifulStephen Wolfram Writings,http://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/,"I Never Expected This

It’s unexpected, surprising—and for me incredibly exciting. To be fair, at some level I’ve been working towards this for nearly 50 years. But it’s just in the last few months that it’s finally come together. And it’s much more wonderful, and beautiful, than I’d ever imagined.

In many ways it’s the ultimate question in natural science: How does our universe work? Is there a fundamental theory? An incredible amount has been figured out about physics over the past few hundred years. But even with everything that’s been done—and it’s very impressive—we still, after all this time, don’t have a truly fundamental theory of physics.

Back when I used do theoretical physics for a living, I must admit I didn’t think much about trying to find a fundamental theory; I was more concerned about what we could figure out based on the theories we had. And somehow I think I imagined that if there was a fundamental theory, it would inevitably be very complicated.

But in the early 1980s, when I started studying the computational universe of simple programs I made what was for me a very surprising and important discovery: that even when the underlying rules for a system are extremely simple, the behavior of the system as a whole can be essentially arbitrarily rich and complex.

And this got me thinking: Could the universe work this way? Could it in fact be that underneath all of this richness and complexity we see in physics there are just simple rules? I soon realized that if that was going to be the case, we’d in effect have to go underneath space and time and basically everything we know. Our rules would have to operate at some lower level, and all of physics would just have to emerge.

By the early 1990s I had a definite idea about how the rules might work, and by the end of the 1990s I had figured out quite a bit about their implications for space, time, gravity and other things in physics—and, basically as an example of what one might be able to do with science based on studying the computational universe, I devoted nearly 100 pages to this in my book A New Kind of Science.

I always wanted to mount a big project to take my ideas further. I tried to start around 2004. But pretty soon I got swept up in building Wolfram|Alpha, and the Wolfram Language and everything around it. From time to time I would see physicist friends of mine, and I’d talk about my physics project. There’d be polite interest, but basically the feeling was that finding a fundamental theory of physics was just too hard, and only kooks would attempt it.

It didn’t help that there was something that bothered me about my ideas. The particular way I’d set up my rules seemed a little too inflexible, too contrived. In my life as a computational language designer I was constantly thinking about abstract systems of rules. And every so often I’d wonder if they might be relevant for physics. But I never got anywhere. Until, suddenly, in the fall of 2018, I had a little idea.

It was in some ways simple and obvious, if very abstract. But what was most important about it to me was that it was so elegant and minimal. Finally I had something that felt right to me as a serious possibility for how physics might work. But wonderful things were happening with the Wolfram Language, and I was busy thinking about all the implications of finally having a full-scale computational language.

But then, at our annual Summer School in 2019, there were two young physicists (Jonathan Gorard and Max Piskunov) who were like, “You just have to pursue this!” Physics had been my great passion when I was young, and in August 2019 I had a big birthday and realized that, yes, after all these years I really should see if I can make something work.

So—along with the two young physicists who’d encouraged me—I began in earnest in October 2019. It helped that—after a lifetime of developing them—we now had great computational tools. And it wasn’t long before we started finding what I might call “very interesting things”. We reproduced, more elegantly, what I had done in the 1990s. And from tiny, structureless rules out were coming space, time, relativity, gravity and hints of quantum mechanics.

We were doing zillions of computer experiments, building intuition. And gradually things were becoming clearer. We started understanding how quantum mechanics works. Then we realized what energy is. We found an outline derivation of my late friend and mentor Richard Feynman’s path integral. We started seeing some deep structural connections between relativity and quantum mechanics. Everything just started falling into place. All those things I’d known about in physics for nearly 50 years—and finally we had a way to see not just what was true, but why.

I hadn’t ever imagined anything like this would happen. I expected that we’d start exploring simple rules and gradually, if we were lucky, we’d get hints here or there about connections to physics. I thought maybe we’d be able to have a possible model for the first seconds of the universe, but we’d spend years trying to see whether it might actually connect to the physics we see today.

In the end, if we’re going to have a complete fundamental theory of physics, we’re going to have to find the specific rule for our universe. And I don’t know how hard that’s going to be. I don’t know if it’s going to take a month, a year, a decade or a century. A few months ago I would also have said that I don’t even know if we’ve got the right framework for finding it.

But I wouldn’t say that anymore. Too much has worked. Too many things have fallen into place. We don’t know if the precise details of how our rules are set up are correct, or how simple or not the final rules may be. But at this point I am certain that the basic framework we have is telling us fundamentally how physics works.

It’s always a test for scientific models to compare how much you put in with how much you get out. And I’ve never seen anything that comes close. What we put in is about as tiny as it could be. But what we’re getting out are huge chunks of the most sophisticated things that are known about physics. And what’s most amazing to me is that at least so far we’ve not run across a single thing where we’ve had to say “oh, to explain that we have to add something to our model”. Sometimes it’s not easy to see how things work, but so far it’s always just been a question of understanding what the model already says, not adding something new.

At the lowest level, the rules we’ve got are about as minimal as anything could be. (Amusingly, their basic structure can be expressed in a fraction of a line of symbolic Wolfram Language code.) And in their raw form, they don’t really engage with all the rich ideas and structure that exist, for example, in mathematics. But as soon as we start looking at the consequences of the rules when they’re applied zillions of times, it becomes clear that they’re very elegantly connected to a lot of wonderful recent mathematics.

There’s something similar with physics, too. The basic structure of our models seems alien and bizarrely different from almost everything that’s been done in physics for at least the past century or so. But as we’ve gotten further in investigating our models something amazing has happened: we’ve found that not just one, but many of the popular theoretical frameworks that have been pursued in physics in the past few decades are actually directly relevant to our models.

I was worried this was going to be one of those “you’ve got to throw out the old” advances in science. It’s not. Yes, the underlying structure of our models is different. Yes, the initial approach and methods are different. And, yes, a bunch of new ideas are needed. But to make everything work we’re going to have to build on a lot of what my physicist friends have been working so hard on for the past few decades.

And then there’ll be the physics experiments. If you’d asked me even a couple of months ago when we’d get anything experimentally testable from our models I would have said it was far away. And that it probably wouldn’t happen until we’d pretty much found the final rule. But it looks like I was wrong. And in fact we’ve already got some good hints of bizarre new things that might be out there to look for.

OK, so what do we need to do now? I’m thrilled to say that I think we’ve found a path to the fundamental theory of physics. We’ve built a paradigm and a framework (and, yes, we’ve built lots of good, practical, computational tools too). But now we need to finish the job. We need to work through a lot of complicated computation, mathematics and physics. And see if we can finally deliver the answer to how our universe fundamentally works.

It’s an exciting moment, and I want to share it. I’m looking forward to being deeply involved. But this isn’t just a project for me or our small team. This is a project for the world. It’s going to be a great achievement when it’s done. And I’d like to see it shared as widely as possible. Yes, a lot of what has to be done requires top-of-the-line physics and math knowledge. But I want to expose everything as broadly as possible, so everyone can be involved in—and I hope inspired by—what I think is going to be a great and historic intellectual adventure.

Today we’re officially launching our Physics Project. From here on, we’ll be livestreaming what we’re doing—sharing whatever we discover in real time with the world. (We’ll also soon be releasing more than 400 hours of video that we’ve already accumulated.) I’m posting all my working materials going back to the 1990s, and we’re releasing all our software tools. We’ll be putting out bulletins about progress, and there’ll be educational programs around the project.

Oh, yes, and we’re putting up a Registry of Notable Universes. It’s already populated with nearly a thousand rules. I don’t think any of the ones in there yet are our own universe—though I’m not completely sure. But sometime—I hope soon—there might just be a rule entered in the Registry that has all the right properties, and that we’ll slowly discover that, yes, this is it—our universe finally decoded.

How It Works

OK, so how does it all work? I’ve written a 448-page technical exposition (yes, I’ve been busy the past few months!). Another member of our team (Jonathan Gorard) has written two 60-page technical papers. And there’s other material available at the project website. But here I’m going to give a fairly non-technical summary of some of the high points.

It all begins with something very simple and very structureless. We can think of it as a collection of abstract relations between abstract elements. Or we can think of it as a hypergraph—or, in simple cases, a graph.

We might have a collection of relations like

{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}

that can be represented by a graph like

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModelPlot""][{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}, VertexLabels -> Automatic]

All we’re specifying here are the relations between elements (like {2,3}). The order in which we state the relations doesn’t matter (although the order within each relation does matter). And when we draw the graph, all that matters is what’s connected to what; the actual layout on the page is just a choice made for visual presentation. It also doesn’t matter what the elements are called. Here I’ve used numbers, but all that matters is that the elements are distinct.

OK, so what do we do with these collections of relations, or graphs? We just apply a simple rule to them, over and over again. Here’s an example of a possible rule:

{{x, y}, {x, z}} → {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}

What this rule says is to pick up two relations—from anywhere in the collection—and see if the elements in them match the pattern {{x,y},{x,z}} (or, in the Wolfram Language, {{x_,y_},{x_,z_}} ), where the two x’s can be anything, but both have to be the same, and the y and z can be anything. If there’s a match, then replace these two relations with the four relations on the right. The w that appears there is a new element that’s being created, and the only requirement is that it’s distinct from all other elements.

We can represent the rule as a transformation of graphs:

✕ RulePlot[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}], VertexLabels -> Automatic, ""RulePartsAspectRatio"" -> 0.5]

Now let’s apply the rule once to:

{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}

The {2,3} and {2,4} relations get matched, and the rule replaces them with four new relations, so the result is:

{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}}

We can represent this result as a graph (which happens to be rendered flipped relative to the graph above):

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}, {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}, 1][""FinalStatePlot"", VertexLabels -> Automatic]

OK, so what happens if we just keep applying the rule over and over? Here’s the result:

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}, {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}, 10, ""StatesPlotsList""]

Let’s do it a few more times, and make a bigger picture:

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}, {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}, 14, ""FinalStatePlot""]

What happened here? We have such a simple rule. Yet applying this rule over and over again produces something that looks really complicated. It’s not what our ordinary intuition tells us should happen. But actually—as I first discovered in the early 1980s—this kind of intrinsic, spontaneous generation of complexity turns out to be completely ubiquitous among simple rules and simple programs. And for example my book A New Kind of Science is about this whole phenomenon and why it’s so important for science and beyond.

But here what’s important about it is that it’s what’s going to make our universe, and everything in it. Let’s review again what we’ve seen. We started off with a simple rule that just tells us how to transform collections of relations. But what we get out is this complicated-looking object that, among other things, seems to have some definite shape.

We didn’t put in anything about this shape. We just gave a simple rule. And using that simple rule a graph was made. And when we visualize that graph, it comes out looking like it has a definite shape.

If we ignore all matter in the universe, our universe is basically a big chunk of space. But what is that space? We’ve had mathematical idealizations and abstractions of it for two thousand years. But what really is it? Is it made of something, and if so, what?

Well, I think it’s very much like the picture above. A whole bunch of what are essentially abstract points, abstractly connected together. Except that in the picture there are 6704 of these points, whereas in our real universe there might be more like 10400 of them, or even many more.

All Possible Rules

We don’t (yet) know an actual rule that represents our universe—and it’s almost certainly not the one we just talked about. So let’s discuss what possible rules there are, and what they typically do.

One feature of the rule we used above is that it’s based on collections of “binary relations”, containing pairs of elements (like {2,3}). But the same setup lets us also consider relations with more elements. For example, here’s a collection of two ternary relations:

{{1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}}

We can’t use an ordinary graph to represent things like this, but we can use a hypergraph—a construct where we generalize edges in graphs that connect pairs of nodes to “hyperedges” that connect any number of nodes:

✕ ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][{{1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}}, VertexLabels -> Automatic]

(Notice that we’re dealing with directed hypergraphs, where the order in which nodes appear in a hyperedge matters. In the picture, the “membranes” are just indicating which nodes are connected to the same hyperedge.)

We can make rules for hypergraphs too:

{{x, y, z}} → {{w, w, y}, {w, x, z}}

✕ RulePlot[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}} -> {{4, 4, 2}, {4, 1, 3}}]]

And now here’s what happens if we run this rule starting from the simplest possible ternary hypergraph—the ternary self-loop {{0,0,0}}:

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}} -> {{4, 4, 2}, {4, 1, 3}}, {{0, 0, 0}}, 8][""StatesPlotsList"", ""MaxImageSize"" -> 180]

Alright, so what happens if we just start picking simple rules at random? Here are some of the things they do:

✕ urules24 = Import[""https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/Data/22-24-\ 2x0-unioned-summary.wxf""]; SeedRandom[6783]; GraphicsGrid[ Partition[ ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][List @@@ EdgeList[#]] & /@ Take[Select[ ParallelMap[ UndirectedGraph[ Rule @@@ ResourceFunction[""WolframModel""][#, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 8, ""FinalState""], GraphLayout -> ""SpringElectricalEmbedding""] &, #Rule & /@ RandomSample[urules24, 150]], EdgeCount[#] > 10 && ConnectedGraphQ[#] &], 60], 10], ImageSize -> Full]

Somehow this looks very zoological (and, yes, these models are definitely relevant for things other than fundamental physics—though probably particularly molecular-scale construction). But basically what we see here is that there are various common forms of behavior, some simple, and some not.

Here are some samples of the kinds of things we see:

✕ GraphicsGrid[ Partition[ ParallelMap[ ResourceFunction[""WolframModel""][#[[1]], #[[2]], #[[3]], ""FinalStatePlot""] &, {{{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{1, 2}, {1, 4}, {2, 4}, {4, 3}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 12}, {{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{1, 4}, {1, 4}, {2, 4}, {3, 2}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 10}, {{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{2, 2}, {2, 4}, {1, 4}, {3, 4}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 10}, {{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {1, 4}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 10}, {{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {4, 1}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 12}, {{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{2, 4}, {2, 1}, {4, 1}, {4, 3}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 9}, {{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{2, 4}, {2, 4}, {1, 4}, {3, 4}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 10}, {{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{2, 4}, {2, 4}, {2, 1}, {3, 4}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 10}, {{{1, 2}, {1, 3}} -> {{4, 1}, {1, 4}, {4, 2}, {4, 3}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 12}, {{{1, 2}, {2, 3}} -> {{1, 2}, {2, 1}, {4, 1}, {4, 3}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 10}, {{{1, 2}, {2, 3}} -> {{1, 3}, {1, 4}, {3, 4}, {3, 2}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 10}, {{{1, 2}, {2, 3}} -> {{2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {1, 2}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 9}}], 4], ImageSize -> Full]

And the big question is: if we were to run rules like these long enough, would they end up making something that reproduces our physical universe? Or, put another way, out in this computational universe of simple rules, can we find our physical universe?

A big question, though, is: How would we know? What we’re seeing here are the results of applying rules a few thousand times; in our actual universe they may have been applied 10500 times so far, or even more. And it’s not easy to bridge that gap. And we have to work it from both sides. First, we have to use the best summary of the operation of our universe that what we’ve learned in physics over the past few centuries has given us. And second, we have to go as far as we can in figuring out what our rules actually do.

And here there’s potentially a fundamental problem: the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. One of the great achievements of the mathematical sciences, starting about three centuries ago, has been delivering equations and formulas that basically tell you how a system will behave without you having to trace each step in what the system does. But many years ago I realized that in the computational universe of possible rules, this very often isn’t possible. Instead, even if you know the exact rule that a system follows, you may still not be able to work out what the system will do except by essentially just tracing every step it takes.

One might imagine that—once we know the rule for some system—then with all our computers and brainpower we’d always be able to “jump ahead” and work out what the system would do. But actually there’s something I call the Principle of Computational Equivalence, which says that almost any time the behavior of a system isn’t obviously simple, it’s computationally as sophisticated as anything. So we won’t be able to “outcompute” it—and to work out what it does will take an irreducible amount of computational work.

Well, for our models of the universe this is potentially a big problem. Because we won’t be able to get even close to running those models for as long as the universe does. And at the outset it’s not clear that we’ll be able to tell enough from what we can do to see if it matches up with physics.

But the big recent surprise for me is that we seem to be lucking out. We do know that whenever there’s computational irreducibility in a system, there are also an infinite number of pockets of computational reducibility. But it’s completely unclear whether in our case those pockets will line up with things we know from physics. And the surprise is that it seems a bunch of them do.

What Is Space?

Let’s look at a particular, simple rule from our infinite collection:

{{x, y, y}, {z, x, u}} → {{y, v, y}, {y, z, v}, {u, v, v}}

✕ RulePlot[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 2}, {3, 1, 4}} -> {{2, 5, 2}, {2, 3, 5}, {4, 5, 5}}]]

Here’s what it does:

✕ ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][#, ImageSize -> 50] & /@ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{{1, 2, 2}, {3, 1, 4}} -> {{2, 5, 2}, {2, 3, 5}, {4, 5, 5}}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 20, ""StatesList""]

And after a while this is what happens:

✕ Row[Append[ Riffle[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 2}, {3, 1, 4}} -> {{2, 5, 2}, {2, 3, 5}, {4, 5, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, #, ""FinalStatePlot""] & /@ {200, 500}, "" ... ""], "" ...""]]

It’s basically making us a very simple “piece of space”. If we keep on going longer and longer it’ll make a finer and finer mesh, to the point where what we have is almost indistinguishable from a piece of a continuous plane.

Here’s a different rule:

{{x, x, y}, {z, u, x}} → {{u, u, z}, {v, u, v}, {v, y, x}}

✕ RulePlot[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, x, y}, {z, u, x}} -> {{u, u, z}, {v, u, v}, {v, y, x}}]]

✕ ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][#, ImageSize -> 50] & /@ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 1}} -> {{4, 4, 3}, {5, 4, 5}, {5, 2, 1}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 20, ""StatesList""]

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 1}} -> {{4, 4, 3}, {5, 4, 5}, {5, 2, 1}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 2000, ""FinalStatePlot""]

It looks it’s “trying to make” something 3D. Here’s another rule:

{{x, y, z}, {u, y, v}} → {{w, z, x}, {z, w, u}, {x, y, w}}

✕ RulePlot[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 2, 5}} -> {{6, 3, 1}, {3, 6, 4}, {1, 2, 6}}]]

✕ ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][#, ImageSize -> 50] & /@ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y, z}, {u, y, v}} -> {{w, z, x}, {z, w, u}, {x, y, w}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 20, ""StatesList""]

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 2, 5}} -> {{6, 3, 1}, {3, 6, 4}, {1, 2, 6}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 1000, ""FinalStatePlot""]

Isn’t this strange? We have a rule that’s just specifying how to rewrite pieces of an abstract hypergraph, with no notion of geometry, or anything about 3D space. And yet it produces a hypergraph that’s naturally laid out as something that looks like a 3D surface.

Even though the only thing that’s really here is connections between points, we can “guess” where a surface might be, then we can show the result in 3D:

✕ ResourceFunction[""GraphReconstructedSurface""][ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][ {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 2, 5}} -> {{6, 3, 1}, {3, 6, 4}, {1, 2, 6}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 2000, ""FinalState""]]

If we keep going, then like the example of the plane, the mesh will get finer and finer, until basically our rule has grown us—point by point, connection by connection—something that’s like a continuous 3D surface of the kind you might study in a calculus class. Of course, in some sense, it’s not “really” that surface: it’s just a hypergraph that represents a bunch of abstract relations—but somehow the pattern of those relations gives it a structure that’s a closer and closer approximation to the surface.

And this is basically how I think space in the universe works. Underneath, it’s a bunch of discrete, abstract relations between abstract points. But at the scale we’re experiencing it, the pattern of relations it has makes it seem like continuous space of the kind we’re used to. It’s a bit like what happens with, say, water. Underneath, it’s a bunch of discrete molecules bouncing around. But to us it seems like a continuous fluid.

Needless to say, people have thought that space might ultimately be discrete ever since antiquity. But in modern physics there was never a way to make it work—and anyway it was much more convenient for it to be continuous, so one could use calculus. But now it’s looking like the idea of space being discrete is actually crucial to getting a fundamental theory of physics.

The Dimensionality of Space

A very fundamental fact about space as we experience it is that it is three-dimensional. So can our rules reproduce that? Two of the rules we just saw produce what we can easily recognize as two-dimensional surfaces—in one case flat, in the other case arranged in a certain shape. Of course, these are very bland examples of (two-dimensional) space: they are effectively just simple grids. And while this is what makes them easy to recognize, it also means that they’re not actually much like our universe, where there’s in a sense much more going on.

So, OK, take a case like:

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 3, 5}} -> {{3, 5, 2}, {5, 2, 4}, {2, 1, 6}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 22, ""FinalStatePlot""]

If we were to go on long enough, would this make something like space, and, if so, with how many dimensions? To know the answer, we have to have some robust way to measure dimension. But remember, the pictures we’re drawing are just visualizations; the underlying structure is a bunch of discrete relations defining a hypergraph—with no information about coordinates, or geometry, or even topology. And, by the way, to emphasize that point, here is the same graph—with exactly the same connectivity structure—rendered four different ways:

✕ GridGraph[{10, 10}, GraphLayout -> #, VertexStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][""SpatialGraph"", ""VertexStyle""], EdgeStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][""SpatialGraph"", ""EdgeLineStyle""] ] & /@ {""SpringElectricalEmbedding"", ""TutteEmbedding"", ""RadialEmbedding"", ""DiscreteSpiralEmbedding""}

But getting back to the question of dimension, recall that the area of a circle is πr2; the volume of a sphere is . In general, the “volume” of the d-dimensional analog of a sphere is a constant multiplied by rd. But now think about our hypergraph. Start at some point in the hypergraph. Then follow r hyperedges in all possible ways. You’ve effectively made the analog of a “spherical ball” in the hypergraph. Here are examples for graphs corresponding to 2D and 3D lattices:

✕ MakeBallPicture[g_, rmax_] := Module[{gg = UndirectedGraph[g], cg}, cg = GraphCenter[gg]; Table[HighlightGraph[gg, NeighborhoodGraph[gg, cg, r]], {r, 0, rmax}]]; Graph[#, ImageSize -> 60, VertexStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][""SpatialGraph"", ""VertexStyle""], EdgeStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][""SpatialGraph"", ""EdgeLineStyle""] ] & /@ MakeBallPicture[GridGraph[{11, 11}], 7]

✕ MakeBallPicture[g_, rmax_] := Module[{gg = UndirectedGraph[g], cg}, cg = GraphCenter[gg]; Table[HighlightGraph[gg, NeighborhoodGraph[gg, cg, r]], {r, 0, rmax}]]; Graph[#, ImageSize -> 80, VertexStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][""SpatialGraph"", ""VertexStyle""], EdgeStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][""SpatialGraph"", ""EdgeLineStyle""] ] & /@ MakeBallPicture[GridGraph[{7, 7, 7}], 5]

And if you now count the number of points reached by going “graph distance r” (i.e. by following r connections in the graph) you’ll find in these two cases that they indeed grow like r2 and r3.

So this gives us a way to measure the effective dimension of our hypergraphs. Just start at a particular point and see how many points you reach by going r steps:

✕ gg = UndirectedGraph[ ResourceFunction[""HypergraphToGraph""][ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}}, 11, ""FinalState""]]]; With[{cg = GraphCenter[gg]}, Table[HighlightGraph[gg, NeighborhoodGraph[gg, cg, r], ImageSize -> 90], {r, 6}]]

Now to work out effective dimension, we in principle just have to fit the results to rd. It’s a bit complicated, though, because we need to avoid small r (where every detail of the hypergraph is going to matter) and large r (where we’re hitting the edge of the hypergraph)—and we also need to think about how our “space” is refining as the underlying system evolves. But in the end we can generate a series of fits for the effective dimension—and in this case these say that the effective dimension is about 2.7:

✕ HypergraphDimensionEstimateList[hg_] := ResourceFunction[""LogDifferences""][ MeanAround /@ Transpose[ Values[ResourceFunction[""HypergraphNeighborhoodVolumes""][hg, All, Automatic]]]]; ListLinePlot[ Select[Length[#] > 3 &][ HypergraphDimensionEstimateList /@ Drop[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}}, 16, ""StatesList""], 4]], Frame -> True, PlotStyle -> {Hue[0.9849884156577183, 0.844661839156126, 0.63801], Hue[0.05, 0.9493847125498949, 0.954757], Hue[ 0.0889039442504032, 0.7504362741954692, 0.873304], Hue[ 0.06, 1., 0.8], Hue[0.12, 1., 0.9], Hue[0.08, 1., 1.], Hue[ 0.98654716551403, 0.6728487861309527, 0.733028], Hue[ 0.04, 0.68, 0.9400000000000001], Hue[ 0.9945149844324427, 0.9892162267509705, 0.823529], Hue[ 0.9908289627180552, 0.4, 0.9]}]

If we do the same thing for

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 2}, {3, 1, 4}} -> {{2, 5, 2}, {2, 3, 5}, {4, 5, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 200, ""FinalStatePlot""]

it’s limiting to dimension 2, as it should:

✕ CenteredDimensionEstimateList[g_Graph] := ResourceFunction[""LogDifferences""][ N[First[Values[ ResourceFunction[""GraphNeighborhoodVolumes""][g, GraphCenter[g]]]]]]; Show[ListLinePlot[ Table[CenteredDimensionEstimateList[ UndirectedGraph[ ResourceFunction[""HypergraphToGraph""][ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 2}, {3, 1, 4}} -> {{2, 5, 2}, {2, 3, 5}, {4, 5, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, t, ""FinalState""]]]], {t, 500, 2500, 500}], Frame -> True, PlotStyle -> {Hue[0.9849884156577183, 0.844661839156126, 0.63801], Hue[0.05, 0.9493847125498949, 0.954757], Hue[ 0.0889039442504032, 0.7504362741954692, 0.873304], Hue[ 0.06, 1., 0.8], Hue[0.12, 1., 0.9], Hue[0.08, 1., 1.], Hue[ 0.98654716551403, 0.6728487861309527, 0.733028], Hue[ 0.04, 0.68, 0.9400000000000001], Hue[ 0.9945149844324427, 0.9892162267509705, 0.823529], Hue[ 0.9908289627180552, 0.4, 0.9]}], Plot[2, {r, 0, 50}, PlotStyle -> Dotted]]

What does the fractional dimension mean? Well, consider fractals, which our rules can easily make:

{{x, y, z}} → {{x, u, w}, {y, v, u}, {z, w, v}}

✕ RulePlot[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}} -> {{1, 4, 6}, {2, 5, 4}, {3, 6, 5}}]]

✕ ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][#, ""MaxImageSize"" -> 100] & /@ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}} -> {{1, 4, 6}, {2, 5, 4}, {3, 6, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}}, 6, ""StatesList""]

If we measure the dimension here we get 1.58—the usual fractal dimension for a Sierpiński structure:

✕ HypergraphDimensionEstimateList[hg_] := ResourceFunction[""LogDifferences""][ MeanAround /@ Transpose[ Values[ResourceFunction[""HypergraphNeighborhoodVolumes""][hg, All, Automatic]]]]; Show[ ListLinePlot[ Drop[HypergraphDimensionEstimateList /@ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}} -> {{1, 4, 6}, {2, 5, 4}, {3, 6, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}}, 8, ""StatesList""], 2], PlotStyle -> {Hue[0.9849884156577183, 0.844661839156126, 0.63801], Hue[0.05, 0.9493847125498949, 0.954757], Hue[ 0.0889039442504032, 0.7504362741954692, 0.873304], Hue[ 0.06, 1., 0.8], Hue[0.12, 1., 0.9], Hue[0.08, 1., 1.], Hue[ 0.98654716551403, 0.6728487861309527, 0.733028], Hue[ 0.04, 0.68, 0.9400000000000001], Hue[ 0.9945149844324427, 0.9892162267509705, 0.823529], Hue[ 0.9908289627180552, 0.4, 0.9]}, Frame -> True, PlotRange -> {0, Automatic}], Plot[Log[2, 3], {r, 0, 150}, PlotStyle -> {Dotted}]]

Our rule above doesn’t create a structure that’s as regular as this. In fact, even though the rule itself is completely deterministic, the structure it makes looks quite random. But what our measurements suggest is that when we keep running the rule it produces something that’s like 2.7-dimensional space.

Of course, 2.7 is not 3, and presumably this particular rule isn’t the one for our particular universe (though it’s not clear what effective dimension it’d have if we ran it 10100 steps). But the process of measuring dimension shows an example of how we can start making “physics-connectable” statements about the behavior of our rules.

By the way, we’ve been talking about “making space” with our models. But actually, we’re not just trying to make space; we’re trying to make everything in the universe. In standard current physics, there’s space—described mathematically as a manifold—and serving as a kind of backdrop, and then there’s everything that’s in space, all the matter and particles and planets and so on.

But in our models there’s in a sense nothing but space—and in a sense everything in the universe must be “made of space”. Or, put another way, it’s the exact same hypergraph that’s giving us the structure of space, and everything that exists in space.

So what this means is that, for example, a particle like an electron or a photon must correspond to some local feature of the hypergraph, a bit like in this toy example:

✕ Graph[EdgeAdd[ EdgeDelete[ NeighborhoodGraph[ IndexGraph@ResourceFunction[""HexagonalGridGraph""][{6, 5}], {42, 48, 54, 53, 47, 41}, 4], {30 <-> 29, 42 <-> 41}], {30 <-> 41, 42 <-> 29}], VertexSize -> {Small, Alternatives @@ {30, 36, 42, 41, 35, 29} -> Large}, EdgeStyle -> {ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][ ""SpatialGraph"", ""EdgeLineStyle""], Alternatives @@ {30 \[UndirectedEdge] 24, 24 \[UndirectedEdge] 18, 18 \[UndirectedEdge] 17, 17 \[UndirectedEdge] 23, 23 \[UndirectedEdge] 29, 29 \[UndirectedEdge] 35, 35 \[UndirectedEdge] 34, 34 \[UndirectedEdge] 40, 40 \[UndirectedEdge] 46, 46 \[UndirectedEdge] 52, 52 \[UndirectedEdge] 58, 58 \[UndirectedEdge] 59, 59 \[UndirectedEdge] 65, 65 \[UndirectedEdge] 66, 66 \[UndirectedEdge] 60, 60 \[UndirectedEdge] 61, 61 \[UndirectedEdge] 55, 55 \[UndirectedEdge] 49, 49 \[UndirectedEdge] 54, 49 \[UndirectedEdge] 43, 43 \[UndirectedEdge] 37, 37 \[UndirectedEdge] 36, 36 \[UndirectedEdge] 30, 30 \[UndirectedEdge] 41, 42 \[UndirectedEdge] 29, 36 \[UndirectedEdge] 42, 35 \[UndirectedEdge] 41, 41 \[UndirectedEdge] 47, 47 \[UndirectedEdge] 53, 53 \[UndirectedEdge] 54, 54 \[UndirectedEdge] 48, 48 \[UndirectedEdge] 42} -> Directive[AbsoluteThickness[2.5], Darker[Red, .2]]}, VertexStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][""SpatialGraph"", ""VertexStyle""]]

To give a sense of scale, though, I have an estimate that says that 10200 times more “activity” in the hypergraph that represents our universe is going into “maintaining the structure of space” than is going into maintaining all the matter we know exists in the universe.

Curvature in Space & Einstein’s Equations

Here are a few structures that simple examples of our rules make:

✕ GraphicsRow[{ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 2}, {1, 3, 4}} -> {{4, 5, 5}, {5, 3, 2}, {1, 2, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 1000, ""FinalStatePlot""], ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 1, 2}, {1, 3, 4}} -> {{4, 4, 5}, {5, 4, 2}, {3, 2, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 1000, ""FinalStatePlot""], ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 1}} -> {{3, 3, 5}, {2, 5, 1}, {2, 6, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 2000, ""FinalStatePlot""]}, ImageSize -> Full]

But while all of these look like surfaces, they’re all obviously different. And one way to characterize them is by their local curvature. Well, it turns out that in our models, curvature is a concept closely related to dimension—and this fact will actually be critical in understanding, for example, how gravity arises.

But for now, let’s talk about how one would measure curvature on a hypergraph. Normally the area of a circle is πr2. But let’s imagine that we’ve drawn a circle on the surface of a sphere, and now we’re measuring the area on the sphere that’s inside the circle:

✕ cappedSphere[angle_] := Module[{u, v}, With[{spherePoint = {Cos[u] Sin[v], Sin[u] Sin[v], Cos[v]}}, Graphics3D[{First@ ParametricPlot3D[spherePoint, {v, #1, #2}, {u, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, Mesh -> None, ##3] & @@@ {{angle, \[Pi], PlotStyle -> Lighter[Yellow, .5]}, {0, angle, PlotStyle -> Lighter[Red, .3]}}, First@ParametricPlot3D[ spherePoint /. v -> angle, {u, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, PlotStyle -> Darker@Red]}, Boxed -> False, SphericalRegion -> False, Method -> {""ShrinkWrap"" -> True}]]]; Show[GraphicsRow[Riffle[cappedSphere /@ {0.3, Pi/6, .8}, Spacer[30]]], ImageSize -> 250]

This area is no longer πr2. Instead it’s π , where a is the radius of the sphere. In other words, as the radius of the circle gets bigger, the effect of being on the sphere is ever more important. (On the surface of the Earth, imagine a circle drawn around the North Pole; once it gets to the equator, it can never get any bigger.)

If we generalize to d dimensions, it turns out the formula for the growth rate of the volume is , where R is a mathematical object known as the Ricci scalar curvature.

So what this all means is that if we look at the growth rates of spherical balls in our hypergraphs, we can expect two contributions: a leading one of order rd that corresponds to effective dimension, and a “correction” of order r2 that represents curvature.

Here’s an example. Instead of giving a flat estimate of dimension (here equal to 2), we have something that dips down, reflecting the positive (“sphere-like”) curvature of the surface:

✕ res = CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/L1ylk12R""]; GraphicsRow[{ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 2, 5}} -> {{6, 3, 1}, {3, 6, 4}, {1, 2, 6}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 800, ""FinalState""]], ListLinePlot[res, Frame -> True, PlotStyle -> {Hue[0.9849884156577183, 0.844661839156126, 0.63801], Hue[0.05, 0.9493847125498949, 0.954757], Hue[ 0.0889039442504032, 0.7504362741954692, 0.873304], Hue[ 0.06, 1., 0.8], Hue[0.12, 1., 0.9], Hue[0.08, 1., 1.], Hue[ 0.98654716551403, 0.6728487861309527, 0.733028], Hue[ 0.04, 0.68, 0.9400000000000001], Hue[ 0.9945149844324427, 0.9892162267509705, 0.823529], Hue[ 0.9908289627180552, 0.4, 0.9]}]}]

What is the significance of curvature? One thing is that it has implications for geodesics. A geodesic is the shortest distance between two points. In ordinary flat space, geodesics are just lines. But when there’s curvature, the geodesics are curved:

✕ (*https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/TechPaper-Programs/\ Section-04/Geodesics-01.wl*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/L1PH6Rne""]; hyperboloidGeodesics = Table[ Part[ NDSolve[{Sinh[ 2 u[t]] ((2 Derivative[1][u][t]^2 - Derivative[1][v][t]^2)/( 2 Cosh[2 u[t]])) + Derivative[2][u][t] == 0, ((2 Tanh[ u[t]]) Derivative[1][u][t]) Derivative[1][v][t] + Derivative[2][v][ t] == 0, u[0] == -0.9, v[0] == v0, u[1] == 0.9, v[1] == v0}, { u[t], v[t]}, {t, 0, 1}, MaxSteps -> Infinity], 1], {v0, Range[-0.1, 0.1, 0.025]}]; {SphereGeodesics[Range[-.1, .1, .025]], PlaneGeodesics[Range[-.1, .1, .025]], Show[ParametricPlot3D[{Sinh[u], Cosh[u] Sin[v], Cos[v] Cosh[u]}, {u, -1, 1}, {v, -\[Pi]/3, \[Pi]/3}, Mesh -> False, Boxed -> False, Axes -> False, PlotStyle -> color], ParametricPlot3D[{Sinh[u[t]], Cosh[u[t]] Sin[v[t]], Cos[v[t]] Cosh[u[t]]} /. #, {t, 0, 1}, PlotStyle -> Red] & /@ hyperboloidGeodesics, ViewAngle -> 0.3391233203265557`, ViewCenter -> {{0.5`, 0.5`, 0.5`}, {0.5265689095305934`, 0.5477310383268459`}}, ViewPoint -> {1.7628482856617167`, 0.21653966523483362`, 2.8801868854502355`}, ViewVertical -> {-0.1654573174671554`, 0.1564093539158781`, 0.9737350718261054`}]}

In the case of positive curvature, bundles of geodesics converge; for negative curvature they diverge. But, OK, even though geodesics were originally defined for continuous space (actually, as the name suggests, for paths on the surface of the Earth), one can also have them in graphs (and hypergraphs). And it’s the same story: the geodesic is the shortest path between two points in the graph (or hypergraph).

Here are geodesics on the “positive-curvature surface” created by one of our rules:

✕ findShortestPath[edges_, endpoints : {{_, _} ...}] := FindShortestPath[ Catenate[Partition[#, 2, 1, 1] & /@ edges], #, #2] & @@@ endpoints; pathEdges[edges_, path_] := Select[Count[Alternatives @@ path]@# >= 2 &]@edges; plotGeodesic[edges_, endpoints : {{_, _} ...}, o : OptionsPattern[]] := With[{vertexPaths = findShortestPath[edges, endpoints]}, ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][edges, o, GraphHighlight -> Catenate[vertexPaths], EdgeStyle -> <| Alternatives @@ Catenate[pathEdges[edges, #] & /@ vertexPaths] -> Directive[AbsoluteThickness[4], Red]|>]]; plotGeodesic[edges_, endpoints : {__ : Except@List}, o : OptionsPattern[]] := plotGeodesic[edges, {endpoints}, o]; plotGeodesic[ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 2, 5}} -> {{6, 3, 1}, {3, 6, 4}, {1, 2, 6}}, Automatic, 1000, ""FinalState""], {{123, 721}, {24, 552}, {55, 671}}, VertexSize -> 0.12]

And here they are for a more complicated structure:

✕ (*https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/TechPaper-Programs/\ Section-04/Geodesics-01.wl*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/L1PH6Rne""];(*Geodesics*) gtest = UndirectedGraph[ Rule @@@ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}}, 10, ""FinalState""], Sequence[ VertexStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][ ""SpatialGraph"", ""VertexStyle""], EdgeStyle -> ResourceFunction[""WolframPhysicsProjectStyleData""][ ""SpatialGraph"", ""EdgeLineStyle""]] ]; Geodesics[gtest, #] & /@ {{{79, 207}}, {{143, 258}}}

Why are geodesics important? One reason is that in Einstein’s general relativity they’re the paths that light (or objects in “free fall”) follows in space. And in that theory gravity is associated with curvature in space. So when something is deflected going around the Sun, that happens because space around the Sun is curved, so the geodesic the object follows is also curved.

General relativity’s description of curvature in space turns out to all be based on the Ricci scalar curvature R that we encountered above (as well as the slightly more sophisticated Ricci tensor). But so if we want to find out if our models are reproducing Einstein’s equations for gravity, we basically have to find out if the Ricci curvatures that arise from our hypergraphs are the same as the theory implies.

There’s quite a bit of mathematical sophistication involved (for example, we have to consider curvature in space+time, not just space), but the bottom line is that, yes, in various limits, and subject to various assumptions, our models do indeed reproduce Einstein’s equations. (At first, we’re just reproducing the vacuum Einstein equations, appropriate when there’s no matter involved; when we discuss matter, we’ll see that we actually get the full Einstein equations.)

It’s a big deal to reproduce Einstein’s equations. Normally in physics, Einstein’s equations are what you start from (or sometimes they arise as a consistency condition for a theory): here they’re what comes out as an emergent feature of the model.

It’s worth saying a little about how the derivation works. It’s actually somewhat analogous to the derivation of the equations of fluid flow from the limit of the underlying dynamics of lots of discrete molecules. But in this case, it’s the structure of space rather than the velocity of a fluid that we’re computing. It involves some of the same kinds of mathematical approximations and assumptions, though. One has to assume, for example, that there’s enough effective randomness generated in the system that statistical averages work. There is also a whole host of subtle mathematical limits to take. Distances have to be large compared to individual hypergraph connections, but small compared to the whole size of the hypergraph, etc.

It’s pretty common for physicists to “hack through” the mathematical niceties. That’s actually happened for nearly a century in the case of deriving fluid equations from molecular dynamics. And we’re definitely guilty of the same thing here. Which in a sense is another way of saying that there’s lots of nice mathematics to do in actually making the derivation rigorous, and understanding exactly when it’ll apply, and so on.

By the way, when it comes to mathematics, even the setup that we have is interesting. Calculus has been built to work in ordinary continuous spaces (manifolds that locally approximate Euclidean space). But what we have here is something different: in the limit of an infinitely large hypergraph, it’s like a continuous space, but ordinary calculus doesn’t work on it (not least because it isn’t necessarily integer-dimensional). So to really talk about it well, we have to invent something that’s kind of a generalization of calculus, that’s for example capable of dealing with curvature in fractional-dimensional space. (Probably the closest current mathematics to this is what’s been coming out of the very active field of geometric group theory.)

It’s worth noting, by the way, that there’s a lot of subtlety in the precise tradeoff between changing the dimension of space, and having curvature in it. And while we think our universe is three-dimensional, it’s quite possible according to our models that there are at least local deviations—and most likely there were actually large deviations in the early universe.

Time

In our models, space is defined by the large-scale structure of the hypergraph that represents our collection of abstract relations. But what then is time?

For the past century or so, it’s been pretty universally assumed in fundamental physics that time is in a sense “just like space”—and that one should for example lump space and time together and talk about the “spacetime continuum”. And certainly the theory of relativity points in this direction. But if there’s been one “wrong turn” in the history of physics in the past century, I think it’s the assumption that space and time are the same kind of thing. And in our models they’re not—even though, as we’ll see, relativity comes out just fine.

So what then is time? In effect it’s much as we experience it: the inexorable process of things happening and leading to other things. But in our models it’s something much more precise: it’s the progressive application of rules, that continually modify the abstract structure that defines the contents of the universe.

The version of time in our models is in a sense very computational. As time progresses we are in effect seeing the results of more and more steps in a computation. And indeed the phenomenon of computational irreducibility implies that there is something definite and irreducible “achieved” by this process. (And, for example, this irreducibility is what I believe is responsible for the “encrypting” of initial conditions that is associated with the law of entropy increase, and the thermodynamic arrow of time.) Needless to say, of course, our modern computational paradigm did not exist a century ago when “spacetime” was introduced, and perhaps if it had, the history of physics might have been very different.

But, OK, so in our models time is just the progressive application of rules. But there is a subtlety in exactly how this works that might at first seem like a detail, but that actually turns out to be huge, and in fact turns out to be the key to both relativity and quantum mechanics.

At the beginning of this piece, I talked about the rule

{{x, y}, {x, z}} → {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}

✕ RulePlot[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}], VertexLabels -> Automatic, ""RulePartsAspectRatio"" -> 0.55]

and showed the “first few steps” in applying it

✕ ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""] /@ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}, {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}, 4, ""StatesList""]

But how exactly did the rule get applied? What is “inside” these steps? The rule defines how to take two connections in the hypergraph (which in this case is actually just a graph) and transform them into four new connections, creating a new element in the process. So each “step” that we showed before actually consists of several individual “updating events” (where here newly added connections are highlighted, and ones that are about to be removed are dashed):

✕ With[{eo = ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}, {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}, 4]}, TakeList[eo[""EventsStatesPlotsList"", ImageSize -> 130], eo[""GenerationEventsCountList"", ""IncludeBoundaryEvents"" -> ""Initial""]]]

But now, here is the crucial point: this is not the only sequence of updating events consistent with the rule. The rule just says to find two adjacent connections, and if there are several possible choices, it says nothing about which one. And a crucial idea in our model is in a sense just to do all of them.

We can represent this with a graph that shows all possible paths:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/LmHho8Tr""]; (*newgraph*)newgraph[ Graph[ResourceFunction[""MultiwaySystem""][ ""WolframModel"" -> {{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}}, {{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}}, 3, ""StatesGraph"", VertexSize -> 3, PerformanceGoal -> ""Quality""], AspectRatio -> 1/2], {3, 0.7}]

For the very first update, there are two possibilities. Then for each of the results of these, there are four additional possibilities. But at the next update, something important happens: two of the branches merge. In other words, even though we have done a different sequence of updates, the outcome is the same.

Things rapidly get complicated. Here is the graph after one more update, now no longer trying to show a progression down the page:

✕ Graph[ResourceFunction[""MultiwaySystem""][ ""WolframModel"" -> {{{x, y}, {x, z}} -> {{x, z}, {x, w}, {y, w}, {z, w}}}, {{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}}, 4, ""StatesGraph"", VertexSize -> 3, PerformanceGoal -> ""Quality""]]

So how does this relate to time? What it says is that in the basic statement of the model there is not just one path of time; there are many paths, and many “histories”. But the model—and the rule that is used—determines all of them. And we have seen a hint of something else: that even if we might think we are following an “independent” path of history, it may actually merge with another path.

It will take some more discussion to explain how this all works. But for now let me say that what will emerge is that time is about causal relationships between things, and that in fact, even when the paths of history that are followed are different, these causal relationships can end up being the same—and that in effect, to an observer embedded in the system, there is still just a single thread of time.

The Graph of Causal Relationships

In the end it’s wonderfully elegant. But to get to the point where we can understand the elegant bigger picture we need to go through some detailed things. (It isn’t terribly surprising that a fundamental theory of physics—inevitably built on very abstract ideas—is somewhat complicated to explain, but so it goes.)

To keep things tolerably simple, I’m not going to talk directly about rules that operate on hypergraphs. Instead I’m going to talk about rules that operate on strings of characters. (To clarify: these are not the strings of string theory—although in a bizarre twist of “pun-becomes-science” I suspect that the continuum limit of the operations I discuss on character strings is actually related to string theory in the modern physics sense.)

OK, so let’s say we have the rule:

{A → BBB, BB → A}

This rule says that anywhere we see an A, we can replace it with BBB, and anywhere we see BB we can replace it with A. So now we can generate what we call the multiway system for this rule, and draw a “multiway graph” that shows everything that can happen:

✕ ResourceFunction[""MultiwaySystem""][{""A"" -> ""BBB"", ""BB"" -> ""A""}, {""A""}, 8, ""StatesGraph""]

At the first step, the only possibility is to use A→BBB to replace the A with BBB. But then there are two possibilities: replace either the first BB or the second BB—and these choices give different results. On the next step, though, all that can be done is to replace the A—in both cases giving BBBB.

So in other words, even though we in a sense had two paths of history that diverged in the multiway system, it took only one step for them to converge again. And if you trace through the picture above you’ll find out that’s what always happens with this rule: every pair of branches that is produced always merges, in this case after just one more step.

This kind of balance between branching and merging is a phenomenon I call “causal invariance”. And while it might seem like a detail here, it actually turns out that it’s at the core of why relativity works, why there’s a meaningful objective reality in quantum mechanics, and a host of other core features of fundamental physics.

But let’s explain why I call the property causal invariance. The picture above just shows what “state” (i.e. what string) leads to what other one. But at the risk of making the picture more complicated (and note that this is incredibly simple compared to the full hypergraph case), we can annotate the multiway graph by including the updating events that lead to each transition between states:

✕ LayeredGraphPlot[ ResourceFunction[""MultiwaySystem""][{""A"" -> ""BBB"", ""BB"" -> ""A""}, {""A""}, 8, ""EvolutionEventsGraph""], AspectRatio -> 1]

But now we can ask the question: what are the causal relationships between these events? In other words, what event needs to happen before some other event can happen? Or, said another way, what events must have happened in order to create the input that’s needed for some other event?

Let us go even further, and annotate the graph above by showing all the causal dependencies between events:

✕ LayeredGraphPlot[ ResourceFunction[""MultiwaySystem""][{""A"" -> ""BBB"", ""BB"" -> ""A""}, {""A""}, 7, ""EvolutionCausalGraph""], AspectRatio -> 1]

The orange lines in effect show which event has to happen before which other event—or what all the causal relationships in the multiway system are. And, yes, it’s complicated. But note that this picture shows the whole multiway system—with all possible paths of history—as well as the whole network of causal relationships within and between these paths.

But here’s the crucial thing about causal invariance: it implies that actually the graph of causal relationships is the same regardless of which path of history is followed. And that’s why I originally called this property “causal invariance”—because it says that with a rule like this, the causal properties are invariant with respect to different choices of the sequence in which updating is done.

And if one traced through the picture above (and went quite a few more steps), one would find that for every path of history, the causal graph representing causal relationships between events would always be:

✕ ResourceFunction[""SubstitutionSystemCausalGraph""][{""A"" -> ""BBB"", ""BB"" -> ""A""}, ""A"", 10] // LayeredGraphPlot

or, drawn differently,

✕ ResourceFunction[""SubstitutionSystemCausalGraph""][{""A"" -> ""BBB"", ""BB"" -> ""A""}, ""A"", 12]

The Importance of Causal Invariance

To understand more about causal invariance, it’s useful to look at an even simpler example: the case of the rule BA→AB. This rule says that any time there’s a B followed by an A in a string, swap these characters around. In other words, this is a rule that tries to sort a string into alphabetical order, two characters at a time.

Let’s say we start with BBBAAA. Then here’s the multiway graph that shows all the things that can happen according to the rule:

✕ Graph[ResourceFunction[""MultiwaySystem""][{""BA"" -> ""AB""}, ""BBBAAA"", 12, ""EvolutionEventsGraph""], AspectRatio -> 1.5] // LayeredGraphPlot

There are lots of different paths that can be followed, depending on which BA in the string the rule is applied to at each step. But the important thing we see is that at the end all the paths merge, and we get a single final result: the sorted string AAABBB. And the fact that we get this single final result is a consequence of the causal invariance of the rule. In a case like this where there’s a final result (as opposed to just evolving forever), causal invariance basically says: it doesn’t matter what order you do all the updates in; the result you’ll get will always be the same.

I’ve introduced causal invariance in the context of trying to find a model of fundamental physics—and I’ve said that it’s going to be critical to both relativity and quantum mechanics. But actually what amounts to causal invariance has been seen before in various different guises in mathematics, mathematical logic and computer science. (Its most common name is “confluence”, though there are some technical differences between this and what I call causal invariance.)

Think about expanding out an algebraic expression, like (x + (1 + x)2)(x + 2)2. You could expand one of the powers first, then multiply things out. Or you could multiply the terms first. It doesn’t matter what order you do the steps in; you’ll always get the same canonical form (which in this case Mathematica tells me is 4 + 16x + 17x2 + 7x3 + x4). And this independence of orders is essentially causal invariance.

Here’s one more example. Imagine you’ve got some recursive definition, say f[n_]:=f[n-1]+f[n-2] (with f[0]=f[1]=1 ). Now evaluate f[10] . First you get f[9]+f[8] . But what do you do next? Do you evaluate f[9] , or f[8] ? And then what? In the end, it doesn’t matter; you’ll always get 55. And this is another example of causal invariance.

When one thinks about parallel or asynchronous algorithms, it’s important if one has causal invariance. Because it means one can do things in any order—say, depth-first, breadth-first, or whatever—and one will always get the same answer. And that’s what’s happening in our little sorting algorithm above.

OK, but now let’s come back to causal relationships. Here’s the multiway system for the sorting process annotated with all causal relationships for all paths:

✕ Magnify[LayeredGraphPlot[ ResourceFunction[""MultiwaySystem""][{""BA"" -> ""AB""}, ""BBBAAA"", 12, ""EvolutionCausalGraph""], AspectRatio -> 1.5], .6]

And, yes, it’s a mess. But because there’s causal invariance, we know something very important: this is basically just a lot of copies of the same causal graph—a simple grid:

✕ centeredRange[n_] := # - Mean@# &@Range@n; centeredLayer[n_] := {#, n} & /@ centeredRange@n; diamondLayerSizes[layers_?OddQ] := Join[#, Reverse@Most@#] &@Range[(layers + 1)/2]; diamondCoordinates[layers_?OddQ] := Catenate@MapIndexed[ Thread@{centeredRange@#, (layers - First@#2)/2} &, diamondLayerSizes[layers]]; diamondGraphLayersCount[graph_] := 2 Sqrt[VertexCount@graph] - 1; With[{graph = ResourceFunction[""SubstitutionSystemCausalGraph""][{""BA"" -> ""AB""}, ""BBBBAAAA"", 12]}, Graph[graph, VertexCoordinates -> diamondCoordinates@diamondGraphLayersCount@graph, VertexSize -> .2]]

(By the way—as the picture suggests—the cross-connections between these copies aren’t trivial, and later on we’ll see they’re associated with deep relations between relativity and quantum mechanics, that probably manifest themselves in the physics of black holes. But we’ll get to that later…)

OK, so every different way of applying the sorting rule is supposed to give the same causal graph. So here’s one example of how we might apply the rule starting with a particular initial string:

✕ evo = (SeedRandom[2424]; ResourceFunction[ ""SubstitutionSystemCausalEvolution""][{""BA"" -> ""AB""}, ""BBAAAABAABBABBBBBAAA"", 15, {""Random"", 4}]); ResourceFunction[""SubstitutionSystemCausalPlot""][evo, EventLabels -> False, CellLabels -> True, CausalGraph -> False]

But now let’s show the graph of causal connections. And we see it’s just a grid:

✕ evo = (SeedRandom[2424]; ResourceFunction[ ""SubstitutionSystemCausalEvolution""][{""BA"" -> ""AB""}, ""BBAAAABAABBABBBBBAAA"", 15, {""Random"", 4}]); ResourceFunction[""SubstitutionSystemCausalPlot""][evo, EventLabels -> False, CellLabels -> False, CausalGraph -> True]

Here are three other possible sequences of updates:

✕ SeedRandom[242444]; GraphicsRow[ Table[ResourceFunction[""SubstitutionSystemCausalPlot""][ ResourceFunction[ ""SubstitutionSystemCausalEvolution""][{""BA"" -> ""AB""}, ""BBAAAABAABBABBBBBAAA"", 15, {""Random"", 4}], EventLabels -> False, CellLabels -> False, CausalGraph -> True], 3], ImageSize -> Full]

But now we see causal invariance in action: even though different updates occur at different times, the graph of causal relationships between updating events is always the same. And having seen this—in the context of a very simple example—we’re ready to talk about special relativity.

Deriving Special Relativity

It’s a typical first instinct in thinking about doing science: you imagine doing an experiment on a system, but you—as the “observer”—are outside the system. Of course if you’re thinking about modeling the whole universe and everything in it, this isn’t ultimately a reasonable way to think about things. Because the “observer” is inevitably part of the universe, and so has to be modeled just like everything else.

In our models what this means is that the “mind of the observer”, just like everything else in the universe, has to get updated through a series of updating events. There’s no absolute way for the observer to “know what’s going on in the universe”; all they ever experience is a series of updating events, that may happen to be affected by updating events occurring elsewhere in the universe. Or, said differently, all the observer can ever observe is the network of causal relationships between events—or the causal graph that we’ve been talking about.

So as toy model let’s look at our BA→AB rule for strings. We might imagine that the string is laid out in space. But to our observer the only thing they know is the causal graph that represents causal relationships between events. And for the BA→AB system here’s one way we can draw that:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVkTxvC5""]; (*regularCausalGraphPlot*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) \ regularCausalGraphPlot[10, {0, 0}, {0.0, 0.0}, lorentz[0]]

But now let’s think about how observers might “experience” this causal graph. Underneath, an observer is getting updated by some sequence of updating events. But even though that’s “really what’s going on”, to make sense of it, we can imagine our observers setting up internal “mental” models for what they see. And a pretty natural thing for observers like us to do is just to say “one set of things happens all across the universe, then another, and so on”. And we can translate this into saying that we imagine a series of “moments” in time, where things happen “simultaneously” across the universe—at least with some convention for defining what we mean by simultaneously. (And, yes, this part of what we’re doing is basically following what Einstein did when he originally proposed special relativity.)

Here’s a possible way of doing it:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVkTxvC5""]; (*regularCausalGraphPlot*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) \ regularCausalGraphPlot[10, {1, 0}, {0.0, 0.0}, lorentz[0]]

One can describe this as a “foliation” of the causal graph. We’re dividing the causal graph into leaves or slices. And each slice our observers can consider to be a “successive moment in time”.

It’s important to note that there are some constraints on the foliation we can pick. The causal graph defines what event has to happen before what. And if our observers are going to have a chance of making sense of the world, it had better be the case that their notion of the progress of time aligns with what the causal graph says. So for example this foliation wouldn’t work—because basically it says that the time we assign to events is going to disagree with the order in which the causal graph says they have to happen:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVkTxvC5""]; (*regularCausalGraphPlot*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) \ regularCausalGraphPlot[6, {.2, 0}, {5, 0.0}, lorentz[0]]

But, so given the foliation above, what actual order of updating events does it imply? It basically just says: as many events as possible happen at the same time (i.e. in the same slice of the foliation), as in this picture:

✕ (*https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/TechPaper-Programs/\ Section-08/BoostedEvolution.wl*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/LbaDFVSn""]; (*boostedEvolution*) \ ResourceFunction[""SubstitutionSystemCausalPlot""][ boostedEvolution[ ResourceFunction[ ""SubstitutionSystemCausalEvolution""][{""BA"" -> ""AB""}, StringRepeat[""BA"", 10], 10], 0], EventLabels -> False, CellLabels -> True, CausalGraph -> False]

OK, now let’s connect this to physics. The foliation we had above is relevant to observers who are somehow “stationary with respect to the universe” (the “cosmological rest frame”). One can imagine that as time progresses, the events a particular observer experiences are ones in a column going vertically down the page:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVkTxvC5""]; (*regularCausalGraphPlot*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) \ regularCausalGraphPlot[5, {1, 0.01}, {0.0, 0.0}, {1.5, 0}, {Red, Directive[Dotted, Thick, Red]}, lorentz[0]]

But now let’s think about an observer who is uniformly moving in space. They’ll experience a different sequence of events, say:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVkTxvC5""]; (*regularCausalGraphPlot*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) \ regularCausalGraphPlot[5, {1, 0.01}, {0.0, 0.3}, {0.6, 0}, {Red, Directive[Dotted, Thick, Red]}, lorentz[0]]

And that means that the foliation they’ll naturally construct will be different. From the “outside” we can draw it on the causal graph like this:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVkTxvC5""]; (*regularCausalGraphPlot*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) \ regularCausalGraphPlot[10, {1, 0.01}, {0.3, 0.3}, {0, 0}, {Red, Directive[Dotted, Thick, Red]}, lorentz[0.]]

But to the observer each slice just represents a successive moment of time. And they don’t have any way to know how the causal graph was drawn. So they’ll construct their own version, where the slices are horizontal:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVkTxvC5""]; (*regularCausalGraphPlot*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) \ regularCausalGraphPlot[10, {1, 0.01}, {0.3, 0.3}, {0, 0}, {Red, Directive[Dotted, Thick, Red]}, lorentz[0.3]]

But now there’s a purely geometrical fact: to make this rearrangement, while preserving the basic structure (and here, angles) of the causal graph, each moment of time has to sample fewer events in the causal graph, by a factor of where β is the angle that represents the velocity of the observer.

If you know about special relativity, you’ll recognize a lot of this. What we’ve been calling foliations correspond directly to relativity’s “reference frames”. And our foliations that represent motion are the standard inertial reference frames of special relativity.

But here’s the special thing that’s going on here: we can interpret all this discussion of foliations and reference frames in terms of the actual rules and evolution of our underlying system. So here now is the evolution of our string-sorting system in the “boosted reference frame” corresponding to an observer going at a certain speed:

✕ (*https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/TechPaper-Programs/\ Section-08/BoostedEvolution.wl*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/LbaDFVSn""]; (*boostedEvolution*) \ ResourceFunction[""SubstitutionSystemCausalPlot""][ boostedEvolution[ ResourceFunction[ ""SubstitutionSystemCausalEvolution""][{""BA"" -> ""AB""}, StringRepeat[""BA"", 10], 10], 0.3], EventLabels -> False, CellLabels -> True, CausalGraph -> False]

And here’s the crucial point: because of causal invariance it doesn’t matter that we’re in a different reference frame—the causal graph for the system (and the way it eventually sorts the string) is exactly the same.

In special relativity, the key idea is that the “laws of physics” work the same in all inertial reference frames. But why should that be true? Well, in our systems, there’s an answer: it’s a consequence of causal invariance in the underlying rules. In other words, from the property of causal invariance, we’re able to derive relativity.

Normally in physics one puts in relativity by the way one sets up the mathematical structure of spacetime. But in our models we don’t start from anything like this, and in fact space and time are not even at all the same kind of thing. But what we can now see is that—because of causal invariance—relativity emerges in our models, with all the relationships between space and time that that implies.

So, for example, if we look at the picture of our string-sorting system above, we can see relativistic time dilation. In effect, because of the foliation we picked, time operates slower. Or, said another way, in the effort to sample space faster, our observer experiences slower updating of the system in time.

The speed of light c in our toy system is defined by the maximum rate at which information can propagate, which is determined by the rule, and in the case of this rule is one character per step. And in terms of this, we can then say that our foliation corresponds to a speed 0.3 c. But now we can look at the amount of time dilation, and it’s exactly the amount that relativity says it should be.

By the way, if we imagine trying to make our observer go “faster than light”, we can see that can’t work. Because there’s no way to tip the foliation at more than 45° in our picture, and still maintain the causal relationships implied by the causal graph.

OK, so in our toy model we can derive special relativity. But here’s the thing: this derivation isn’t specific to the toy model; it applies to any rule that has causal invariance. So even though we may be dealing with hypergraphs, not strings, and we may have a rule that shows all kinds of complicated behavior, if it ultimately has causal invariance, then (with various technical caveats, mostly about possible wildness in the causal graph) it will exhibit relativistic invariance, and a physics based on it will follow special relativity.

What Is Energy? What Is Mass?

In our model, everything in the universe—space, matter, whatever—is supposed to be represented by features of our evolving hypergraph. So within that hypergraph, is there a way to identify things that are familiar from current physics, like mass, or energy?

I have to say that although it’s a widespread concept in current physics, I’d never thought of energy as something fundamental. I’d just thought of it as an attribute that things (atoms, photons, whatever) can have. I never really thought of it as something that one could identify abstractly in the very structure of the universe.

So it came as a big surprise when we recently realized that actually in our model, there is something we can point to, and say “that’s energy!”, independent of what it’s the energy of. The technical statement is: energy corresponds to the flux of causal edges through spacelike hypersurfaces. And, by the way, momentum corresponds to the flux of causal edges through timelike hypersurfaces.

OK, so what does this mean? First, what’s a spacelike hypersurface? It’s actually a standard concept in general relativity, for which there’s a direct analogy in our models. Basically it’s what forms a slice in our foliation. Why is it called what it’s called? We can identify two kinds of directions: spacelike and timelike.

A spacelike direction is one that involves just moving in space—and it’s a direction where one can always reverse and go back. A timelike direction is one that involves also progressing through time—where one can’t go back. We can mark spacelike ( ) and timelike ( ) hypersurfaces in the causal graph for our toy model:

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVkTxvC5""]; (*regularCausalGraphPlot*) CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) \ regularCausalGraphPlot[10, {1, 0.5}, {0., 0.}, {-0.5, 0}, {Red, Directive[Dashed, Red]}, lorentz[0.]]

(They might be called “surfaces”, except that “surfaces” are usually thought of as 2-dimensional, and our 3-space + 1-time dimensional universe, these foliation slices are 3-dimensional: hence the term “hypersurfaces”.)

OK, now let’s look at the picture. The “causal edges” are the causal connections between events, shown in the picture as lines joining the events. So when we talk about a “flux of causal edges through spacelike hypersurfaces”, what we’re talking about is the net number of causal edges that go down through the horizontal slices in the pictures.

In the toy model that’s trivial to see. But here’s a causal graph from a simple hypergraph model, where it’s already considerably more complicated:

✕ Graph[ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][ {{x, y}, {z, y}} -> {{x, z}, {y, z}, {w, z}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 15, ""LayeredCausalGraph""], AspectRatio -> 1/2]

(Our toy-model causal graph starts from a line of events because we set up a long string as the initial condition; this starts from a single event because it’s starting from a minimal initial condition.)

But when we put a foliation on this causal graph (thereby effectively defining our reference frame) we can start counting how many causal edges go down through successive (“spacelike”) slices:

✕ foliationLines[{lineDensityHorizontal_ : 1, lineDensityVertical_ : 1}, {tanHorizontal_ : 0.0, tanVertical_ : 0.0}, offset : {_, _} : {0, 0}, lineStyles : {_, _} : {Red, Red}, transform_ : (# &)] := {If[lineDensityHorizontal != 0, Style[Table[ Line[transform /@ {{-100 + First@offset, k - 100 tanHorizontal + Last@offset}, {100 + First@offset, k + 100 tanHorizontal + Last@offset}}], {k, -100.5, 100.5, 1/lineDensityHorizontal}], First@lineStyles], {}], If[lineDensityVertical != 0, Style[Table[ Line[transform /@ {{k - 100 tanVertical + First@offset, -100 + Last@offset}, {k + 100 tanVertical + First@offset, 100 + Last@offset}}], {k, -100.5, 100.5, 1/lineDensityVertical}], Last@lineStyles], {}]}; ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {z, y}} -> {{x, z}, {y, z}, {w, z}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 15][""LayeredCausalGraph"", AspectRatio -> 1/2, Epilog -> foliationLines[{0.44, 0}, {0, 0}, {0, -0.5}, {Directive[Red, Opacity[0.2]], Red}]]

We can also ask how many causal edges go “sideways”, through timelike hypersurfaces:

✕ foliationLines[{lineDensityHorizontal_ : 1, lineDensityVertical_ : 1}, {tanHorizontal_ : 0.0, tanVertical_ : 0.0}, offset : {_, _} : {0, 0}, lineStyles : {_, _} : {Red, Red}, transform_ : (# &)] := {If[lineDensityHorizontal != 0, Style[Table[ Line[transform /@ {{-100 + First@offset, k - 100 tanHorizontal + Last@offset}, {100 + First@offset, k + 100 tanHorizontal + Last@offset}}], {k, -100.5, 100.5, 1/lineDensityHorizontal}], First@lineStyles], {}], If[lineDensityVertical != 0, Style[Table[ Line[transform /@ {{k - 100 tanVertical + First@offset, -100 + Last@offset}, {k + 100 tanVertical + First@offset, 100 + Last@offset}}], {k, -100.5, 100.5, 1/lineDensityVertical}], Last@lineStyles], {}]}; ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{x, y}, {z, y}} -> {{x, z}, {y, z}, {w, z}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 15][""LayeredCausalGraph"", AspectRatio -> 1/2, Epilog -> foliationLines[{0, 1/3}, {0, 0}, {2.1, 0}, {Directive[Red, Opacity[0.5]], Directive[Dotted, Opacity[0.7], Red]}]]

OK, so why do we think these fluxes of edges correspond to energy and momentum? Imagine what happens if we change our foliation, say tipping it to correspond to motion at some velocity, as we did in the previous section. It takes a little bit of math, but what we find out is that our fluxes of causal edges transform with velocity basically just like we saw distance and time transform in the previous section.

In the standard derivation of relativistic mechanics, there’s a consistency argument that energy has to transform with velocity like time does, and momentum like distance. But now we actually have a structural reason for this to be the case. It’s a fundamental consequence of our whole setup, and of causal invariance. In traditional physics, one often says that position is the conjugate variable to momentum, and energy to time. And that’s something that’s burnt into the mathematical structure of the theory. But here it’s not something we’re burning in; it’s something we’re deriving from the underlying structure of our model.

And that means there’s ultimately a lot more we can say about it. For example, we might wonder what the “zero of energy” is. After all, if we look at one of our causal graphs, a lot of the causal edges are really just going into “maintaining the structure of space”. So if in a sense space is uniform, there’s inevitably a uniform “background flux” of causal edges associated with that. And whatever we consider to be “energy” corresponds to the fluctuations of that flux around its background value.

By the way, it’s worth mentioning what a “flux of causal edges” corresponds to. Each causal edge represents a causal connection between events, that is in a sense “carried” by some element in the underlying hypergraph (the “spatial hypergraph”). So a “flux of causal edges” is in effect the communication of activity (i.e. events), either in time (i.e. through spacelike hypersurfaces) or in space (i.e. through timelike hypersurfaces). And at least in some approximation we can then say that energy is associated with activity in the hypergraph that propagates information through time, while momentum is associated with activity that propagates information in space.

There’s a fundamental feature of our causal graphs that we haven’t mentioned yet—that’s related to information propagation. Start at any point (i.e. any event) in a causal graph. Then trace the causal connections from that event. You’ll get some kind of cone (here just in 2D):

✕ CloudGet[""https://wolfr.am/KVl97Tf4""];(*lorentz*) foliationLines[{lineDensityHorizontal_ : 1, lineDensityVertical_ : 1}, {tanHorizontal_ : 0.0, tanVertical_ : 0.0}, offset : {_, _} : {0, 0}, lineStyles : {_, _} : {Red, Red}, transform_ : (# &)] := {If[lineDensityHorizontal != 0, Style[Table[ Line[transform /@ {{-100 + First@offset, k - 100 tanHorizontal + Last@offset}, {100 + First@offset, k + 100 tanHorizontal + Last@offset}}], {k, -100.5, 100.5, 1/lineDensityHorizontal}], First@lineStyles], {}], If[lineDensityVertical != 0, Style[Table[ Line[transform /@ {{k - 100 tanVertical + First@offset, -100 + Last@offset}, {k + 100 tanVertical + First@offset, 100 + Last@offset}}], {k, -100.5, 100.5, 1/lineDensityVertical}], Last@lineStyles], {}]}; squareCausalGraphPlot[ layerCount_ : 9, {lineDensityHorizontal_ : 1, lineDensityVertical_ : 1}, {tanHorizontal_ : 0.0, tanVertical_ : 0.0}, offset : {_, _} : {0, 0}, lineStyles : {_, _} : {Red, Red}, transform_ : (# &)] := NeighborhoodGraph[ DirectedGraph[ Flatten[Table[{v[{i + 1, j}] -> v[{i, j}], v[{i + 1, j + 1}] -> v[{i, j}]}, {i, layerCount - 1}, {j, 1 + Round[-layerCount/2 + i/2], (layerCount + i)/2}]], VertexCoordinates -> Catenate[ Table[v[{i, j}] -> transform[{2 (#2 - #1/2), #1} & @@ {i, j}], {i, layerCount + 1}, {j, 1 + Round[-layerCount/2 + i/2] - 1, (layerCount + i)/2 + 1}]], VertexSize -> .33, VertexStyle -> Directive[Directive[Opacity[.7], Hue[0.14, 0.34, 1.]], EdgeForm[Directive[Opacity[0.4], Hue[0.09, 1., 0.91]]]], VertexShapeFunction -> ""Rectangle"", Epilog -> foliationLines[{lineDensityHorizontal, lineDensityVertical}, {tanHorizontal, tanVertical}, offset, lineStyles, transform]], v[{1, 1}], 9]; With[{graph = squareCausalGraphPlot[ 10, {0, 0}, {0., 0.}, {-0.5, 0}, {Red, Directive[Dotted, Red]}, lorentz[0.]]}, Graph[graph, VertexStyle -> {Directive[ Directive[Opacity[.7], Hue[0.14, 0.34, 1.]], EdgeForm[Directive[Opacity[0.4], Hue[0.09, 1., 0.91]]]], Alternatives @@ VertexOutComponent[graph, v[{9, 5}]] -> Directive[Directive[Opacity[.6], Hue[0, 0.45, 0.87]], EdgeForm[ Hue[0, 1, 0.48]]]}]]

The cone is more complicated in a more complicated causal graph. But you’ll always have something like it. And what it corresponds to physically is what’s normally called a light cone (or “forward light cone”). Assuming we’ve drawn our causal network so that events are somehow laid out in space across the page, then the light cone will show how information (as transmitted by light) can spread in space with time.

When the causal graph gets complicated, the whole setup with light cones gets complicated, as we’ll discuss for example in connection with black holes later. But for now, we can just say there are cones in our causal graph, and in effect the angle of these cones represents the maximum rate of information propagation in the system, which we can identify with the physical speed of light.

And in fact, not only can we identify light cones in our causal graph: in some sense we can think of our whole causal graph as just being a large number of “elementary light cones” all knitted together. And, as we mentioned, much of the structure that’s built necessarily goes into, in effect, “maintaining the structure of space”.

But let’s look more closely at our light cones. There are causal edges on their boundaries that in effect correspond to propagation at the speed of light—and that, in terms of the underlying hypergraph, correspond to events that “reach out” in the hypergraph, and “entrain” new elements as quickly as possible. But what about causal edges that are “more vertical”? These causal edges are associated with events that in a sense reuse elements in the hypergraph, without involving new ones.

And it looks like these causal edges have an important interpretation: they are associated with mass (or, more specifically, rest mass). OK, so the total flux of causal edges through spacelike hypersurfaces corresponds to energy. And now we’re saying that the flux of causal edges specifically in the timelike direction corresponds to rest mass. We can see what happens if we “tip our reference” frames just a bit, say corresponding to a velocity v ≪ c. Again, there’s a small amount of math, but it’s pretty easy to derive formulas for momentum (p) and energy (E). The speed of light c comes into the formulas because it defines the ratio of “horizontal” (i.e. spacelike) to “vertical” (i.e timelike) distances on the causal graph. And for v small compared to c we get:

So from these formulas we can see that just by thinking about causal graphs (and, yes, with a backdrop of causal invariance, and a whole host of detailed mathematical limit questions that we’re not discussing here), we’ve managed to derive a basic (and famous) fact about the relation between energy and mass:

Sometimes in the standard formalism of physics, this relation by now seems more like a definition than something to derive. But in our model, it’s not just a definition, and in fact we can successfully derive it.

General Relativity & Gravity

Earlier on, we talked about how curvature of space can arise in our models. But at that point we were just talking about “empty space”. Now we can go back and also talk about how curvature interacts with mass and energy in space.

In our earlier discussion, we talked about constructing spherical balls by starting at some point in the hypergraph, and then following all possible sequences of r connections. But now we can do something directly analogous in the causal graph: start at some point, and follow possible sequences of t connections. There’s quite a bit of mathematical trickiness, but essentially this gets us “volumes of light cones”.

If space is effectively d-dimensional, then to a first approximation this volume will grow like . But like in the spatial case, there’s a correction term, this time proportional to the so-called Ricci tensor . (The actual expression is roughly where the are timelike vectors, etc.)

OK, but we also know something else about what is supposed to be inside our light cones: not only are there “background connections” that maintain the structure of space, there are also “additional” causal edges that are associated with energy, momentum and mass. And in the limit of a large causal graph, we can identify the density of these with the so-called energy-momentum tensor . So in the end we have two contributions to the “volumes” of our light cones: one from “pure curvature” and one from energy-momentum.

Again, there’s some math involved. But the main thing is to think about the limit when we’re looking at a very large causal graph. What needs to be true for us to have d-dimensional space, as opposed to something much wilder? This puts a constraint on the growth rates of our light cone volumes, and when one works everything out, it implies that the following equation must hold:

But this is exactly Einstein’s equation for the curvature of space when matter with a certain energy-momentum is present. We’re glossing over lots of details here. But it’s still, in my view, quite spectacular: from the basic structure of our very simple models, we’re able to derive a fundamental result in physics: the equation that for more than a hundred years has passed every test in describing the operation of gravity.

There’s a footnote here. The equation we’ve just given is without a so-called cosmological term. And how that works is bound up with the question of what the zero of energy is, which in our model relates to what features of the evolving hypergraph just have to do with the “maintenance of space”, and what have to do with “things in space” (like matter).

In existing physics, there’s an expectation that even in the “vacuum” there’s actually a formally infinite density of pairs of virtual particles associated with quantum mechanics. Essentially what’s happening is that there are always pairs of particles and antiparticles being created, that annihilate quickly, but that in aggregate contribute a huge effective energy density. We’ll discuss how this relates to quantum mechanics in our models later. But for now let’s just recall that particles (like electrons) in our models basically correspond to locally stable structures in the hypergraph.

But when we think about how “space is maintained” it’s basically through all sorts of seemingly random updating events in the hypergraph. But in existing physics (or, specifically, quantum field theory) we’re basically expected to analyze everything in terms of (virtual) particles. So if we try to do that with all these random updating events, it’s not surprising that we end up saying that there are these infinite collections of things going on. (Yes, this can be made much more precise; I’m just giving an outline here.)

But as soon as we say this, there is an immediate problem: we’re saying that there’s a formally infinite—or at least huge—energy density that must exist everywhere in the universe. But if we then apply Einstein’s equation, we’ll conclude that this must produce enough curvature to basically curl the universe up into a tiny ball.

One way to get out of this is to introduce a so-called cosmological term, that’s just an extra term in the Einstein equations, and then posit that this term is sized so as to exactly cancel (yes, to perhaps one part in 1060 or more) the energy density from virtual particles. It’s certainly not a pretty solution.

But in our models, the situation is quite different. It’s not that we have virtual particles “in space”, that are having an effect on space. It’s that the same stuff that corresponds to the virtual particles is actually “making the space”, and maintaining its structure. Of course, there are lots of details about this—which no doubt depend on the particular underlying rule. But the point is that there’s no longer a huge mystery about why “vacuum energy” doesn’t basically destroy our universe: in effect, it’s because it’s what’s making our universe.

Black Holes, Singularities, etc.

One of the big predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes. So how do things like that work in our models? Actually, it’s rather straightforward. The defining feature of a black hole is the existence of an event horizon: a boundary that light signals can’t cross, and where in effect causal connection is broken.

In our models, we can explicitly see that happen in the causal graph. Here’s an example:

✕ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {0, 3}} -> {{1, 2}, {3, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {4, 4}}, {{0, 0}, {0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 20, ""CausalGraph""] // LayeredGraphPlot

At the beginning, everything is causally connected. But at some point the causal graph splits—and there’s an event horizon. Events happening on one side can’t influence ones on the other, and so on. And that’s how a region of the universe can “causally break off” to form something like a black hole.

But actually, in our models, the “breaking off” can be even more extreme. Not only can the causal graph split; the spatial hypergraph can actually throw off disconnected pieces—each of which in effect forms a whole “separate universe”:

✕ Framed[ResourceFunction[""WolframModelPlot""][#, ImageSize -> {UpTo[100], UpTo[60]}], FrameStyle -> LightGray] & /@ ResourceFunction[ ""WolframModel""][{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 3}} -> {{2, 6, 4}, {6, 1, 2}, {4, 2, 1}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 20, ""StatesList""]

By the way, it’s interesting to look at what happens to the foliations observers make when there’s an event horizon. Causal invariance says that paths in the causal graph that diverge should always eventually merge. But if the paths go into different disconnected pieces of the causal graph, that can’t ever happen. So how does an observer deal with that? Well, basically they have to “freeze time”. They have to have a foliation where successive time slices just pile up, and never enter the disconnected pieces.

It’s just like what happens in general relativity. To an observer far from the black hole, it’ll seem to take an infinite time for anything to fall into the black hole. For now, this is just a phenomenon associated with the structure of space. But later we’ll see that it’s also the direct analog of something completely different: the process of measurement in quantum mechanics.

Coming back to gravity: we can ask questions not only about event horizons, but also about actual singularities in spacetime. In our models, these are places where lots of paths in a causal graph converge to a single point. And in our models, we can immediately study questions like whether there’s always an event horizon associated with any singularity (the “cosmic censorship hypothesis”).

We can ask about other strange phenomena from general relativity. For example, there are closed timelike curves, sometimes viewed as allowing time travel. In our models, closed timelike curves are inconsistent with causal invariance. But we can certainly invent rules that produce them. Here’s an example:

✕ Graph[ResourceFunction[""MultiwaySystem""][{""AB"" -> ""BAB"", ""BA"" -> ""A""}, ""ABA"", 4, ""StatesGraph""], GraphLayout -> {""LayeredDigraphEmbedding"", ""RootVertex"" -> ""ABA""}]

We start from one “initial” state in this multiway system. But as we go forward we can enter a loop where we repeatedly visit the same state. And this loop also occurs in the causal graph. We think we’re “going forward in time”. But actually we’re just in a loop, repeatedly returning to the same state. And if we tried to make a foliation where we could describe time as always advancing, we just wouldn’t be able to do it.

Cosmology

In our model, the universe can start as a tiny hypergraph—perhaps a single self-loop. But then—as the rule gets applied—it progressively expands. With some particularly simple rules, the total size of the hypergraph has to just uniformly increase; with others it can fluctuate.

But even if the size of the hypergraph is always increasing, that doesn’t mean we’d necessarily notice. It could be that essentially everything we can see just expands too—so in effect the granularity of space is just getting finer and finer. This would be an interesting resolution to the age-old debate about whether the universe is discrete or continuous. Yes, it’s structurally discrete, but the scale of discreteness relative to our scale is always getting smaller and smaller. And if this happens fast enough, we’d never be able to “see the discreteness”—because every time we tried to measure it, the universe would effectively have subdivided before we got the result. (Somehow it’d be like the ultimate calculus epsilon-delta proof: you challenge the universe with an epsilon, and before you can get the result, the universe has made a smaller delta.)

There are some other strange possibilities too. Like that the whole hypergraph for the universe is always expanding, but pieces are continually “breaking off”, effectively forming black holes of different sizes, and allowing the “main component” of the universe to vary in size.

But regardless of how this kind of expansion works in our universe today, it’s clear that if the universe started with a single self-loop, it had to do a lot of expanding, at least early on. And here there’s an interesting possibility that’s relevant for understanding cosmology.

Just because our current universe exhibits three-dimensional space, in our models there’s no reason to think that the early universe necessarily also did. There are very different things that can happen in our models:

✕ ResourceFunction[""WolframModel""][#1, #2, #3, ""FinalStatePlot""] & @@@ {{{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {2, 6}} -> {{7, 7, 2}, {6, 2, 8}, {8, 5, 7}, {8, 9, 3}, {1, 6}, {10, 6}, {5, 3}, {7, 11}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 16}, {{{1, 2, 3}, {1, 4, 5}, {3, 6}} -> {{7, 8, 7}, {7, 5, 6}, {9, 5, 5}, {1, 7, 4}, {7, 5}, {5, 10}, {11, 6}, {6, 9}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 100}, {{{1, 2, 3}, {3, 4}} -> {{5, 5, 5}, {5, 6, 4}, {3, 1}, {1, 5}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0}}, 16}}

In the first example here, different parts of space effectively separate into non-communicating “black hole” tree branches. In the second example, we have something like ordinary—in this case 2-dimensional—space. But in the third example, space is in a sense very connected. If we work out the volume of a spherical ball, it won’t grow like rd; it’ll grow exponentially with r (e.g. like 2r).

If we look at the causal graph, we’ll see that you can effectively “go everywhere in space”, or affect every event, very quickly. It’d be as if the speed of light is infinite. But really it’s because space is effectively infinite dimensional.

In typical cosmology, it’s been quite mysterious how different parts of the early universe managed to “communicate” with each other, for example, to smooth out perturbations. But if the universe starts effectively infinite-dimensional, and only later “relaxes” to being finite-dimensional, that’s no longer a mystery.

So, OK, what might we see in the universe today that would reflect what happened extremely early in its history? The fact that our models deterministically generate behavior that seems for all practical purposes random means that we can expect that most features of the initial conditions or very early stages of the universe will quickly be “encrypted”, and effectively not reconstructable.

But it’s just conceivable that something like a breaking of symmetry associated with the first few hypergraphs might somehow survive. And that suggests the bizarre possibility that—just maybe—something like the angular structure of the cosmic microwave background or the very large-scale distribution of galaxies might reflect the discrete structure of the very early universe. Or, in other words, it’s just conceivable that what amounts to the rule for the universe is, in effect, painted across the whole sky. I think this is extremely unlikely, but it’d certainly be an amazing thing if the universe were “self-documenting” that way.

Elementary Particles—Old and New

We’ve talked several times about particles like electrons. In current physics theories, the various (truly) elementary particles—the quarks, the leptons (electron, muon, neutrinos, etc.), the gauge bosons, the Higgs—are all assumed to intrinsically be point particles, of zero size. In our models, that’s not how it works. The particles are all effectively “little lumps of space” that have various special properties.

My guess is that the precise list of what particles exist will be something that’s specific to a particular underlying rule. In cellular automata, for example, we’re used to seeing complicated sets of possible localized structures arise:

✕ SeedRandom[2525]; ArrayPlot[ CellularAutomaton[110, RandomInteger[1, 700], 500], ImageSize -> Full, Frame -> None]

In our hypergraphs, the picture will inevitably be somewhat different. The “core feature” of each particle will be some kind of locally stable structure in the hypergraph (a simple analogy might be that it’s a lump of nonplanarity in an otherwise planar graph). But then there’ll be lots of causal edges associated with the particle, defining its particular energy and momentum.

Still, the “core feature” of the particles will presumably define things like their charge, quantum numbers, and perhaps spin—and the fact that these things are observed to occur in discrete units may reflect the fact that it’s a small piece of hypergraph that’s involved in defining them.

It’s not easy to know what the actual scale of discreteness in space might be in our models. But a possible (though potentially unreliable) estimate might be that the “elementary length” is around 10–93 meters. (Note that that’s very small compared to the Planck length ~10–35 meters that arises essentially from dimensional analysis.) And with this elementary length, the radius of the electron might be 10–81 meters. Tiny, but not zero. (Note that current experiments only tell us that the size of the electron is less than about 10–22 meters.)

One feature of our models is that there should be a “quantum of mass”—a discrete amount that all masses, for example of particles, are multiples of. With our estimate for the elementary length, this quantum of mass would be small, perhaps 10–30, or 1036 times smaller than the mass of the electron.

And this raises an intriguing possibility. Perhaps the particles—like electrons—that we currently know about are the “big ones”. (With our estimates, an electron would have hypergraph elements in it.) And maybe there are some much smaller, and much lighter ones. At least relative to the particles we currently know, such particles would have few hypergraph elements in them—so I’m referring to them as “oligons” (after the Greek word ὀλιγος for “few”).

What properties would these oligons have? They’d probably interact very very weakly with other things in the universe. Most likely lots of oligons would have been produced in the very early universe, but with their very weak interactions, they"

"Enormous relief that on April 12th, the World Health Organization will officially announce the DRC to be Ebola-free",http://aje.io/b2c5y,"WHO to officially announce on April 12 the end of 20-month epidemic in eastern DRC that killed more than 2,200 people.

Editor’s Note: Since the publication of this article, the World Health Organization has announced that a new case of Ebola has been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Therefore, the outbreak will not be declared over on April 12, as previously expected.

Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo – Bold rays of sunshine pour through the windows of the Ebola Treatment Centre in Beni, and along its eerily-deserted hallways lined with biosecure care units.

Outside, in a high-risk zone fenced off by neon orange barriers, a nurse in full protective gear carefully sterilises some medical equipment with chlorinated water. A pair of assistants take stock of medical supplies in a large wooden hut nearby.

“It feels strange for this place to be so empty,” said Dr Esther Sokolua Perso, head of medical activities at the Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or, MSF) centre since June 2019.

“But it’s an enormous relief.”

The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) latest Ebola outbreak, which killed 2,264 of the 3,453 people infected, emerged in eastern North Kivu province in August 2018 and later spread to the neighbouring Ituri province.

At the height of the outbreak, the tenth and by far the DRC’s largest, the facility in Beni was the epicentre and home to a highly-active team of more than 130 healthcare workers.

But ever since the last patient in the country, a woman called Masika Mawasu Semida, tested negative on February 17 and was discharged last month in scenes of great jubilation, it has largely lay empty.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is set to declare the outbreak over on April 12 – the date marking double the disease’s 21-day incubation period since the departure of the last patient – if no other cases emerge.

“The feeling is of joy,” said Perso, calling the expected end of the outbreak a “real success”. She added: “The team here battled and battled. It wasn’t easy. But we did everything we could to save people.”

Among those saved were a number of women who were pregnant at the time of contracting Ebola, eight of whom survived with a viable fetus, the first time this has ever been achieved.

Josephine Ekoli last year gave birth to a healthy baby girl named Sylvana after being admitted to Beni’s Ebola Treatment Centre in December 2018.

“I was so afraid at the time,” the 29-year-old said. “I couldn’t have imagined my life being transformed to what it is now.”

Mass mobilisation led by the Ministry of Health has proven crucial, with almost 160 million individual screenings for Ebola symptoms at checkpoints around the eastern region since August 2018.

The WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in July 2019, after the highly contagious virus threatened to spread to the large city of Goma and neighbouring countries.

Fortunes changed with the rollout of two vaccines produced by Merck and Johnson & Johnson – which are in clinical study phases and not yet licenced – to immunise more than 300,000 people. Prioritising the contacts of people diagnosed with Ebola was highly effective in halting the severe hemorrhagic fever, which attacks multiple bodily organs and can cause uncontrollable internal bleeding.

“In these difficult times, it is a great victory,” said Jean-Jacques Muyembe, head of the DRC’s Ebola response and director of the National Institute of Biomedical Research.

“The vaccines helped turn the tide for us. They have been very effective. But our work is far from over.”

Initial efforts to tackle the outbreak of Ebola in the DRC were hampered by long-seething political and social tensions in the country’s volatile eastern region.

The densely-populated North Kivu region surrounding Beni is an active conflict zone where dozens of armed groups have killed more than 1,700 civilians since 2014, according to the database Kivu Security Tracker.

Distrust of the emergency operation was also heightened among many locals who saw international organisations dedicate huge resources to respond to the Ebola outbreak but much less to the other concerns in the destitute region, where malaria, measles and other diseases kill thousands every year.

“At the beginning of the epidemic, the response was centralised around important systems like surveillance, patient care and communication,” said Berengere Guais, emergency coordinator for MSF in North Kivu. “But in retrospect, we needed to involve communities in discussions from the start.”

This was compounded by allegations of large-scale embezzlement of resources meant to tackle Ebola, misinformation about aid agencies intentionally spreading the virus and heavy-handed use of force by the Congolese army to enforce rules around burial practices and patient transport – which was later deemed “disproportionate” in a United Nations report.

The ill-feeling combined with the continuing campaign by armed groups led to 420 attacks on health facilities, resulting in 11 deaths and 86 injuries of health workers and patients, since August 2018.

Yet the end of this outbreak is now finally in sight for Perso and her team at the Beni treatment centre, with only a matter of days to count down. However, they will continue to remain on high alert for 80 days after the declaration and will provide care for Ebola survivors as part of an 18-month programme of regular health checkups.

“We’re still in full response mode,” said Dr Gervais Folefack, an incident manager for the WHO in the DRC. “We have to remain extremely vigilant because there are many factors that could undo all of our work.”

The Ebola virus itself can persist in used medical equipment for weeks and in the bodily fluids of survivors for many months, added Folefack, and in rare cases survivors can relapse. The virus is endemic to the region, with fruit bats believed to be its natural hosts, and a further zoonotic transmission from the species is always possible.

Analyses published in The Royal Society journal last year also warned that the 42-day countdown may not be enough to say with confidence that the epidemic is over because the complex security situation means some cases may have gone undetected.

For now, the celebrations will remain low-key. A planned event at the Beni treatment centre to mark the end of the outbreak was cancelled after the first cases of coronavirus in the city were confirmed last week.

But the occasion will nonetheless be a huge stride forward in the battle against Ebola.

“There are no words to describe how grateful I am,” says Faustin Kalivanda, who was under treatment at the Beni centre until November 2019 and now works there as a nurse assistant.

“This place brought me back to life and I’ll never forget it.”"

Good news! The Easter Bunny is officially named an essential worker ahead of this weekend by the Irish Health Minister,http://thejournal.ie/easter-bunny-simon-harris-5068604-Apr2020/,"THERE WAS GOOD news for the children of Ireland (and maybe some of its adults too) this morning after Health Minister Simon Harris confirmed that the Easter Bunny is classed as an essential worker.

This means that many of us are likely to get an Easter egg this weekend.

Fears had been raised that due to the current guidelines on social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak that the Easter Bunny may be excluded from making sure the children of Ireland get their Easter eggs.

Luckily, after receiving the latest medical advice, the Easter Bunny has been given clearance to go about his business this Sunday.

Important news for children: Many of you contacted me & asked me to if the Easter Bunny was allowed work this weekend. I have checked with our top doctors & the good news is he can. But he has been contacted to remind him about washing his hands regularly & keeping his distance — Simon Harris TD (@SimonHarrisTD) April 7, 2020 Source: Simon Harris TD /Twitter

Harris said this morning: “Many of you contacted me and asked me if the Easter Bunny was allowed work this weekend.

I have checked with our top doctors and the good news is he can. But he has been contacted to remind him about washing his hands regularly and keeping his distance.

Harris’ comments follow confirmation from New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern yesterday that both the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy had been deemed “essential workers”.

She said: “As you can imagine at this time, of course they are going to be potentially quite busy at home with their family as well and their own bunnies.

“And so I say to the children of New Zealand if the Easter Bunny doesn’t make it to your household, then we have to understand that it is a bit difficult at the moment for the Bunny to perhaps get everywhere.”"
Good news: PM Boris Johnson in stable condition!,http://businessinsider.com/coronavirus-boris-johnson-stable-not-being-treated-ventilator-covid-breathing-2020-4,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is spending a second night in intensive care and is in ""stable"" condition, a spokesperson said on Tuesday evening.

Johnson, who was admitted to intensive care on Monday, had received oxygen treatment but had not required a ventilator so far.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will continue to stand in for the prime minister in his absence.

Here's what we know about Raab, Johnson's ""designated survivor.""

What happens if Johnson becomes too ill to remain prime minister.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will remain in intensive care but is in a ""stable"" condition and is in ""good spirits,"" his spokesperson said on Tuesday evening.

Johnson, who was admitted to St. Thomas' Hospital on Sunday with ""persistent"" symptoms of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, was moved into intensive care at about 7 p.m. in London on Monday.

""The Prime Minister's condition is stable and he remains in intensive care for close monitoring. He is in good spirits,"" the spokesperson said.

His spokesman said earlier on Tuesday that Johnson was receiving oxygen treatment but did not yet require mechanical assistance with his breathing through a ventilator. ""He is receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any other assistance,"" his spokesman said.

The spokesman also said the prime minister did not have pneumonia.

Johnson's spokesman previously said the prime minister was moved into intensive care as a precautionary measure in case he needed ventilation.

The Times of London on Tuesday had reported that sources inside the hospital suggested the prime minister ""needed 4 liters of oxygen in intensive care"" but had not yet been intubated — the process by which a tube is inserted into the windpipe before ventilation.

The paper said ""the normal threshold for intensive care is 15 liters, suggesting that he was in better health than such patients generally.""

Johnson's spokesman, however, denied that the prime minister was receiving special treatment above more serious cases.

""There is significant spare capacity in intensive-care units in hospitals in London and across the United Kingdom,"" he said.

Dominic Raab, the UK's foreign secretary, is standing in for Johnson while he is treated.

""The PM sent the message that he wanted the foreign secretary to assume some of his responsibilities where appropriate,"" his spokesman said on Tuesday.

He added that if Raab also became ill, then Chancellor Rishi Sunak would step in to deputize for him.

Raab told the BBC that he would deputize for the prime minister ""where necessary,"" adding that ""there is an incredibly strong team spirit behind the prime minister.""

Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill broke the ICU news to the rest of the Cabinet via a video call, Sky News reported.

One minister who was present in the meeting described it as a ""truly shocking"" moment, according to the Times of London.

The UK's chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, told the BBC the whole cabinet would lead the country's response to the virus in Johnson's absence.

""We're all working together to implement the plan that the prime minister set out to make sure we can marshal all the resources of government and this country to fight this invisible enemy,"" Gove said.

Several of Johnson's senior aides are also experiencing symptoms of the virus.

Johnson spent over a week in self-isolation after developing COVID-19 symptoms before he was taken to the hospital on Sunday for tests.

His condition worsened later in the day, prompting doctors to move him into intensive care.

UK rejects Trump's offer of help with Johnson's treatment

President Donald Trump told a press briefing on Monday that ""Americans are all praying for his recovery,"" adding that Johnson had ""been a very good friend.""

He added that his administration had contacted Johnson's doctors and told them he had asked two unnamed medical companies who worked on treatments for AIDS and Ebola to offer the prime minister support.

Johnson's spokesman rejected the offer on Tuesday, saying ""any treatment he receives is a matter for his doctors.""

""On this specific point, we are grateful for all of the warm wishes the prime minister has received overnight,"" the person said.

""We're confident the prime minister is receiving the best possible care from the National Health Service,"" he added. ""Any treatment he receives is a matter for his doctors.""

French President Emmanuel Macron said he sent ""all my support to Boris Johnson, to his family, and to the British people at this difficult moment.""

Keir Starmer, the new leader of the opposition Labour Party, described the news Johnson had been admitted to the ICU as ""terribly sad.""

""All the country's thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time,"" he tweeted.

Former Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""Thinking of @BorisJohnson and his family tonight. Get well soon. You are in great hands and we all want you safe, well and back in @10DowningStreet.""

Earth Is Vibrating Substantially Less Because There's So Little Activity Right Now,http://sciencealert.com/the-earth-is-moving-substantially-less-because-of-the-global-pandemic/amp,"Flights are grounded. Fewer trains are running. Rush hour is gone. The world - particularly in cities - is looking drastically different during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

According to seismologists, that drastic reduction in human hustle and bustle is causing the Earth to move substantially less. The planet is 'standing still'.

Thomas Lecocq, a geologist and seismologist at the Royal Observatory in Belgium, noticed that the country's capital Brussels is experiencing a 30 to 50 percent reduction in ambient seismic noise since the lockdowns began, as CNN reports.

That means data collected by seismologists is becoming more accurate, capable of detecting even the smallest tremors - despite the fact that many of the scientific instruments in use today are near city centers.

""You'll get a signal with less noise on top, allowing you to squeeze a little more information out of those events,"" Andy Frassetto, a seismologist at the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology in Washington DC told Nature.

Researchers in Los Angeles and in West London, UK noticed a similar trend.

But seismologists collecting data from remote stations far away from human civilization might not see a change at all, according to Nature.

Regardless, a significant drop in seismic noise also shows that we're at least doing one thing right during the current pandemic: staying in the safety of our own homes as we wait for the virus to run its course.

GREAT. The curve seems to flatten in the Bay Area,http://tonic75.com/1389/great-the-curve-seems-to-flatten-in-the-bay-area/,"The Bay Area is starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Still a lot to go., but the signs are encouraging!

Fantastic news from the Bay Area as it seems that the Coronavirus curve is starting to flatten. Doctors are still cautious, but since 6 Bay counties adopted an aggressive lock-down policy ((March the 16th), things are getting better.

Doctors at area hospitals are now reporting fewer cases than they expected. Governor Gavin Newsom commented: “We believe very strongly the stay-at-home order has helped advance our efforts in reducing the stress on the system that we believe would have already materialized in more acute ways had we not advanced those protocols when we did.”

The situation is much better than some other States like New York that are already bracing for the worst.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf is also satisfied to comment: “Just generally when you look around Oakland now, what you are seeing gives you hope that makes you feel good about what’s going on here. People really got the message and I believe that it will show that we will have flattened that curve.”

What do the experts say?

Stephen Parodi, is specialized in infectious diseases and he is the associate executive director with The Permanente Medical Group in Northern California. Parodi is also prudent in his comments to say: “While we still predict an upcoming surge, the partnership between the health system and public health officials on the local and state levels to implement social distancing has given us more time to put a lot of pieces in place to prepare for a potential surge.”

Let’s stay optimistic!

President Michael D Higgins has written a stunning poem encouraging Irish people to ‘take care’ during the current global situation.

The poem, called Take Care, was shared on the President’s Facebook page and encouraged Irish people to keep the faith as ‘dark moments should not threaten belief’.

President Higgins urged followers to ‘hold firm, take care, come home together’.

He also encouraged people to stay strong as ‘to weaken is to die in the misery of knowing the journey abandoned.’

Michael D Higgin has regularly updated the Irish people and recently encouraged people to practise social distancing.

‘All of us in Ireland now must realise that social distancing – keeping a physical distance of no less than 2 metres or 6.5 feet – is one of the best measures we have to protect our people,’ he said.

‘I would appeal to those who have found these measures difficult, to simply begin again during this crucial week and to go further.’

Speaking to Dublin’s FM104, the President encouraged people to stay positive and know that what they do know will impact life when this is all over.

‘I think it’s very important for people to concentrate on the time when it will be over,’ he said.

‘It will be over, but it will be over with the least loss of life and the least hardship if, in fact, we do what is tough now but what is necessary.

‘It will be over and we are in control of how it will turn out.’

Take Care – Michael D Higgins

In the journey to the light,

the dark moments

should not threaten.

Belief

requires

that you hold steady.

Bend, if you will,

with the wind.

The tree is your teacher,

roots at once

more firm

from experience

in the soil

made fragile.

Your gentle dew will come

and a stirring

of power

to go on

towards the space

of sharing.

In the misery of the I,

in rage,

it is easy to cry out

against all others

but to weaken

is to die

in the misery of knowing

the journey abandoned

towards the sharing

of all human hope

and cries

is the loss

of all we know

of the divine

reclaimed

for our shared

humanity.

Hold firm.

Take care.

Come home

together.

Hat Bosch den Test-Durchbruch geschafft? Bild: dpa

Schneller und sicherer auf das Virus testen – der deutsche Traditionskonzern Bosch will mit einem neuen, vielversprechenden Angebot auf den Markt.

Bitte melden Sie sich an, um diesen Artikel auf Ihrem Merkzettel zu speichern.

Der Autozulieferer Bosch hat auch eine kleine Sparte Medizintechnik, und von dort kommt eine überraschende Nachricht: Bosch hat einen Schnelltest für Corona-Infektionen entwickelt. Innerhalb von zweieinhalb Stunden kann damit eine Infektion festgestellt werden, und zwar direkt vor Ort, ohne Transportwege, die Zeit und Geld kosten.

„Mit dem Covid-19-Schnelltest wollen wir einen Beitrag zur möglichst raschen Eindämmung der Corona-Pandemie leisten. Infizierte Patienten können schneller identifiziert und isoliert werden“, sagt der Bosch-Vorstandsvorsitzende Volkmar Denner: „Im Kampf gegen das Virus ist Zeit einer der entscheidenden Faktoren. Eine zuverlässige, schnelle Diagnose direkt vor Ort ohne Umwege – das ist der große Vorteil unserer Lösung.“ (Lesen Sie hier ein exklusives Interview mit dem Bosch-Vorstandsvorsitzenden zum neuen Schnelltest.)

Während Schnelltests auf Corona-Infektionen bisher im Ruf stehen, sehr ungenau zu sein, ist bei Bosch davon die Rede, dass in diversen Labortests Ergebnisse mit einer Genauigkeit von mehr als 95 Prozent erzielt worden seien. „Der Schnelltest erfüllt die Qualitätsstandards der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO“, heißt es in einer Mitteilung von Bosch.

Die Probe wird mittels Abstrich-Tupfer aus Nase oder Rachen entnommen und in eine Kartusche gegeben, die schon alle für den Test erforderlichen Reagenzien enthält. Diese Kartusche wird sofort in das Analyse-Gerät eingeführt, das nach Bosch-Angaben so anwenderfreundlich gestaltet ist, dass kein besonders geschultes Personal notwendig ist.

Innerhalb von 24 Stunden könnten bis zu zehn Tests pro Gerät durchführt werden. Von den Analysegeräten gibt es bisher einige Dutzend in verschiedenen Laboren und im Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus in Stuttgart. Für die Produktion der Geräte stehen Kapazitäten bei Bosch am Medizintechnik-Standort in Waiblingen zur Verfügung, heißt es.

Der neue Test wird ab April zunächst in Deutschland erhältlich sein. Bosch prüfe aktuell, wie es Ärzte und Pflegepersonal in medizinischen Einrichtungen unterstützen kann, damit diese sich zeitnah testen lassen können, um möglichst lange einsatzfähig zu bleiben, heißt es in der Mitteilung des Stuttgarter Konzerns.

Das Besondere des Tests ist, dass mit derselben Probe neben Covid-19 auch noch neun weitere Atemwegserkrankungen wie Influenza A und B untersucht werden. „Durch die Differenzial-Diagnostik ersparen sich die Ärzte zusätzlich die Zeit für weitere Tests, erhalten rasch eine fundierte Diagnose und können daraus schneller eine geeignete Therapie einleiten“, wird Marc Meier, Geschäftsführer der Bosch Healthcare Solutions GmbH in der Mitteilung zitiert. Bosch hat bei der Entwicklung des Schnelltests mit dem nordirischen Medizintechnik-Unternehmen Randox Laboratories Ltd. kooperiert.

Bei den Kosten für Geräte und Tests sieht sich Bosch in etwa auf dem Niveau anderer Tests. Demnach kostet jede Kartusche (und damit jeder Test) einen hohen zweistelligen Eurobetrag, jedes Analysegerät einen niedrigen fünfstelligen Betrag."
Coronavirus side effect: Air quality is great now,http://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNndnRyaWJ1bmUuY29tLzIwMjAvMDMvMjQvY29yb25hdmlydXMtc2lkZS1lZmZlY3QtYWlyLXF1YWxpdHktaXMtZ3JlYXQtbm93L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNndnRyaWJ1bmUuY29tLzIwMjAvMDMvMjQvY29yb25hdmlydXMtc2lkZS1lZmZlY3QtYWlyLXF1YWxpdHktaXMtZ3JlYXQtbm93L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"It won’t last much longer than the stay-at-home orders, but right now, the air quality in Los Angeles County is phenomenal, experts say. And it’s not just because the freeways are nearly empty.

“It’s also due to all the rain and stormy weather we’ve been having over the past week and a half,” South Coast Air Quality Management District Deputy Executive Officer Philip Fine said in an interview on Tuesday. His organization tracks air quality for Los Angeles County, Orange County and the densely populated parts of the Inland Empire.

Although brutal on the economy, business closures only have helped the wet weather improve our air.

Shipping is down in the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, meaning fewer trucks on the road and ships in the water. There are also fewer planes in the sky and more construction projects on hold.

Emissions from that kind of heavy machinery accounts for nearly 80% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Los Angeles County, Fine said. Consumer cars are included in the number, but it’s hardly a dent in the big picture when compared to their industrial counterparts.

“Emissions have likely dropped a lot in the past few weeks,” Fine added, but there’s a catch. Because all of the coronavirus closures began under wet, gray skies, it’s difficult to suss out what’s a result of the weather and what’s from the new coronavirus-related closures.

Move the slider above to compare photos of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach before and after the coronavirus restrictions. Note that the amount of fog at the ports varies greatly.”

The South Coast Air Quality Management District doesn’t have conclusive data just yet to show the effects of the stay-at-home orders, but Fine hopes to have more concrete numbers in the next few weeks — just as soon as the weather clears up.

Even without the data, some residents anecdotally say there’s been improvement, particularly asthmatics like Austin Frank.

Frank lives near the intersection of the 405 and 10 freeways and typically bikes into work. On hot, pollution and pollen-filled days, he said his lungs feel “heavy and gross” by the time he gets into the office.

While he’s been working from home since the orders took effect, he’s still biking around his neighborhood for exercise, and he can “definitely notice a difference” lately, he said.

Assuming the observations are indeed correct, environmental healing would be par for the coronavirus course.

NASA scientists reported drops of up to 30% in smog-forming pollutants in China over January and February, compared to the same months in recent years, based on satellite measurements.

Meanwhile, in Venice, Italy, water clarity has returned to the city’s notoriously dirty canals after officials instituted their own versions of stay-at-home orders several weeks ago, several publications have noted.

Back in Los Angeles, Fine said he wouldn’t expect the air quality to stay this clean once business returns to normal. But how quickly it resets remains to be seen.

“It really depends on how quickly the economy comes back,” Fine said. Once the heavy machines start moving again, it’s likely that the air quality will return to normal."

The sports stars are making a move! If you wonder why tennis legend, Roger Federer, has been voted for 17 consecutive years as a fans’ favorite, here is one of the reasons!

Federer is currently in Switzerland and he is touched by what is happening all over the world. Eventually, he decided with his lovely wife Mirka to donate 1 million Swiss francs to the Swiss families that are hit by this horrible Coronavirus pandemic.

Roger explained that things have to be quick as families need money pretty quickly. He also states that this will be just the beginning, and he hopes that others will follow.

These are his statements

“We must help families in need quickly and unbureaucratically. Mirka and I have donated to a newly established emergency assistance fund for families in Switzerland. The fund is managed by “Winterhilfe,” a trusted partner of our foundation and highly experienced to support vulnerable people for decades. From tomorrow March 26, the “Fund for families in need“ will be functional and ready to make contributions such as vouchers for food and child care services and where necessary.”

“These are challenging times for everyone and nobody should be left behind. Mirka and I have personally decided to donate one million Swiss Francs for the most vulnerable families in Switzerland. Our contribution is just a start. We hope that others might join in supporting more families in need. Together we can overcome this crisis! Stay healthy!”"

""He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.

""The Duchess of Cornwall has also been tested but does not have the virus. In accordance with government and medical advice, the Prince and the Duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland.

""The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire where they met the criteria required for testing.

""It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.""

Prince Charles' last public event was a reception and dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief effort on 12 March, which took place at Mansion House in London.

Earlier that day the Prince of Wales had attended an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace, where he greeted recipients with a non-contact gesture due to concerns about the spread of the illness.

Sky News' royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills said that since then Charles has a ""small number of meetings"", and that all people he has come into contact with have been tested.

Doctors' most conservative estimate is that he would have been contagious since 13 March, she added.

He last met the Queen on the morning of 12 March and the 93-year-old monarch is said to be in ""good health"" and following all appropriate health and safety advice.

Following Prince Charles' diagnosis, Buckingham Palace said: ""Her Majesty The Queen remains in good health.

""The Queen last saw the Prince of Wales briefly on 12 March and is following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare. We will not be commenting further.""

On 10 March, Prince Charles hosted a WaterAid summit at Clarence House to discuss the impact of climate change on access to drinking water.

The event was also attended by Prince Albert of Monaco, who last week became the first head of state confirmed to have tested positive for coronavirus.

His health was described as ""not worrying"" and he was being treated by doctors from the Princess Grace Hospital, named after his US actress mother.

Albert is continuing to work from his home office in the palace and is in contact with members of his government.

The announcement that Prince Charles has COVID-19 comes a week after the Queen and Prince Philip moved to Windsor Castle earlier than planned for the Easter period.

Following their arrival in Windsor, the monarch issued a message of solidarity to Britons worried about the disease, saying families around the UK were entering ""a period of great concern and uncertainty"".

""We are all being advised to change our normal routines and regular patterns of life for the greater good of the communities we live in and, in particular, to protect the most vulnerable within them,"" she said.

""At times such as these, I am reminded that our nation's history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.

""We are enormously thankful for the expertise and commitment of our scientists, medical practitioners and emergency and public services; but now more than any time in our recent past, we all have a vitally important part to play as individuals - today and in the coming days, weeks and months.

""Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe. I am certain we are up to that challenge. You can be assured that my family and I stand ready to play our part.""

The UK has seen 424 deaths from coronavirus so far, with more than 8,000 confirmed cases.

There were 89 deaths reported on Tuesday, which was the biggest daily nationwide increase to date.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has enforced a lockdown to try to slow the spread the disease, with people urged not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary.

Britons should stay indoors unless they are classed as key workers, such as the emergency services, to buy food and other vital supplies, and for exercise - but only once per day.

Some confusion remains over the measures, however, with Mr Johnson facing increasing calls to intervene and stop non-essential construction workers heading to building sites during the pandemic."
40 days of mindfulness meditation leads to structural brain changes and improved quality of life. The study has helped reinforce our understanding of how meditation and mindfulness affect change in the structure and functioning of certain brain areas,http://psypost.org/2020/03/40-days-of-mindfulness-meditation-leads-to-structural-brain-changes-and-improved-quality-of-life-56228,"A study in Scientific Reports has helped reinforce our understanding of how meditation and mindfulness affect change in the structure and functioning of certain brain areas, and how these changes lead to increased wellness.

In the study, fourteen university students participated in a 40-day meditation training course. None of the students had any prior training in meditation, which allowed the researchers to evaluate changes in the function and structure of a number of brain regions. In addition, subjects were given self-assessment questionnaires before and after the meditation course to monitor any changes in mood and wellbeing.

After 40 days of mindfulness training, imaging techniques revealed alterations in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. These two brain regions are thought to be involved at various levels in self-awareness and consciousness. They also play critical roles in the Default Mode Network, a vast network of interconnected structures that contributes to certain fundamental aspects of personhood, including the perception of one’s own emotional state, understanding others’ thoughts and emotions, and moral reasoning.

In addition to these neurological changes, participants also showed a marked decrease in both depressive and anxious tendencies, as evaluated by the self-assessment questionnaires. More significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores correlated with greater structural changes in the aforementioned brain regions, lending support to previous research in the same domain.

The study, as noted by researchers, should be considered in light of certain methodological limitations. First and foremost, a relatively small sample size of 14 participants limits the study’s generalizability. There was also no control group, which is unfortunate, as this makes it difficult to be sure that the observed changes were, in fact, a result of the meditation practice, and not some other, external factor.

Nonetheless, the study’s findings are both intriguing and promising: they contribute to our understanding of how brain structures are changed by meditation and mindfulness, and provides a number of opportunities for future research. The most striking finding of the study is that a mere 40 days of meditation was needed to both alter the structure and function of participant’s brains, and improve the participants’ quality of life as measured by depression symptomatology and anxiety.

The study, “Alterations in Brain Structure and Amplitude of Low-frequency after 8 weeks of Mindfulness Meditation Training in Meditation-Naïve Subjects“, was authored by Chuan-Chih Yang, Alfonso Barrós-Loscertales, Meng Li, Daniel Pinazo, Viola Borchardt, César Ávila, and Martin Walter."
This is better than cash nowadays..,http://sfchronicle.com/business/article/Facebook-donates-720-000-medical-masks-1-5-15148473.php,"Bay Area health care workers have been pleading for more protective gear, saying some hospitals are forcing them to reuse masks because the nation is running out. A few local companies have responded with massive donations.

They range from the famous, like Facebook, the giant Menlo Park social network, to the less well known, like Flexport, a San Francisco startup ideally positioned to assist because its software helps with global supply chains.

The donations come as President Trump called on American manufacturers over the weekend to switch their assembly lines to making ventilators.

Facebook plans to donate 720,000 masks — a combination of the coveted N95 respirators and more basic surgical masks — and 1.5 million pairs of gloves to health care workers around the world. Facebook officials said they bought the masks for their offices’ emergency disaster kits following wildfires in California.

Facebook has already donated 375,000 masks and 867,000 pairs of gloves to county officials in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, who are expected to distribute them to hospitals.

“As the situation continues to change, our commitment to our community will only get stronger,” Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote to employees in an internal memo Saturday.

Last week, Flexport donated 60,000 masks and other supplies to San Francisco health care workers, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it would donate 950,000 masks to hospitals across the state.

Facebook also said it has donated $650,000 worth of food to more than a dozen Bay Area senior centers, schools and other organizations, including Food Runners SF, Peninsula Volunteers Meals on Wheels and the East Palo Alto Senior Center. Meanwhile, the company sent $250,000 to the Sequoia Union High School District in San Mateo County to pay for 2,000 Wi-Fi hotspots and a year of Wi-Fi for low-income students who need to complete their work online during shelter in place but don’t have a reliable connection.

The company, which is the dominant employer in its headquarters city but also has large offices in San Francisco, Mountain View and other Bay Area cities, also pledged to give $500,000 to multiple homelessness prevention organizations in the Bay Area — and promised more local support.

“We greatly appreciate Facebook’s support in helping us to make sure our front-line health workers are protected as they do the critical work to save lives,” said San Francisco Mayor London Breed. “I’m proud that the city is coming together in the face of this unprecedented crisis, and I know we will get through this incredibly challenging time.”

The donation from Flexport, which uses software to make international trade more efficient, includes 60,000 surgical masks, 34,000 gloves, 2,000 surgical gowns and 50 thermometers. Breed announced the delivery Saturday in conjunction with Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who served as an intermediary.

Officials said they would put the supplies to immediate use in San Francisco’s Emergency Operations Center.

“Our front-line health care workers and first responders are doing heroic work to protect people and save lives during this crisis,” Breed said, noting the need for more equipment as the city braces for a surge of COVID-19 cases.

Hospitals throughout the country are confronting a scarcity of masks and other gear, which became so dire in Washington state that medical workers made 500 masks out of vinyl, tape, foam and elastic purchased at Home Depot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines, allowing workers to use bandannas, scarves and homemade masks as a last resort.

Experts cited several reasons for the shortage, including the rapidly spreading virus — which quickly stripped hospitals of their supplies — and a consumer buying spree. Also, hospitals rely on manufacturers from China and Italy for their supplies, said Brent Andrew, spokesman for San Francisco General. Both countries were hit hard by the coronavirus, which led to disruptions.

In San Francisco and elsewhere, concerned citizens have rallied hospital donations online while elected officials work behind the scenes.

“I was thrilled — but not surprised — to hear that Flexport is stepping up to deliver thousands of much-needed surgical gowns, gloves, masks, and more to our local efforts to flatten the curve,” Stefani said. “When we all step up, there’s no challenge too great for San Francisco.”

Around the country, factories that crank out cars and trucks were looking into making much-needed ventilators. Distilleries intended for beer, whiskey and rum transformed to instead turn out hand sanitizers and disinfectants. And an electronics maker that builds display screens was repurposed for surgical masks.

All are answering the call of duty amid a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 14,000 lives and sickened 335,000 people globally.

But redirecting plants to make completely different products will take a long time and a huge effort — possibly too long for some companies to help with medical gear shortages that become more acute every day.

“When you are repurposing a factory, it really depends on how similar the new product is to the existing products in your product line,” said Kaitlin Wowak, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on industrial supply chains. “It’s going to be a substantial pivot to start producing an entirely different item.”

On Friday, President Trump said he invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, which allows the government to marshal the private sector to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. But he did not give examples as to how he was using it.

No automakers, however, are building ventilators at present. GM announced on Friday that it is working with ventilator maker Ventec Life Systems to ramp up production. The automaker said it would help with logistics, purchasing and manufacturing, but stopped short of saying it would make ventilators in its own factories, which have been idled for two weeks after workers who’d been fearful of contagion put pressure on the company.

Crosstown rival Ford, which also suspended factory production along with other automakers with operations in North America, confirmed that it too was in discussions with the Trump administration about helping.

“We’re looking at feasibility,” Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said. “It may be possible, but it’s not ‘you go from Rangers (small pickups) one day to ventilators the next.’ We’re figuring out what is possible now.”

Other industries may be better equipped to help with the virus. Rum producer Bacardi, for example, said its distillery in Puerto Rico has shifted to making ethanol needed to produce hand sanitizer. Anheuser-Busch said Saturday it would start producing and distributing sanitizer.

Even though it may take time and a monumental effort to switch factories to medical products, that may have to be done if the virus outbreak lasts for several months or longer, said Notre Dame’s Wowak.

“I think given the circumstance and how critical it is for these surgical masks, ventilators and gloves, I think there is going to be a lot of organizations, government, private, trying to increase (factory) capacity,” she said. “Maybe the government recognizes how critical of an issue this is.”

Melbourne's zoos have decided to live stream some of their animals so that people social distancing won't miss out on a seeing these cute creatures!,http://timeout.com/melbourne/news/melbourne-zoos-are-now-live-streaming-their-penguins-lions-and-baby-snow-leopards-031920,"Practising social distancing right now? Luckily for you, Melbourne’s zoos have decided to live stream their animals so you won’t miss out on a second of all that cute creature fun.

Zoos Victoria has set up live streams at some Melbourne Zoo and Werribee Open Range Zoo enclosures, including the adorable snow leopard cubs. These adorable (and frequently napping) cubs were born on January 26 and are starting to explore the world a little more under the watchful eye of their mum Miska.

You can also watch over the Zoo’s friendly penguins, lazy lions and wandering giraffes, including recent arrival Kilintun.

Head over to the Zoo’s website to watch them live now. Fair warning: if you’re supposed to be working, this is highly distracting.

Covid-19 pandemic proves good for the environment,http://nbcnews.com/science/environment/coronavirus-shutdowns-have-unintended-climate-benefits-n1161921?cid=db_npd_nn_fb_fbbot,"In Venice, the often murky canals recently began to get clearer, with fish visible in the water below. Italy's efforts to limit the coronavirus meant an absence of boat traffic on the city's famous waterways. And the changes happened quickly.

Countries that have been under stringent lockdowns to stop the spread of the coronavirus have experienced an unintended benefit. The outbreak has, at least in part, contributed to a noticeable drop in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in some countries.

Although grim, it's something scientists said could offer tough lessons for how to prepare — and ideally avoid — the most destructive impacts of climate change.

""If we can think about how to prepare for climate change like a pandemic, maybe there will be a positive outcome to all of this,"" said Christopher Jones, lead developer of the CoolClimate Network, an applied research consortium at the University of California, Berkeley. ""We can help prevent crises in the future if we are prepared. I think there are some big-picture lessons here that could be very useful.""

The coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 180,000 people and killed more than 7,100 worldwide since early January. Some countries, most notably China and Italy, have been forced to seal their borders and restrict residents' movements to control the rates of infection.

Satellite observations have shown that the temporary measures have also driven significant decreases in harmful emissions.

""Carbon dioxide is tied to industrial activity, electricity production and transportation, so anything that affects those sectors will impact greenhouse gases, as well,"" Jones said.

The coronavirus first emerged in late December in Wuhan, China. As it rapidly spilled into neighboring regions, the Chinese government locked down the city, quarantining 11 million people in Wuhan. Eventually, the lockdown would include almost 60 million people in the province of Hubei.

Industrial operations in the coronavirus hot spot ground to a halt, and travel restrictions within China meant that air, rail and road traffic were paused or scaled back across some regions.

According to Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland, the restrictions contributed to a 25 percent drop in China's carbon dioxide emissions over four weeks beginning in late January, compared to the same time last year.

Myllyvirta's analysis also found that industrial operations were reduced by 15 percent to 40 percent in some sectors and that coal consumption at power plants fell by 36 percent.

Pollution-monitoring satellites operated by NASA and the European Space Agency observed drastic decreases in air pollution over China over two weeks in February when the quarantine was in effect. The satellites measured concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, which is released by cars, power plants and industrial facilities, from Jan. 1 to Jan. 20 and again from Feb. 10 to Feb. 25. The difference was unmistakable.

The cloud of nitrogen dioxide that was parked over China in January seemed to evaporate in February. NASA scientists said that similar emissions reductions have been observed in other countries during economic disruptions but that the sharp decrease in air pollution in China during the quarantine period was especially rapid.

""This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic dropoff over such a wide area for a specific event,"" Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement this month.

Pollution levels have similarly decreased over Italy, which has become the center of the coronavirus pandemic outside China. On March 8, as cases spiked, Italy locked down its northern Lombardy region. Two days later, the prime minister expanded the quarantine to include the entire country.

Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere over Italy also fell precipitously, as they did in China. An analysis by The Washington Post found that the most dramatic drop was observed over northern Italy.

Nitrogen dioxide can irritate the lungs, and inhaling the pollutant can increase the risk of asthma and inflammation of the lungs. Although the noxious gas isn't thought to be a major contributor to climate change, studying its concentration in the atmosphere can help scientists understand other heat-trapping greenhouse gases that do drive global warming.

Jacqueline Klopp, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Urban Development at Columbia University in New York City, said she expects to see greenhouse gas emissions plummet across the board because of the quarantine measures.

""People were in their homes and really stopped a lot of the activities that lead to greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution,"" she said.

Early observations have shown that extreme social-distancing measures are likely also having an effect on air pollution at the city level in the U.S.

Jordan Wildish, a project director at Earth Economics, an environmental non-profit organization based in Tacoma, Washington, developed an online dashboard to track air quality in San Francisco, New York City and the Seattle area, comparing the measurements with figures from the same time last year.

In San Francisco, which is under shelter-in-place orders to control the spread of the coronavirus, the average concentration of fine particulate matter — tiny particles in the air that are dangerous because they can be breathed deeply into the lungs — over the past five days was almost 40 percent lower than the previous year.

In New York City, there was a 28 percent drop over the same period of time, and the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue saw a 32 percent decrease.

But experts warned that observed reductions are temporary and that as cities, countries and economies bounce back, so, too, will emissions — unless major infrastructure or societal changes are adopted.

Klopp said the pandemic could make companies and governments realize that other threats to humanity, including climate change, could be just as devastating and that it's imperative to develop protective measures.

""As we move to restart these economies, we need to use this moment to think about what we value,"" she said. ""Do we want to go back to the status quo, or do we want to tackle these big structural problems and restructure our economy and reduce emissions and pollution?"""
"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted: With that, all Allies have welcomed our soon-to-be 30th member. Congratulations, North Macedonia!",http://usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-03-17/n-macedonia-clears-last-nato-membership-hurdle,"BRUSSELS (AP) — North Macedonia on Tuesday cleared the final hurdle to becoming the 30th member of the NATO military alliance after the Spanish Senate ratified its accession.

Spain’s office at NATO said that 259 of the 264 senators endorsed the move. The bill was immediately signed by King Felipe and will be submitted to the U.S. State Department for official confirmation within the next 72 hours.

Hailing the move, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted: “With that, all Allies have welcomed our soon-to-be 30th member. Congratulations, North Macedonia!”

It marks the end of a long quest for the former Yugoslav republic. Joining NATO and the European Union has been a priority for its leaders, but a dispute with neighboring Greece over the country’s name stalled progress for more than two decades.

North Macedonia previously was known as Macedonia, a name it shared with a Greek province. Under a 2017 deal with Athens, the country changed its name and Greece agreed to drop objections to its NATO and eventual EU membership.

Greece was the first country to ratify North Macedonia’s accession to the western military alliance. The country is expected to be given the green light to start EU membership talks in coming weeks."

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China has completed the clinical research of Favipiravir, an antiviral drug that has shown good clinical efficacy against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to an official Tuesday.

Favipiravir, the influenza drug which was approved for clinical use in Japan in 2014, has shown no obvious adverse reactions in the clinical trial, said Zhang Xinmin, director of the China National Center for Biotechnology Development under the Ministry of Science and Technology, at a press conference.

More than 80 patients have participated in the clinical trial in The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, including 35 patients taking Favipiravir and 45 patients on a control group. Results showed that patients receiving Favipiravir treatment turned negative for the virus in a shorter time compared with patients in the control group.

A multi-centered randomized clinical study led by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University also suggested that the therapeutic effect of Favipiravir is much better than that of the control group.

Favipiravir has been recommended to medical treatment teams and should be included in the diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 as soon as possible, Zhang said.

A Chinese pharmaceutical company has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration to mass-produce the drug and ensure stable supply, Zhang added."

He used to sling crack. Now he's making highly addictive cupcakes for celebrities.,http://nypost.com/2020/03/11/he-used-to-sell-crack-now-he-owns-a-successful-bakery/?utm_source=url_sitebuttons&utm_medium=site%20buttons&utm_campaign=site%20buttons,"He used to sling crack. Now he’s baking highly addictive cupcakes.

Meet Antwoin Gutierrez, a k a Chef Fresh. He started making and selling the drug as a 16-year-old in Peekskill, NY, but these days owns Fresh Taste, an online bakery that caters to celebrities’ sweet tooths.

His career transformation wasn’t easy, or swift. It came after three stints in prison, including two for drug dealing and the last, for a robbery that landed him in behind bars for 32 months.

“If I could tell teenage me that I’d be baking the dopest cupcakes, I would’ve said you’re crazy, ” Gutierrez, 33, tells The Post. “But I still have that hustler spirit.”

He learned to harness his entrepreneurial tendencies into more respectable pursuits, thanks to nonprofit organizations geared to helping ex-cons succeed.

Fresh out of prison in 2011, Gutierrez joined the Doe Fund, a nonprofit that aims to break the cycle of homelessness and criminal recidivism. He went in thinking he’d earn his commercial driver’s license. Instead, the food-services head took Gutierrez under his wing and taught him how to bake, a skill similar to one he already had.

“He didn’t just give me a recipe,” Gutierrez says. “He showed me how to make it, and it was similar to what I was doing when cooking crack. It was all about mixing things and the different reactions you get with chemistry. Something just clicked.”

He went on to bake and cook in the organization’s kitchen. Soon he was working at hotels and restaurants, including Maialino and Thomas Keller’s Bouchon, all the while baking on the side and posting his creations on social media.

“I would take pictures and post them on Insta, and people were asking where they could buy [them],” he says. “I knew there was a demand.” He sharpened his business skills by participating in Defy Ventures‘ CEO of Your New Life program, which is similar to “Shark Tank.”

In 2016, Gutierrez launched Fresh Taste Bakery and now sells about 500 treats a day, including his carrot-cake cookies and alcohol-infused cupcakes.

He’s made cupcakes for DJ Khaled, “America’s Next Top Model” winner Eva Marcille and the cast of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” But he’d love to bake for President Trump.

“I could learn a lot from him being his baker,” he says.

Although he has boldface devotees, his biggest fan remains his mother, Lasanja Mignotte. She loves his carrot-cake cookies — and how he’s turned his life around.

“She had me young and used to throw away my drugs. She hated me being locked up,” he says. “She told me that she can die happy. She doesn’t have to worry about me.”"

Australia is home to a lot of amazing creatures. Therefore sometimes we might think that some of the creatures are fake. There’s no way that these types of creatures exist in real life. If you see a photo of this amazing robin bird, you’ll probably think that it is edited. Because of this birds’ round pink color body. But this pink robin bird is definitely can be found in Australia.

Recently there have been a lot of worries about Australia’s natural animal population. Therefore most of the time the focus has been on more recognizable ones such as koalas, kangaroos, or wombats. Even if we searched we couldn’t find many statistics about how these amazing and vibrant bird species have been affected by the fires.

These pink robins nest and breed in the dense vegetation of eucalyptus forests and temperate rainforests. So it seems that there was some damage to their habitats. These birds are classified by the males’ blackheads, a white patch above their beaks and their incredible belly.

Female Australian pink robin birds are more of an olive-brown. And they have only the slightest pink tint to their bellies. They have their little round bodies. So BirdLige Australia describes them as a “Small tubby bird”.

An Instagram photographer @ambikangela is the one who brought this amazing bord to the worldwide audience. So you can see more of their amazing Australian wildlife photos on Instagram.

And if you are willing to help, you can donate to the ongoing fight to preserve these wildlife animals in Australia. So you can donate through WIRES.

What do you think about this bird? Do you like this bird? Do you think this bird is important?

Slime mold simulations used to map dark matter holding universe together,http://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-03/nsfc-sms031020.php,"The behavior of one of nature's humblest creatures is helping astronomers probe the largest structures in the universe.

The single-cell organism, known as slime mold (Physarum polycephalum), builds complex filamentary networks in search of food, finding near-optimal pathways to connect different locations. In shaping the universe, gravity builds a vast cobweb structure of filaments tying galaxies and clusters of galaxies together along faint bridges hundreds of millions of light-years long. There is an uncanny resemblance between the two networks: one crafted by biological evolution, and the other by the primordial force of gravity.

The cosmic web is the large-scale backbone of the cosmos, consisting primarily of the mysterious substance known as dark matter and laced with gas, upon which galaxies are built. Dark matter cannot be seen, but it makes up the bulk of the universe's material. The existence of a web-like structure to the universe was first hinted at in the 1985 Redshift Survey conducted at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Since those studies, the grand scale of this filamentary structure has grown in subsequent sky surveys. The filaments form the boundaries between large voids in the universe.

But astronomers have had a difficult time finding these elusive strands, because the gas is so dim it is hard to detect. Now a team of researchers has turned to slime mold to help them build a map of the filaments in the local universe (within 500 million light-years from Earth) and find the gas within them.

They designed a computer algorithm, inspired by slime-mold behavior, and tested it against a computer simulation of the growth of dark matter filaments in the universe. A computer algorithm is similar to a recipe that tells a computer precisely what steps to take to solve a problem.

The researchers then applied the slime mold algorithm to data containing the locations of 37,000 galaxies mapped by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at distances corresponding to 300 million light-years. The algorithm produced a three-dimensional map of the underlying cosmic web structure.

They then analyzed the ultraviolet light from 350 quasars (at much farther distances of billions of light-years) cataloged in the Hubble Spectroscopic Legacy Archive, which holds the data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope's spectrographs. These distant cosmic flashlights are the brilliant black-hole-powered cores of active galaxies, whose light shines across space and through the foreground cosmic web. Imprinted on that light was the telltale absorption signature of otherwise undetected hydrogen gas that the team analyzed at specific points along the filaments. These target locations are far from the galaxies, which allowed the research team to link the gas to the universe's large-scale structure.

""It's really fascinating that one of the simplest forms of life actually enables insight into the very largest-scale structures in the universe,"" said lead researcher Joseph Burchett of the University of California (UC), Santa Cruz. ""By using the slime-mold simulation to find the location of the cosmic web filaments, including those far from galaxies, we could then use the Hubble Space Telescope's archival data to detect and determine the density of the cool gas on the very outskirts of those invisible filaments. Scientists have detected signatures of this gas for several decades, and we have proven the theoretical expectation that this gas comprises the cosmic web.""

The survey further validates research that denser regions of intergalactic gas is organized into filaments that the team found stretches over 10 million light-years from galaxies. (That distance is more than 100 times the diameter of our Milky Way galaxy.)

The researchers turned to slime mold simulations when they were searching for a way to visualize the theorized connection between the cosmic web structure and the cool gas detected in previous Hubble spectroscopic studies.

Then team member Oskar Elek, a computational media scientist at UC Santa Cruz, discovered online the work of Sage Jenson, a Berlin-based media artist. Among Jenson's works were mesmerizing artistic visualizations showing the growth of a slime mold's tentacle-like network of food-seeking structures. Jenson's art was based on outside scientific research, which detailed an algorithm for simulating the growth of slime mold.

The research team noted a striking similarity between how the slime mold builds complex filaments to capture new food, and how gravity, in shaping the universe, constructs the cosmic web strands between galaxies and galaxy clusters.

Based on the simulation, Elek developed a three-dimensional computer model of the buildup of slime mold to estimate the location of the cosmic web's filamentary structure.

Although using a slime-mold-inspired simulation to pinpoint the universe's largest structures may sound bizarre at first, scientists have used computer models of these humble microorganisms, as well as grown them in petri dishes in a lab, to solve such complex problems as finding the most efficient traffic routes in large cities, solving mazes and pinpointing crowd evacuation routes. ""These are hard problems to solve for a human, let alone a computer algorithm,"" Elek said.

""You can almost see, especially in the map of galaxies in the local universe from the Sloan data, where the filaments should be,"" Burchett explained. ""The slime-mold model fits that intuition impressively. The structure that you know should be there is all of a sudden found by the computer algorithm. There was no other known method that was well suited to this problem for our research.""

The researchers say that it is very difficult to design a reliable algorithm for finding the filaments in such a large survey of galaxies. ""So it's quite amazing to see that the virtual slime mold gives you a very close approximation in just minutes,"" Elek explained. ""You can literally watch it grow."" Just for comparison, growing the organism in a petri dish takes days. Slime mold actually has a very special kind of intelligence for solving this one spatial task. After all, it's critical to its survival.

Many species of reef fish change functional sex over their life time. New work shows why this evolves.,http://ucdavis.edu/news/male-size-advantage-drives-evolution-sex-change-reef-fish,"Some species of fish, notably parrotfish and wrasses living on coral reefs, change their biological sex as they age, beginning life as females and later becoming functionally male. New work from the University of California, Davis, shows that this sequential hermaphroditism evolves when bigger males gain an advantage in reproductive success — for example by defending a permanent mating territory.

“People have wondered why this kind of sex change evolved,” said Jennifer Hodge, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Evolution and Ecology in the UC Davis College of Biological Sciences. A paper about the work by Hodge, research associate Francesco Santini and Professor Peter Wainwright is published online in The American Naturalist.

Fishes are the only vertebrates to show such a sex change over their lifetime. The prevailing theory is that sequential switching from female to male evolves when it is more beneficial to reproduce as a female when small and as a male when large — a circumstance that is likely to change depending on the social and mating behavior of the species.

Evidence to confirm this idea has been lacking, however.

Large males can hold territory

Mating behavior differs wildly across this group of fish. In some species, males defend a territory and monopolize one or more females within it. Others establish a “lek,” or temporary territory, that is visited by females. And in some species, fish mate without establishing a territory at all.

Mating systems that require defending a territory or females provide the opportunity for larger males to be more reproductively successful.

“Large males can control mates and resources, establishing a territory with food and shelter,” Hodge said.

Hodge, Santini and Wainwright tested this theory by looking at 89 species of wrasses and parrotfishes with different kinds of mating systems. They used DNA sequence data to reconstruct a tree of the relationships between the species of fish and assigned them to different mating systems based on published studies.

“Our results provide some of the first comparative evidence to support the theory that sequential hermaphroditism evolves when, for a given sex, reproduction is more effective at a certain size,” Hodge said. The size advantage increases from lek-like to haremic mating systems, she said, as does the likelihood that all males of the population will be derived from sex-changed females.

The work was supported by grants from the NSF and an NSF postdoctoral fellowship to Hodge."

Heartwarming appeal to find 'angels' who helped save elderly couple in UK,http://bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/18281306.heart-warming-appeal-find-angels-helped-save-elderly-couple/,"An elderly woman wants to thank two young men who helped her and her husband who got stuck in their car over two stone boulders.

Jenny Allen, who is 80-years-old, and her 93-year-old husband were driving down a 'soggy country lane' near Burnham Beeches.

Mrs Allen said: ""The speed was slow because we were looking out for a particular address - several cars were behind us, so my husband who was at the wheel pulled over to allow them all to pass.""

In doing so he unintentionally drove over two stone boulders which got lodged in the undercarriage of the car.

Mrs Allen told the Bucks Free Press that they tried for about 15 minutes and at their age the prospect of getting away seemed 'very dismal'.

Many cars passed during their struggle until a large van and trailer stopped for the elderly couple.

Mrs Allen said: ""Two tall guys came to inspect the trouble , and without any hesitation they set to to free the car for us.

"Prosthetic innovation: 'It's like you have a hand again': study. Today's artificial limbs can look very natural, and now an innovative process makes prosthetic hands move more naturally as well.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-amputees/prosthetic-innovation-its-like-you-have-a-hand-again-study-idUKKBN20R2WR,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Today’s artificial limbs can look very natural, and now an innovative process makes prosthetic hands move more naturally as well.

In an innovative experiment, scientists have shown that the nerves in patients’ arms can be trained to control the movements of prosthetic fingers and thumbs.

“This is the biggest advance in motor control for people with amputations in many years,” said Paul Cederna, a professor of plastic surgery and biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan.

A challenge to powering prosthetics has been the minute signals put out by an amputee’s nerves. Cederna’s team boosted the signal by wrapping tiny bits of muscle around nerve endings, according to their study published in Science Translational Medicine.

As the nerves grow into the muscle, the person’s thoughts can create a muscle twitch that produces a signal big enough to be picked up by tiny wires connected to a nearby computer, which tells the prosthetic hand to move.

“Our ultimate goal is to have prosthetic limbs that the person views as a part of their body,” Cederna said.

In an example of how well the system works, a woman who was nervously tapping her own fingers prompted the prosthetic to tap right along with it, Cederna said. “It was just doing what the other hand was doing, like it was a part of her,” he noted.

“This worked the very first time we tried it. There’s no learning for the participants. All of the learning happens in our algorithms. That’s different from other approaches.”

The procedure also worked for another amputee in the study who had lost not only his hand, but also part of his arm.

“It’s the coolest part of what they’ve shown,” said Lee Fisher, an assistant professor in the University of Pittsburgh’s department of physical medicine and rehabilitation and bioengineering.

Participants were able to pick up blocks with a pincer grasp, move their thumb in a continuous motion, lift spherical objects, and even play in a version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, according to the study.

The approach is an “exciting innovation,” but no one can predict when it will be marketable, said David Putrino, co-director of the abilities research center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. “Currently it takes 17 years to get something (from the lab) out into clinical practice,” he said."

Many moths are endowed with ultrasound-sensitive ears that serve the detection and evasion of echolocating bats.

The thorax of a moth is bulky and hence acoustically highly reflective. This renders it an obvious target for any bat. Much of the thorax of moths is covered in hair-like scales, the layout of which is remarkably similar in structure and arrangement to natural fibrous materials commonly used in sound insulation. Despite this structural similarity, the effect of thorax scales on moth echoes has never been characterized. Here, we test whether and how moth thorax scales function as an acoustic absorber. From tomographic echo images, we find that the thin layer of thoracic scales of diurnal butterflies affects the strength of ultrasound echoes from the thorax very little, while the thorax scales of earless moths absorbs an average of 67 ± 9% of impinging ultrasonic sound energy. We show that the thorax scales of moths provide acoustic camouflage by acting as broadband (20–160 kHz) stealth coating. Modelling results suggest the scales are acting as a porous sound absorber; however, the thorax scales of moths achieve a considerably higher absorption than technical fibrous porous absorbers with the same structural parameters. Such scales, despite being thin and lightweight, constitute a broadband, multidirectional and efficient ultrasound absorber that reduces the moths' detectability to hunting bats and gives them a survival advantage."

Scientists devise model for the kinematics of wok-tossing to explain how it produces fried rice that is nicely browned but not burnt. The best model is a timely combination of side-to-side and see-sawing motions.,http://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/georgia-tech-physicists-unlock-the-secret-to-perfect-wok-tossed-fried-rice/,"Fried rice is a classic dish in pretty much every Chinese restaurant, and the strenuous process of tossing the rice in a wok over high heat is key to producing the perfect final product. There's always chemistry involved in cooking, but there's also a fair amount of physics. Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology have devised a model for the kinematics of wok-tossing to explain how it produces fried rice that is nicely browned but not burnt. They described their work in a recent paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society: Interface.

This work hails from David Hu's lab at Georgia Tech, known for investigating such diverse phenomena as the collective behavior of fire ants, water striders, snakes, various climbing insects, mosquitos, the unique properties of cat tongues, and animal bodily functions like urination and defecation—including a 2019 Ig Nobel Prize-winning study on why wombats produce cubed poo. Hu and his graduate student, Hungtang Ko—also a co-author on a 2019 paper on the physics of how fire ants band together to build rafts—discovered they shared a common interest in the physics of cooking, particularly Chinese stir-fry.

Hu and Ko chose to focus their investigation on fried rice (or ""scattered golden rice""), a classic dish dating back some 1,500 years. According to the authors, tossing the ingredients in the wok while stir-frying ensures that the dish is browned but not burned. Something about this cooking process creates the so-called ""Maillard reaction"": the chemical interaction of amino acids and carbohydrates subjected to high heat that is responsible for the browning of meats, for instance.

But woks are heavy, and the constant tossing can take its toll on Chinese chefs, some 64 percent of whom report chronic shoulder pain, among other ailments. Hu and Ko thought that a better understanding of the underlying kinematics of the process might one day lead to fewer wok-related injuries for chefs.

In the summers of 2018 and 2019, Ko and Hu filmed five chefs from stir-fry restaurants in Taiwan and China cooking fried rice and then extracted frequency data from that footage. (They had to explain to patrons that the recording was for science and that they were not making a television show.) It typically takes about two minutes to prepare the dish, including sporadic wok-tossing—some 276 tossing cycles in all, each lasting about one-third of a second.

Ko and Hu presented preliminary results of their experiments at a 2018 meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics, publishing the complete analysis in this latest paper. They were able to model the wok's motion with just two variables, akin to a two-link pendulum, since chefs typically don't lift the wok off the stove, maintaining ""a single sliding point of contact,"" they wrote. Their model predicted the trajectory of the rice based on projectile motion, using three metrics: the proportion of the rice being tossed, how high it was tossed, and its angular displacement.

The authors found two distinct stages of wok-tossing: pushing the wok forward and rotating it clockwise to catch rice as it falls; and pulling the wok back while rotating it counter-clockwise to toss the rice. Essentially, the wok executes two independent motions: side to side, and a see-sawing motion where the left end moves in a clockwise circle and the right moves counterclockwise. ""The key is using the stove rim as the fulcrum of the seesaw motion,"" the authors wrote. Also key: the two motions share the same frequency but are slightly out of phase.

Hu compared the effect to ""flipping pancakes or juggling with rice."" The trick is to ensure that the rice constantly leaves the wok, allowing it to cool a little, since the wok temperature can reach up to 1,200 degrees Celsius. That produces fried rice that is perfectly browned but not burned.

Based on their analysis, Hu and Ko recommend that chefs increase both the frequency of motion when tossing fried rice in a wok and the ""phase lag"" between the two distinct motions. This ""may enable rice to jump further, and promote cooling and mixing.""

The mathematical model Hu and Ko developed isn't just a fun curiosity; it should also prove useful for industrial robotic designs. One goal for the authors is to develop a wearable exoskeleton or similar device to reduce the rate of shoulder injury among Chinese chefs. But there has been interest in automating cooking since the 1950s to perform such basic functions as cutting, boiling, frying, and pancake flipping—the latter task usually relying on reinforcement learning algorithms.

There have also been attempts to automate stir-frying fried rice in large batches, with limited success. Prior robotic designs have included a rotating drum to mix ingredients, and a see-sawing wok to flip ingredients, augmented with an automated spatula. These could mix ingredients via rotation or shaking but could not toss the rice and, thus, could not produce the ideal carbonated grains. ""If there was an automated way of doing this, it could be very useful [for chefs],"" said Hu.

"What I got from this study is that if you're not lifting as well as usual, reducing the weight will improve recovery, prevent injury, and lead to the same muscle gains, but read for yourself if interested",http://medicalnewstoday.com/articles/weight-training-best-success-less-is-more,"Researchers have demonstrated that reducing the amount of weight that people lift in training can improve their performance. Share on Pinterest New research confirms that velocity-based training improves performance while reducing muscle fatigue. The researchers, from the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom, have shown that weightlifters can enhance their performance across a range of measurements by varying the amount of weight that they lift in their training sessions. These findings, which appear in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, could help athletes maintain or improve their performance while reducing their muscle fatigue.

Two types of strength training The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that adults perform muscle-strengthening exercises on at least 2 days of the week. These exercises could include, for example, pressups, situps, or lifting weights — ideally, as many as a person can manage before they find it difficult to do another repetition. For athletes, these forms of exercise are even more important, particularly for those playing sports that rely on muscle strength. However, while doing muscle-strengthening exercises is important, so is an athlete’s ability to recover. Recovering fully means less time injured and, as a result, more time maximizing the efficiency of each workout. Traditionally, weightlifters do muscle-strengthening exercises by lifting a percentage of the maximum amount of weight that they can lift. This percentage-based training (PBT) builds muscle strength over days or weeks as they repeat the exercise. An alternative method of weightlift training is velocity-based training (VBT). Here, in each session, the trainer measures the time that it takes the weightlifter to lift the weight. The trainer can then tailor the amount of weight that the weightlifter uses accordingly.

Varying the amount lifted The researchers recruited 16 men between the ages of 18 and 29 years, who all had at least 2 years’ experience weightlifting. They assigned each participant to one of two groups. The first group completed 6 weeks of training using PBT, while the second group used VBT. The researchers determined the maximum weight that each participant could lift. The PBT group then did training based on lifting a percentage of this weight. Meanwhile, the VBT group did a series of warmups that allowed the researchers to measure their performance relative to their predetermined maximum and their warmup measurements on previous days. The researchers then tailored the amount of weightlifting that the VBT group members did. If a weightlifter was less able to lift weights that day, the team reduced the amount that they asked them to lift. Conversely, if the weightlifter was able to lift the weights as quickly as on previous days, they received heavier weights to lift. Overall, the VBT group ended up lifting less weight over the course of the training than the PBT group. According to Dr. Harry Dorrell from the University of Lincoln’s School of Sport and Exercise Science, “There are a lot of factors which can contribute to an athletes’ performance on a particular day, such as how much sleep they have had, nutrition, or motivational factors, but with traditional percentage-based methods, we would have no insight into how this effects [sic] their strength.” “The velocity-based training enabled us to see if they were up or down on their normal performance and thus adjust the load accordingly.” “It’s about making sure the athlete is lifting the optimal load for them on that particular day,” he continues. “If you lift too little, then you won’t stimulate the body as you intend to, but if you lift too much, you’ll be fatigued, which increases the risk of injury.” “This fatigue won’t necessarily happen immediately, either. You could lift too much regularly, and 3 weeks down the line, this will catch up with you, and you’ll find that the muscles are too fatigued to manage what you believe should be in your ability.”"
"Disguises are surprisingly effective: Superficial but deliberate changes in someone's facial appearance, such as a new hairstyle or complexion, are effective in identity deception, reducing the ability of participants to match faces by around 30%, even when they were warned, finds new study.",http://york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2019/research/study-reveals-disguises-are-surprisingly-effective/,"Catch me if you can: Study reveals disguises are surprisingly effective

Posted on 18 February 2019

Superficial but deliberate changes in someone’s facial appearance – such as a new hairstyle or complexion - are surprisingly effective in identity deception, new research suggests.





In the study, led by researchers at the universities of York and Huddersfield, participants were often fooled by disguises when asked to judge whether two photographs showed the same or different people.

Disguises reduced the ability of participants to match faces by around 30%, even when they were warned that some of the people had changed the way they look.

Participants were only able to see through disguises reliably when they knew the people in the images.

Security settings

Co-author of the study, Dr Rob Jenkins from the Department of Psychology at the University of York, said: “We shouldn’t be complacent about deliberate disguise in criminal and security settings. When someone puts their mind to concealing their identity, it can be very effective.

“Familiarity with the people who are disguising themselves improves accuracy. When you are unfamiliar with a face you are easily fooled by superficial changes in hairstyle or colouration.

“However, when you ‘know’ a face you tend to rely more on internal facial features - the eyes, nose and mouth - which are much harder to alter.”

The models recruited for the study were given plenty of time and resources with which to change their appearance. Many used make-up, changed their hair colour and style, and some grew or got rid of facial hair.

To ensure maximum effort, a financial incentive was introduced with a prize for the model whose disguise fooled the most participants.

Props like hats or dark glasses were not allowed as they are prohibited in real-life security settings.

Criminal suspects

The researchers also compared the effectiveness of two different methods of disguise.

Impersonation disguise - or trying to look like someone else - is sometimes used by people attempting to travel using a stolen passport or in cases of identity theft. Evasion disguise – trying not to look like yourself - might be used in witness protection programmes or by undercover police, as well as by criminal suspects on the run from the law.

The study found that evasion disguise is much more effective than impersonation disguise.

Dr Eilidh Noyes, from the University of Hudderfield, added: “With evasion disguise, you can change your appearance in any way you like. With impersonation, you can only change your appearance in ways that resemble your target, so your options are much more constrained.

“Deliberate disguise poses a real challenge to human face recognition. The next step is to test automatic face recognition on the same tasks.”"
"By watching videos of each other eating, blue tits and great tits can learn to avoid foods that taste disgusting and are potentially toxic. Blue tits learned best by watching their own kind, but great tits learned equally well from observing either species.",http://newscientist.com/article/2234640-blue-tits-learn-to-avoid-gross-food-by-watching-videos-of-other-birds/,"Blue tits can learn what food to avoid from watching other birds on video Blickwinkel/Alamy

Blue tits and great tits can learn to avoid unpleasant foods without even tasting them. Seeing another bird’s disgusted response, even if it is just on video, helps them avoid unpalatable prey by recognising their markings.

Liisa Hämäläinen at the University of Cambridge and her colleagues studied this type of social learning in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major), which forage together.

Two groups of 24 birds, 12 blue tits and 12 great tits, were shown a video of either a blue tit or a great tit eating unpleasant “prey” – food soaked in a bitter solution and marked with a black square. The filmed birds reacted with disgust by wiping their beaks and shaking their heads.

The birds that watched the videos were then introduced to unpleasant food and their normal, unaltered food to see if they had learned from the filmed birds. Another set of 12 blue tits and 12 great tits were presented with these food options without having watched the videos.

For both species, the birds that had watched the videos ate fewer unpleasant prey items than those that hadn’t. Blue tits learned best by watching their own kind, but great tits learned equally well from observing either species.

While several birds have been shown to avoid certain prey by observing their own species, this has only been seen across species once before, between red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula).

This is also the first time blue tits have been shown to use social information to the same, or an even greater, extent as great tits. The researchers believe this could be because the study focused on risky food choices.

“The two species differ in size, and it is possible that great tits can cope better with chemical defences because they are larger than blue tits,” says Hämäläinen. “The costs to consume potentially toxic food might therefore be higher for blue tits.”

Predators learning from each other in this way could explain why certain prey animals develop conspicuous markings despite the attention they attract. In places where multiple predators can learn from a single predation, this could make more conspicuous warning signals worth it.

Vydra's superb solo goal gives Burnley win at Southampton. Matej Vydra's superb goal boosts Burnley's hopes of playing in Europe for the second time in three years in their weather-affected Premier League win at Southampton.,https://bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51423888,"Last updated on .From the section Premier League

Matej Vydra's goal was his first for Burnley since 22 September 2018

Matej Vydra's superb goal boosted Burnley's hopes of playing in Europe for the second time in three years as they won a weather-affected Premier League game at Southampton.

The result lifts the Clarets up to 10th, five points behind Sheffield United in fifth.

The visitors had made the perfect start, Ashley Westwood scoring direct from a corner after 93 seconds.

Danny Ings, who was deceived by the flight of the ball for Westwood's goal, made amends by equalising with a rasping drive into the bottom right corner from 18 yards.

With Saints mastering the wet and windy conditions brought on by Storm Dennis better than their opponents, Jack Stephens then headed Sofiane Boufal's delivery against the Burnley crossbar as the hosts pressed for a winner.

But Vydra's stunning left-foot effort, into the top-left corner from 18 yards, ensured Burnley claimed their first league double over Southampton since 1947.

Clarets aim for Europe

Burnley arrived on the south coast after winning at Old Trafford in their last away game.

And a typically gritty performance, illuminated by Vydra's goal, helped them equal their longest unbeaten run of the run of the season, four matches.

It was not always pretty from Burnley, who already had the worst pass-completion rate in the Premier League and who slipped to 61% here, but crucially it was effective.

Full-backs Charlie Taylor and Phil Bardsley routinely hit the channels while the likes of Jack Cork, Dwight McNeil and Jeff Hendrick remained on the periphery of the action.

'That's a fantastic goal for sure' - Dyche on Vydra's second-half stunner

Dyche's side last qualified for European competition in 2017-18, with a seventh-place Premier League finish, and may well fancy their chances of emulating that achievement.

Games against Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham aside, the Clarets have a reasonably promising run-in.

And if Manchester City's ban from European club competitions is upheld, it opens up the possibility of the team finishing fifth playing in the Champions League, with Europa League qualification extending further down the table.

Saints cause own problems

If Burnley were rewarded for their no-nonsense approach to defending, the opposite was true for Southampton.

While Saints went into this contest with seven wins from 12 matches they once again displayed their vulnerability at home.

Ralph Hasenhuttl's side have now lost eight times at St Mary's this season and many of those defeats appear to have been self-inflicted - with orders to play out from the back in challenging conditions continually causing them problems here.

Southampton 1-2 Burnley: Hasenhuttl disappointed after 'worst start you can imagine'

Hasenhuttl had also suggested his team could use the elements in their favour against Burnley but instead saw his side immediately caught out by conditions as the visitors scored their quickest ever away goal in the Premier League.

Up against the club where he made his name, Ings curiously moved out of the way of Westwood's corner, which - with nobody on the near post and goalkeeper Alex McCarthy out of position - crept over the line.

Ings did at least redeem himself with his 15th goal of the season, his best return since scoring 21 for the Clarets in the Championship six years ago.

But it was not enough to add to the 11 points they have taken at home, which is the worst record in the division.

Man of the match - Ben Mee (Burnley)

Ben Mee made the joint most clearances of any player and was Burnley's most accurate passer

'We scored a sublime goal' - what they said

Burnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to Match of the Day: ""It was incredibly poor conditions for travelling let alone football. A tough game, really tough. We had to dig in again like we do.

""We didn't take a grip of the game [after we scored], they did. We waited for the game to come to us and you can't do that. They were better than us first half. Second half, we calmed the game down. We scored a sublime goal.

""Chris Wood has got a hamstring [problem]. We're happy he got off quick and could feel it early. We don't spend massive amounts of money and so that involves a whole squad of players. Matej Vydra keeps himself right and he's delivered.""

Southampton boss Ralph Haseenhuttl speaking to Match of the Day: ""First half was OK. We come back from a stupid goal in the second minute. We played better football than the opponent but it's always difficult to make chances against this team. The second half it is very difficult to keep them in their half.

""It was the worst start you can imagine. The reaction was OK. In the end we are not good enough second half. We are not aggressive enough and didn't find the solutions for putting them under pressure.

On a penalty not awarded against Ben Mee for possible handball: ""It's boring to discuss this to be honest, there is no clear line. As you want... continue. We could have this discussion every week.""

Southampton's leaky defence - the stats

Burnley are unbeaten in their past seven Premier League meetings with Southampton (W4 D3).

Southampton have won just 11 points at home in the Premier League this season (P13 W3 D2 L8), fewer than any other side.

Burnley have won back-to-back away Premier League games for the first time since April 2018 (a run of three).

Southampton have conceded 30 goals in their 13 home league games this season, the first English top-flight side to concede so many after just 13 home matches from the start of a campaign since Ipswich Town in 1963-64 (31).

Ashley Westwood's opener after 93 seconds was the earliest away goal Burnley have ever scored in the Premier League.

Danny Ings has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season - the last Southampton player to score more in a season with Saints as a top-flight club was James Beattie in 2002-03 (24).

Among English Premier League players, only Marcus Rashford (19) and Raheem Sterling (20) have scored more goals in all club competitions this season than Ings.

Matej Vydra's winner for Burnley was just his fifth Premier League goal, his first away from home, and first overall since September 2018.

What's next?

Southampton host Aston Villa in their next Premier League game on Saturday, 22 February (15:00 GMT). Burnley are next in action in the Premier League on the same day when they welcome Bournemouth to Turf Moor (15:00 GMT)."
"Woman thanks police with a note and cookies for saving her from an overdose, I actually am able to say I love myself and who I am.",http://boston.com/news/local-news/2020/02/12/natick-police-letter-opioid-crisis,"When the woman walked into the Natick Police Department, she brought two things with her: baked goods and a letter.

Both were to say thank you to the first responders who saved her life.

“I overdosed for the last time in August,” she wrote in the letter. “It was a major wake up call. I went to detox the next day and haven’t used since. Due to you guys saving my live through CPR and Narcan I got my life back!”

The woman went on to share what that meant for her. Since her recovery, she has kept a steady job and regained custody of her daughter.

“I actually am able to say I love myself and who I am,” she wrote. “I got my family back, and they allow me to live with them, also have earned their trust back. Today I celebrate five months sober!”

Natick police Lt. Cara Rossi told Boston.com that the gesture made by the woman a couple weeks ago touched the officers involved — that they were given the opportunity to interact with her in a positive way. The department spokeswoman shared a photo of the letter on Facebook on Tuesday.

“This makes it all worthwhile,” she wrote.

Rossi said she hoped that by sharing the positive moment, it might reach and make a difference to someone also struggling with substance use, spreading the message that no one should give up.

The post has gotten shares across the country, with comments cheering both the department and the letter-writer for persistence in the face of the opioid epidemic.

“The response has been so overwhelmingly positive,” Rossi said. “It’s so unbelievable to me.”

The public safety community has worked hard to embrace the opioid epidemic as a public health crisis, working to break down the stigma associated with addiction and substance use, she said.

But even though the Natick department may be beyond the stereotypes of addiction, Rossi said she still hears people questioning why so much attention and resources are focused on helping those suffering in the crisis.

“This just shows why and I’m hoping that it will change a lot of minds … that these people who need us are worth it,” she said of the letter and the response to it.

That so many people are reacting to the letter emphasizes how there’s “not a single person who hasn’t been impacted in one way, shape, or form” by the opioid crisis, the lieutenant said.

“It’s all of our problem to try and help,” she said.

The observed improvements in reading speed were also accompanied by a change in the overall perception of visual stimuli.

“While studying the cause of developmental dyslexia — the inability to acquire adequate reading abilities — we observed that children with dyslexia show a specific deficit in the analysis of whole visual images, showing a tendency to focused on local details,” explained study author Sandro Franceschini of the University of Padova in Italy.

“In rehabilitation trainings, we observed that improving their global analysis of visual scenes also improved their reading skill. Knowing that caffeine could momentarily improve the global perception of visual scenes in healthy adults, we were interested to measure if this ‘magnification’ of global perception was linked to an improvement of reading skills.”

In two double-blind studies involving 78 participants, the researchers found that a single dose of 200 mg of caffeine (about two espresso coffees) significantly improved the reading speed of text compared to placebo.

In line with previous research, caffeine also improved global pattern perception — meaning the ability to distinguish large letters composed of smaller letters.

The findings highlight that “many different factors contribute to the execution of a complex ability like reading a text, not only phonological skills. Visual perception and attention could play a determinant role,” Franceschini told PsyPost.

The researchers also found that a small amount of sleep deprivation was related to greater beneficial effects.

“Our results show that the effect of caffeine on meaningful word text reading speed was boosted by a small amount of sleep deprivation: if in the previous night one loses two hours of sleep, then the savings when reading this article will be more than doubled,” Franceschini explained.

“It is intriguing to think that caffeine, to boost its effect, needs a specific brain condition. This correlation could drive future research to establish the effect of caffeine on specific neurotransmitters.”

The researchers did not observe speed improvements in the reading of single word lists or nonsense words. “Improvement in text reading speed did not appear to be due to a faster decoding of the single elements that compose the string of letters or a faster access to phonological lexicon,” the authors of the study wrote.

Caffeine also did not boost phonological short-term memory or executive functions.

“We would like to understand the specific network activated by caffeine intake. Global perception is usually associated with right hemisphere abilities. At the same time, we know that the right hemisphere does not host phonological information. We need to understand specifically in what way this network exerts its influence,” Franceschini said.

The study, “Caffeine improves text reading and global perception“, was authored by Sandro Franceschini, Matteo Lulli, Sara Bertoni, Simone Gori, Alessandro Angrilli, Martina Mancarella, Giovanna Puccio, and Andrea Facoetti."

Touching Food Directly With Your Hands Makes Eating More Enjoyable,http://stevens.edu/news/touching-food-directly-your-hands-makes-eating-more-enjoyable,"(Hoboken, N.J. – Feb. 5, 2020) – Strawberry-flavored mousse tastes 10% sweeter when served from a white container rather than a black one. Coffee tastes nearly twice as intense when it is drunk from a white mug rather than a clear glass one. Adding two-and-a-half ounces to the weight of a plastic yogurt container makes the yogurt seem about 25% more filling.

Now, Adriana Madzharov, a sensory marketing researcher and assistant professor at Stevens Institute of Technology, shows that when high self-control individuals touch food directly with their hands (vs. indirectly with a utensil), they not only experience it as tastier and more satisfying, but they eat more of it. The work, published in the Dec. 19 issue of the Journal of Retailing, not only harnesses the power of touch and food but also offers retailers a simple way to make the eating experience more enjoyable for consumers sampling food.

“It’s an interesting effect,” said Madzharov. “It’s such a small tweak but it can change how people evaluate your product. ”

In her first experiment, Madzharov had 45 undergraduate students visually inspect and evaluate a cube of Muenster cheese, hold it before eating it and then asked them to answer questions about their eating behavior. Half of the participants sampled a cheese cube with an appetizer pick on it and the other half sampled a cheese cube without a pick. Initially, the two groups – direct touch and indirect touch – did not indicate any difference between the cheese with and without the pick before eating it.

Madzharov found that participants who reported a high degree of self-control when consuming food – individuals who report that they can resist tasty foods and are conscious about what and how much they eat – perceived the cheese as tastier and more appetizing after they ate it. However, that finding did not hold true for individuals who report a low degree of self-control when consuming food.

“These two groups do not appear to process sensory information in the same way,” said Madzharov. “Our results suggest that for people who regularly control their food consumption, direct touch triggers an enhanced sensory response, making food more desirable and appealing.”

Even when Madzharov manipulated participants’ thinking on self-control, goals and food consumption, these findings persisted, suggesting that a high degree of self-control influences how people experience food when they touch it directly with their hands – whether self-control is real or primed.

In this second experiment, Madzharov separated a new set of 145 undergraduate students into two groups. The first group was told to imagine that they had decided to be more careful with their diet and cut back on excessive eating in order to achieve their long-term objective of being fit and healthy. The second, that they had decided to worry less about their weight all the time and allow themselves to indulge in tasty foods more often in order to enjoy life and experience its pleasures.

All participants were given a plastic cup with four mini donuts inside it – half with appetizer picks and half without picks. As in the first experiment, the participants were then asked to visually inspect and evaluate the mini donuts on hedonistic qualities such as texture, freshness, quality and nutrition. She also instructed them to report their level of focus and attention when eating the mini donuts to get a measure of mindfulness and sensory experience.

Madzharov found that when participants were primed with self-control (vs. indulgent) thinking, they evaluated the sampled food more positively when they touched it directly with their hands. It also suggests that the mechanism driving this effect was the enhanced sensory experience that participants reported in the direct touch/self-control condition.

Past research has explored, for example, how the weight and texture of containers and cups influence how people evaluate food of beverage, and has confirmed that tactile input from cues external to the food is important. However, this is the first time that direct touch of food has been evaluated as a way to influence how people experience food, and possibly drive consumer behavior.

Two years ago, Madzharov also found that just the scent of coffee, which has no caffeine in it, appears to boost performance in math.

Fifty-four New Zealand citizens and 44 permanent residents on Chinese passports arrived at a navy base in Whangaparāoa, north of Auckland, just after midnight and started their 14-day quarantine.

Their Air New Zealand flight was arranged by the New Zealand government in the wake of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan.

Families and individuals have been assigned a campervan with a number on each of them, according to people RNZ spoke to.

An Auckland woman, who did not want her name used, said she felt lucky that the family, including her husband and two young children, were able to stay together in this special experience.

""There's a dining hall that we can go to and get food. Then you take the food back and eat it in the campervan,"" she said.

""We got lots of options for breakfast, including yogurt, egg, sausage and bread. Last night, we were also given fruit, chips, juice, water and even a hat. We were provided with a toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo and all that.""

She said they were exhausted yesterday and would like to find out more regarding how relatives and friends can drop off some goods for them.

""All the staff members who have been involved in this evacuation are very kind and nice to us. I felt very touched,"" she said.

Auckland man Mr Li, who did not wish to use his full name and who has been in New Zealand, was excited to be reunited with his six-year-old son who went to Wuhan alone for a holiday.

Li, who is now staying in quarantine with his son, said he was appreciative of a family who helped bring his son back.

""Not only did they help bringing my son back, they also helped other people. Another evacuee has two kids and a few suitcases, and this family helped them with the luggage all the way,"" he said.

Li said staff told them there will be children's activities as well.

He said they were asked to stay in their campervan as much as possible, and put a mask on whenever they go outside and wash their hands after they came back to the campervan.

People were also asked not to visit each other, and stay at least an arm's length apart when talking to each other outside the campervan and no longer than 15 minutes every time, he said.

Health officials reassure Whangaparāoa locals

Health officials have offered reassurances to Whangaparāoa locals who live in the Auckland suburb which is housing nearly 160 people evacuated from Wuhan.

About two dozen Whangaparāoa residents gathered this evening at a community event where they wanted answers on the threat posed by the novel coronavirus.

Councillor Wayne Walker said he was not worried.

""We as far as this facility is concerned, it's been used for quarantine before some years ago, it can be isolated very easily, it's in a good position, you couldn't ask for a better location in many respects, so I'm pretty comfortable around that.""

Walker said he was happy for more evacuees to be housed in Whangaparāoa."

Amazing: Scientists Found The Planet's Oldest Asteroid Strike In Australia,http://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/amazing-scientists-found-planets-oldest-asteroid-strike-australia-119256,"The world’s oldest remaining asteroid crater is at a place called Yarrabubba, southeast of the town of Meekatharra in Western Australia.

Our new study puts a precise age on the cataclysmic impact – showing Yarrabubba is the oldest known crater and dating it at the right time to trigger the end of an ancient glacial period and the warming of the entire planet.

What we found at Yarrabubba

Yarrrabubba holds the eroded remnants of a crater 70 kilometres wide that was first described in 2003, based on minerals at the site that showed unique signs of impact. But its true age was not known.

We studied tiny “impact-shocked” crystals found at the site, which show the crater formed 2.229 billion years ago (give or take 5 million years).

This new, precise date establishes Yarrabubba as the oldest recognised impact structure on Earth. It is some 200 million years older than the next oldest, the Vredefort impact in South Africa.

More intriguing, the geological record shows the Earth had glacial ice before the time of the impact – but afterwards, ice disappeared for hundreds of millions of years. Was the Yarrabubba impact a trigger for global climate change?

How to date an asteroid hit

An asteroid strike is one of the most violent geologic events. In an instant, Earth’s crust is squeezed to unimaginable pressures, before exploding and ejecting carnage across the landscape. Large impacts leave behind scars the size of a small city.

The basin formed by an impact will partly fill with molten and pulverised rock from the Earth and from the asteroid itself. The edge of the crater forms a ring of mountains; over time erosion gradually erases the story.

Today, Yarrabubba has been worn down into a minor feature on a barren landscape.

To place the Yarrabubba event in a geologic context, we had to find its age. To find the age, we had to look carefully at minerals in the rocks shocked by the impact.

Geologists date events using “isotopic clocks” in minerals like zircon and monazite. These minerals contain small amounts of uranium, which gradually decays into lead at a known rate.

Asteroid strikes raise the temperature in rocks they hit, causing minerals to lose their accumulated lead, which resets the clock. After impact, the isotopic clocks start ticking again as new lead accumulates.

So by measuring the isotopes of uranium and lead in these minerals, we can calculate how much time has passed since the impact.

At Yarrabubba, we identified tiny crystals of zircon and monazite – each about the width of human hair – with textures that show they had been heated by a massive impact.

We analysed the amounts of lead and uranium isotopes in these crystals using mass spectrometry, and found their clocks had been reset 2.229 billion years ago (give or take five million years). That’s when we realised Yarrabubba coincided with a major change in Earth’s climate.

A different Earth

The Yarrabubba impact occurred during a period in Earth’s history called the Proterozoic eon. Long before plants, fish, or dinosaurs, life at this time consisted of simple, multicellular organisms.

These simple bacteria had already begun changing the composition of air. Previously dominated by carbon dioxide and methane, Earth’s atmosphere gradually became oxygenated by life about 2.4 billion years ago.

As oxygen levels built up, rocks started weathering more, and the atmosphere cooled down. And then ice came, plunging Earth into globally frigid conditions.

Earth has repeatedly dipped into glacial conditions over the last 4.5 billion years. We know about these periods because of deposits of solidified rock and mud that were ground up by glaciers as they bulldozed across Earth’s surface.

Studies have found multiple periods in Earth’s history in which glacial deposits occur in rocks of the same age across many continents. These deposits may represent worldwide glacial conditions, often referred to as a “Snowball Earth” event.

In these periods, ice forms from the poles well into the tropics, covering nearly all of Earth.

There is geological evidence that Earth was in an icy phase during the Yarrabubba impact. Rocks in South Africa show that glaciers were present at this time. But it’s not clear if the amount of ice was similar to today, or if it covered the world.

Fire and ice

So we found Earth’s oldest preserved impact crater, and worked out when the asteroid hit. We also know Earth had ice at the time, but not how much.

To understand the effect of the impact on an ice-covered world, we used computer models based on the physics of shockwaves to estimate how much ice would end up in the atmosphere as water vapour. As it turns out, it’s quite a lot.

Our models show that if the Yarrabubba asteroid hit an ice sheet 5 kilometres thick (not an unreasonable estimate), more than 200 billion tons of water vapour would be ejected into the atmosphere. That’s about 2% of the total amount of water vapour in today’s atmosphere, but would have been a much bigger fraction back then.

Water vapour is a serious greenhouse gas. It’s responsible for about half of the heat absorption from solar radiation today.

Global climate models don’t yet exist for the Proterozoic Earth, so we don’t yet know for sure if the Yarrabubba impact pushed the planet past a tipping point that led to more warming and the end of a possible Snowball Earth.

Fascinating projections of the decline of HPV through vaccines and cervical cancer,http://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30157-4/fulltext,"These findings emphasise the importance of acting immediately on three fronts to scale up vaccination, screening, and treatment for pre-invasive and invasive cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, a one-third reduction in the rate of premature mortality from cervical cancer in LMICs is possible, contributing to the realisation of the 2030 UN SDGs. Over the next century, successful implementation of the WHO elimination strategy would reduce cervical cancer mortality by almost 99% and save more than 62 million women's lives.

In 2020, the estimated cervical cancer mortality rate across all 78 LMICs was 13·2 (range 12·9–14·1) per 100 000 women. Compared to the status quo, by 2030, vaccination alone would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, leading to a 0·1% (0·1–0·5) reduction, but additionally scaling up twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 34·2% (23·3–37·8), averting 300 000 (300 000–400 000) deaths by 2030 (with similar results for once-lifetime screening). By 2070, scaling up vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 61·7% (61·4–66·1), averting 4·8 million (4·1–4·8) deaths. By 2070, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 88·9% (84·0–89·3), averting 13·3 million (13·1–13·6) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 92·3% (88·4–93·0), averting 14·6 million (14·1–14·6) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). By 2120, vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 89·5% (86·6–89·9), averting 45·8 million (44·7–46·4) deaths. By 2120, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 97·9% (95·0–98·0), averting 60·8 million (60·2–61·2) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 98·6% (96·5–98·6), averting 62·6 million (62·1–62·8) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [45–55]) of deaths averted would be in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29–34]) would be in South Asia; over the next 100 years, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions. For premature deaths (age 30–69 years), the WHO triple-intervention strategy would result in rate reductions of 33·9% (24·4–37·9) by 2030, 96·2% (94·3–96·8) by 2070, and 98·6% (96·9–98·8) by 2120.

The WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) involves three independent, dynamic models of HPV infection, cervical carcinogenesis, screening, and precancer and invasive cancer treatment. Reductions in age-standardised rates of cervical cancer mortality in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) were estimated for three core scenarios: girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with catch-up for girls aged 10–14 years; girls-only vaccination plus once-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up; and girls-only vaccination plus twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up. Vaccination was assumed to provide 100% lifetime protection against infections with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and to scale up to 90% coverage in 2020. Cervical screening involved HPV testing at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with scale-up to 45% coverage by 2023, 70% by 2030, and 90% by 2045, and we assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancer would receive appropriate surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, which would increase to 90% by 2030. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions.

WHO is developing a global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem, which proposes an elimination threshold of four cases per 100 000 women and includes 2030 triple-intervention coverage targets for scale-up of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to 90%, twice-lifetime cervical screening to 70%, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer to 90%. We assessed the impact of achieving the 90–70–90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century. We also assessed the potential for the elimination initiative to support target 3.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.

The aims of the current analysis were to model cancer treatment scale-up in addition to HPV vaccination and cervical screening and to assess the impact of achieving the 90–70–90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century on the path to elimination. The cervical cancer elimination initiative has been framed within the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support the realisation of SDG target 3.4—a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.Therefore, we also assessed the potential for the cervical cancer elimination strategy to deliver a one-third reduction in premature mortality from cervical cancer by 2030.

WHO Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Target 3.4: by 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being. Indicator 3.4.1: mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease.

In May, 2018, the Director-General of WHO announced a call to action to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, and in January, 2019, the WHO Executive Board requested that a draft global strategy to achieve elimination be developed. The draft global strategy being developed by WHO, with its partners, includes triple-intervention targets for scale-up of vaccination, screening, precancer treatment, and invasive cancer treatment in all countries; these targets specify 90% coverage of HPV vaccination, 70% coverage of twice-lifetime screening, and 90% access to cervical precancer and cancer treatment services and palliative care, by 2030.To inform the strategic planning process, the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) was formed and has done comparative modelling of potential intervention scenarios in all 78 LMICs. In the accompanying Article published in The Lancet,CCEMC predictions of the impact of HPV vaccination, screening, and precancer treatment strategies on cervical cancer incidence and cases averted are presented; the analysis found that elimination by 2120 at a threshold of four cases per 100 000 women was possible in all 78 LMICs if girls-only vaccination was combined with twice-lifetime screening. This strategy was predicted to reduce age-standardised incidence across 78 LMICs by 97% and to avert more than 74 million cervical cancer cases over the next century.The analysis concluded that adding screening with high uptake to vaccination will expedite reductions in cervical cancer incidence and the number of cases averted, and will be necessary to eliminate cervical cancer in countries with the highest burden.

Many high-income countries are transitioning, or considering transitioning, from cervical cytology to primary HPV testing for cervical screening, which is generally a more effective and cost-effective approach to screening.Initiatives for both HPV vaccination and screening have been introduced in the context of broad access to diagnostic, precancer treatment, cancer treatment, and supportive and palliative care services in high-income countries, and the combination of early detection via screening and effective treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy has meant that net 5-year survival for cervical cancer is around 60–70% or greater in several high-income countries.However, in LMICs, uptake of cervical screening has been low and inconsistent, and population-level access to cancer care is generally poor. As a consequence of these differentials in access to cervical screening and treatment, the majority of deaths (91%) from cervical cancer currently occur in LMICs and upper-middle-income countries, and 60% of deaths are in LMICs.Access to supportive and palliative care services for people in LMICs is poor,and thus the majority of women dying from cervical cancer do so with little or no supportive care or pain relief.

Implementing the 90–70–90 WHO triple-intervention strategy to achieve cervical cancer elimination will result in more than 74 million cervical cancer cases averted and more than 62 million women's lives saved over the course of the next century. These findings have informed the draft WHO global strategy for cervical cancer elimination, which will be presented to the WHO Executive Board in February, 2020, and thereafter considered at the World Health Assembly in May, 2020.

This analysis of the impact of the WHO triple-intervention cervical cancer elimination strategy on mortality outcomes shows that, in the next 10 years, achieving substantial reductions in mortality will require successful scale-up of cancer diagnostic and treatment services in LMICs, including pathology, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; supportive and palliative care services will also need to be scaled up. If this is done, the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goal of achieving a greater than one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases could be realised for cervical cancer. In the next 50 years, cervical screening and vaccination will both have an important role. The triple-intervention strategy would result in mortality rate reductions of 92% by 2070, increasing to almost 99% over the course of the next century as the full benefits of vaccination of young cohorts are realised over time.

Most low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) do not have access to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, cervical screening programmes are unavailable or poorly implemented, and population-level access to cancer treatment services is variable. WHO, with its partners, is developing a global strategy towards the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. The draft strategy involves triple-intervention targets for scale-up of vaccination, screening, and precancer treatment and invasive cancer treatment and palliative care in all countries; these targets, known as the 90–70–90 WHO triple-intervention strategy, specify 90% coverage of HPV vaccination, 70% coverage of twice-lifetime screening with HPV testing (or a similarly high sensitivity test), and 90% of women having access to cervical precancer and cancer treatment and palliative care services, by 2030. In the accompanying Article published in The Lancet, the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) predicted the impact of various HPV vaccination and screening and precancer treatment strategies on cervical cancer incidence in 78 LMICs. The analysis found that cervical cancer elimination by 2120 at a threshold of four cases per 100 000 women-years was possible in all 78 LMICs if girls-only vaccination was combined with twice-lifetime screening. The results suggested that elimination was consistently achievable, and the number of cervical cancer cases averted maximised, only if vaccination was combined with twice-lifetime cervical screening and with appropriate treatment for women found to have cervical precancer. The CCEMC harnesses three independent, extensively peer-reviewed models: Policy1-Cervix (Cancer Council NSW, Sydney, NSW Australia), Harvard (Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA), and HPV-ADVISE (Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada). In this analysis, the models projected the reductions in cervical cancer mortality over time by use of standardised scenarios determined via consultations at various WHO technical expert, advisory group, and global stakeholder meetings.

Prophylactic vaccines against oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) have been available in most high-income countries from 2006 onwards. First-generation vaccines directly protect against oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 in individuals naive for those types, and these HPV types are responsible for approximately 70% of invasive cervical cancers.More recently, broader-spectrum protection against the types responsible for up to 90% of cervical cancers has been shown either via direct protection against a larger proportion of types (second-generation 9-valent vaccine) or via cross-protection against non-vaccine included types (bivalent vaccine).However, because vaccines are primarily targeted at pre-adolescents or young adolescents, it is expected to take several decades after deployment in a population before their full benefits in terms of cancer prevention are realised, and a substantial impact of vaccines on cervical cancer incidence or mortality outcomes is yet to be observed. To date, vaccine coverage in LMICs has been low overall, with an estimated 3% of the primary targeted population of young girls in less developed regions vaccinated by 2014.By 2016, only 14% of LMICs had established vaccination programmes.

In 2018, an estimated 570 000 cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed, and 311 000 women died from the disease.Although cervical cancer has been relatively well controlled for several decades in many high-income countries, mainly because of cervical screening initiatives and effective cancer treatment services, it remains the most common cause of cancer-related death among women in 42 countries, most of which are low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs).

This research was partly funded by WHO, which contributed to study design, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report. Other funders had no role in the design of this analysis or the decision to submit for publication. KC, JJK, and MB had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

The analysis was a comparative exercise based on three models with different structural and parameterisation assumptions and a form of sensitivity analysis is built into the reported ranges of results. We reported on key model-specific findings for calibration outcomes and for age-specific mortality rates ( appendix pp 3–7, 11–25 ). We also ran explanatory (but counterfactual) scenarios to understand the sensitivity of the model results to underlying aspects of the impact modelling, including an extreme sensitivity analysis on the impact of cancer treatment scale-up. We also assessed the impact of using alternative population structures for age standardisation on the predicted age-standardised rate and the impact of different underlying fertility assumptions for population projections on the cumulative number of cervical cancer deaths averted.

Each single-model analysis was done independently at a country level. The coordinating centre for the analysis (Cancer Council NSW, Australia) aggregated all results, applied standard populations and population projections, and estimated the median and range of results. Results are presented across all 78 LMICs, regionally, and by country. Rates were age-standardised by applying the age structure of the 2015 World Female Population aged 0–99 years. Premature mortality from cervical cancer was estimated by applying the 2015 World Female Population for ages 30–69 years, and in sensitivity analysis it was based on the probability of death from cervical cancer from age 30 years to 70 years.For calculation of deaths averted, country-specific and age-specific population projections were based on the UN World Population Prospects: 2017 Revision.Relative reductions over time were compared to the status quo. We summarised results for mortality reductions, and deaths averted were calculated from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2030, 2070, and 2120, with the median (range) of model predictions for each result. See the appendix (pp 46–49) for more details.

WHO Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Target 3.4: by 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being. Indicator 3.4.1: mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease.

For this analysis we considered two types of intervention packages—vaccination alone or vaccination combined with cervical screening and treatment for precancer and screen-detected cancer, delivered in conjunction with scaled-up treatment services for clinically detected cancer. This approach took into account the feasibility and acceptability of whether interventions could be considered in isolation from each other. Although vaccination can be considered in isolation since it is prophylactic, population-wide implementation of cervical screening leads to screening-related detection of precancer and invasive cervical cancer (with favourable effects on stage-shifting). Referral pathways should be organised so that women with screen-detected invasive cancer are offered prompt and effective treatment (with treatment capacity scaling up as screening expands), since this approach then leads to improved survival outcomes.

Vaccination was assumed to scale up to 90% coverage from 2020 with 100% lifetime broad spectrum protection against HPV oncogenic types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 in individuals susceptible to the relevant type; the analysis thus applies to a broad-spectrum vaccine that protects against these types either by direct protection (as per a second-generation 9-valent vaccine) or via cross-protection for non-vaccine-included types. We assumed that full efficacy against vaccine types was achieved with two doses for vaccine recipients aged younger than 15 years, and with three doses for older vaccine recipients (although dose delivery was not explicitly modelled). Cervical screening was assumed to involve HPV testing once or twice per lifetime at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with increasing uptake from 45% in 2023, 70% in 2030, to 90% in 2045 onwards. Sensitivity of HPV testing was assumed to be 90% for CIN2 and 94% for CIN3 or worse, independent of age. We assumed that 90% of HPV screen-positive women received visual assessment and appropriate treatment as required for precancer or cancer (triaging was not explicitly modelled). For successfully delivered precancer treatment, treatment success was assumed to be 100%; CCEMC groups differed in their modelling of post-treatment natural history for whether an elevated risk of recurrence was simulated ( appendix pp 50–56 ). We assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancers would have access to high quality surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, and this would increase to 90% by 2030. Once treatment access was scaled up to 90% in 2030, 10-year survival was assumed to increase to 78% for women diagnosed at FIGO Stage 1, 69% at FIGO Stage 2, 52% at FIGO Stages 3–4A, and 8% at FIGO Stage 4B ( appendix p 71 ).

Models projected age-standardised cervical cancer mortality and deaths over time in 78 LMICs for standardised scenarios. The selection of core scenarios was determined after consultation at several WHO technical expert, advisory group, and global stakeholder meetings in 2018 and was based on a multi-step process, as previously described.The scenarios were aligned with the scale-up targets articulated in the WHO draft global strategy for elimination.The final fully articulated core scenarios for the mortality impact analysis were ongoing girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with multi-age cohort catch-up in the first year for ages 10–14 years (S1); girls-only vaccination, once-lifetime screening at around age 35 years with precancer treatment, and invasive cancer treatment scale-up (S2); and girls-only vaccination, twice-lifetime screening at around ages 35 years and 45 years with precancer treatment, and invasive cancer treatment scale-up (S3; the WHO triple-intervention strategy). We also considered two supplementary vaccination scenarios: girls-only vaccination with initial extended multi-age cohort catch-up to age 25 years (S4), and vaccination of girls and boys at age 9 years with multi-age cohort catch-up at ages 10–14 years (S5; appendix 57–59 ).

Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2018 estimates are based on IARC-certified cancer registry information where available in a country, or on a series of estimation methods if verified registry data are not available.Each group incorporated initial country-level stage-specific 5-year and 10-year survival rates, and models were then calibrated to country-specific and age-specific mortality rates from GLOBOCAN 2018 by incorporating a quality factor into the final estimated country-specific and stage-specific survival assumptions. This approach encompasses limitations in the available data on staging, treatment access, uncertainties in actual delivery of treatment, variations in treatment delivery from established protocols and recommendations, equipment and infrastructure maintenance and logistics, and treatment abandonment. The calibrated results for incidence and mortality are shown for each model in the appendix (pp 3–7) , summarised as the results across all 78 LMICs and at the regional level. Calibration results were comparable for all three models and generally demonstrated good fit with GLOBOCAN 2018.

Treatment for cervical cancer involves stage-appropriate multimodality therapies with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with surgery (partial or total hysterectomy) being an important option for early-stage disease. Cervical cancer clinical staging was based on the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) sub-regional-level estimates for the stage distribution of invasive cervical cancer at diagnosis, and data on 5-year and 10-year survival rates were derived from systematic reviews done by WHO based on peer-reviewed publications and national reports including cancer control plans, cross-referenced to data from IARC cancer registries. Radiotherapy access, estimated as machine density per 1000 patients with cancer, was used as a surrogate for multimodal treatment delivery. We used 2018 data for radiotherapy access and availability of external beam radiation therapy and personnel (radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and radiation therapy technologists) provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency's Directory of Radiotherapy Centres (DIRAC). Ranges of treatment access rates in each World Bank region encompassed the lowest and the highest treatment access rates of the countries in each region and represented the percentage of the population that could potentially be served with the equipment and workforce available ( table 1 ). These data were then used to derive initial estimates of country-level current status quo stage distributions, treatment access rates, and survival rates ( appendix pp 63–70 ). We used these data as an initial (pre-calibration) input to the models.

This table provides a regional summary of the data used as an initial (pre-calibration) input to the models; however, each modelling group also applied a quality factor to further adjust survival in the status quo to fit to Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2018 estimates for cervical cancer mortality by 5-year age group appendix pp 3–7, 63–70 . Detailed country-specific estimates for status quo treatment access rates are provided in the appendix (pp 63–70) . Staging is according to International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for carcinoma of cervix (2009 version) and TNM, 7th edition. Data based on a systematic review done by WHO, which obtained information from 43 countries, prioritising countries with population-based cancer registries. Results were derived by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) subregions. Regional results shown are weighted on the basis of each country's cancer case burden.

Treatment access rates were estimated on the basis of radiotherapy access and on the most recent availability of external beam radiation therapy and personnel (radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and radiation therapy technologists), which were provided by the Directory of Radiotherapy Centres (DIRAC). Ranges of treatment access rates in each region encompass the lowest and the highest treatment access rates of the countries in each region and represent the percentage of the population that could potentially be serviced on the basis of the equipment and workforce available.

The comparator (status quo) S0 scenario assumed no scale-up of vaccination, cervical screening, or cancer treatment. Under the status quo, it was assumed that none of the 78 LMICs had achieved substantial vaccination coverage by 2020, although in practice a few countries, such as Rwanda, have initiated high-coverage vaccination initiatives within the past few years. Thus, our analysis only captures the effect of scaled-up vaccination from 2020 onwards. For cervical screening, modelling groups made different assumptions about whether the impact of limited existing screening coverage was considered in the status quo (see the appendix pp 50–56 for further details).

HPV transmission and cervical carcinogenesis are modelled for the oncogenic HPV types included in second-generation vaccines (HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) and other oncogenic types, and each model simulates the type-specific natural history of cervical cancer from persistent HPV infection to cervical cancer via high-grade precancerous cervical lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 [CIN2] and 3 [CIN3]). All models can simulate complex cervical screening and treatment algorithms, and for the current analysis these models were adapted to incorporate country-level assumptions about the proportion of women receiving cervical cancer treatment and the consequent survival outcomes. Reporting was done according to a consensus-based framework for modelled evaluations of HPV prevention and cervical cancer control: HPV-FRAME.See the appendix (pp 50–56, 74–76) for a detailed description of the model platforms and HPV-FRAME reporting.

The WHO CCEMC comprised three modelling groups collaborating with WHO and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The platforms were independent dynamic models, identified by WHO by use of predefined criteria. The modelling methods have been previously described.In brief, the selected models for the analysis explicitly considered the dynamic transmission of HPV infection (and could thus capture the effects of herd immunity); were capable of projecting the impact of HPV vaccination, cervical screening, and precancer treatment and clinical and screen-detected cancer treatment scale-up at a country level for all 78 LMICs considered; and were independently developed and have been extensively validated and peer reviewed. Three models were selected: Policy1-Cervix (Cancer Council NSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia), Harvard (Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA), and HPV-ADVISE (Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada). The individual CCEMC models have been previously used to inform national policy on cervical screening and HPV vaccination in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA, and at the global level.The structure of the CCEMC models and the comparative modelling approach were endorsed by the WHO Advisory Committee on Immunization and Vaccines related Implementation Research (IVIR-AC).

The 78 LMICs considered were located in six regions according to World Bank definitions: east Asia and Pacific, Europe and central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, north Africa and the Middle East, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa (see the appendix pp 44–45 for the full list of countries within each region and the grouping of countries by income level).

The findings for model-specific, explanatory, and sensitivity analyses are provided in the appendix (pp 11–25, 33–43) . Overall, the findings were concordant between models. The only notable difference was in the level of herd immunity predicted at older ages for unvaccinated individuals, which probably relate to underlying differences in assumptions around assortative sexual mixing among different age groups and different behaviour groups; we consider that the model variation in this area provides a useful reflection of true uncertainty in outcomes. The explanatory results demonstrated that the main benefits by 2030 were via cancer treatment scale-up, and that screening would lead to substantial mortality reductions beyond those conferred by vaccination and cancer treatment scale-up from 2030 to 2070–80. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the choice of standard population is an important driver for rate estimates and also showed that, for deaths averted, differences between individual model estimates were much smaller than the unavoidable uncertainties in future population projections over the next century.

The appendix (pp 27–32) provides information at the country level for the predicted impact of the WHO triple-intervention strategy. In all countries, the median estimates of mortality rates by 2120 approach 1 per 100 000 women or lower.

With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [range 45–55]) of deaths averted would be in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29–34]) would be in South Asia (including India); over the next century, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions ( appendix p 26 ).

By 2120, girls-only vaccination would result in a mortality rate of 1·3 (range 1·3–1·9) per 100 000 women, corresponding to a mortality reduction of 89·5% (86·6–89·9), averting 45·8 million (44·7–46·4) deaths. By 2120, a mortality rate of 0·2 (0·2–0·5) per 100 000 women, corresponding to a reduction of 98·6% (96·5–98·6), would be achievable with the WHO triple-intervention strategy, averting 62·6 million (62·1–62·8) deaths. If screening were done once per lifetime instead of twice, 60·8 million (60·2–61·2) deaths would be averted over the same period. The specific estimate for the incremental benefit of the twice-lifetime versus once-lifetime screening package over this period was 1·6 million (1·3–2·5) additional deaths averted, with most of these additional deaths averted before 2070. Compared to girls-only vaccination alone, 16·8 million (16·4–17·4) additional deaths would be averted via the triple-intervention strategy by 2120.

By 2070, girls-only vaccination would lead to a mortality rate of 5·0 (range 4·5–5·4) per 100 000 women, corresponding to a reduction of 61·7% (61·4–66·1), averting 4·8 million (4·1–4·8) deaths, but scaling up once-lifetime screening and treatment in addition to vaccination would result in a rate of 1·4 (1·4–2·2) per 100 000 women, corresponding to a reduction of 88·9% (84·0–89·3), averting 13·3 million (13·1–13·6) deaths. By 2070, girls-only vaccination, twice-lifetime screening, and treatment would result in a mortality rate of 1·0 (0·9–1·6) per 100 000 women, corresponding to a reduction of 92·3% (88·4–93·0), averting 14·6 million (14·1–14·6) deaths. Compared to girls-only vaccination with catch-up to age 14 years (S1), extended-multi-age cohort vaccination to 25 years (S4) would result in increased intermediate-term mortality benefits, bringing forward the benefits of vaccination by about a decade ( figure 1 ). At the high levels of vaccination coverage for girls assumed in the analysis, additional vaccination of boys at age 9 years (S5) would have minimal additional impact on cervical cancer mortality in women over the next 50 years and would have similar intermediate-term benefits to girls-only vaccination by 2070 ( figure 1 table 2 ).

The solid lines represent the median outcome of the three models; the shading represents the range of model outputs. HPV=human papillomavirus. LMICs=low-income and lower-middle-income countries. S0=status quo (no scale-up of vaccination, screening or treatment). S1=female-only vaccination at 9 years with multi-age cohort catch-up to age 14 years in 2020.

Supplementary S5=female and male vaccination at age 9 years with multi-age cohort catch-up to age 14 years in 2020. All scenarios assume the use of a broad-spectrum HPV vaccine with protection against seven oncogenic types.

In 2020, the predicted age-standardised rate for cervical cancer mortality across all 78 LMICs was 13·2 (range 12·9–14·1) per 100 000 women. By 2030, vaccine-only strategies would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, which would remain at 13·2 (12·9–14·0) deaths per 100 000 women, corresponding to a 0·1% (0·1–0·5) reduction, averting a median of 620 deaths across all 78 LMICs by 2030 (rounded to 0·0 million in table 3 ). However, scaling up twice-lifetime cancer screening and treatment in addition to vaccination would result in a mortality rate of 8·5 (8·2–10·8) by 2030, corresponding to a 34·2% (23·3–37·8) reduction, averting 300 000 (300 000–400 000) deaths, mainly due to the impact of improved access to cancer treatment. In this 10-year timeframe, vaccination plus once-lifetime screening or twice-lifetime screening and treatment scale-up would lead to similar mortality reductions. For further information about the relative contribution of the interventions, see the appendix (pp 33–40)

Cumulative cervical cancer deaths (in millions) across all 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries over three time periods are shown.

All vaccination strategies assume the use of a broad-spectrum HPV vaccine with protection against the seven oncogenic types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Population projections were obtained from the UN and further projected out to 2120 ( appendix pp 48–49 ). The median for deaths is the median of three possible model outputs for a given time period, and might use results from different models at different periods; similarly, the median for deaths averted and percentage reduction versus S0 is the median model for these metrics independently, and might be different to the median model selected for total deaths metric, and might also be different across the different periods. Caution should be applied in interpreting comparative differences between the values in this table, which represent the median and range across models; any individual median result could represent the findings of any one of the Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium models. Note that the sum of averted cases and cases predicted for a given strategy might also not be identical to cases predicted for S0 because of rounding.

Note that table entry is zero due to rounding. Actual median and range of estimates for deaths averted: 620 (−1100 to 3600) deaths (model methods incorporate randomness and heterogeneity in estimates, which can occasionally, over shorter-term timeframes, lead to relative increases rather than decreases in rates compared to the status quo, shown here as a negative value).

Predictions from the three models were broadly consistent for all scenarios. Figure 1 shows the summary results across the models for the reduction in age-standardised mortality from 2020 to 2120, table 2 depicts these findings as numerical snapshots of the rates and relative reductions compared to the status quo scenario over time, and the reductions in premature mortality in women aged 30–69 years. Snapshots of the age-specific findings in 2020, 2070, and 2120 for each of the three CCEMC models are shown in the appendix (pp 11–25)

Model methods incorporate randomness and heterogeneity in estimates, which can occasionally, over shorter term timeframes, lead to relative increases rather than decreases in rates compared to the status quo, shown here as negative values. Randomness and heterogeneity can also lead to slight decreases in the percentage reduction in predicted rates even in the first year modelled (2020) and small differences from the expected relative ordering of the impact of different scenarios or the expected relative reductions over time.

et al. Impact of HPV vaccination and cervical screening on cervical cancer elimination: a comparative modelling analysis in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries. In this analysis, we have quantified, for the first time, the number of women's lives that could be saved by the successful implementation of the WHO global strategy for cervical cancer elimination. This report complements our parallel analysis on cervical cancer incidence.Importantly, by extending the analysis to encompass mortality outcomes, we have quantified the impact of scaling up cancer treatment. Taken together, these two modelling analyses show that successful implementation of the WHO 90–70–90 triple-intervention strategy by 2030 would reduce cervical cancer incidence to 0·7 (0·6–1·6) per 100 000 womenand mortality to 0·2 (0·2–0·5) per 100 000 women across all 78 LMICs by 2120. This outcome, which is only achievable through a multi-sectoral and integrated approach across the continuum of cancer care, would represent extraordinary reductions in cervical cancer incidence (97% reduction) and mortality (99% reduction). Consequently, around 74·1 million cervical cancer cases and 62·6 million deaths would be averted, representing an enormous gain in terms of both quality of life and lives saved.

et al. Scale-up of radiotherapy for cervical cancer in the era of human papillomavirus vaccination in low-income and middle-income countries: a model-based analysis of need and economic impact. A major strength of this study is that we used a comparative approach involving well established model platforms that have been previously validated with data from multiple countries and that have jointly informed many national vaccination and cervical screening policy decisions. Predictions from the three models were broadly consistent for all scenarios, even over a century-long projection period. Our results for vaccination-only strategies are generally consistent with a recent analysis of the shorter-term impact on likely radiotherapy demand in LMICs,which estimated that bivalent HPV vaccination of girls aged 12 years would only result in a 3·9% reduction in incident cervical cancer cases from 2015 to 2035. In line with our findings, the analysis found that incremental scale-up of radiotherapy in LMICs in the shorter term (up to 2035) would yield substantial health gains. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that for deaths averted, the variations generated by the differences in models were much smaller than uncertainties due to population size and structure over the next century. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrated that rates are somewhat sensitive to the choice of standard population used; this emphasises the importance of using the 2015 World Female Population for calculating cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for comparability with our findings and across countries.

et al. Expanding global access to radiotherapy. There were also some limitations to our analysis. The quality and availability of data about access to cancer treatment services, effective delivery of treatment, stage-distribution at diagnosis, and survival are variable for LMICs. Our modelling of survival was based on the latest data from major WHO reviews and we used updated DIRAC radiotherapy machine density as a surrogate for radiotherapy capacity and treatment access; this approach is reflective of the importance of radiotherapy as a cornerstone of effective treatment for cervical cancer and in line with the approach used by recently published models and the 2015 Lancet Oncology Commission on expanding global access to radiotherapy.Furthermore, each modelling group independently did country-level model calibration of stage-specific survival to the best available mortality estimates from GLOBOCAN 2018. We incorporated a calibrated quality factor into the final estimated country-specific and stage-specific survival assumptions, which encompasses data limitations in treatment delivery information as well as variations in treatment delivery from established protocols and recommendations, equipment and infrastructure maintenance and logistics, and treatment abandonment due to financial stress or for other reasons. We did not take into account treatment improvements over time, assuming that mortality benefits resulting from cancer treatment scale-up by 2030 will be only due to the delivery of existing, effective treatment modalities, and not to emerging or hypothetical improvements in treatment beyond what is proven to be effective on a large scale in health services in high-income countries today.

Comprehensive cervical cancer control: a guide to essential practice. Another limitation is that we did not explicitly model HPV infection, precancer and cervical cancer in women living with HIV. Increased progression to precancer and invasive cancer and reduced clearance of HPV is known to occur in women living with HIV, and this group is at increased risk of developing invasive cervical cancer, although this risk might now be partly or largely countered by the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy in many settings.A separate collaborative group sponsored and coordinated by WHO is analysing the effects of HIV burden on estimates of cervical cancer elimination timing in selected countries. Current WHO cervical screening recommendations specify more frequent screening in women living with HIV,and thus the mortality benefits we predicted are likely to depend on successful implementation of more intensive strategies for screening in high HIV-burden settings.

et al. Impact of HPV vaccination and cervical screening on cervical cancer elimination: a comparative modelling analysis in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries. We did not include vaccination of boys or adult women in our core scenarios, because neither strategy has been found to be universally cost-effective even in high-income countries, and neither approach is recommended as part of the draft WHO elimination strategy. WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) has recommended that vaccinating boys or older women should be delayed until current vaccine supply constraints are alleviated.Priority should be given to vaccination of young girls since this strategy will generate the greatest health benefits overall; boys will derive protection via herd immunity if high-coverage vaccination can be achieved in girls, and older women will be offered protection via scale-up of screening and treatment services. In this analysis, we did not explicitly consider cost-effectiveness, although previous work has shown the cost-effectiveness of combined vaccination and cervical screening approaches in various upper-middle-income countries and LMICs.Cost-effectiveness will be required to weigh the trade-offs of the different strategies assessed here, including the incremental costs and benefits of vaccinating boys and doing two cervical screening tests instead of one in a lifetime. We found that the additional benefit of twice-lifetime versus once-lifetime screening was 1·6 million more deaths averted over a century, but the differences in cases averted is much higher.Thus, the incremental improvement in quality of life from including a second screen is likely to be substantial. Furthermore, our findings for screening are in the context of rapid and effective scale-up of cancer treatment. If cancer treatment is not as broadly available as we assumed, the incremental benefits of additional cancer prevention via increasing screening to two tests in a lifetime would be larger. Finally, the incremental benefits of a second screen are higher when considered over the next 50 years rather than 100 years, because if vaccination is scaled up successfully then screening will provide the most benefit in the next 50–60 years. In the future, it will be important to assess the potential for future de-intensification of cervical screening, since our findings suggest that this could be considered in some countries after about 2070–80, when the full benefits of vaccination for mortality outcomes are becoming realised. The ongoing work of the CCEMC is focused on more detailed analysis of the incremental benefits of the strategies and on quantifying cost-effectiveness for the 78 LMICs; we are also analysing a larger number of more nuanced alternative scenarios at a country level, including optimal triage policy. In general terms, more detailed country-level analyses, taking into account specific local factors important for the effective delivery of vaccination and screening interventions, will continue to be required, and should be viewed as an important complement to the current large-scale analysis.

WHO guidelines for the use of thermal ablation for cervical pre-cancer lesions. The WHO scale-up targets for elimination can be considered aspirational. Many challenges will need to be overcome, including vaccine and screening test supply and delivery challenges, and the infrastructure challenges associated with scale-up of invasive cancer diagnostics, treatment, and supportive and palliative care services. If scale-up is achieved more slowly than we have assumed, then reductions in mortality will be correspondingly delayed. With respect to HPV vaccination, the assumed scaled up 90% coverage rate is broadly in line with data suggesting that global coverage of other vaccines in LMICs (including measles, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) is 84–90%.Our analysis for screening broadly applies to a wide range of clinically validated HPV tests that can achieve benchmark sensitivity and specificity. Testing could be done either at a central laboratory or in a point of care environment, with clinician-collected or self-collected samples; the sensitivity of PCR-based self-collected tests has been shown to be comparable to that of clinician-collected samples.In principle, our findings also apply to any future screening test with similar performance to that of primary HPV testing. For example, machine learning approaches for analysing digitised cervical images hold promise in some settings.Our modelling of screening assumed that the majority (90%) of HPV-positive women were treated, with visual assessment for treatment done only to exclude the possibility of a frank cancer or a large precancerous lesion (which would require referral). Therefore, our findings for the impact of the cervical screening and referral pathway are likely to represent the maximum attainable benefit. In practice, resource-stratified guidelines recommend different approaches in different settings and, where possible, women are triaged to treatment to minimise the potential harms, which include psychosocial impact, potential overtreatment, and a possible impact on obstetric outcomes. WHO is revising its guidelines for cervical screening and has already revised its guidelines for precancer treatment to take into account the latest evidence and the elimination strategy.

One of our main findings is that although achieving cervical cancer elimination per se will take many decades, the benefits of scaling up to the WHO elimination coverage targets will start to be realised within a decade. Key to this insight is an understanding of the timing of the effects of each intervention. Over the next 10–20 years, scaling up cancer treatment services will have the greatest impact because thousands of women in LMICs are being diagnosed every year with cervical cancer but have no access to adequate treatment. With appropriate treatment, survival prospects for early-stage and locally advanced cervical cancer are high. As a linked issue, offering appropriate palliative care to women who require it is an ethical and moral imperative. Over the intermediate term (the next 50–60 years), cervical screening will make an important contribution to outcomes, and over the longer term the full benefits of vaccination will be realised. The realisation of the major benefits of screening and vaccination over the intermediate and longer term will, however, require immediate action to implement these initiatives.

Political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage: “universal health coverage: moving together to build a healthier world”. 39 Union for International Cancer Control

Cancer and universal health coverage. World Cancer Leaders' Summit 2019 report. Nur-Sultan (Astana), Kazakhstan. Scaling up to national vaccination, screening, and cancer treatment services in LMICs will be greatly facilitated by the successful realisation of universal health coverage in countries (SDG target 3.8). The 2019 Political Declaration of the UN high-level meeting on universal health coverage reaffirmed that health is a precondition for, and an outcome and indicator of, all dimensions of sustainable development, and countries strongly recommitted to achieving universal health coverage by 2030.Building resilient and sustainable health systems could also be facilitated by the cervical cancer elimination initiative.For example, cervical screening initiatives might be able to support or build on HIV services, since women receiving antiretroviral therapy return for refills regularly. Opportunities exist to link screening with sexual and reproductive health services, potentially increasing both uptake of screening and of contraception services. The elimination initiative could assist with building cancer literacy and addressing stigma in communities, and scaling up treatment as well as supportive and palliative care services for cervical cancer should have positive implications for various other tumour types. Access to universal health coverage will be a key underlying factor for the achievement of SDG goal 3.4, to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by a third by 2030. We have shown that, when considered at a level across all 78 LMICs, the cervical cancer elimination initiative will specifically support efforts to achieve this target. More broadly, the elimination agenda will support a reduction in poverty (SGD1), an increase in gender equality (SDG5), and reduction in inequalities (SDG10). Thus, successful implementation of the elimination initiative will have both nearer-term and enduring positive consequences, not only for women but also for their families and broader society.

In conclusion, these findings emphasise the importance of acting now on three fronts to scale up HPV vaccination, screening, and treatment for cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, achieving substantial reductions in cervical cancer mortality will depend on successful scale-up of cancer treatment services in LMICs, and supportive and palliative care will need to be scaled up alongside such services. Implementing the WHO strategy towards cervical cancer elimination will result in large-scale mortality reductions and more than 62 million women's lives saved over the next century in LMICs. These findings have informed the draft WHO global strategy for cervical cancer elimination, which will be presented to the WHO Executive Board in February, 2020, and thereafter considered at the World Health Assembly in May, 2020."
Minute weekly exercise provides health benefits to older people. Experts found that the once weekly session was enough to produce improvements in blood glucose control and general mobility.,http://abertay.ac.uk/news/2020/one-minute-of-weekly-exercise-enough-to-provide-health-benefits-to-older-people/,"One minute of weekly exercise enough to provide health benefits to older people

Just one minute of exercise per week is enough to provide health benefits to people over the age of 65, according to new research.

The study, from Abertay University in Dundee, saw groups of 65 to 75-year-olds participate in either once or twice weekly training sessions for a period of 8 weeks.

Each had been living a sedentary lifestyle, and had not been taking part in regular exercise.

The participants took to stationary bikes, and were asked to cycle as hard as they were able to for six seconds before resting for at least a minute.

They would repeat the process – which is known as sprint interval training (SIT) – until they had exercised for a total of one minute.

Experts found that the once weekly session was enough to produce improvements in blood glucose control and general mobility.

As people age, they lose the ability to take glucose out of their blood which results in insulin resistance.

This can lead to Type 2 Diabetes, and problems with the heart and liver.

Dr John Babraj (pictured above), who led the study, said: “We’ve found that SIT, whether it’s done once a week or twice a week, improves the ability to get glucose out of the system.

“While those participating in the twice-weekly sessions observed a greater improvement, those taking part in the single session also observed change.

“Importantly, they also observed a difference in general function, greatly improving their ability to do everyday tasks such as getting up to answer a door and walk up and down stairs.

“These are major issues for older people. As we lose physical function, we start to become socially isolated, and as we become socially isolated our quality of life declines significantly.”

Dr Babraj wants to see sprint interval training introduced to the government’s physical-activity guidelines: “Currently, older adults are advised to participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, and that can be difficult to accrue.

“Both of our groups produced greater adaptations than what we would expect the smallest worthwhile change to be.

“Our results provide further support for the inclusion of this form of training in the guidelines as one of the methods to gain health benefits.”

"A single dose of psilocybin improved anxiety, depression, hopelessness, and existential dread in patients with life-threatening cancer diagnoses for nearly 5 years. A third of cancer patients experience emotional distress and psilocybin may provide lasting relief for their mental health.",http://inverse.com/mind-body/cancer-patients-single-dose-one-popular-drug-provides-relief,"A cancer diagnosis can be a terrifying thing. Medical bills, loss of loved ones, and the fear of death can overwhelm people with cancer, and may even diminish their chances of survival. But a new therapy tested in people with life-threatening cancer offers potential relief for these crippling anxieties.

The therapy rests on psilocybin — a compound found in psychedelic or ""magic"" mushrooms — which is taken alongside a course of traditional psychotherapy. The study, which followed people diagnosed with cancer for four and half years, offers compelling evidence that a single dose of psilocybin improves anxiety, depression, and existential dread years after the drug leaves their systems.

“Three out of four of our participants said the therapy was the singular or in the top five most spiritually meaningful experiences of their lives and they continue to remember them,” Stephen Ross, researcher at NYU Langone and senior author on the study, said in a teleconference.

“These experiences rapidly changed their relationship to cancer, changes which this long-term follow-up study suggests endure for years.”

Ross and colleagues published their findings Tuesday in the journal Journal of Psychopharmacology.

""I have a greater appreciation and sense of gratitude for being alive.”

Current approaches to treating cancer-related psychological turmoil tend to fall short. Traditional drug treatments for depression and anxiety work for less than half of people being treated for cancer — in fact, people may as well take a placebo, research suggests. Psilocybin could offer a welcome — and even life-saving — alternative, the researchers say.

Untreated cancer-related anxiety, depression and existential distress are linked with higher suicide rates among people seeking treatment for cancer and decreased survival of cancer, probably related to impaired immune function, Ross explained.

“The implication here is that psilocybin profoundly altered the care of cancer patients, especially those confronting death,” Ross said.

Psychedelic boom

The study builds on research that dates back to the 1970s, when scientists tested the psychological effects of LSD in cancer patients. The results were promising, but research on psychedelics stalled for the next four decades. Now, clinical trials have picked up again.

The new results follow up a 2016 landmark study which illuminates psilocybin’s powerful psychological effects. In both studies, participants include a group of people diagnosed with life-threatening cancer.

In 2016, researchers divided 29 cancer patients into two groups: One group received a single dose of psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) in a controlled setting and took part in nine psychotherapy sessions with trained clinicians. The control group received a placebo, Niacin (250 mg), which induces a similar flush to a psychedelic experience, along with the same amount of counseling sessions. After seven weeks, the researchers switched the groups’ drug treatments. The placebo group then received a single dose of psilocybin, while the psychedelic group received Niacin.

During the study, the participants filled out questionnaires designed to measure how depressed, anxious, hopeless, or demoralized they felt. They also self-reported their quality of life, spirituality, well-being, and whether they felt existential dread or had a mystical experience during treatment.

Psilocybin produced “immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements” in anxiety and depression in all the participants, the researchers reported.

“One day after getting psilocybin, 80 percent of the participants no longer met criteria for depression related to cancer,” Ross said. These effects were “immediate and clinically meaningful.""

A single dose of psilocybin led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual well-being, and increased quality of life. But this first study only tracked participants’ psyches for six and a half months, so whether psilocybin’s mood benefits persisted beyond the study period was not known. Until now.

The power of a single dose

To test the drug’s long term effects, the research team followed up with 16 of the 29 2016 study participants (nine patients had passed away). Of these, 15 people chose to be involved in the new analysis.

Researchers gave the participants the same mental-health questionnaires from the original study at two time points — 3.2 and 4.5 years after the initial psilocybin doses. The participants also filled out a questionnaire asking open-ended questions about positive changes that they attributed to the psilocybin-assisted therapy experience.

The majority of participants experienced reduced anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization, and death anxiety. At both follow-up check-ins, 60 to 80 percent of participants showed hallmarks of having been successfully treated for depression and anxiety.

That means the original mood-boosting effects of the psilocybin dose appear to have endured nearly five years after the initial therapy. This is the longest study to date analyzing psilocybin’s effects on the mental health of cancer patients, the researchers say.

One participant responded in the questionnaire, “There’s a reckoning, which came with cancer, and this reckoning was enhanced by the psilocybin experience. I have a greater appreciation and sense of gratitude for being alive.”

Another wrote:

“[I] most certainly feel a stronger connection to a higher power due to the psilocybin experience, [as well as] greater openness towards others, more empathy, more interconnected with other people. I believe these changes are directly attributable to the psilocybin experience as well as the integration sessions afterwards.”

Mind shift

Participants overwhelmingly (71 to 100 percent) attributed positive life changes to the psilocybin-assisted therapy experience and rated it among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives.

According to the study, not a single participant reported lasting negative or adverse effects from their therapy sessions.

The researchers caution that this isn’t evidence that cancer patients struggling with psychological conditions related to their diagnosis should run out and eat magic mushrooms. Psilocybin ""should be taken in a controlled and psychologically safe setting, preferably in conjunction with counseling from trained mental health practitioners or facilitators,” Gabrielle Agin-Liebes, lead author of the study and researcher at Palo Alto University, said in a statement.

“The brain appears to be more interconnected when you use psilocybin.”

However the evidence does suggest that, under controlled settings, the therapy could make a profound difference to people's lives.

“My experience during the dosing was profound,” said one participant during a teleconference to discuss the research. “I experienced first grade anxiety and then that turned to great compassion for the suffering on Earth, in all different modalities. Then, that turned into a profound spiritual awareness of how connected we all are. That has lasted and opened me enormously.”

The participant “completely lost” the fear of her cancer returning, even though she had been diagnosed with a particularly rare and aggressive form of non Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The psychedelic therapy isn't necessarily ""euphoric,"" Ross said. Instead, it enables patients to confront their fears, and ""pass through them."" Overcoming fear can be vital for a population like cancer patients who are grappling with their own mortality, he said.

How does psilocybin affect the brain?

Scientists aren’t sure how psilocybin affects the brain. But evidence suggests that the brain’s communication pathways seem to change when exposed to psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD.

“The brain appears to be more interconnected when you use psilocybin,” Ross said. “Parts of the brain that don't normally speak to each other communicate with each other.”

Some researchers hypothesize that the therapeutic effect might stem from an area of the brain called the “default mode network,” which helps to create a person’s sense of self. The network is typically active when people daydream. When someone has anxiety or depression, this network goes into overdrive, seemingly triggering them to ruminate and worry. Psilocybin may deactivate the network, enabling people to put their problems in perspective.

“The brain is very complex. We don't know how any psychiatric disorders work from a neurobiological perspective. We don't know any of our medications work, and psychedelics fit into that,"" Ross said.

We’re still years away from psilocybin becoming incorporated as standard treatment for people dealing with cancer-related psychological symptoms, and scientists can’t draw definitive conclusions yet. But if further research confirms the results, the discovery could positively shift the long-term outlooks of people with cancer who are dealing with deadly diagnoses.

The mental turmoil caused by cancer can be as devastating as the physical damage the disease causes. This study suggests psilocybin may be a potentially powerful tool for the almost 40 percent of the global population that will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.

Abstract:

Background: A recently published randomized controlled trial compared single-dose psilocybin with single-dose niacin in conjunction with psycho- therapy in participants with cancer-related psychiatric distress. Results suggested that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy facilitated improvements in psychiatric and existential distress, quality of life, and spiritual well-being up to seven weeks prior to the crossover. At the 6.5-month follow-up, after the crossover, 60–80% of participants continued to meet criteria for clinically significant antidepressant or anxiolytic responses.

Methods: The present study is a long-term within-subjects follow-up analysis of self-reported symptomatology involving a subset of participants that completed the parent trial. All 16 participants who were still alive were contacted, and 15 participants agreed to participate at an average of 3.2 and 4.5 years following psilocybin administration.

Results: Reductions in anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization, and death anxiety were sustained at the first and second follow-ups. Within-group effect sizes were large. At the second (4.5 year) follow-up approximately 60–80% of participants met criteria for clinically significant antidepressant or anxiolytic responses. Participants overwhelmingly (71–100%) attributed positive life changes to the psilocybin-assisted therapy experience and rated it among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy holds promise in promoting long-term relief from cancer-related psychiatric distress. Limited conclusions, however, can be drawn regarding the efficacy of this therapy due to the crossover design of the parent study. Nonetheless, the present study adds to the emerging literature base suggesting that psilocybin-facilitated therapy may enhance the psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being of patients with life-threatening cancer."

It only just beat South Korea, which has ranked first for six years.

The US only came in ninth, while Singapore jumped from sixth place last year to third in 2020.

Germany's top score comes as a surprise given its economy has been struggling in recent months.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Germany has broken South Korea's six-year reign as the ""the most innovative nation in the world,"" according to the latest Bloomberg Innovation Index. The US ranked ninth, while China came in 15th.

A total of 60 nations are included in the index, which is compiled using criteria including research and development spending, manufacturing capability, and concentration of high-tech public companies.

Innovation was a hot topic this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as the political, academic, and business elite discussed technological solutions to the current climate crisis.

Germany secured first place because of its positive ratings in patent activity, high-tech density, and value-added manufacturing. South Korea, on the other hand, recorded a slump in productivity, pushing it down to second place.

The result is somewhat surprising, as Germany's economy has been struggling. In 2019, it grew at its slowest pace in six years due to trade conflicts, a crisis in the automotive industry, and Brexit.

Meanwhile, Singapore rose from sixth place to third overall, and three Nordic countries made it into the top 10.

Japan's innovation ranking dropped by three spots since last year (it is now in 12th place), and the US, which held first place when the Bloomberg Index first debuted in 2013, is now only the ninth most innovative country in the world. The second-largest economy, China, rose one spot to 15th.

This amazing village in India plants 111 trees every time a girl is born,http://globalcitizen.org/en/content/this-amazing-village-in-india-plants-111-trees-eve/?fbclid=IwAR2qmiBk-Nucli1KQX4KNyTBPuuJqLjQlVsmRG6acxM3IrdSJf1Pw2IYrCs,"Every culture has its own traditions surrounding the birth of a child, but this one might be my favorite.

In a country that historically favors the birth of a son, Piplantri village in India has created a new tradition that not only celebrates the birth of a daughter, but also benefits the community and the planet. You see, every time a girl is born they plant 111 trees. That’s right, 111 trees!

This eco-conscious tradition was started by a former village leader when his own daughter passed away at an early age. Since then over a quarter of a million trees have been planted, ensuring that with each new generation the future gets a little greener.

As part of the tradition in Piplantri, the village also creates a “trust”. With contributions from the girl’s parents and the village residents, a trust of 31,000 rupees (US $500) is collected. This sum is set aside in a 20 year fixed deposit for the girl.



This fixed deposit ensures that the girl will never be a financial burden to her family, and alleviates some of the stress historically placed on families to provide a dowry for their daughters at marriage.

As part of accepting the trust, parents sign a legal affidavit which states their daughter will only be married once she reaches legal age and has received a proper education. The trees planted after her birth must be taken care of as well.



These stipulations help protect the right of the girl and promote sustainability by ensuring the fruit trees can support the growing population of the community.



As part of caring for the trees, villagers plant aloe around them to help protect the trees from termites. As an added benefit, these plants can also be used to make various products and have created a source of income for several villagers.

It’s incredible when we see how one tradition can have a positive impact on so many aspects of life. These actions serve as hope for the future of gender equality and sustainability, and it all starts with the birth of a girl."

Russian feminist and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activist Yulia Tsvetkova, already under house arrest for two months on bogus charges of pornography distribution, faces new charges of allegedly violating Russia’s “gay propaganda” law.

In the new charges, police claim Tsvetkova, 26, violated the country’s notorious “gay propaganda” law by posting on social media her drawing, depicting two same-sex couples with children and the caption “Family is where love is. Support LGBT+ families!” Tsvetkova already faces up to six years imprisonment for the pornography charge.

In a recent interview, Tsvetkova said she made the drawing last year in support of a same-sex couple with two adopted children who had to flee Russia after being targeted by authorities.

In December, a court in Komsomolsk-on-Amur fined Tsvetkova 50,000 rubles (US$800) for violation of the “gay propaganda” law over LGBT-friendly and feminist posts in 2 social media groups which she administers. Among other things, the judge was unfazed by the fact that both groups had “18+” age markers even though Russia’s “gay propaganda” ban only concerns “propagating non-traditional sexual relations” to children.

The “gay propaganda” law, adopted by Russia in 2013, was condemned as discriminatory by the European Court of Human Rights in 2017. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has also denounced the law because it “encourages the stigmatization of and discrimination” of LGBT people. However, instead of repealing the law, the Russian government uses it to silence LGBT activists, suppress peaceful protests, and censor online expression.

Tsvetkova came under police scrutiny last year after a homophobic agitator Timur Bulatov, who in his view leads a “moral jihad” against LGBT people, filed written complaints against her. Bulatov is particularly known for identifying allegedly LGBT teachers, outing them to school principals, and demanding their dismissal to guard children against “gay propaganda.” In 2016, he boasted that 65 teachers lost their job as a result of his complaints. Bulatov’s attacks on Tsvetkova forced her to close a youth theater project last spring over security concerns.

Russian authorities should drop all charges against Tsvetkova, finally repeal the propaganda law, and end its targeting of LGBT people which facilitates hate campaigns like that of Bulatov."
"Stray dogs can understand human cues. Untrained stray dogs respond to gestures from people, showing that understanding between humans and dogs transcends training. Dogs can closely observe a human and use their understanding of humans to make a decision. This shows intelligence and adaptability.",http://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/f-ndo010920.php#.XiF5hk5mEFU.reddit,"If you have a dog, hopefully you're lucky enough to know that they are highly attuned to their owners and can readily understand a wide range of commands and gestures. But are these abilities innate or are they exclusively learned through training?

To find out, a new study in Frontiers in Psychology investigated whether untrained stray dogs could understand human pointing gestures.

The study revealed that about 80% of participating dogs successfully followed pointing gestures to a specific location despite having never received prior training. The results suggest that dogs can understand complex gestures by simply watching humans and this could have implications in reducing conflict between stray dogs and humans.

Dogs were domesticated 10,000-15,000 years ago, likely making them the oldest domesticated animals on the planet. Humans then bred dogs with the most desirable and useful traits so that they could function as companions and workers, leading to domesticated dogs that are highly receptive to human commands and gestures.

However, it was not clear whether dogs understand us through training alone, or whether this was innate. Can dogs interpret a signal, such as a gesture, without specific training, or even without having met the signaling person previously? One way to find out is to see whether untrained, stray dogs can interpret and react to human gestures.

Stray dogs are a common feature in cities around the world and particularly in many developing countries. While they may observe and occasionally interact with people, such dogs have never been trained, and are behaviorally ""wild"". Conflicts between stray dogs and humans are a problem and understanding how humans shape stray dog behavior may help alleviate this.

To investigate, Dr. Anindita Bhadra of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, India, and colleagues studied stray dogs across several Indian cities. The researchers approached solitary stray dogs and placed two covered bowls on the ground near them. A researcher then pointed to one of the two bowls, either momentarily or repeatedly, and recorded whether the dog approached the indicated bowl. They also recorded the perceived emotional state of the dogs during the experiment.

Approximately half of the dogs did not approach either bowl. However, the researchers noticed that these dogs were anxious and may have had bad experiences with humans before. The dogs who approached the bowls were noted as friendlier and less anxious, and approximately 80% correctly followed the pointing signals to one of the bowls, regardless of whether the pointing was momentary or repeated. This suggests that the dogs could indeed decipher complex gestures.

""We thought it was quite amazing that the dogs could follow a gesture as abstract as momentary pointing,"" explained Bhadra. ""This means that they closely observe the human, whom they are meeting for the first time, and they use their understanding of humans to make a decision. This shows their intelligence and adaptability.""

The results suggest that dogs may have an innate ability to understand certain human gestures which transcends training. However, it should be noted that the shyer, more anxious animals tended not to participate, so future studies are needed to determine more precisely how an individual dog's personality affects their ability to understand human cues.

Overall, dogs may be more perceptive than we realize. ""We need to understand that dogs are intelligent animals that can co-exist with us,"" said Bhadra ""They are quite capable of understanding our body language and we need to give them their space. A little empathy and respect for another species can reduce a lot of conflict.""

Greatest drummer of all time dead at 67,http://cbc.ca/news/entertainment/neil-peart-obit-1.5422806?cid=ed_npd_bn_tw_bn,"Neil Peart, the virtuoso drummer of iconic Canadian band Rush who was revered by fans and fellow musicians as one of the greatest drummers of all time, has died at age 67.

The influential musician and lyricist died Tuesday in Santa Monica, Calif., after having been diagnosed with brain cancer, according to a statement issued Friday by family spokesperson Elliot Mintz.

His death was confirmed by Meg Symsyk, a media spokesperson for the progressive rock trio comprising Peart, Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson.

""It is with broken hearts and the deepest sadness that we must share the terrible news that on Tuesday our friend, soul brother and bandmate of over 45 years, Neil, has lost his incredibly brave three-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer,"" his bandmates said in a statement.

They also called for privacy for Peart's family and urged fans wanting to express their condolences to make a donation in his name to a cancer research group or charity of their choice.

""Rest in peace, brother.""

Along with penning impressive lyrics, Peart was renowned for his remarkable proficiency on drums (he famously employed a complex drum kit that completely surrounded him) and expertly weaving together techniques from different musical genres, blending jazz and big band with hard rock.

After the Hamilton, Ont.-born, St. Catharines, Ont.-raised Peart joined bandmates Lee and Lifeson in 1974, his virtuoso drumming helped lift Rush to new musical heights.

The band attracted a loyal, worldwide fanbase, sold millions of records and influenced a multitude of rock musicians with its complex, literary music.

The trio was inducted into the U.S. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013, after years of lobbying by devoted fans.

The band played its last tour in 2015, with Peart revealing the following year in the Rush documentary Time Stand Still that he had fought intense physical pain during that final run.

Trump Wishes North Korea's Kim a Happy Birthday,http://voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/trump-wishes-north-koreas-kim-happy-birthday,"SEOUL - U.S. President Donald Trump has sent a happy birthday message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who is believed to have turned 36 Wednesday. It is the first recent reported contact between the two leaders amid stalled nuclear talks.

Trump asked that South Korea deliver the birthday message to Kim, according to South Korea’s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, who met briefly with Trump this week in Washington.

Chung, who spoke with reporters at the airport after returning to Seoul Friday, said he believed the message was delivered through “proper channels.” It is not clear what else, if anything, was in Trump’s message, what form the message took, or how it was delivered.

Trump and Kim have exchanged personal letters during nearly two years of diplomacy. Trump has hinted the two also talk on the phone. Trump insisted last week the relationship remains “very good,” despite U.S.-North Korea talks being stalled.

In his New Year’s comments, Kim vowed the world would witness an unspecified “new strategic weapon in the near future.” Kim also said he no longer felt bound by his self-imposed suspension of long-range missile and nuclear tests.

Kim did not, however, announce a formal end to negotiations, and North Korea has not delivered its threatened “Christmas gift” to the U.S., which many analysts guessed could be a weapons test.

“He likes me. I like him. We get along,” Trump said last week. “He’s representing his country. I’m representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.”

“And I think he’s a man of his word. So we’re going to find out,” Trump added.

The talks have not progressed since February, when Trump and Kim were unable to reach a deal at a summit in Hanoi. Kim later set an end-of-year deadline for the U.S. to offer more concessions and subsequently tested 13 rounds of short-range missiles and artillery. It’s not yet clear what Kim may do to enforce the deadline.

For now, North Korea may look to benefit from maintaining a low-key profile, said Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser for Northeast Asia and nuclear policy at the International Crisis Group.

“It can continue to advance toward its nuclear and economic goals without ruffling Trump’s feathers,” she wrote in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.

Many analysts are pessimistic about the short-term chances for talks, though, given Kim’s New Year’s comments about a long-term standoff with the U.S.

“North Korea has made clear it will not return to the talks unless the U.S. offers new proposals,” Kim Dong Yub, a North Korea expert at Kyungnam University's Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said at a conference in Seoul on Friday.

The North Korean leader has not likely abandoned talks altogether, however, Kim said. “The U.S. is the only country that can help North Korea be a normal nation in the international community,” he added.

Although the birthdays of Kim's father and grandfather, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, are celebrated as major national holidays in North Korea, the younger Kim’s birthday is not yet observed.

There were no reported celebrations in North Korea and state media did not mention the birthday. North Korea has not revealed Kim’s age, but South Korean and U.S. officials believe he is 36."
Installing air filters in classrooms has surprisingly large educational benefits,http://vox.com/2020/1/8/21051869/indoor-air-pollution-student-achievement,"An emergency situation that turned out to be mostly a false alarm led a lot of schools in Los Angeles to install air filters, and something strange happened: Test scores went up. By a lot. And the gains were sustained in the subsequent year rather than fading away.

That’s what NYU’s Michael Gilraine finds in a new working paper titled “Air Filters, Pollution, and Student Achievement” that looks at the surprising consequences of the Aliso Canyon gas leak in 2015.

The impact of the air filters is strikingly large given what a simple change we’re talking about. The school district didn’t reengineer the school buildings or make dramatic education reforms; they just installed $700 commercially available filters that you could plug into any room in the country. But it’s consistent with a growing literature on the cognitive impact of air pollution, which finds that everyone from chess players to baseball umpires to workers in a pear-packing factory suffer deteriorations in performance when the air is more polluted.

If Gilraine’s result holds up to further scrutiny, he will have identified what’s probably the single most cost-effective education policy intervention — one that should have particularly large benefits for low-income children.

And while it’s too hasty to draw sweeping conclusions on the basis of one study, it would be incredibly cheap to have a few cities experiment with installing air filters in some of their schools to get more data and draw clearer conclusions about exactly how much of a difference this makes.

The Aliso Canyon gas leak, explained

Back on October 23, 2015, employees of the Southern California Gas Company discovered a massive leak in the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility near Porter Ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Significant for the larger purposes of the study, the Porter Ranch area is known for having “some of the cleanest air in the Valley year-round.”

The gas leak was a huge catastrophe from the standpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, but also naturally raised concerns in the local community about the immediate impact on public health.

Facing political pressure from concerned parents and teachers, Gilraine writes, “the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the owner of the gas well, the Southern California Gas Company, placed air filters in every classroom, office and common area in all schools within five miles of the gas leak at the end of January 2016.”

Strikingly, however, air testing conducted around the time of the installation of the filters shows that the schools didn’t actually have abnormally high levels of the kinds of pollution that are normally associated with natural gas. Methane is lighter than air, and by the time the filters were installed — nearly three months after the leak — the extra pollution caused was all the way up in the sky and not affecting school buildings.

Consequently, the installation of the filters served not to remove extra contamination caused by the leak, but simply to clean up the normal amount of background indoor air pollution present in the Valley. That lets Gilraine estimate the difference in student performance for schools just inside the boundary compared to those just outside.

He finds that math scores went up by 0.20 standard deviations and English scores by 0.18 standard deviations, and the results hold up even when you control for “detailed student demographics, including residential ZIP Code fixed effects that help control for a student’s exposure to pollution at home.”

For context, this is comparable in scale to some of the most optimistic studies on the potential benefits of smaller class sizes, with Alan Krueger finding that cutting class size by a third leads to a 0.22 standard deviation improvement in academic performance. Other studies find smaller or even negative effects (because adding teachers means bringing in less experienced or less effective ones), but even accepting the positive findings, it costs much more than $700 per classroom to achieve class size reductions of that scale.

This is a big, but not implausible, number

The effect Gilraine finds is strikingly large given that it’s a seemingly trivial intervention.

But Sefi Roth of the London School of Economics studied university students’ test performance relative to air pollution levels on the day of the test alone. He found that taking a test in a filtered rather than unfiltered room would raise test scores by 0.09 standard deviations. That’s about half the impact Gilraine found, just based on day-of-test air quality. In Gilraine’s natural experiment, students benefited from cleaner air for about four months. Given that context, it’s not incredibly surprising that you could see an impact that’s about twice as large.

What’s natural to ask — though unknowable from the study before us — is how much more change we could see if students benefited from an entire school year of clean air. Or perhaps an entire school career, from pre-K through high school graduation, of clean air.

One striking thing about this is the government has long been aware that indoor air pollution is a potential problem. But according to currently prevailing Indoor Air Quality standards, there was nothing wrong with the air in the schools. Filters were installed because of an essentially unwarranted panic about natural gas.

And while Los Angeles is a fairly high-pollution part of the country, outdoor particulate levels are higher in many areas — including New York, Chicago, and Houston — than they were in the impacted neighborhood. In other words, there’s no reason to think the impacted schools were unusually deficient in their air quality. They just happen to be the ones that installed filters.

A cheap, scalable initiative

For a sense of scale, Mathematica Policy Research’s best evidence on the effectiveness of the highly touted KIPP charter school network finds that after three years at KIPP there is significant improvement on three out of four test metrics — up 0.25 standard deviations on one English test, 0.22 standard deviations on another, and 0.28 standard deviations on one of two math tests.

Those are big gains, and they help explain why there is so much enthusiasm about KIPP in some quarters, even as charter schools remain politically controversial and charters in general seem to produce roughly average results.

This is bigger than the impact of letting kids benefit from clean air for four months. But installing the full suite of air filters costs about $1,000 per classroom, and continuing to operate them beyond the first year is cheaper than that. And best of all, unlike totally reworking school operations, it could be scaled up very quickly.

It would be almost trivially easy to get a variety of school districts all around the country to randomly select schools for the installation of air filters. That would rapidly generate a ton of additional data, and if the results continued to be promising, the initiative could be made universal very quickly.

The benefits, on their face, would be extremely large at a relatively low cost. And since air pollution is generally worse in lower-income communities, you would not only raise test scores nationally, but make progress on the big socioeconomic gaps in student achievement that have proven very difficult to remedy."
"My Favorite Beverage Is a 2,000-Year-Old Energy Drink From Ancient Rome",http://getpocket.com/explore/item/my-favorite-beverage-is-a-2-000-year-old-energy-drink-from-ancient-rome?utm_source=pocket-newtab,"We all know it’s good to hydrate. Water can be so blah though. So when I’m trying to rehydrate after a long run in the summer heat, I tend to reach for an old-timey solution: The energy drink of ancient Rome.

The Romans were famed for their innovations in military logistics, which allowed them to extend their territory from Rome and its immediate surrounds to the whole Mediterranean and ultimately, with the establishment of the Roman Empire, virtually all of western Eurasia. But an army can’t win if it’s thirsty. Enter posca. This blend of vinegar and water—and possibly salt, herbs, and other stuff—holds a special place in beverage history thanks to its role as the Gatorade of the Roman army.

It’s possible posca was Greek in origin. Its name may have derived from the Greek word epoxos, which means “very sharp,” according to The Logistics of the Roman Army at War, by Jonathan Roth, historian at San Jose State University. But the beverage owes its fame to the small, but essential, part it played in the Roman army’s legendary efficiency. As early as the middle of the Roman Republic era (509-27 BCE), the military rationed posca to troops along with grains and, very occasionally, meat and cheese. That policy continued for centuries, well into the Roman Empire.

Roman soldiers did, of course, drink water. But historical records suggest that it wasn’t their beverage of choice. Consider what Plutarch wrote about how Cato the Elder, an officer during the Second Punic War (218-202 BCE), dealt with his thirst, according to Roth:

Water was what he drank on his campaigns, except that once in a while, in a raging thirst, he would call for vinegar, or when his strength was failing, would add a little wine.

Like Cato, Romans prized wine for its supposed health benefits, as Rod Phillips, a historian at Carleton University in Ottawa, writes in his book Wine: A Social and Cultural History of the Drink That Changed Our Lives. That made posca—which contained vinegar made from wine gone bad—vastly preferable to plain old H20. And wine, at the time, was plentiful. Rich Romans put back titanic volumes of it. As the reach of Roman imperialism spread throughout Europe, viticulture followed, which “gave their armies ready access to wine depots almost everywhere,” writes Phillips.

For military officials, off wine was a cheap source of calories to distribute in bulk. Diluting it with water to make posca “effectively doubled the volume of liquid ration given to the soldiers at a very low cost,” observes Roth.

There probably was something to the Romans’ belief in posca’s health benefits. The drink’s acidity and slight alcohol content would likely have neutralized bacteria, making it safer than drinking straight water. That could have been a big benefit, given that tainted water has been known to ravage armies more effectively than battle. Vinegar was also thought to help stave off that scourge of militaries throughout history—scurvy. (It doesn’t, as it turns out. But Ancient Romans were hardly the only ones to misplace faith in vinegar’s antiscorbutic virtues; as late as the mid-1800s, the US Army rationed apple cider vinegar to troops stationed in America’s southwest during the Mexican War, according to Roth.)

Mind you, military leaders and other elites generally didn’t deign to drink posca, which was more a drink of the common people, according to Pass the Garum, a fantastic blog dedicated to exploring Roman cuisine. When Roman emperor Hadrian wanted to slum it with his soldiers, this would have been his drink of choice. As Pass the Garum notes, the ancient historian Suetonius mentions vendors selling posca on the streets during the early years of the Roman Empire. Both among soldiers and common folk, posca continued to enjoy favor well into the Middle Ages, writes Andrew Dalby, a renowned historian of Greek and Roman cuisines, in Food in the Ancient World from A to Z.

Aside from slaking Roman thirst, posca’s other main claim to fame arises from its controversial cameo in the Bible. As Jesus Christ was suffering crucifixion—or possibly just before, at Golgotha—Roman soldiers offered him sips of the stuff from a sponge held aloft with a reed, according to Matthew 27:48. Depending on the interpretation, they did this either to help lessen his anguish or to needle him, notes Phillips. Whatever the case, Jesus wasn’t having it. “After tasting the posca, Christ refused to drink it,” writes Phillips.

So what did posca taste like? It’s a little hard to say. Due to its ubiquity in Roman literature of the day, we can safely conclude that it involved some ratio of water and red wine vinegar. But might it also have featured other flavors? History isn’t very helpful on that score, since no Roman posca recipes exist.

Thanks to Byzantine medical writers, however, we’re not totally in the dark. Aëtius of Amida and Paul of Aegina, both Byzantine Greek physicians of the sixth and seventh centuries, respectively, included recipes for a “palatable and laxative” posca that included cumin, fennel seed, celery seed, anise, thyme, and salt, according to another book by Dalby, Tastes of Byzantium: The Cuisine of a Legendary Empire. (However, Dalby complicates the matter somewhat by noting that the word they used, the Greek loanword phouska, may by that time have become a catchall term for second-rate wine substitutes.)

Adding herbs and sweeteners push posca in the direction of more familiar old school vinegar-based drinks like switchel, sekanjabin, and shrub. Throw in salt, and you have the combo of carbohydrates and sodium used in Gatorade and other modern sports drinks that help you recover the water and salts lost during exercise (or from simply sweating a lot). That makes sense: tromping around Europe and Asia Minor while saddled with armor and packs was undoubtedly sweaty work.

As for modern-day perspirers, why buy commercial sports drinks to slake your thirst when you can make the Gatorade of the ancients? While the scribes of antiquity haven’t left us a lot to go on, that hasn’t stopped food bloggers and Roman enthusiasts—and me—from trying. For anyone wanting to join in, here are a few recipes and guidelines to get your started. Make sure to use brewed vinegar only—red wine, black, balsamic, or apple cider, for example—and not distilled.

Though we have only the faintest hint that posca was sweetened, lots of recipes call for honey—like ”Sharp-but-sweet Posca” from Pass the Garum:

2 tbsp red wine vinegar

250ml water

1 tbsp honey

According to this recipe, honey should first be melted in the microwave for about 20 seconds, and then added to the water and stirred. Then add the vinegar.

If you want something a little “sharper,” this recipe, from the site Romae Vitam, calls for a much higher proportion of vinegar to water, as well as crushed coriander seeds:

1.5 cups of red wine vinegar

0.5 cups of honey

1 tablespoon of crushed coriander seed

4 cups of water

The recipe calls for boiling the honey and letting it cool before combining. Also, make sure to strain out the crushed coriander before drinking.

My own posca–making is guided not by zeal for ancient Rome, but, rather, because I’m really thirsty. So while my concoction was inspired by what I learned from a lecture on ancient Roman cuisine a few years back, it has since strayed from the more authentic recipes listed above.

Britain's 'Most Prolific Rapist' Is Jailed for Life,http://nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/europe/reynhard-sinaga-rape.html,"Mr. Sinaga was already serving a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years before parole after being convicted in his earlier trials, which began in 2018. He was sentenced on Monday to life in prison and had his minimum term increased to 30 years.

Mr. Sinaga insisted on taking the case to trial and argued in court that the victims were only pretending to be asleep as part of a sexual role play. He accused the victims of being closeted gay men lying about the assaults, according to British news accounts of the trial.

Each of Mr. Sinaga’s four trials dealt with between 10 and 13 victims. In all, he was found guilty of 159 offenses, including 136 anal rapes.

“He would no doubt still be adding to his staggering tally had he not been caught,” Ian Rushton, a deputy chief crown prosecutor for the northwest of England, said in a statement. He said Mr. Sinaga “appears to have derived further twisted pleasure from rewatching his films in court and putting victims through the trauma of giving evidence.”

Born and raised in Indonesia, Mr. Sinaga came to Britain in 2007 on a student visa. He studied for a master’s degree at Manchester University in sociology, and then began studying for a doctorate in human geography in 2012 at Leeds University.

Living off money given to him by his father, a banker in Indonesia, Mr. Sinaga fashioned a life of nights out and holidays that looked extravagant to his friends, according to British news accounts of trial testimony. He was openly gay, and he attended gay clubs in Manchester and used gay hookup apps, Mr. Sinaga testified.

Mr. Sinaga’s friends’ only hint of his nighttime campaign was the way he boasted of making heterosexual men realize their gay fantasies."
Thank you US and Canadian Firefighters helping out in Australia,http://dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/us-canadian-firefighters-will-help-local-efforts-in-bushfire-crisis/news-story/b3682d095caacf22de608e1fb123a9d9,"North American firefighters have been arriving in Australia since early December to assist in the country’s bushfire crisis with more to be deployed on Monday.

For the first time since 2010, the US is sending firefighters while Canada is sending fire experts to Australia for the first time.

Twenty veteran California firefighters are among those being sent from the US.

According to the National Interagency Fire Centre, the US government agency that coordinates international deployment of firefighters, roughly 100 American firefighters have been sent to Australia over the last four weeks, with 50 to 60 more planned to be dispatched on Monday.

Stephen Tulle, duty officer with the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, said there are currently 84 Canadian fire experts stationed in Queensland and NSW on a six-week deployment.

Canadians are keen to repay Australian assistance received during the 2017 and 2018 fires in the province of British Columbia.

The Canadian contingent says the Australian bushfire crisis is unlike anything they have experienced before.

About 13 million acres of have been burned and at least 17 people have died.

Glen Burgress, who is co-ordinating Canadian efforts out of Sydney, says these fires are particularly severe.

“I’ve seen a lot of pretty dramatic fire behaviour but nothing like what we’re seeing here,” he told the Calgary Herald. “The temperatures are so different and the fire behaviours are so different. It’s not what we’re used to dealing with, for sure. The basics of firefighting don’t really change, but the volatility and the rates of spread are really something we’re not overly used to.”

Marc Mousseau, a Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) official currently in Brisbane, told Globe and Mail that Australia’s drought meant the fire response was different to how fires in Canada were usually handled.

“Freshwater is definitely in short supply here in Australia, so different tactics are used on the fire,” he said. “There’s a lot of burnout operations – you know, clearing and burning. Where we would just find a nice water supply, set up, run hose – they just don’t have that luxury here.”

Canadian officials are keen to stress that Australian firefighters are the most knowledgeable about how to fight these fires but Canadian deployment liaison officer Morgan Kehr says the international contingent has been able to offer a key boost to the firefighting effort.

“Canadians came in fresh and uplifted the spirits and energy levels in the fire control centres they are working in now,” he said. “The staff in the incident management teams are obviously exhausted, and that’s why we’re here.”

NY is now a top solar state! Great way to start the new decade,http://pv-magazine-usa.com/2019/12/17/new-york-is-a-2-gw-solar-state/,"What was billed as the opening of the state’s newest community solar project became a monumental day in New York solar history. The installation, a 6.12 MW project developed by ForeFront Power in Mechanicville, put New York at over 2 GW of solar installed. The Empire State has now become the 9th in the country to have more than 2 GW of solar capacity installed.

The milestone also keeps New York on track to achieve the statewide target of installing 6 GW of solar by 2025.

“Solar energy is a vital part of New York’s Green New Deal strategy to transition to a clean energy future, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality,” said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. “The success of this initiative demonstrates we are on the path to meeting our nation-leading climate goals, and our clean energy agenda is spurring economic growth and jobs while leaving this planet cleaner and greener for generations to come.”

New York is in an especially interesting spot as it positions itself as a national solar leader. While nearly every state within the “2 GW installed” club is home to massive utility-scale projects, New York’s greatest potential lies in distributed generation. The state has no shortage when it comes to rooftops, a resource that is currently being used to develop a a 316 MW / 2528 MWh (that’s 8 hours) energy storage facility (pdf). Furthermore, a study done by City University of New York early in the decade found that 66.4% of all rooftops in New York city were suitable for solar installations, totaling well over 5 GW in capacity.

As for the immediate future of New York solar, it would appear that more positive news is on the horizon. There are 1,262 MW of solar projects currently under development, as reported by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). These 1,200 MW include 351 community solar projects, an impressive figure when you consider that community solar really took off for the first time in New York in 2019. New York’s community solar market is serving roughly 14,000 subscribers across the state.

SEIA estimates that New York will install 3.6 GW total solar over the next 5 years, meaning that in the final year, the state will have to install just 379 MW to achieve the 6 GW goal. That 3.6 GW figure is the 7th most aggressive projection in the nation over that time period.

As we enter the new decade, New York is poised to be one of the states leading the energy transition. And, in typical New York fashion, it will do so to the beat of its own drum. While California, Florida and Texas boast gargantuan utility-scale projects, NYSERDA has filed a petition with the New York State Public Service Commission requesting an additional $573 million to expand the NY-Sun program, which focuses on distributed generation projects. Of that $573 million, $135 million are to be dedicated to activities focused on low- and moderate-income New Yorkers, affordable housing, environmental justice communities, and disadvantaged communities. If this information is to be trusted, New York could well be leading an energy transition by the people, for the people."

Stocks had a stellar year in 2019,http://cnn.com/2019/12/28/investing/stock-market-rally-2019/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) US stocks had a fantastic year in 2019, with all three major indexes climbing more than 20%. But that performance came at the price of volatility and uncertainty.

Last year ended on a sour note, with the worst December since the Great Recession leading to the first annual stock market losses in three years. This year was a rebound -- and then some -- but it wasn't easy. Trade and the Fed, the two big themes of 2019, pushed and pulled on equities. The Fed won out, and stocks soared. Investors got quite a bit of whiplash along the way.

Trade tensions

President Donald Trump's approach to trade policy, including tariffs and threats of escalation, was a main driver of investor and business sentiment. The trade war with China took center stage as the world's two largest economies imposed tariffs on each others' imports, and what appeared to be promising negotiations to end the impasse were followed by increasing tensions.

Stocks ebbed and flowed in line with the news. This brought on some of the biggest losses and rebounds of the year, as investors factored the economic costs of the trade war into their forecasts and got excited by hopes of a deal to end the uncertainty."

We've just had the best decade in human history. Seriously,http://spectator.co.uk/2019/12/weve-just-had-the-best-decade-in-human-history-seriously/?fbclid=IwAR1ozTZQbGK4e7dSUXcw0xpuAkOb4xut3WhCX7yBWr0N72NmnM5_LaCtMYo,"Let nobody tell you that the second decade of the 21st century has been a bad time. We are living through the greatest improvement in human living standards in history. Extreme poverty has fallen below 10 per cent of the world’s population for the first time. It was 60 per cent when I was born. Global inequality has been plunging as Africa and Asia experience faster economic growth than Europe and North America; child mortality has fallen to record low levels; famine virtually went extinct; malaria, polio and heart disease are all in decline.

Little of this made the news, because good news is no news. But I’ve been watching it all closely. Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist in 2010, I’ve been faced with ‘what about…’ questions: what about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump? How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that? The answer is: because bad things happen while the world still gets better. Yet get better it does, and it has done so over the course of this decade at a rate that has astonished even starry-eyed me.

Perhaps one of the least fashionable predictions I made nine years ago was that ‘the ecological footprint of human activity is probably shrinking’ and ‘we are getting more sustainable, not less, in the way we use the planet’. That is to say: our population and economy would grow, but we’d learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved. An MIT scientist, Andrew McAfee, recently documented this in a book called More from Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less stuff: less metal, less water, less land. Not just in proportion to productivity: less stuff overall.

This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us. But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: ‘Anyone who thinks that you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist’, ask him this: ‘But what if economic growth means using less stuff, not more?’ For example, a normal drink can today contains 13 grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In 1959, it contained 85 grams. Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.

As for Britain, our consumption of ‘stuff’ probably peaked around the turn of the century — an achievement that has gone almost entirely unnoticed. But the evidence is there. In 2011 Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing that the UK was now using not just relatively less ‘stuff’ every year, but absolutely less. Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain (domestic extraction of biomass, metals, minerals and fossil fuels, plus imports minus exports) fell by a third between 2000 and 2017, from 12.5 tonnes to 8.5 tonnes. That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.

If this doesn’t seem to make sense, then think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the 1970s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player, newspaper and pack of cards. LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices are not yet paperless, but they use much less paper.

Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected. For instance, experts in the 1970s forecast how much water the world would consume in the year 2000. In fact, the total usage that year was half as much as predicted. Not because there were fewer humans, but because human inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.

Until recently, most economists assumed that these improvements were almost always in vain, because of rebound effects: if you cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy-hungry and people leave them on for longer. This is known as the Jevons paradox, after the 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons, who first described it. But Andrew McAfee argues that the Jevons paradox doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.

Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching ‘peak farmland’ — despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land. In 2012, Jesse Ausubel of Rockefeller University and his colleagues argued that, thanks to modern technology, we use 65 per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with 50 years ago. By 2050, it’s estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.

Land-sparing is the reason that forests are expanding, especially in rich countries. In 2006 Ausubel worked out that no reasonably wealthy country had a falling stock of forest, in terms of both tree density and acreage. Large animals are returning in abundance in rich countries; populations of wolves, deer, beavers, lynx, seals, sea eagles and bald eagles are all increasing; and now even tiger numbers are slowly climbing.

Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy. John Constable of the Global Warming Policy Forum points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled in size since 1970, and our population is up by 20 per cent, total primary inland energy consumption has actually fallen by almost 10 per cent. Much of that decline has happened in recent years. This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues: although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, aeroplanes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the highest energy prices for industry in the world.

In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems. Innovation requires experiments (most of which fail). Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial — as shown by the industrial revolution. Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of. Fortunately, it is now possible that nuclear fusion will one day deliver energy in minimalist form, using very little fuel and land.

Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early 1970s, The Limits to Growth in America and Blueprint for Survival in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels. The Limits to Growth predicted that if growth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before 2000. School textbooks soon echoed these claims.

This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that a basket of five metals (chosen by Ehrlich) would cost less in 1990 than in 1980. The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutes if metals grew scarce. Simon won the bet easily, although Ehrlich wrote the cheque with reluctance, sniping that ‘the one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles’. To this day none of those metals has significantly risen in price or fallen in volume of reserves, let alone run out. (One of my treasured possessions is the Julian Simon award I won in 2012, made from the five metals.)

A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff. A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than an equivalent system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt. Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land, the eviction of more woodpeckers — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional. Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer off in a new direction. If we do, we risk retarding progress.

As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction: by the end of it, we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture in the world. There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer, and each of us will use fewer resources. The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction.

"An exciting new research which describes how Mitochondrial Replication has stayed similar in the simplest to most complex organisms, shedding light on its origin.",http://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-019-0714-x,"Evaluation of the Aurora kinase ortholog CmAUR

Although some previous studies have focused on CmAUR localization in C. merolae23,24, little is known about its role as an Aurora kinase, such as in mitotic progression through histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation in mitosis25. Thus, we considered that it was important to test the Aurora kinase function of CmAUR. First, we conducted immunostaining to determine the cellular localization of CmAUR. Previously, we reported a CmAUR antibody and confirmed its specificity24. The immunostaining showed that CmAUR localized to the mitotic spindle and mitochondrion (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1). To investigate its function in cell cycle progression, we transiently expressed a kinase-dead version of CmAUR (CmAURK208R) in C. merolae. This mutant of CmAUR was designed by reference to previous reports of kinase-dead human Aurora A26 and B27, and we confirmed that recombinant CmAURK208R protein had no autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 1b). Expression of CmAURK208R in C. merolae delayed M phase, and this was most likely caused by a dominant-negative effect, analogous to a previous study in human27 (Fig. 1c). These results suggested that CmAUR has an important role in M phase in C. merolae, like its orthologs in other eukaryotes. We also tested whether CmAUR has capability as a kinase of histone H3 Ser10. Similar to other species, C. merolae showed phosphorylation of histone H3 Ser10 during M phase, as reported previously28 (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2). Recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-CmAUR strongly phosphorylated H3 Ser10 in vitro (Fig. 1e). Although a weak histone H3 phospho Ser10 band was detected in the GST only-treated sample, the intensity was not different from the band in the non-GST-treated sample (Fig. 1e). Therefore, we consider that H3 Ser10 phosphorylation by GST-CmAUR depends on CmAUR. For further confirmation of whether CmAUR works as an Aurora kinase, we treated GST-CmAUR in vitro with hesperadin, an Aurora kinase inhibitor. Phosphorylation of H3 Ser10 by GST-CmAUR was inhibited by hesperadin (Fig. 1f). In summary, these results suggest that CmAUR functions as an Aurora kinase.

Relationship between mitochondrial division and CmAUR

To investigate the molecular processes regulated by CmAUR, we conducted immunostaining analyses of autophosphorylated CmAUR. Previous studies suggested that Aurora kinase activates itself through autophosphorylation29,30. Because the self-phosphorylation site of Aurora kinase is well conserved among Aurora kinase orthologs, a commercial human phospho-Aurora (phAUR) antibody was able to detect self-phosphorylated CmAUR (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). By using the phAUR antibody, we demonstrated that activated CmAUR partially localized to the mitochondrion (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4). Co-immunostaining using phAUR and an antibody against the mitochondrial division ring component Mda1 revealed that phAUR was localized to the mitochondrial division ring (Fig. 2b). To investigate whether the localization changed depending on cell cycle progression, we analyzed phAUR and Mda1 in both G2 and M phase. The intensity of the phAUR signals on the mitochondrial division ring increased as mitochondrial division progressed (Student’s t test, p < 0.01) but not Mda1 signals (Fig. 2b, c). Because Mda1 is a protein that accumulates on the mitochondrial division ring, this result suggests that the phAUR signals increased independently of the accumulation of other mitochondrial division-related proteins in M phase such as Mda1. After mitochondrial division, the phAUR signal was observed on structures other than the mitochondrion (Fig. 2a, white arrowheads). Considering the morphological features and a previous report on C. merolae mitosis31, we deduced that this structure was the mitotic spindle. However, localization on speckles, which are clearly different from the spindle, was also observed. This suggests that CmAUR does not co-localize exclusively with mitochondria, as already reported in human Aurora A25. We conclude that CmAUR activity is involved in both mitochondrial division and mitotic spindle formation.

To confirm the role of CmAUR in mitochondrial division during mitosis, we overexpressed both wild-type and kinase-dead type CmAUR. Then we measured the frequency of each phase of the transformants (interphase, pre-mitochondrial division phase, and post-mitochondrial division phase) in the mitochondrial replication process (Fig. 2d). The transformants overexpressing both CmAURK208R and wild-type CmAUR were arrested at the pre- and post-mitochondrial division phases (Fig. 2e, f; Supplementary Tables 1, 2). Because the proportion of wild-type and CmAURK208R overexpressing cells in each phase did not seem to be different, it is not clear whether the kinase activity of CmAUR had an impact on the mitochondrial division. However, these data indicate that CmAUR kinase activity and/or another CmAUR function can regulate both nuclear and mitochondrial division. Division of the mitochondrion occurs before nuclear division in C. merolae31. Thus, the inhibition of mitochondrial division was most likely not caused by nuclear division.

To predict the localization of substrates phosphorylated by CmAUR in vivo, we conducted co-staining for CmAUR and with ProQ diamond. ProQ diamond binds total phosphorylated proteins and we previously demonstrated that ProQ diamond staining is effective in C. merolae24. In co-stained M-phase C. merolae cells, CmAUR signals were partially co-localized with ProQ signals (Fig. 2g, h). Because CmAUR was localized to the mitochondrion (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1), this result implies that CmAUR phosphorylates substrates in mitochondria.

Identification of the substrates of CmAUR

Because localization analysis of phAUR suggested a relationship between mitochondrial division and CmAUR, we predicted that CmAUR is involved in mitochondrial division through phosphorylation of mitochondrial division ring components. To verify this presumption, we performed in vitro kinase assays using recombinant CmDnm1, Mda1, and TOP, which are known to be involved in mitochondrial division in C. merolae11,24,32. CmDnm1 is a highly conserved protein among eukaryotes and an orthologue of human Drp1 (DNM1L), which forms a ring around mitochondria and induces their division in eukaryotes such as mammalian, nematode, and yeast cells33,34,35. In these assays, CmAUR phosphorylated CmDnm1, Mda1, and TOP (Fig. 3a–c). These results suggested that CmAUR regulates mitochondrial division through phosphorylation of mitochondrial division ring components in C. merolae.

Determination of phosphorylation sites of CmDnm1 by CmAUR

On the basis of our findings that CmAUR is involved in mitochondrial division and in the phosphorylation of proteins related to mitochondrial division, we hypothesized that CmAUR regulates mitochondrial division via direct phosphorylation of mitochondrial division ring proteins. We predicted that phosphorylation of CmDnm1 by CmAUR would be important for mitochondrial division because CmDnm1, as a component of the mitochondrial division ring, has a crucial role in mitochondrial division in C. merolae4,11. To further analyze phosphoregulation of CmDnm1 by CmAUR, in vitro phosphorylation sites in CmDnm1 were identified by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. 5). Taking evolutionary conservation among eukaryotes into consideration, nine residues were determined as candidate sites for phosphorylation. Through in vitro kinase assays of point mutants of these nine residues, four phosphorylation sites (T139, S570, S726, S732) were confirmed to be phosphorylated by CmAUR (Fig. 4a). In addition, to confirm each single phosphorylation site, we quantified the western blot signal reduction of phosphorylation site variants. As a result, signal densities of T139A and S726A variants were reproducibly reduced compared with wild-type CmDnm1 signals (Fig. 4b).

Signals from different membranes were normalized against the luminosity of wild-type CmDnm1. The relative value of wild-type CmDnm1 was 1. n = 3 for T139A, n = 4 for S726A. The error bars indicate standard error of the mean. c Frequency of transformants expressing CmDnm1 variants. Alanine and phosphomimetic glutamic acid mutants of CmDnm1T139 and CmDnm1S726 were overexpressed in C. merolae cells. According to classification Fig. 2d, transfectants were counted. Transfectants with an aberrant number of plastids (three or more) were not counted. d Normal phenotype of dividing mitochondrion in cell overexpressing wild-type CmDnm1. e Phenotype of single mitochondrion without division in cell overexpressing CmDnm1S570E. f Phenotype of multiple chloroplasts in CmDnm1T139A overexpression mutant. g Frequency of cells with multiple chloroplasts among Dnm1-mutant transfectants. Total countable transfectants were counted. h In vitro kinase assay of human Aurora kinases with recombinant GST-human Drp1. Bars: 1 μm. Full size image

To reveal the function of these phosphorylation sites in mitochondrial division, we produced Dnm1 variants in which phosphorylation sites T139, S570, S726, and S732 were substituted to nonphosphorylatable alanine or phosphomimetic glutamic acid and overexpressed them in C. merolae. The effects of these variants were quantified by determining the frequency of each mitochondrial division phase in each transformant (Fig. 2d). The population in each mitochondrial division phase was not affected by overexpression of CmDnm1S570A/E, CmDnm1S726A, or CmDnm1S732A/E, but the number of cells in pre-mitochondrial division phase was increased by overexpression of CmDnm1T139A/E and CmDnm1S726E (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Table 4). This result suggests that the expression of CmDnm1T139A/E and CmDnm1S726E causes suppression of mitochondrial division. Previously, it was reported that mitochondrial division is stalled by overexpression of dominant-negative Drp1 mutants (phosphodeficient or mimetic substitution within the GTPase domain)33. We observed that overexpression of CmDnm1T139A/E and CmDnm1S726E caused mitochondrial division arrest. These results suggest that T139A/E and S726E function, respectively, in a dominant-negative mode. Interestingly, overexpression of CmDnm1 with T139 variations caused abnormal phenotypes such as mitochondrial distribution on one side of the cell (Fig. 4c–e; Supplementary Table 4) and multiple chloroplasts (Fig. 4f, g; Supplementary Table 5), as described previously31. Because aberrant phenotypes were not frequent among the transformants of CmDnm1S726E, we predict that phosphoregulation of T139 has a more important role in mitochondrial division than does phosphoregulation of S726.

To investigate whether the phosphorylation of T139 regulates the localization of CmDnm1, we constructed stably transformed lines that expressed superfolder GFP (sfGFP)-CmDnm1, sfGFP-CmDnm1T139A, and sfGFP-CmDnm1T139E under the control of a heat-inducible promoter16. The heat-inducible expression enables CmDnm1 variant localization to be observed without the effect of a transfection reagent containing polyethylene glycol. After heat induction, we immunostained cells using an Ef-Tu36 antibody as a mitochondrial marker and a GFP antibody. We found no differences in the intracellular localization of each CmDnm1 variant (Supplementary Fig. 6). This result indicates that phosphorylation of T139 may regulate CmDnm1 independently from the intracellular localization control.

Finally, we examined if recombinant human Aurora kinase could directly phosphorylate recombinant Drp1, which is a CmDnm1 orthologue found in human. Aurora A and Aurora B could phosphorylate Drp1 in vitro (Fig. 4h). This result suggests that the direct phosphoregulation of CmDnm1 orthologs by Aurora kinase is conserved between C. merolae and human."
We've just had the best decade in human history. Seriously,http://spectator.us/just-best-decade-human-history-seriously/,"Let nobody tell you that the second decade of the 21st century has been a bad time. We are living through the greatest improvement in human living standards in history. Extreme poverty has fallen below 10 percent of the world’s population for the first time. It was 60 percent when I was born. Global inequality has been plunging as Africa and Asia experience faster economic growth than Europe and North America; child mortality has fallen to record low levels; famine virtually went extinct; malaria, polio and heart disease are all in decline.

Little of this made the news, because good news is no news. But I’ve been watching it all closely. Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist in 2010, I’ve been faced with ‘what about…’ questions: what about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump? How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that? The answer is: because bad things happen while the world still gets better. Yet get better it does, and it has done so over the course of this decade at a rate that has astonished even starry-eyed me.

Perhaps one of the least fashionable predictions I made nine years ago was that ‘the ecological footprint of human activity is probably shrinking’ and ‘we are getting more sustainable, not less, in the way we use the planet’. That is to say: our population and economy would grow, but we’d learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved. An MIT scientist, Andrew McAfee, recently documented this in a book called More from Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less stuff: less metal, less water, less land. Not just in proportion to productivity: less stuff overall.

This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us. But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: ‘Anyone who thinks that you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist’, ask him this: ‘But what if economic growth means using less stuff, not more?’ For example, a normal drink can today contains 13 grams of aluminum, much of it recycled. In 1959, it contained 85 grams. Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.

As for Britain, our consumption of ‘stuff’ probably peaked around the turn of the century — an achievement that has gone almost entirely unnoticed. But the evidence is there. In 2011 Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing that the UK was now using not just relatively less ‘stuff’ every year, but absolutely less. Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain (domestic extraction of biomass, metals, minerals and fossil fuels, plus imports minus exports) fell by a third between 2000 and 2017, from 13.7 tons to 9.4 tons. That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.





If this doesn’t seem to make sense, then think about your own home. Cell phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the 1970s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player, newspaper and pack of cards. LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices are not yet paperless, but they use much less paper.

Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected. For instance, experts in the 1970s forecast how much water the world would consume in the year 2000. In fact, the total usage that year was half as much as predicted. Not because there were fewer humans, but because human inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.

Until recently, most economists assumed that these improvements were almost always in vain, because of rebound effects: if you cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy-hungry and people leave them on for longer. This is known as the Jevons paradox, after the 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons, who first described it. But Andrew McAfee argues that the Jevons paradox doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.

Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching ‘peak farmland’ — despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land. In 2012, Jesse Ausubel of Rockefeller University and his colleagues argued that, thanks to modern technology, we use 65 percent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with 50 years ago. By 2050, it’s estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.

Land-sparing is the reason that forests are expanding, especially in rich countries. In 2006 Ausubel worked out that no reasonably wealthy country had a falling stock of forest, in terms of both tree density and acreage. Large animals are returning in abundance in rich countries; populations of wolves, deer, beavers, lynx, seals, sea eagles and bald eagles are all increasing; and now even tiger numbers are slowly climbing.

Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy. John Constable of the Global Warming Policy Forum points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled in size since 1970, and our population is up by 20 percent, total primary inland energy consumption has actually fallen by almost 10 percent. Much of that decline has happened in recent years. This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues: although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, airplanes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminum and chemical industries abroad with some of the highest energy prices for industry in the world.

In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems. Innovation requires experiments (most of which fail). Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial — as shown by the industrial revolution. Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of. Fortunately, it is now possible that nuclear fusion will one day deliver energy in minimalist form, using very little fuel and land.

Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early 1970s, The Limits to Growth in America and Blueprint for Survival in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels. The Limits to Growth predicted that if growth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before 2000. School textbooks soon echoed these claims.

This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that a basket of five metals (chosen by Ehrlich) would cost less in 1990 than in 1980. The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutes if metals grew scarce. Simon won the bet easily, although Ehrlich wrote the check with reluctance, sniping that ‘the one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles’. To this day none of those metals has significantly risen in price or fallen in volume of reserves, let alone run out. (One of my treasured possessions is the Julian Simon award I won in 2012, made from the five metals.)

A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff. A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than an equivalent system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt. Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land, the eviction of more woodpeckers — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional. Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer off in a new direction. If we do, we risk retarding progress.

As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction: by the end of it, we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture in the world. There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer, and each of us will use fewer resources. The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction.

"The World's Oldest Fossil Forest Was Just Found in New York, And It's Magnificent",http://sciencealert.com/scientists-think-they-ve-found-the-world-s-oldest-fossilised-forest,"A slice of the world's oldest fossilised forest has been found cemented into the ground at an abandoned quarry in Cairo, New York.

Discovered by chance in 2009, these extremely rare webs of fossilised roots, some of which are nearly 11 metres (36 ft) wide, mark the spot where some of the first woody trees once stood.

""You are walking through the roots of ancient trees,"" paleobotanist Christopher Berry from Cardiff University in the United Kingdom told Science Magazine.

""Standing on the quarry surface we can reconstruct the living forest around us in our imagination.""

(Stein et al., Current Biology, 2019)

Many of these long woody roots are thought to belong to plants of the Archaeopteris genus, an ancestor of today's modern trees and one of the first to capture and store carbon dioxide from the air with its flat green leaves.

This sort of activity would have dramatically shifted our planet's climate, potentially adding more oxygen to the atmosphere and providing lush habitats for primitive insects and millipede-like creatures. It would be many more years before birds and other large animals made their home in the trees.

""By the end of the Devonian period [360 million years ago], the amount of carbon dioxide was coming down to what we know it is today,"" explained Berry to New Scientist.

The international team of researchers has so far mapped over 3,000 square metres of this fossilised forest (over 32,000 square feet), which includes two other types of ancient tree; one of them belongs to a fossil plant group known as cladoxylopsids, and the other is yet to be identified.

Altogether, the forest would have been quite open and sparse, with clumps of cladoxylopsids spotted throughout. This particular leafless tree would have stretched 10 metres high (some 32 ft) with short celery-like branches and shallow roots.

Archaeopteris, on the other hand, resembled more of a pine tree, but instead of bearing needles it would have grown hairy, fern-like fronds. Marked by long woody roots, this particular tree would have dramatically changed the way plants and soils gathered water.

All three fossilised remains, the authors say, would have reproduced via spores and not seeds.

Earth scientist Howard Falcon-Lang from Royal Holloway, London, who was not involved in the study, told BBC News he has no doubt these are the earliest fossilised trees found on our planet so far, but that doesn't mean they won't someday be surpassed by something older.

""It may well be that in the future, something even older pops up - palaeontology is full of surprises,"" said Falcon-Lang.

""But for the time being, this is incredibly exciting.""

The presence of fish fossils in the sandstone quarry suggest this ancient fossilised forest was ultimately wiped out by a flood. But not before it changed our planet for the better.

The study was published in Current Biology."

Toronto's winter 'Shelter Bus' for the homeless is as sensible as it is kind,http://thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2019/12/03/torontos-winter-shelter-bus-for-the-homeless-is-as-sensible-as-it-is-kind.html?fbclid=IwAR27xaAsdLaBs8SrNCaDWXCsgoWsOXS_CilVdgw5WBAiV5_iIO3i-tL1-8Q,"Park ‘n’ sleep. Perchance to dream. Definitely to warm up and rest a while.

A city that often throws its down-and-out under the bus — despite the mega-millions also thrown at the chronic urban blight of homelessness — is just a little bit kinder today, a tiny bit more big-hearted.

Although the city — as in The City — has nothing to do with this particular gesture of benevolence towards the destitute.

What was once a transit bus, and most recently a coach for travelling hockey players in Quebec City, took to Toronto’s downtown streets on Tuesday evening.

The “Shelter Bus” it’s called — retrofitted with 20 sleeping spaces, a lounge area, kitchenette, washroom and bumper-to-bumper compassion.

From 8 p.m. to at least 8 a.m., throughout the winter, the full-size vehicle will pick up homeless and transients, the hungry and the shivering, in an undertaking so straight-up sensible one wonders why nobody ever thought about it before.

“We recognize that homelessness in particular is a critical issue here in Toronto during the winter months,” says Zubair Afzal, president of Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, Canada’s largest Muslim youth organization, with chapters across the country and headquartered in Toronto. “The weather can be extremely cold, especially at night.

“The shelter bus will be travelling through downtown Toronto every night for the next three months, to pick up homeless individuals who do not have any shelter. And provide them with hot meals as well.”

There are, as per the most recent estimates, more than 9,200 people in this city of plenty who are homeless on any given night. Reasons for their indigent state cut across a broad spectrum — loss of employment, family breakup, family violence, mental illness, poor physical health, substance abuse, sexual abuse, to cite only a few of the underlying causes.

Most people, overwhelmingly, do not choose to be homeless, though there is a hardcore subset that prefers sleeping rough to the hardships associated with accessing a vast shelter system. A system with a nightly occupancy rate, in any event, of 98 per cent, with more than 100,000 on the subsidized housing waiting list. Seniors and youth comprise about 10 per cent of the homeless population.

In a city that can be cold-shouldered in so many ways.

“One of the fundamental teachings of Islam exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is to give charity and serve humanity, irrespective of race, religion and ethnicity,” says Afzal. “In line with these teachings, the Ahmadiyya Youth Association is taking on this bus shelter initiative. We hope and pray this initiative can make a difference in the lives of many Torontonians by providing those less fortunate with a comfortable place to sleep during the cold nights.”

First of its kind, to anybody’s knowledge, the genius idea of an association member employed as a city planning engineer. All those decommissioned buses taken out of service, why not give them a second life?

“We acquired this bus because it was on its way to the junkyard to be retired permanently and taken apart for scrap,” explains Safwan Choudhry, one of the organizers. “Bringing together some brain power and some ingenuity, we were able to bring it back to life.”

At the bargain basement price of $10,000, from heap of junk to sleek retrofitted moving shelter, with funding from partner Humanity First but completely borne on the shoulders of volunteers.

So, the bus will be scooping up indigents who might want to park their weary bones somewhere for a few hours, accept a warm meal — food also prepared by volunteers but organizers have an arrangement with vendors should they run out — or maybe just a bottle of clean water and some hygienic products. There’s no nurse attached to the bus but that’s an idea they’re looking at, maybe to join the volunteer crew once a week. Only the bus driver is paid.

“Sadly, in a city like Toronto you don’t have to go very far or try very hard to find those less fortunate,” sighs Choudhry.

The bus, which is parked in Vaughan when not on its downtown meanderings, has already been taken out for some pilot road-testing in targeted neighbourhoods such as Moss Park. Police have given assurances there won’t be a parking problem wherever it stops in the inner-city core.

“Our shelter crisis is nothing new,” notes Afzal. “However, our ambitions go beyond Toronto. These challenges exist in Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa … Our projects don’t necessarily coincide based on what may be a short- or long-term issue, but something that’s systematic.

“Why not use the leverage of our youth and engage them in something good?”

The association informed the city about their intentions some time back. Got a high-five and good-luck but, well, you’re on your own.

The city provides more than 7,000 and transitional beds in 65 locations and through motel programs used mostly by families. Straining at the seams, the Shelter, Support and Housing Administration has a budget for 2019 of $235 million but expenditures, as of June, were already at $246 million, expected to be over-budget by $42.5 million by year’s end.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

And still the homeless sleep over subway grates. Every year somebody will freeze to death.

The shelter bus is just a drop in the homeless bucket. But it’s tangible, directly serving the neediest among us. The wheels of this bus go ‘round and ‘round.

Salaam alaikum."
"'It's a milestone, I'm thrilled': B.C. survivor of conversion therapy applauds federal commitment to ban it",http://cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/peter-gajdics-conversion-therapy-ban-reaction-1.5397010,"A B.C. man who says he is still recovering from an attempt to change his sexual orientation through a practice known as conversion therapy is applauding a federal commitment to ban it in Canada.

This week, a mandate letter sent from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Minister of Justice and Attorney General David Lametti asked that the Criminal Code be amended ""to ban the practice of conversion therapy and take other steps required with the provinces and territories to end conversion therapy in Canada.""

Conversion therapy is a practice that aims to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, aiming to ""convert"" them from gay, lesbian or bisexual to heterosexual, or from transgender to cisgender, which means identifying with the sex assigned to them at birth.

Peter Gajdics, author of the book The Inheritance of Shame, spent six years in conversion therapy with a licensed psychiatrist in Victoria.

""It's a milestone, I'm thrilled, I think it will be a journey to actually have it passed,"" he said about the federal move to end its practice in Canada.

He described his years in conversion therapy as painful.

""I just felt completely distorted and cut up inside by the drugs, by the primal scream, by the shame, by this effort to change myself into something that I wasn't,"" he said. ""At one point the medications were at a fatal level, and I overdosed, and by all accounts I should have died.""

He says a psychiatrist prescribed several antidepressants and a sedative in hopes that it would help Gajdic become heterosexual.

""I fell for these tactics because I wanted to believe what my family wanted me to be, that I could heal somehow,"" he said.

WATCH Peter Gajdics talk to the CBC's Jon Hernandez about his experience with conversion therapy:

'Such long term-pain' 0:36 B.C. Conversion therapy survivor Peter Gajdics talks about his troubling experience. 0:36

Gajdics says he grew up ashamed of his sexuality because his parents didn't approve of it, and was cut off from his friends and family.

No proof it works

Conversion therapy employs various approaches, including talk therapy, medication and aversion therapy, which attempts to condition a person's behaviour by causing them discomfort through things like electric shocks when they're exposed to specific stimuli.

It is believed conversion therapy has existed for more than a century, with German psychiatrist Albert von Schrenck-Notzing being one of the first to use the practice on patients.

Conversion therapy has been widely condemned by health experts as having no scientific proof that it works. It is also described as being unethical and unprofessional.

Elizabeth Saewyc, a UBC nursing professor, says people who have gone through the therapy have a greater chance of developing depression and anxiety.

""It has created challenges around their ability to actually have caring relationships with others,"" she said.

In 2018, the City of Vancouver passed a bylaw that bans any business from providing conversion therapy.

Gajdics said he will watch how the federal government develops its amendments to the Criminal Code to ban conversion therapy. He's worried that loopholes will remain for the practice to carry on underground.

""Delineating exactly what conversion therapy is or maybe isn't in the Criminal Code will be vital,"" he said. ""Practitioners, organizations, sidestep the issue. Immediately they say we don't practise that."""
'Ending up here is a love story.' American writer John Irving becomes a Canadian citizen,http://thestar.com/entertainment/books/2019/12/13/american-writer-john-irving-becomes-a-canadian-citizen.html,"On a drizzly Tuesday afternoon in a grey government office in Scarborough, the American writer John Irving became a Canadian citizen.

He held his red and white Maple Leaf flag along with 83 other people from 35 countries who also swore allegiance to the Queen and this country. On the other side of the room sat his wife, Janet Turnbull, daughter Eva and assistant Khalida.

After the ceremony, they came over to give hugs; his eyes welled up with a few tears that didn’t fall. You might say they were misty. The smiles on all their faces were huge.

“I was moved because Janet was there and Eva was there, and my being here is because of her,” Irving, 77, says in an interview the next day in his capacious personal office in downtown Toronto. “At my age, ending up here is a love story.”

His walls speak to the importance of family, covered with photos of his wife, daughter, sons, parents — family history and his own mementoes; himself on the cover of Time magazine, among them. This, he says “is not a political story.”

Neither is it a straightforward story, one with a few quick questions about what it means to be a good citizen and how he’ll take up that mantle here. As in his art, Irving’s answers meander; he talks about politics and the U.S., and even about going to school in Austria. All the moments in his life that have led to this one. He begins an anecdote, then circles back and picks up the thread again, a technique that propels the main narrative of his life forward.

Or gives him time to think about what he’s really going to say.

So let’s start with the love. Janet Turnbull. He met her here, about 30 years ago, in the Brigantine Room at Harbourfront where he was appearing as an author. She was the editor at Seal Books and Doubleday Canada, which was the publisher of the paperback edition of “The Cider House Rules.” “We were kind of smitten pretty instantly,” he says with a smile.

She lived here; her work and life were here. But he lived in the U.S. and had custody of his two sons, at the time 16 and 20.

“I couldn’t leave them or expect them to uproot their lives and come to Canada,” Irving says. “I felt that being the parent with custody was a responsibility and that the disruption of my divorce from their mother was as much disruption as a couple of young boys should have.”

He tells how he and Janet married in 1987; she moved to Vermont, changed her business (ultimately becoming a literary agent with him her only client), became an American citizen and even started a school.

“It was a big change to her life, not just being married but being married to a guy with a 16-year-old and a 20-year-old,” Irving says. He was the coach of the 16-year-old’s wrestling team. “Janet, who had always been a city girl, was on the team bus every weekend, going god knows where with a bunch of unruly teenage wrestlers. This was not the life that she had imagined for herself.”

And so, life unfolded, kids grew up, books were published. They often came back to Toronto — it was like a second home anyway. Janet had never given up her place, they cottaged here in the summer. But when it came to the point where the kids weren’t coming home as much and the house in Vermont was too isolated, they equivocated about where to move.

“I asked Janet a simple question: If I died right now, where would she go?” he says. The answer: Toronto.

And so here they are. This is not a political story. As a writer, Irving says, he can write anywhere. But, sometimes, it’s hard to figure out where John Irving the writer ends and John Irving the individual begins. He is still, in many ways, a political writer. And a person deeply interested in politics.

“At least half of my novels are political,” he says. “By which I mean there is a point of view taken that is on one side of an issue, clearly.”

“A Prayer for Owen Meany” took on the Vietnam war; “The World According to Garp” took on women’s rights; he’s written about AIDS, LGBTQ rights. And, he says, after this latest, his 15th, more than half of his books will have been political.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

He is working on a new book, so far “1,000 pages and 40 chapters long” that will be rewritten down to size, as he usually does. He won’t say outright that the book features Canada, “I don’t want to give too much away”; he will say it begins in the U.S. and comes back to Canada.

It’s a state of existence that’s been familiar both in his fiction and in his personal life, this moving back and forth between the two countries. It allows him to observe, he says. Like any writer “my job is to observe and learn.”

He reserves the right to continue to be outspoken about the United States. He reserves the right to criticize. “I very much intend to keep my American citizenship. Because I don’t want anyone in my birth country to be able to say, ‘Well, he’s moved to Canada. He’s not one of us.’ Oh, yes, I am.”

Whether he can feel comfortable enough to criticize Canada in the same way remains to be seen. “I want to feel that I have a right to participate in the life here and that certainly includes making political decisions and voting. And being an observer. I don’t know that at my age I’ll ever live here long enough to feel comfortable to be a critic of Canada politically.”

Irving talks about the 2016 U.S. election, saying that he held responsible the “six and a half million Democrats … who voted for Obama in 2012 and did not show up for Mrs. Clinton in 2016” for helping Trump into office.

Trump, he said “needed the help of indifferent or disgruntled or, for whatever reason, absent Democrats.”

He is vocal, very vocal, about his dislike of Trump (“his vulgarity, his narcissism … his xenophobia”). From what he’s observed, does Irving think a similar type of person could be elected here?

“I’m still learning about your …”

“Our,” I venture.

“I say respectfully as a new citizen ‘your’ because I feel I’m still a student of the game,” he says. “I talk to Janet all the time about your Liberal Party and your NDP Party — what I sometimes call your Liberal Party A and your Liberal Party B. Sometimes I have a hard time not seeing how the existence of those two parties make things easier for the Conservatives.”

“You are all looking far too serious,” the judge says as he sits down in the grey Scarborough room, ready to welcome 84 new citizens.

While it was a joyous occasion to be sure, it was also one not to be taken lightly. Irving says he is lucky enough to be able to choose to come here. Not everyone can.

Because he is 77, he didn’t have to take the history test — “Not fair!” he says a young boy who had been sitting next to him responded. Irving recognized a few people that he’d run into in various bureaucratic offices over the four years it took him to move from permanent resident to citizen. Just a meeting of eyes, a recognition.

He sang “O Canada” — “it’s a beautiful song and I was very moved to hear it” — and pledged allegiance to the Queen. “I had to, at least inwardly, ask my grandmother’s forgiveness as an old New Englander. I grew up hearing all about Paul Revere’s ride and the Boston Tea Party, and seeing my ancestors as revolutionaries.

“Certainly my grandmother would not have approved.”"

State Department pleased with EU's 5G plan,http://c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/it-networks/5g/2019/12/05/state-department-pleased-with-eus-5g-plan/,"The U.S. State Department, which is hoping to slow the spread of 5G networks using hardware from China, said it supports a plan from the European Union Council that highlighted the risks to 5G networks if they are built from certain companies, according to a Dec. 4 statement.

“We look forward to the release of the EU’s 5G risk mitigation toolbox later this month,"" the State Department said in a release. ""We hope its recommendations will include strong measures to address the risks identified in today’s statement and in the EU’s Risk Assessment published in October 2019. The United States urges all countries, including our partners and allies, to adopt national security policies that would prevent untrusted vendors from accessing any part of their future 5G networks.”

The State Department also suggested European partners and allies “ensure only trusted vendors participate in any part of their future 5G networks.” Moreover, the State Department noted “[t]he stakes are too high” to allow important networks to be run by vendors subject to authoritarian regimes. The statement specifically called out Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, saying they must comply with directives from the central government.

“Allowing these vendors anywhere in a country’s 5G networks would present critical risks to the privacy, human rights, and security of its citizens,” the statement read.

Beyond the European Union, NATO also recently affirmed the importance networks and telecommunications technologies, including 5G, will play in the national security debate in the future.

“NATO and Allies, within their respective authority, are committed to ensuring the security of our communications, including 5G, recognising the need to rely on secure and resilient systems,” a communique from London on Dec. 4 read."
"Just 10 minutes of mindfulness meditation can improve verbal learning and memory processes, suggests a new study. The fact that mindfulness can help with this after only 10 minutes is an important finding that people can use in their everyday lives.",http://psypost.org/2019/12/just-10-minutes-of-mindfulness-meditation-can-improve-verbal-learning-and-memory-processes-study-finds-54979,"New scientific research published in the journal Memory & Cognition provides evidence that a brief mindfulness meditation exercise can enhance verbal learning.

“A number of studies have shown that mindfulness can improve cognitive abilities, including certain verbal abilities. However, little research has examined how mindfulness can affect verbal learning and memory. Furthermore, no research has examined the mechanism by which mindfulness may improve learning and memory,” said study author Adam Lueke, an assistant teaching professor at Ball State University.

“We reasoned that, since mindfulness often works to quiet down thoughts which may occupy phonological loop resources, then it should be able to improve the learning of new verbal information, likely by allowing information to be better absorbed through the encoding process of memory.”

For their study, the researchers randomly assigned 142 undergraduate university students to one of two groups. One group listened to a 10-minute mindfulness meditation audio tape while the other group listened to a 10-minute audio tape that described an English countryside.

The participants completed four neuropsychological tests: the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, the Controlled Oral Word Association Test, the Trail Making Test, and the Color-Word Interference Test.

The researchers found that the mindfulness exercise increased verbal learning and memory encoding capabilities despite not improving general attention abilities or general verbal fluency. In other words, participants who listened to the 10-minute mindfulness exercise tended to be better at recalling newly learned words — but they were not any better at retrieving verbal material stored in long-term memory.

“The average reader can take away the fact that mindfulness seems likely to improve their ability to learn new verbal information and then be able to remember it later. Most of the information we rely on for school, work, and social situations is verbal in nature,” Lueke told PsyPost.

“Mindfulness can potentially make studying more efficient, can help you retain and utilize important information in your work, or even help remember something as simple as a person’s name or a story they shared with you. In essence, the ability of mindfulness to improve learning and memory can help improve people’s lives in myriad ways.”

The study — like all research — includes some caveats.

“We found that a brief mindfulness meditation of 10 minutes can have these benefits soon after the meditation for novices. We do not know how long this effect lasts. It could be that this effect wears off rather quickly, thus not allowing improved verbal learning and memory throughout the day. It is important to see how long this effect lasts within novices,” Lueke explained.

“Likewise, it is important to see if long-term meditators receive this benefit as well, perhaps throughout their day without needing to have just meditated. Additionally, we still do not know how mindfulness may affect visual learning and memory. It is possible that mindfulness is particularly good for verbal but not visual information.”

“We are currently conducting research to determine if this is the case, or if mindfulness also helps improve visual information. Also, we do not know how mindfulness may help people with memory impairments — it is possible that mindfulness may be unable to help these people due to the nature of their ailment,” Lueke said.

Despite the limitations, the findings are mostly in line with previous research. For instance, a 2013 study found that college students who were randomly assigned to attend a mindfulness class scored higher on a working memory test and the verbal reasoning section of the GRE compared to students who attended a nutrition class.

“The ability to learn new information and remember it for later use is a vital process that allows us to interact efficiently with our world and other people. Enhancing this ability can help us gain better mastery over our lives and our environment by giving us more information at our disposal to make better, more informed decisions, and to be better able to relate to other people,” Lueke said.

“The fact that mindfulness can help with this after only 10 minutes is an important finding that people can use in their everyday lives when they know they will need to rely on these abilities. Big test coming up? Got a presentation for work? Know you’ll be meeting new people and want to remember things about them in order to make a connection? Then perhaps spending a little time to meditate beforehand can help you accomplish your goals.”

The study, “Mindfulness improves verbal learning and memory through enhanced encoding“, was authored by Adam Lueke and Niloufar Lueke."
"Climate change: From the beginning, models have been remarkably accurate",http://vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/12/4/20991315/climate-change-prediction-models-accurate,"There are dozens of disciplines and subdisciplines within the broad ambit of climate science, studying everything from ancient geology to the spread of disease. But one discipline in particular is exposed to intense public scrutiny, the subject of long-running political and legal disputes: modeling.

As interesting as the details of climate science may be, what society most needs from it is an answer to a simple question: What the hell is going to happen? What are we in for? That’s the question models seek to answer.

It turns out that attempting to understand, model, and predict the entire global biophysical/atmospheric system is complicated. It’s especially tricky because there’s no way to run tests. There’s no second Earth to use as an experimental control group. The best scientists can do is use their knowledge of climate history and climate physics to build models of Earth systems and then test the models against future emission scenarios.

The IPCC AR5 assessed 1200 scenarios, 120 consistent with 2C, nearly all of which require negative emissions #TCCS https://t.co/1R1QpFpGaJ pic.twitter.com/Ko7tVMb7jx — Glen Peters (@Peters_Glen) June 13, 2017

This reliance on models has always been a bête noire for climate change deniers, who have questioned their accuracy as a way of casting doubt on their dire projections. For years, it has been a running battle between scientists and their critics, with the former rallying to defend one dataset and model after another. (The invaluable site Skeptical Science has a page devoted to attacks on modeling, with links to further reading.)

Now, for the first time, a group of scientists — Zeke Hausfather of UC Berkeley, Henri Drake and Tristan Abbott of MIT, and Gavin Schmidt of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies — has done a systematic review of climate models, dating back to the late 1970s. Published in Geophysical Research Letters, it tests model performance against a simple metric: how well they predicted global mean surface temperature (GMST) through 2017, when the latest observational data is available.

Long story short: “We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication.”

This is contrary to deniers, who claim that models overestimate warming, and contrary to the bizarre op-ed the New York Times ran in November, which claimed that scientists underestimate warming. As it happens, models have roughly hit the mark all along. It’s just, nobody listened.

The good news, as the authors say, is that this result “increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming.” As uncertain as we may be about our future emissions (more on that later), we have a pretty good handle on how the planet is going to respond to them.

The bad news is that the projections from those models are unrelentingly grim, so accuracy isn’t very reassuring.

Let’s take a quick look at how the review worked.

Five decades of climate models, more or less on point

The researchers did a comprehensive literature review for pre-1990 models; for post-1990 models, they followed the literature reviews of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They ended up choosing 17 models to closely analyze, dating from 1970 through 2007 — models old enough to be testable against decades of observational data.

To be clear, almost all the models chosen are no longer in use, having been superseded by more sophisticated models since. Some of the earlier ones, especially those from the 1970s and early ’80s, are fairly crude energy-in, energy-out models, with a single variable for forcing (CO2) and a crude measure of climate sensitivity (the amount temperature rises per additional ton of CO2). It wasn’t until the late ’80s that James Hansen and other scientists developed multivariable general-circulation models.

It turns out that even those crude early models were fairly accurate, which is remarkable given the sophistication of the science and the available computing power. None of the models the authors analyzed got it badly wrong.

There is one important nuance to keep in mind here, which helps illuminate the ways that climate models are evolving and improving over time.

Predicting physics vs. predicting humans

There are two basic factors that contribute to the accuracy of a model’s projections. The first is physics — how various biophysical systems like the ocean and atmosphere respond to external radiative “forcings” like carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. That’s the stuff we expect climate scientists to get right.

But they also depend on the level of forcings, i.e., how many tons of GHGs are actually pumped into the atmosphere. That’s not a matter of physics, it’s more about demographics, economics, history, and sociology. It’s about how human societies and technologies develop, which depends on endless variables that climate scientists can’t possibly be expected to predict (not like anyone else can either).

Scientists generally project a range of forcings, with high, low, and medium scenarios, but they can still be off in one direction or another — and it’s not fair to blame the models when those projections of forcings turn out to be mistaken. It’s the physics for which we should be holding models accountable.

With that in mind, the authors tested the models against two different metrics. One is “temperature vs. time,” which is simply, how closely did the model predict observed changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST) over time?

The second is “temperature vs. change in radiative forcing” (or “implied TCR”), which asks, how accurately did the model predict the rate of change per ton of GHGs? This is arguably a fairer assessment of a model, since it measures it purely on the accuracy of its physics, not on the accuracy of its predictions about pollution.

Here are both metrics, plotted against observed GMST:

On the first metric, temperature vs. time, 10 of the 17 models were consistent with observed GMST. Three predicted temperatures too low, four too high.

On the second (and better) metric, implied TCR, 14 of 17 models were consistent with the observed relationship between forcings and temperature change. Two had an implied TCR that was too high, one too low. That’s extremely accurate overall.

Models are dialing in their physics

The authors assigned “skill scores” to models based on their accuracy, where 1 is perfect prediction and zero is no better than chance. On both metrics, temperature vs. time and implied TCR, the “average of the median skill scores across all the model projections evaluated” was 0.69.

But this obscures something important.

Early models performed quite well along the first metric; they predicted actual temperature change fairly accurately. But it turns out there was a bit of luck involved.

They got some physics wrong, in that they didn’t accurately estimate how much CO2 the ocean would absorb, so they overestimated how much surface temperatures would rise. Their implied TCR was too high. On the flip side, they badly underestimated the change in radiative forcings, mainly because most of them only included CO2, not other GHGs.

“These early models end up getting their temperature vs. time projections mostly right because the too-high transient climate response is counteracted by too-low future forcings,” Hausfather told me. So the overall median of scores for temperature vs. time projections was good, but maybe slightly by accident.

What this obscures is that implied TCR performance is generally getting better over time. Models are getting better at estimating the amount of climate change that will result from a given ton of GHGs. They’re getting their physics dialed in.

It will always be difficult to predict future radiative forcings, because they are dominated by anthropogenic emissions, anthropogenic emissions depend on human behavior, and human behavior is inscrutable. We don’t know how human societies are ultimately going to respond to climate change, whether they will manage to change course or continue blundering ahead into catastrophe.

All we can ask of climate models is that they accurately tell us what Earth’s biophysical systems will do in response to our behavior. And every indication suggests that models are doing just that. For five decades now, they have warned us that we are marching toward ruin, and we have, for the most part, ignored them. We cannot claim that we did not know what we were doing. We knew."
No kids came to this 11-year-old's birthday party.

His call for birthday wishes was met with a flood of tweets from hockey players, celebrities, and politicians, including ""Star Wars"" star Mark Hamill, actor Ben Stiller and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Then the Maple Leafs took notice. The team flew the birthday boy and his family from their home in Newfoundland to Toronto for the Leafs' game Saturday against the Philadelphia Flyers.

Kade was able to watch the morning skate and meet the team in their locker room. A video posted by the team shows him shaking hands with players Jason Spezza, Morgan Rielly and others.

Giant tortoises show surprising cognitive powers and master lessons much faster when trained in groups,http://nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03655-5,"They might not be fast on their feet, but these massive reptiles have long memories.

Giant tortoises can learn and remember tasks, and master lessons much faster when trained in groups.

Tamar Gutnick and Michael Kuba at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, and Anton Weissenbacher at Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna trained Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoides nigra) and Aldabra tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) to bite a ball of a particular colour — blue, green or yellow.

When tested three months later, the tortoises recalled the task. The authors tested three of the tortoises again after nine years and found that all three responded to toys of the correct colour. The researchers also found that both species of tortoise could be conditioned with fewer training sessions if they were taught in groups than if learning occurred in isolation, hinting that tortoises learn from watching their peers.

Giant tortoises have generally been considered solitary. However, they often sleep and graze together, and the authors’ results bolster the view that the creatures that have been called ‘living rocks’ might be more social than scientists thought."

Six years ago, Cyril Aggett came home to an empty house after the death of his wife Shirley.

The now 86-year-old said he was immediately hit with loneliness when he shut his front door after her funeral.

For around 15 years, Cyril, who lives outside the gates of Coombe Dean Secondary School, had previously been attending the canteen during lunch with his wife, enjoying a warm home-cooked dinner amongst the schoolchildren.

For a month after Shirley's death he could not bring himself to leave the house, but after a call from the school to check he was OK, he returned for lunch.

Now, the granddad has been mingling with staff and pupils during lunch-time, four-times a week for the last 20 years.

Cyril has shared his experiences with loneliness as part of Plymouth Live's Be A Friend campaign.

""When I first came here I was down in the dumps,"" Cyril said.

""I get a cup of tea, my lunch and good service. Everybody talks to me, the office staff is brilliant and even when my wife was ill, they took dinners up to her.

""My wife was there one minute and then I couldn't talk to her because she was under sedation all the time.""

Cyril said that in the past year, he had a spell of not wanting to get out of bed, but visiting the school has helped get his love for life back.

(Image: Penny Cross / Plymouth Live) (Image: Penny Cross / Plymouth Live)

He added: ""A couple of months ago, I wasn't really getting up until about 2pm in the afternoon, it was lovely weather and I couldn't be bothered.

""I think Shirley must have said 'pull your socks up you know'.

""Coming down here has brought me out of my shell again.""

The Coombe Dean lunch ladies will make Cyril extra batches of sausage rolls, pasties and apple crumble for during the school holidays, so he can freeze them.

""I don't think they should go on holiday actually"" he joked.

Cyril, a retired bespoke shoe maker, said: ""It can be very lonely [living alone]. Once you go inside that door.

""I come down here and see the children, a lot of them talk to me, there's one young man that comes up and makes sure he talks to me.

""I love the company and the noise. Once I go indoors and I close those doors down, there's nothing.

""It's mayhem really, it's good. I'd be lost if I didn't come down here.""

(Image: Penny Cross / Plymouth Live)

Cyril said he tries to combat loneliness through music.

He said: ""Luckily I've got a lot of music and I've just bought myself a new music centre, so I can play the records from the 20s up to the 70s.

""If I get fed up, I just put the music on and just sort of enjoy it. It's the music that I like, not the modern stuff.""

"The ability to live in the moment and accept your emotions, when combined with expressing your feelings through words and touch, can serve to get you through stressful times that can test the quality of your relationship, finds a new study (n=281) exploring mindfulness and relationship quality.",http://psychologytoday.com/au/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201911/personality-trait-may-improve-your-relationships,"When you’re feeling stressed, there’s no doubt that your relationship can suffer. Being distracted and irritable, pressured for time, and unable to devote mental bandwidth to your partner can erode your ability to enjoy your partner’s company and be a responsive and loving contributor to the relationship. Think about the last time you felt so overwrought by having to squeeze too much into too little time that you became angry at the very slightest request your partner made for your . Conversely, think about the occasions when you felt you could take a breather from life’s daily cares and just sit and enjoy a meal together with your partner. It felt good to be able to set everything else aside and focus on what really matters.

The quality of , or the ability to enjoy the present moment, is one that the field of recognizes as key to personal . In a mindful state, you don’t even think about whether you’re “happy,” but instead focus your attention on sensory features of your experiences. By only allowing yourself to live in the moment, you can better deal with stress by not being overcome by worry about the future or regret about the past.

Until relatively recently, mindfulness was studied in the context of the individual’s own well-being as a stress-reducing psychological mechanism. Researchers now are coming to recognize that some people are better at being mindful, and that those who are have not only less stress but better relationships. According to the theory behind a new study by Auburn University’s Julianne McGill and Francesca Adler-Baeder (2019), it may very well be this ability to focus on the present moment that leads you to set stress aside and be more loving with your partner. Indeed, the authors make the observation that such “positive relationship behaviors are associated with higher relationship quality and in fact, may be one of the most potent predictors of relationship functioning determined by individual studies and meta-analytic procedures” (p. 1).

The theory behind McGill and Adler-Baeder's study is family stress theory (FST), which proposes that relationship quality depends on the way that partners perceive and manage the “subjective sense of distress” that can arise from multiple sources, both chronic and acute. You may feel stressed because you and your partner are chronically pinched for money, living from paycheck to paycheck. Stress may take a more acute form if one of you has an accident or you lose the job that provides that paycheck. In either case, being able to cope with the situation should serve to protect your relationship because that distress will not invade the way you and your partner interact with each other. The source of the stress may linger, but through adaptive coping, you’ll perceive it as less of a threat and more of a challenge. In the widely-accepted cognitive model of coping, it’s the perception that a situation is a threat that creates stress, not the situation itself. You may not be able to modify the situation, but you can modify your perception of it. Mindfulness, according to McGill and Adler, should provide you with the tools to flip that mental switch.

To test FST’s predictions that both mindfulness and stress reduction should improve relationship quality, the authors investigated previously-collected data from 281 men and women in heterosexual relationships recruited from the community. The participants averaged 36 years old (most were between 24 and 48), and all were either married or in a committed relationship. This was a relatively diverse sample, with approximately an equal number of males and females; 63% were white and the remainder were black, Asian American, or biracial. As the sample had originally been recruited for a relationship intervention study, a high proportion (67%) reported being in distress, and many (43%) were considering or separation.

The key measures used in the survey questionnaires administered to participants included mindfulness, the use of positive relationship behaviors, perception of stress, and relationship quality. The mindfulness questionnaire asked participants to rate themselves on such items as: “It seems I am ‘running on automatic,’ without much awareness of what I’m doing;” other items from the mindfulness scale include “I find it difficult to stay focused on what’s happening in the present,” and “I could be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until some time later.” Positive relationship behaviors included: “On average, how often in the past month did you say ‘I love you’ to your spouse/significant other?” Positive behaviors also included expressions of physical affection, such as touching. Participants rated their overall levels of stress on a 1 to 7 scale, and they rated their relationship quality similarly on a 7-point scale with items such as “We have a good /relationship.”

In the final model testing FST's predictions that mindfulness would reduce stress which, in turn, would improve relationship quality, McGill and Adler found that, contrary to prediction, mindfulness became its own unique predictor of how participants felt about their relationship. Indeed, the trait of mindfulness was more strongly related to relationship outcomes than the perception of stress. Unrelated to either mindfulness or the perception of stress, the use of positive relationship behaviors proved to be the strongest predictor of perceived relationship quality. These findings supported what the authors call an “additive” model of relationship quality in which the personal resource of mindfulness plus low stress plus high positive behaviors combine to influence how happy couples are in their relationship.

Because the authors defined mindfulness as a “trait,” you may think that it’s not an ability you can gain. However, there are studies showing mindfulness training cited by the authors that can help people become more mindful in general, as well as more mindful in the context of their . Some of these interventions encourage individuals to practice ""loving-kindness"" in which they are trained to become more accepting of their partners, foibles and all. If you can notice non-judgmentally what your partner does, you may be less likely to engage in behaviors that detract from relationship quality such as constantly being critical or seeking to change your partner. Instead, you will be able to accept the fact that your partner isn't perfect (and neither are you).

To sum up, developing the ability to live in the moment and accept your emotions, when combined with those so-called positive relationship behaviors of expressing your feelings through words and touch, can serve to get you through those times that can test the quality of your relationship. Fulfillment in long-term relationships depends not only on how well you can express those positive feelings, but also on how well you can notice and accept them.

Just some funny news to make u laugh,http://foxnews.com/us/female-bodybuilder-82-fights-suspect-picked-wrong-house,"An 82-year-old female bodybuilder fought back against a man who broke into her home on Thursday night as she was getting ready for bed, using her daily workout regimen and various household items to overwhelm the intruder.

Willie Murphy, who attends the Maplewood YMCA in Rochester, N.Y., on a daily basis, was getting ready for bed around 11:00 p.m. when a man started banging on the door asking for an ambulance, while declaring ""I'm sick, I'm sick.""

Murphy called the police and wouldn't let him inside, which she says angered the man.

“I hear a loud noise,” she told WHAM-TV. “I’m thinking, what the heck was that? The young man is in my home. He broke the door.”

The award-winning bodybuilder told the outlet she hid under the cover of night – picking up the nearest object – as the thief crept through her home.

“I picked up the table, and I went to work on him,” said Murphy, who can deadlift 225 pounds. ""The table broke.”

“And when he’s down,” she added, “I’m jumping on him.”

After the table drop, Murphy grabbed a nearby bottle of shampoo and went to town.

“I grabbed the shampoo,” she told WHAM-TV. “Guess what? He’s still on the ground. In his face, all of it, the whole thing.”

Shen then grabbed a nearby broom and swept the floor with the unknown suspect.

“I got the broom,” she said. “He’s pulling the broom. I’m hitting him with the broom.”

When officers arrived, Murphy says the first responders wanted to take selfies with her and she even received a hero's welcome when returning to her local YMCA.

PEACEFUL PROTESTS IN COLOMBIA,http://colombiareports.com/amp/who-is-colombia-is-protesting-and-why,"Colombia’s government is on the edge of its seat as labor unions are on strike and a multitude of social organizations have announced massive anti-government protests.

The strike was initially called by the labor unions in protest of what has since become known as President Ivan “Duque’s Great Package” of pending labor and pension reforms.

The other organizations, some of whom are able to mobilize huge crowds, are protesting for entirely different reasons.

Many demand Duque ends his government’s resistance to the implementation of a 2016 peace deal with the FARC.

What all have in common is that they reject Duque’s refusal to talk to organizations and impose his policies without meaningful dialogues with the affected communities.

A national strike this big hasn’t been seen in Colombia since 1977 and has the government in a state of panic because it reportedly believes it is part of an unfounded international conspiracy to overthrow the government.

Where protests are held

Labor unions

The labor unions called the national strike in the beginning of October to protest at the government’s economic policies, and in particular pending labor and pension reforms, and “the policies of Duque that are destroying the nation and peace.”

According to the labor unions, the government wants to “establish hourly pay, different minimum wages per region, the elimination of the payment of overtime, Sundays and holidays, compensation for dismissal, among others.”

In regards to pensions, the unions have said Duque seeks “increases of pension age and contribution, decrease in pension payments and the worst, the establishment of an individual savings system eliminating solidarity.”

Students

Colombia’s largest student organizations joined the labor unions from the beginning, initially out of solidarity with the labor unions, “against Duque, his labor and pension reforms” and to demand “the compliance of agreements and the right to protest.”

The students have since added that they want the dismantling of controversial riot police unit ESMAD, which has violently repressed student protests in Bogota where students were protesting against corruption.

Indigenous organizations

Colombia’s national indigenous organization ONIC announced all indigenous organizations would join the protests after the killing of indigenous governor Cristina Bautista in a massacre late October.

The massacre was the final straw for the indigenous organizations, who have been demanding attention to an ongoing genocide of native Americans since March.

The ethnic violence escalated after Duque refused to meet with indigenous authorities in the southwestern Cauca province in April. Also the indigenous people demand the government immediately implement a 2016 peace deal with FARC guerrillas that is opposed by Duque’s far-right party.

Additionally, the native Americans want the government to comply with more than 300 previously made agreements that were never complied with.

Black minority leaders

Like the native Colombians, black minority leaders have lost dozens of leaders in assassinations over disputes related to the protection of their autonomous territories against drug traffickers, illegal miners and multinationals.

Also the black minority leaders want Duque to implement the peace deal as agreed by former President Juan Manuel Santos.

Black communities in the west of the country have suffered more than any other group of ongoing armed conflict between illegal armed groups that have taken advantage of the state’s failures to implement the peace deal.

Farmers

Farmers are protesting because of the negative effects they have experienced due to free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union where farmers receive major subsidies.

Currently, the farmers are worried about the European demands to allow the import of potatoes, a vegetable that originally comes from the western hemisphere.

Previously, rice farmers claimed that they were condemned to poverty because the free trade pact with the US obliges them to sow “certified” genetically modified American rice that, because of controversial patent claims, could not be resown.

Armed conflict victims

Victims of state violence, in particular victims of extrajudicial killings, said they would also join the march to demand Duque’s compliance with the peace deal.

The president’s far-right party has always acknowledged the rights of FARC victims, but has ignored the victims of state violence, most of whom were killed when Duque’s political patron, Alvaro Uribe, was president.

The victims are particularly offended because the “uribistas” deny the existence of an armed conflict and have consistently tried to make the victims of the military and paramilitary groups invisible.

Opposition parties and center-right lawmakers

Opposition parties and several center-right politicians will march to demand Duque’s compliance with the peace deal and an end to his persistence in trying to govern without majority support in Congress.

Duque’s Democratic Center party, furthermore, on multiple occasions has pulled dirty and possibly illegal tricks to have their agenda pushed through Congress or to block initiatives by other parties.

Centrist and center-right lawmakers have also joined the march, because they want to convince Duque to stop relying entirely on his far-right party and form a broader coalition that would improve governability.

Everybody else who is pissed off

Apart from the aforementioned organizations, taxi drivers, air traffic controllers, women’s rights organizations and LGBT activists will join, all to demand attention for their grievances.

But most importantly, a lot of people are said to be joining because of Duque’s apparent inability to govern.

Fifteen months after taking office, Duque’s political party received an electoral beating last month and, according to the last poll, the president is disapproved of by 69% of the population.

Some of these individual supporters have said they would join the protests over his loyalty to his allegedly criminal political patron’s fraud and Duque’s ongoing denial of common grievances."

Incredible Person!,http://cnn.com/2018/05/11/health/james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Most people, when they retire, get a gold watch. James Harrison deserves so much more than that.

Harrison, known as the ""Man With the Golden Arm,"" has donated blood nearly every week for 60 years. After all those donations, the 81-year-old Australian man ""retired"" Friday. The occasion marked the end of a monumental chapter.

According to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, he has helped saved the lives of more than 2.4 million Australian babies.

First, a note about antibodies

Harrison's blood has unique, disease-fighting antibodies that have been used to develop an injection called Anti-D, which helps fight against rhesus disease.

This disease is a condition where a pregnant woman's blood actually starts attacking her unborn baby's blood cells. In the worst cases, it can result in brain damage, or death, for the babies.

Here's why:

The condition develops when a pregnant woman has rhesus-negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood (RhD positive), inherited from its father.

If the mother has been sensitized to rhesus-positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an rhesus-positive baby, she may produce antibodies that destroy the baby's ""foreign"" blood cells. That could be deadly for the baby.

How Harrison made a difference

Harrison's remarkable gift of giving started when he had major chest surgery when he was just 14, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service said.

Blood donations saved his life, so he pledged to become a blood donor.

A few years later, doctors discovered his blood contained the antibody which could be used to create Anti-D injections, so he switched over to making blood plasma donations to help as many people as possible.

Doctors aren't exactly sure why Harrison has this rare blood type, but they think it might be from the transfusions he received when he was 14, after his surgery. He's one of no more than 50 people in Australia known to have the antibodies, the blood service says.

""Every bag of blood is precious, but James' blood is particularly extraordinary. His blood is actually used to make a life-saving medication, given to moms whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. Every batch of Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has come from James' blood."" Falkenmire said. ""And more than 17% of women in Australia are at risk, so James has helped save a lot of lives.""

Why his donations were a game changer

Anti-D, produced with Harrison's antibodies, prevents women with rhesus-negative blood from developing RhD antibodies during pregnancy. More than three million does of Anti-D have been issued to Australian mothers with negative blood types since 1967.

Even Harrison's own daughter was given the Anti-D vaccine.

""That resulted in my second grandson being born healthy,"" Harrison said. ""And that makes you feel good yourself that you saved a life there, and you saved many more and that's great.

The discovery of Harrison's antibodies was an absolute game changer, Australian officials said.

""In Australia, up until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors didn't know why, and it was awful. Women were having numerous miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage,"" Jemma Falkenmire, of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, told CNN in 2015 . ""Australia was one of the first countries to discover a blood donor with this antibody, so it was quite revolutionary at the time.""

Why he's a national hero

That would be more than two million lives, according to the blood service, and for that Harrison is considered a national hero in Australia. He's won numerous awards for his generosity, including the Medal of the Order of Australia, one of the country's most prestigious honors.

""It becomes quite humbling when they say, 'oh you've done this or you've done that or you're a hero,'"" Harrison said. ""It's something I can do. It's one of my talents, probably my only talent, is that I can be a blood donor.""

Now that Harrison has given his last blood donation (in Australia you can't donate blood past the age of 81), Falkenmire and others hope people with similar antibodies in their blood will step up and donate.

""All we can do is hope there will be people out there generous enough to do it, and selflessly in the way he's done,"" she said."
"Wholesome and principled father of 7 wins $80 million, doesn't quit job",http://powerball.com/winner-story/mi-lottery-suttons-bay-man-wins-80-million-powerball-jackpot,"MI Lottery: Suttons Bay Man Wins $80 Million Powerball Jackpot

LANSING, Mich., Oct. 23, 2019 - A Suttons Bay man who is ""rich with family"" now has cash to match after winning an $80 million Powerball jackpot from the Michigan Lottery.

Phillip Chippewa, 54, matched all of the winning numbers - 01-09-22-36-68 - and the Powerball 22 in the Sept. 21 drawing to win the big prize. He bought the winning ticket at the Barrels & Barrels Party Store, located at 1375 SW Bayshore Drive in Suttons Bay. Suttons Bay is about 20 miles north of Traverse City.

""Any time I see the jackpot getting up there I buy a few tickets and hope for the best,"" said Chippewa. ""I stopped at Barrels and Barrels the day of the drawing and almost walked out without buying the tickets, but at the last minute, I decided to get four plays.""

It wasn't until the next evening that Chippewa gave another thought to his Powerball tickets.

""I was at work and my sister sent me a text saying that someone who played at Barrels and Barrels won the Powerball jackpot,"" said Chippewa's wife, Dawn. ""My first thought was: 'He better have bought some tickets!'

""After I got home, we were doing our usual Sunday night routine when my sister sent another text to ask if we'd checked Phillip's tickets. Until then I had forgotten all about the news of a big winner.""

""After I bought the tickets, I had put them away in my truck,"" said Chippewa. ""I ran out to take a look at them and I didn't have to look past the first line to see I was the winner. Of course, my wife and son thought I was playing a trick, so my son pulled the numbers up on his phone and read them out loud while Dawn and I looked at the ticket together. By the time he was done, we both had tears in our eyes.""

To confirm they were big winners, the Chippewas decided to head back to Barrels and Barrels and have their ticket scanned.

""As soon as we walked in the clerk asked: 'Are you guys the big winners?' said Chippewa. ""I handed him the ticket and said: 'We're about to find out.' When the terminal printed a receipt saying to contact the Lottery, we knew our lives had changed.""

The Chippewas headed back home and contacted the rest of their family so they could share the good news.

""We called a family meeting and told all seven of our kids the good news,"" said Chippewa. ""There were a lot of emotions in that room because we've always put our family first and it hasn't always been easy, but all of them were so happy for us.

""With seven children and 21 grandchildren, I've always said that I might not have the most money, but I am rich with family. Now, I have all the money I'll ever need and can help my family for generations. That means everything to me.""

Chippewa chose to receive his $80 million jackpot as a one-time lump sum payment of $55.3 million, rather than an annuity. After tax withholdings, he will receive about $42 million. He plans to buy homes for himself and each of his children and continue to share his winnings with his family. A new Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a white Dodge Challenger also are on his shopping list.

""Winning is life changing, but it's not going to change who we are,"" said Chippewa, who is a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. ""My wife and I have been together for 25 years, we've always helped others and we're both still working.

""Every day when I come to work my boss asks me: 'Why are you here?' I just tell him that I was hired to do a job and I'm not going to abandon anyone just because I won. We'll both retire in time, but we believe in being good to the community that has been so good to us.""

Chippewa's big win marks the fourth time a Michigan player has won the Powerball jackpot since the state began offering the game in 2010. The last Michigan player to win the Powerball jackpot was Julie Leach, of Three Rivers. In 2015, Leach won the game's $310.5 million jackpot.

In 2012, Donald Lawson, of Lapeer, won $337 million playing the Powerball game. Lawson's jackpot win holds the record for the largest Lottery prize ever paid in Michigan.

Powerball plays may be purchased for $2 each at Lottery retailers across the state and online at MichiganLottery.com. A ""Power Play"" option that multiplies non-jackpot prizes by up to 10 times to a maximum of $2 million may be added to any Powerball play for only $1.

The Powerball drawing takes place at 10:59 p.m. on Wednesday and Saturday and may be watched online at: http://www.powerball.com. Powerball tickets are sold in 44 states, Washington D.C., U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.

About 97 cents of every dollar spent on Lottery tickets is returned to the state in the form of contributions to the state School Aid Fund, prizes to players and commissions to vendors and retailers. In the 2018 fiscal year, the Lottery provided more than $941.3 million for Michigan's public schools, its fourth record contribution in a row. Since it began in 1972, the Lottery has contributed more than $22 billion to support public education in Michigan.

Flood-hit Venice to face another exceptional high tide on Sunday,http://reuters.com/article/us-italy-weather-venice/flood-hit-venice-to-face-another-exceptional-high-tide-on-sunday-idUSKBN1XQ0LS,"MILAN (Reuters) - Venice will face another exceptional high tide on Sunday, after its worst flooding in 50 years on Tuesday caused more than $1 billion worth of damage and submerged St Mark’s Square under a meter of water.

Slideshow ( 13 images )

The tide could reach 160 cm (5.25 feet) just after midday on Sunday, according to Venice’s center for forecast on tides.

“It will be a tough day tomorrow, but we are ready,” Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said on Saturday during a press conference.

On Tuesday the tide peaked at 187 cm (6.14 ft) at 10.50 p.m. (2150 GMT), just short of the record 194 cm set in 1966. In normal conditions, tides of 80-90 cm are generally seen as high but manageable.

Brugnaro, who has been appointed the special commissioner to deal with the emergency, on Saturday said he had received offers of support from the European Union, and that the European Investment Bank (EIB) could grant special loans for repairs.

The mayor confirmed a damage estimate of around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). The government declared a state of emergency for Venice on Thursday, allocating 20 million euros to address the immediate damage.

Speaking at the same press conference, the official supervising art works and historic buildings Emanuela Carpani said half the city’s 120 churches had been flooded with salt water on Tuesday, damaging some mosaic floors.

“Water is a cancer whose damages emerge after months,” Carpani said, adding that the first repairs to these churches could cost 3.6 million euros.

On Tuesday Saint Mark’s Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, but the fourth in the last 20.

With three tides above 140 cm this week, 2019 will be the worst year for high tides in Venice since 1872, when official tide statistics were first produced."

Thirsty future ahead as climate change explodes plant growth,http://nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment-and-conservation/2019/11/thirsty-future-ahead-climate-change-explodes-plant-growth,"Researchers have now shown a third effect: As CO 2 levels rise, it amps up photosynthesis. Plants in this hotter, CO 2 -rich environment grow bigger, with more leaves. That means when it rains there will be far more wet leaves creating more surface area for more evaporation to occur. Computer modelling shows that such enhanced leaf evaporation has a large effect on runoff and soil moisture, says Mankin.

Mankin's team used 16 different climate models with historical data for a number of variables including precipitation, leaf evaporation, soil evaporation, leaf area index, soil moisture, and more that accurately replicate past conditions. Future climate variables such as surface air temperature and CO 2 levels were added to find out how they would affect the global water cycle.

While plants everywhere will consume more water in a hotter, CO 2 -rich world, northern and tropical regions are projected to have enough precipitation to offset the additional plant growth, Mankin says.

The study’s take-home message: The combined effects of increased CO 2 and warmer temperatures will increase water consumption by vegetation. That will lead to water declines in rivers and streams in the mid-latitudes, including North America, Europe, and Central Asia.

Bad news on water

It’s long been debated whether the effects of high CO 2 levels on plants means more water availability on the land, says Peter Gleick, a world-renowned water expert and former president of the Pacific Institute, which works on global water issues.

“By more accurately modelling growth of biomass overall, including leaf canopy,” the study reaches “a robust, opposite, and ‘bad news’ conclusion: rising levels of CO 2 and the related climate changes will worsen, not improve, water availability,” says Gleick, who was not involved with the research.

This result is “almost certainly bad news for the western U.S.,” he says.

Previous climate research has found an 80 percent likelihood of a 35-year or longer ""megadrought"" striking the Southwest and central Great Plains by 2100 with business-as-usual CO 2 emissions. Moderate reductions in emissions will only reduce this risk to 60 percent. And this megadrought model does not include the new findings about how changes in vegetation could worsen conditions, says Gleick.

The atmosphere is already more CO 2 rich and the climate is warmer. There is evidence from satellites showing significant increases in vegetation in the past 40 years, says Mankin. While growing seasons are also getting longer, it is difficult to say this recent greening of the Earth is entirely due to climate change because there have been so many human alterations to the landscape over the last 100 years, he says.

CO 2 levels rising and rising

For at least 800,000 years the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 levels ranged between 180 and 290 parts per million (ppm). In the last 10,000 years they stayed around 280 ppm until the Industrial Revolution sparked widespread use of coal.

Today’s measurements show CO 2 levels were 412 ppm as of September this year, 47 percent higher than pre-industrial levels. The last time CO 2 levels were above 400 ppm was 16 to 25 million years ago, when the planet and its climate were very different.

CO 2 levels are increasing at a rate of 2 ppm per year. With continued use of coal, gas, and oil that could double to 560 ppm by 2100. Under those conditions the modelling shows that droughts happening much faster, lasting longer, and becoming more severe across the mid-latitudes—even when there is normal rainfall, Mankin says.

Water scarcity is already a major issue, with four billion people suffering from severe water scarcity at least one month a year, according to a 2016 study. Any future reduction in water supply is very bad news indeed."

"Rats love driving tiny cars, even when they don't get treats",http://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/these-rats-learned-to-drive-tiny-cars-for-science/,"Getty Images

Rats that learn to drive are more able to cope with stress. That might sound like the fever-dream of a former scientist-turned-car writer, but it's actually one of the results of a new study from the University of Richmond. The aim of the research was to see what effect the environment a rat was raised in had on its ability to learn new tasks. Although that kind of thing has been studied in the past, the tests haven't been particularly complicated. Anyone who has spent time around rats will know they're actually quite resourceful. So the team, led by Professor Kelly Lambert, came up this time with something a little more involved than navigating a maze: driving.

If you're going to teach rats to drive, first you need to build them a car (or Rat Operated Vehicle). The chassis and powertrain came from a robot car kit, and a transparent plastic food container provided the body. Explaining the idea of a steering wheel and pedals to rats was probably too difficult, so the controls were three copper wires stretched across an opening cut out of the front of the bodywork and an aluminum plate on the floor. When a rat stood on the plate and gripped a copper bar, a circuit was completed and the motors engaged; one bar made the car turn to the left, one made it turn to the right, and the third made it go straight ahead.

If proof were needed that many existing psychology tests are too simple, rats did not take long to learn how to drive. The driving was conducted in a closed-off arena (1.5m x 0.6m x 0.5m) where the goal was to drive over to a food treat. Three five-minute sessions a week, for eight weeks, was sufficient for the rats to learn how to do it. The placement of the treat and the starting position and orientation of the car varied throughout, so the rats had more of a challenge each time. At the end of the experiment, each rat went through a series of trials, conducted a day or two apart, where they were allowed to drive around the arena but without any food treats to see if they were only doing it for the food.

The subjects were 11 male rats, five of whom lived together in a large cage with multiple surface levels and objects to play with, and six who lived together in pairs in standard laboratory rat cages. Although both groups of rats learned to drive the car, the ones that lived in the enriched environment were quicker to start driving, and they continued to be more interested in driving even when there was no reward on offer beyond the thrill of the wind in one's fur.

The researchers also collected each rat's droppings at various points during the study to analyze them for metabolites of corticosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone, a pair of hormones. The ratio of these two hormones can show how stressed an animal is, and it changed in a pattern consistent with emotional resilience in all the rats over the course of the study. However, there was no significant difference between the enriched environment and the control group in this regard, which may well mean that the four-month process of teaching the rats to drive was itself a positive enriching environment.

Serious scientists usually refrain from imputing any further emotion onto research animals, but I'm no longer a serious scientist, so I'm happy saying that learning to drive made the rats more well-adjusted. And the study has further value; these complex activities may be more useful tests in rat models of neuropsychiatry than those in current use.

The unique chemistry of cats' guts make them the perfect host for Toxoplasma gondii,http://massivesci.com/notes/toxoplasma-gondii-chemistry-cat-guts-sexual-reproduction-lifecycle/,"Dieting is notoriously difficult. Thanks in part to evolution, we love foods that are high in calories. Not only that, but once we have experienced the kind of high-calorie foods that surround us in the modern world, more nutritionally-balanced foods become much less attractive. But why?

To understand how the brain makes dieting so difficult, and high-calorie foods so tempting, the authors of a recent study turned to mice, where they could record and manipulate the activity of specific neurons involved in energy balance and reward. They asked how exposing mice to high-calorie foods affected their consumption of, and neural responses to, regular foods.

When researchers gave the mice access to both high-fat (HFD) and standard (SD) diets, mice completely stopped eating the SD almost immediately, and preferred the HFD. They then removed the HFD, and saw that mice still ate very little SD, and so lost substantial weight. This devaluation of regular food was so strong that even fasting mice presented with an SD ate very little — they would only eat a lot if the HFD was available. Just experiencing the HFD for 24 hours was enough time to make the SD less tasty.

Suzanne Beaky

To see how HFD exposure affects the brain’s response to food, the scientists recorded the activity of AgRP neurons, a population of neurons that is active during hunger and controls energy balance, and midbrain dopamine neurons, which release dopamine as a signal of reward. Exposure to the HFD greatly reduced the response of both groups of neurons to the SD: afterward, these neurons would only respond strongly to the HFD. Regular food became less rewarding, and less satiating, than high-calorie food.

Under normal conditions, AgRP neurons would only respond to food when a mouse is hungry. But after HFD withdrawal (mimicking dieting), the AgRP neurons became so sensitive to HFD that they would respond even if the mouse was not hungry. This could explain why when we diet, high-calorie foods are so hard to resist – these foods become rewarding even when we aren’t hungry.

This study suggests that exposure to a HFD alters the brain’s response to food so that only high-calorie foods are rewarding and satiating, while more nutritionally-balanced foods become less valuable. And, abstaining from high-fat foods might just make our brains' hunger centers responsive to these foods even when we’re not hungry, making it difficult to resist the urge to binge. Research on the circuits that regulate food intake will potentially lead to therapies that allow us to manipulate these biological urges and control the obesity epidemic."
Housing complex for homeless veterans first of its kind in Canada. We definitely need more of these!,http://calgary.ctvnews.ca/housing-complex-for-homeless-veterans-first-of-its-kind-in-canada-1.4659357?fbclid=IwAR2IFlGnj3_P05M5gzIkiOwqi4whQ1cJRf85iMbRRMmsQk17xjVBjwulAuI,"CALGARY — Homelessness is a problem among Canadian veterans, with at least 3,500 living on the streets across the country.

Homes For Heroes is trying to fix that and has just finished its first housing complex aimed at supporting homeless veterans and getting them back on their feet.

A complex of 15 tiny homes is now complete with most residents set to move in on the weekend.

Each unit includes a kitchen, bathroom and a Murphy bed, as well as a deck where they can spend time outside.

The units are all named for soldiers killed in the line of duty.

The complex also includes support for mental health and addictions, as well as a family space to help those vets and get them feeling good again.

The program uses expert staff from Veterans Affairs Canada and the Mustard Seed to figure out what each resident needs.

“They get an understanding of what support they need, whether that be post-traumatic stress, whether they’re dealing with addiction, career re-training, education and so forth,” said David Howard, president and co-founder of the Homes For Heroes Foundation.

“But the whole idea is to build that package and to help the veteran work through that.”

The tiny home village is the first of its kind in Canada, but Howard says they have land agreements in place in Edmonton and Ontario with interest from several other cities across the country.

Calgary-based ATCO contributed $1.5 million to design and manufacture the tiny homes, setting up the site along 36th Street S.E. and Canadian Pacific raised more than $800,000 for the initiative over the past three years.

Homes For Heroes was founded by Howard and Murray McCann, who also started the Field of Crosses, the poignant annual display of remembrance along Memorial Drive."

PARIS (AP) — An old painting found in the kitchen of an elderly French woman, who considered it an icon of little importance, has made her a multimillionaire.

The work, a masterpiece attributed to the 13th-century Italian painter Cimabue that was discovered earlier this year, sold for 24 million euros ($26.6 million) Sunday.

Dominique Le Coent of Acteon Auction House, who sold the masterpiece to an anonymous buyer near Chantilly, north of Paris, said the sale represented a “world record for a primitive, or a pre-1500 work.”

“It’s a painting that was unique, splendid and monumental. Cimabue was the father of the Renaissance. But this sale goes beyond all our dreams,” Le Coent told The Associated Press.

An auctioneer spotted the painting in June while inspecting a woman’s house in Compiegne in northern France and suggested she bring it to experts for an evaluation. It hung on a wall between the kitchen and dining room.

The woman will now receive “the majority” of the sale money, the auction house said.

The expected sale price had been 4 million to 6 million euros ($4.4 million to $6.6 million).

Le Coent said experts were off the mark because it was the first time a Cimabue had ever gone under the hammer. “There’s never been a Cimabue painting on sale so there was no reference previously on how much it could make,” he explained.

Titled “Christ Mocked,” the painting measures about 10 inches by 8 inches (24 by 20 centimeters).

Art experts say it is likely part of a larger diptych that Cimabue painted around 1280, of which two other panels are displayed at the Frick Collection in New York and the National Gallery in London.

The painting’s discovery has sent ripples of excitement through the art world.

Cimabue, who taught Italian master Giotto, is widely considered the forefather of the Italian Renaissance. He broke from the Byzantine style popular in the Middle Ages and began to incorporate elements of movement and perspective that came to characterize Western painting.

Specialists at the Turquin gallery in Paris initially examined the painting and concluded with “certitude” that it bore the hallmarks of Cimabue.

Stephane Pinta, an art specialist with the Turquin, pointed to likenesses in facial expressions and buildings, as well as the painter’s techniques for conveying light and distance."
"A new study has found compelling evidence that early humans such as Neanderthals not only controlled fire, but also mastered the ability to generate it.",http://nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51433-0,"The use of fire played a key role in the evolution of the genus Homo1, allowing for warmth, cooking, birch tar production, protection from predators, a venue for social interactions and access to high latitudes and dark caves2. Evidence of hominin fire use is present in the archaeological record beginning around 1.5 million years ago3,4,5, and while it has long been assumed that a variety of hominin species could use fire5,6,7, the degree to which hominins were able to intentionally create and control fire (pyrotechnology) is debated8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Recently, some have argued that this ability was exclusive to modern humans9,12,16, with other hominins, such as Neanderthals, limited to exploiting wildfires. Neanderthals went extinct during the late Pleistocene. The reasons for that extinction remain unclear, and recent genetic data indicate that Neanderthal DNA persists among certain modern populations of Homo sapiens18. Neanderthal extinction has been linked specifically or in combination to fire use, foraging behaviors, a lack of clothing, demography, climate change, and interactions with expanding populations of Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens19,20. Evidence for the use of fire among MP hominins includes burning found in archaeological sites, and the construction of hearths. Manganese dioxide blocks, which are useful for fire-starting, have also been excavated at MP sites and are interpreted by some as evidence of Neanderthal fire production21. However, research at MP sites in France claims that fire frequency, measured by thermally altered flint and burnt bone, is positively correlated with warmer periods, when wildfire frequency is assumed to be highest, rather than with colder, glacial periods when fire use would have provided greater benefit; this correlation is derived by associating chronometrically dated stratigraphic layers at these sites with particular phases of Pleistocene global temperature records. These data are collectively interpreted as evidence that Neanderthals had not mastered pyrotechnology, and instead harvested natural fires caused by lightning strikes12,16, though this interpretation is not accepted by all15.

In order to test the hypothesis that MP hominin fire use was correlated with natural fire frequency, we developed a record of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for the MP site of Lusakert Cave 1 (LKT1) in the Armenian Highlands from eighteen sedimentary units associated with MP lithic technology22,23,24. Organic molecular markers of fire, including PAHs, can provide a quantitative record of fire over geological time scales25,26, though lighter PAHs may be more susceptible to the effects of degradation due to their higher solubility27. During biomass combustion PAHs with variable structure are formed typically containing two (e.g. naphthalene) to six (e.g. benzo[g, h, i]perylene) rings (Supplementary Fig. S1). A number of studies have documented the PAH emission from wood burning in hearths and fireplaces28,29,30,31,32,33. While varied PAHs are produced during wood combustion, low molecular weight PAHs (lPAHs) with four or fewer rings concentrate in the gaseous phase, whereas high molecular weight PAHs (hPAHs), with five or more rings tend to concentrate in the particulate phase34,35,36. Hearths in archaeological contexts can reach maximum temperatures of 1000 °C with mean temperatures of 600 °C, which provides sufficient energy for the production of hPAHs37,38.

Unlike wood combustion in hearths, studies document the low production of hPAHs in wild fires of varying intensities, which produce mostly 3- and 4-ring PAHs. For example, soils measured in a recently burned area in southern France did not measure hPAH abundances higher than control samples39. Following forest fires in South Korea, lPAH concentrations were found to be 3 to 28 times higher than hPAH concentrations40. Soil O-horizons in Russia analyzed two, ten and 16 years after a wildfire found that hPAH concentrations were not higher than background soils, despite 9-fold increases in total PAH concentrations41. hPAHs comprised 35% of the total PAH load in unburnt samples from fire prone regions in Spain, but less than 10% in burnt soils after wildfires due to the addition of lPAHs42. Finally, in savannah fires in Australia the frequency of emitted lPAHs was 13 to 30 times greater than hPAHs43. These data attest to the widespread production and dispersal of lPAHs associated with wildfire events.

In sedimentary records from fire-prone regions, hPAHs are typically lower in abundance than lPAHs44,45. Different explanations have been given for the lack of hPAHs relative to lPAHs, including changes in temperature or burn intensity44, as higher molecular weight PAHs require higher activation energies for synthesis. Another potential explanation is the proximity to the source of the fire45, as hPAHs are less likely to travel from the source of the fire. Therefore, in the context of a spatially confined archaeological site such as LKT1, we expect that the primary mode of deposition of lPAHs will be through long-range dispersals of wildfire, whereas the primary mode of deposition of hPAHs will be local fire use within the cave by hominins. Given the low abundance of hPAHs produced during wildfires relative to lPAHs, and their concentration in the particulate emissions from wood burned in hearths, it is the most parsimonious explanation that accumulation of hPAHs in the sediments of archaeological sites like Lusakert Cave will be due to increased particulate deposition of residues from wood combustion. These particulate emissions of hearths will concentrate locally, on the scale of 10 s of meters.

In addition to PAH data for local or regional fire, we also analyzed the hydrogen (δD wax ) and carbon (δ13C wax ) isotope composition of long-chain n-alkanes, the molecular remains of epicuticular waxes of terrestrial plants, to constrain regional climate and hydrology through the period of hominin occupation (Fig. 1A,B). Like hPAHs and lPAHs, n-alkanes are preserved over geological time scales. Long-chain n-alkanes at LKT1 have high odd-over-even predominance (OEP), demonstrating that they did not undergo significant microbial46 or thermal47 alteration (Supplementary Table S2). The δ13C values in plant material is primarily a reflection of the photosynthetic pathway of the plant (C 3 , C 4 or CAM). In C 3 plants, δ13C values are influenced by physiological changes as plants balance water loss and CO 2 uptake through the regulation of stomata, altering the partial pressures of intracellular (C i ) relative to extracellular (C a ) CO 2 48,49, causing a positive shift in δ13C values in C 3 plants experiencing water stress50. Fractionation during lipid biosynthesis causes n-alkane δ13C values to be lower relative to bulk plant tissues51,52. Therefore, sedimentary δ13C wax values of n-alkanes predominantly reflect plant photosynthetic type and factors that affect isotopic discrimination during carbon fixation53. δD wax record the isotope values of ambient water during the period of growth54, reflecting mostly precipitation isotope values in terrestrial systems. δD values of precipitation are influenced by temperature, amount of precipitation, and cloud transport history55,56. Most of the variability in modern precipitation δD values in the Armenian Highlands is explained by changes in temperature, and there is no significant trend associated with amount of precipitation57. This is also documented in Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation stations in Georgia and Turkey (Supplementary Fig. S3). Hydrogen undergoes further fractionation during lipid biosynthesis, which is influenced by the timing of wax formation, plant physiology and functional type58,59,60.

LKT1 was excavated by an Armenian-American-British team between 2008 and 2011 and is one of the few sites in the region that preserves stratified assemblages of lithic and faunal material (Supplementary Discussion S4, Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, there is extensive evidence for fire in the form of charcoal and visible combustion structures, as well as thermally altered bone micro-fragments in micromorphological samples (Supplementary Figs S6, S7, S8). The lithic assemblage is made entirely of obsidian from a variety of local (<25 km) and exotic (>25 km) sources, it is based on the Levallois method, and it can be classified as Middle Palaeolithic, a toolkit traditionally associated with Neanderthals in the Caucasus and neighboring regions22,23. Preliminary luminescence and AMS radiocarbon dates, as well as tephrochronological correlations constrain the stratigraphy of the site to 60–40 ka."

11-year-old best friends may have helped save a man's life.,http://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/11-year-old-best-friends-may-have-helped-save-a-man-s-life-1.4650197#_gus&_gucid=&_gup=twitter&_gsc=CJKXMWQ,"Juliet Murphy and Darcy Power have been best friends quite literally since the day they were born.

“We are actually born on the same day and at the same hospital and our parents, well our Dads, grew up together,” boasts Juliet, “so we just kind of naturally bonded”.

During a playdate on Saturday, that bond for the 11 year olds became even stronger at Barrhaven’s Furness Park at the corner of Amarillo Drive and Lydia Way.

“We went on a bike ride to the park,” says Darcy.

After playing for a bit, they decided to head back to Juliet’s house in the neighbourhood when they noticed something just wasn’t right,

“We saw a man on the road,” Darcy said.

The man, believed to be in his 60’s, was laying on his back the girls say, half on the road and half on the sidewalk, his phone was on the ground just out of his arm’s reach.

“We thought he may be faking and trying to grab kids,” Darcy worried.

“So then I just told her to be cautious and look and see if anything is suspicious,” Juliet warned her friend,

“We said hello,” Darcy adds, “he wasn’t breathing.”

The girls say they started to feel panicked. So they worked out a plan.

“We parked our bikes in the middle of the street and we looked at him just trying to decide what to do,” said Darcy.

Darcy decided to stay on guard while Juliet ran to a friend’s house down the street for help, but no one was home.

“So I just yelled to Darcy ‘go to the closest door and ring the doorbell!’”

Darcy did just that, but no one was home there either.

That’s when the pair spotted two men down the street and ran to them asking for help.

“At first though they didn’t kind of believe us,” says Juliet, “and we’re like ya we’re serious.”

One man then called to the other to dial 9-1-1 and asked the girls to go home where they would be safe.

“We were rushing, we were biking as fast as we could,” remembers Darcy.

While the men and other bystanders ran to perform CPR, the girls decided to stay down the street and help direct incoming emergency crews.

“We were very nervous,” Darcy said, “but the thing that troubled me most was is that man going to be okay.”

Ottawa Paramedic Superintendent Marc-Antoine Deschamps says when paramedics arrived they continued resuscitation efforts, using a defibrillator and medication to restart the man’s heart. The patient was in critical condition on the way to hospital. His condition now is unknown.

Deschamps, meeting the girls for the first time on Tuesday, says their actions made a difference in the man’s life.

“It’s a team effort and the first chain in the survival is the early recognition and contacting 9-1-1 which is exactly what those two young ladies did.”

The girls are just praying the man will be ok.

“He was in his 60’s so that’s not a full life yet,” says Darcy,

“He has to enjoy it,” adds Juliet.

As for the thought of being called heroes,

“We tend to believe it,” laughs Juliet, “we just wanted to help”,

“And we’re ready to do it again if anybody needs help,” says Darcy."

Thank goodness! An apparently legit breakthrough that will actually help tons!,http://greentechmedia.com/articles/read/apple-new-joint-venture-announces-zero-carbon-aluminum-smelting,"Aluminum production companies Alcoa and Rio Tinto announced Thursday the formation of Elysis, a joint venture company created to commercialize a new aluminum smelting process with no direct greenhouse gas emissions — with backing from tech giant Apple.

Standing alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the two companies announced the technology, a new headquarters in Montreal, and a research and development facility in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec. Canada and Quebec will each invest $60 million, with Apple providing $13 million, as well as technical support. Total investment tops out at $188 million.

Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques called the new process “revolutionary,” while Alcoa said the technology would have wide-ranging environmental benefits.

“This discovery has been long sought in the aluminum industry,” said Alcoa President and CEO Roy Harvey, adding that it would “take aluminum’s sustainable advantage to a new level with the potential to improve the carbon footprint of a range of products from cars to consumer electronics.”

That includes clean energy technologies such as some energy storage products and solar rooftop racking.

Commercial partners who will use the aluminum have yet to be pinned down, but Apple’s collaboration suggests the electronics company will be among the first in line for metal produced with the new technology. The company announced in April that its global operations now run on 100 percent renewable energy, and CEO Tim Cook said Apple looks forward to the day when the technology scales enough for use in the company's products.

It’s a spot of positive news for an industry dealing with the fallout of Trump’s latest round of tariffs. In March the administration proposed 10 percent tariffs on aluminum, along with 25 percent tariffs on steel. According to GTM Research, the tariffs for the two metals taken together could add 2 to 4 cents per watt to solar racking prices, increase the levelized costs of energy for wind power by 2 to 3 percent, and bump the LCOEs for solar by 3 to 5 percent.

This week, the administration offered Canada and Mexico an initial exemption on those tariffs for an undefined period.

The new smelting process — which the companies say will also be called Elysis, in a nod to the electrolysis of alumina used to produce aluminum — uses an inert anode, rather than the carbon anodes used in conventional aluminum smelting. Instead of releasing carbon dioxide, the process Alcoa engineered emits only oxygen. The R&D facility will run on hydropower, further cutting the process’s emissions.

According to the joint venture, if Canadian smelters adopt the technology, its carbon benefits would equate to taking 1.8 million cars off the road.

Beyond its climate benefits, Elysis said the new production process both cuts operating costs by 15 percent and increases production by 15 percent.

Alcoa has refined the process since 2009 at its facility in Pittsburgh, producing about 700 metric tonnes of aluminum. That's a small fraction of what the world currently consumes. China exported 451,000 metric tonnes of unwrought aluminum and aluminum products to the U.S. in April, even with the tariffs in place. Canada produces 3.2 million tonnes a year, with most going to the U.S.

After scaling the technology for industrial use, Elysis expects it to hit the commercial market by 2024. The company plans to license the technology so it can be applied to new builds or used to retrofit active smelters. Elysis also said it will sell proprietary anode and cathode materials.

With the new facilities, Canada will be getting “thousands of jobs,” according to Trudeau (Elysis will employ 100 people to start), as well as initial production capacity using the patented process. Elysis said it will also invest up to $40 million in the U.S. to support its supply chain."
"Being single beats being in bad relationships, and even neutral ones that aren't particularly bad, suggests new study. On 7 different measures, single people did better than people in bad romantic relationships. But they also did better than people in relationships that were not that bad at all.",http://psychologytoday.com/au/blog/living-single/201910/being-single-beats-bad-relationships-and-even-neutral-ones,"“Single? Well, it is better than being in a bad relationship.” Well-meaning friends and relatives sometimes convey such sentiments to single people. There are even some single people who say the same thing about themselves. But is it true?

New research published online in the and Social Psychology Bulletin shows that such a sentiment may in fact set the bar far too low. On seven different measures of how people were doing, people in were better off than single people in only one way. On the other six measures, people in romantic relationships did better than single people only if they said their relationships were of the very highest quality.

In other words, single people did better than people in bad romantic relationships. But they also did better than people in romantic relationships that were not that bad at all.

In “The Highs and Lows of Love,” Nathan W. Hudson of Southern Methodist University, and Richard E. Lucas and M. Brent Donnellan of Michigan State University, also describe the emotional experiences of people in romantic relationships when their partner was and was not around. Some of the findings were not at all romantic.

How the Study Was Conducted

Michigan State University conducts a State of the State telephone survey four times a year. Participants who said they were interested in signing up for other studies were sent invitations to take part in this study. The 326 people who answered questions at least two different times were included in the analyses. They ranged in age from 19 to 92; on average, they were 53 years old. Most (86 percent) were white.

The 307 people categorized as “in a romantic relationship” all said that they were in a committed romantic relationship; 271 were married and 7 were engaged. The people categorized as “not in a romantic relationship” (I refer to them as single) included lifelong single people who were not and those who were dating casually. Just about all of the and widowed people said they were not dating or only dating casually.

All participants answered 7 sets of questions about how they were doing.

1. Overall positive feelings. The extent to which the participants generally felt happy and satisfied over the past two weeks.

2. Overall negative feelings. The extent to which the participants generally felt frustrated, worried, sad, and angry over the past two weeks.

3. Overall sense of meaning. The extent to which the participants generally felt a sense of meaning over the past two weeks.

4. Positive feelings yesterday. The extent to which the participants felt happy and satisfied while engaging in various activities the day before.

5. Negative feelings yesterday. The extent to which the participants generally felt frustrated, worried, sad, and angry while engaging in various activities the day before.

6. Sense of meaning yesterday. The extent to which the participants generally felt a sense of meaning while engaging in various activities the day before.

7. Life satisfaction. The extent to which participants were satisfied with their lives, as measured by five items (e. ., “I am satisfied with my life”).

The participants who were in committed romantic relationships also rated the quality of those relationships. They were asked how much they agreed with 5 statements, such as “My relationship with my partner makes me happy” and “We have a good relationship.” Ratings were recorded on a scale ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree).

Were the People in Romantic Relationships Doing Better Than the Single People?

The people in committed romantic relationships did not experience more positive feelings—overall or during the previous day—than the single people did. They also did not experience fewer negative feelings or any more of a sense of meaning. They were only doing better in one way: they said they were more satisfied with their lives.

It's possible that they were proud of themselves for being in a romantic relationship, since those relationships are so valued, and perhaps that’s why they were more satisfied with their lives. Compared to single people, though, they did not feel any better emotionally and they did not experience their lives as more meaningful.

One subset of people in romantic relationships were doing better than single people in every way—the coupled people who agreed most strongly with every positive statement about their relationship. In every way, they described their relationship in the most positive terms possible—a 7 on the 7-point scale.

As for the coupled people who gave middle-of-the-scale ratings of their relationships—for example, they neither agreed nor disagreed that their relationship made them happy—they were worse off in every way (either significantly or nearly so) than the people who were single. The truism was also true: being single was better than being in a bad relationship.

Were the Coupled People Happier When Their Partners Were Around?

When the participants were asked about the emotions they experienced during various activities the day before, they were also asked to indicate who (if anyone) they were with each time. That way, the researchers were able to see whether people had more positive experiences when they were with their partner than when their partner wasn’t around.

On average, people in romantic relationships had more positive feelings and a greater sense of meaning when they were with their partner. However, they did not experience fewer negative feelings when their partner was around.

Again, the quality of romantic relationships mattered. People who rated their relationship quality as a little better than neutral (4.4 on the 1-to-7 scale) had more positive feelings when their partner was not present than when their partner was around.

When it came to negative feelings (frustration, worry, sadness, and ), the results were even more ominous. Even those who rated their romantic relationships as fairly high in quality (5.5 on the 1-to-7 scale) experienced significantly more negative feelings when they were with their partner than when their partner was not around. As the authors concluded:

“Thus, it appears that people who reported anything less than “strongly agreeing” that their relationship was high quality (original scale score = 6) experienced more negative affect while around their partners than when separated from them.”

As is always true of studies like this, we cannot know for sure whether relationship status or quality, or the presence of a romantic partner, caused people to feel more positively or negatively, or whether some other psychological dynamics were involved.

Single People’s Relationships

Most scholars who study romantic relationships refer to what they are studying as “relationships” rather than “romantic relationships.” The implication seems to be that unless you have a romantic relationship, you don’t have any relationships at all—or at least none that matter. In a truly rare occurrence, the authors of this study offered a more enlightened perspective:

“Although theorists have suggested that romantic relationships may be preeminent in determining well-being (e.g., Hazan & Zeifman, 1994), individuals who are not involved in romantic relationships may be able to fulfill their relational needs in a variety of ways (e.g., friendships; see DePaulo, 2005).

"Bella Hadid is the most beautiful woman in the world, according to 'science'",http://cnn.com/2019/10/17/entertainment/bella-hadid-most-beautiful-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) You can't argue with science, right?

Actually, expect this to cause quite a bit of conflict.

According to the Daily Mail, cosmetic surgeon Dr. Julian De Silva has declared model Bella Hadid the most beautiful woman in the world based on the ""science"" of the Golden Ratio of Beauty Phi.

What's that?

It's a measure of physical perfection reportedly adapted from the ""golden ratio"" artists and architects used during the European Renaissance to map out their masterpieces.

"Couple has second chance at love, tying the knot 60 years after their first engagement",http://abc.net.au/news/2019-10-19/second-chance-at-love-60-years-on/11614886,"A couple who lost contact after a broken engagement 60 years ago tied the knot in an emotional wedding on the weekend.

Key points: Tom and Judith met at teacher's college in Brisbane in 1957, where they were paired up for their annual ball, and two years later were engaged

Tom and Judith met at teacher's college in Brisbane in 1957, where they were paired up for their annual ball, and two years later were engaged But it wasn't meant to be: Judith's mother disapproved and Judith moved to New Zealand — Tom thought she was dead. Both moved on and were married to other people for decades

But it wasn't meant to be: Judith's mother disapproved and Judith moved to New Zealand — Tom thought she was dead. Both moved on and were married to other people for decades Sixty years on, the pair reunited and have now tied the knot after finally meeting face-to-face again for the first time in April

Tom Susans, 87, and Judith Beston, 80, met at teacher's training college in Brisbane in 1957 and two years later were engaged.

But fate had other plans for them, until they met up face-to-face for the first time at the beginning of this year.

""I think we're pretty lucky,"" Judith said of their reconnection.

""The chance of us meeting each other and the chances of us picking up where we left off — we seem to be pretty compatible.""

In an intimate ceremony with family and close friends, Tom placed on Judith's finger the same ring he had been keeping safe all this time.

""I thought after 60 years, it was about time she had it back — and it fitted,"" Tom said.

What happened?

The future had looked bright for the couple in 1959, when Tom landed a job teaching in Beaudesert and Judith decided to move from her job in north Queensland back to her home in Redcliffe.

But she did not count on her family's reaction.

""I thought 'this is good, I can get married here and Mum can help me a bit', but at home it was really difficult,"" Judith recalled.

""Mum didn't want Tom involved; she thought he was much too old for me.""

So Judith packed up her bags and moved to New Zealand, where she got a job as a high school teacher, married and set up a new life.

""She just disappeared,"" Tom said.

""I didn't know where she was; I couldn't find her anywhere in Australia.

""I thought she was dead.""

Tom placed the engagement and wedding rings in a wooden cabinet, where they stayed for the next 60 years, and moved on with his life.

He moved back to his home in central Queensland, marrying fellow teacher Sylvia in Rockhampton, where they raised their four girls.

The two retired to a small farm until Sylvia died after 53 years of marriage.

In New Zealand, Judith married an Englishman, Norman, and they raised seven children between them, including two adopted Maori children, until Norman passed away 35 years later.

Tom's search

During this time, their college — now called the Queensland University of Technology — held Golden Graduate Reunions every 10 years and Tom went to each one, looking for Judith.

Tom Susans went to each of his Golden Graduate Reunions at QUT, hoping to find Judith. And after 50 years, he did. ( Supplied )

The 30-year reunion ticked by, and then the 40-year union.

""She wasn't at either of those,"" Tom said.

""At the 50-year reunion, I didn't even look for her.""

But when Tom returned home and went through the names of the 400 or so attendees, there was Judith's name and he could not believe it.

Tom phoned.

""She pointed out she was still alive,"" he laughed.

They finally met face-to-face in 2009 at another Golden Graduates Reunion and spent the time catching up, but despite this they only kept in touch through Christmas cards for the next decade.

Judith had been widowed for some time, but it was not until Sylvia died that a correspondence sprang up between the couple.

And it was only in April this year that the two finally met up face-to-face again, when Judith made the trip as part of her 80th birthday celebration.

The two holidayed up the Queensland coast, and Tom proposed again.

""When he asked me to marry him, I said yes straightaway,"" Judith said.

""Normally I have to think about things for a while and sometimes I think about it long enough for it not to happen.""

Surprise

It was all a surprise to Tom's friend, Don Waterson.

Don has known Tom since they were at teachers training college together and they meet regularly with a group for retired teachers from their local high school in Rockhampton.

""Three or four months ago, Tom brought this woman along and her name was Judith,"" Don said.

""And she appeared at two of the meetings and at the second one, he announced that he and Judith were engaged and it's just as well that we were sitting down because we were quite surprised.""

Judith's wedding and engagement rings have been stored carefully in Tom's wooden cabinet for 60 years. ( ABC Capricornia: Erin Semmler )

Don said his friend was a naturally cheery fellow but had been quite lonely after Sylvia died.

""We know what a happy life he'd led, and we had no indication of this event that happened to him 60 years ago.""

Don, who attended the wedding, said it was an emotional affair.

""Everybody knew what had been at stake and it was particularly moving when he put that wedding ring on her finger.""

""I have to say they had a bit of trouble getting it on, but they persevered,"" Don said.

And this weekend, Tom and Judith are back in Brisbane to attend their 60th Golden Graduate Reunion, coming full circle."

"Boy who blurted out 'Wow!' in concert, invited back as a special guest",http://amp.classicfm.com/music-news/wow-child-attends-mozart-rehearsal/,"Boy who blurted out ‘Wow!’ in concert, invited back as a special guest

By Rosie Pentreath

Nine-year-old Ronan Mattin, who went viral earlier in the year for exclaiming ‘wow’ after some magnificent Mozart at Boston’s Symphony Hall, has been invited back by the orchestra.

Back in May, the story of a nine-year-old boy who couldn’t hide his enthusiasm for Mozart went viral.

Now dubbed the “wow child”, young Ronan Mattin exclaimed “wow” loudly in the silence before the applause at the end of The Handel and Haydn Society’s performance of Mozart’s Masonic Funeral Music, and delighted audiences around the world.

Mattin, who is on the autism spectrum and is “obsessed with musical instruments”, was invited by the orchestra to return to Boston’s Symphony Hall and attend a dress rehearsal as a special guest.

He left school early for the visit and was accompanied by his grandparents, according to The Boston Globe.

A witness to the first dress rehearsal in the season of The Handel and Haydn Society’s ‘A Mozart Celebration’ season, Mattin was apparently said few words during his visit, but was “thrilled”.

“He was tapping the window and jumping up and down,” his grandmother, Claire Mattin, told The Boston Globe.

“Yeah, music,” were two of the boy’s well-chosen words. Inside the hall he got the chance to meet instruments and their players up close, and hear the sounds they make in isolation.

Principal Trombonist, Toby Oft, welcomed Mattin to experience the vibrations of the music he was making, explaining “sound is vibrations.”

Ronan’s enthusiasm for music came to global attention when, during a brief moment of silence after The Handel & Haydn Society finished their Mozart, he called out an uninhibited ‘Wow!’ (watch video above).

The awe in his voice made the whole audience and ensemble erupt into laughter and applause, with the orchestra’s CEO David Snead describing it as “one of the most wonderful moments I’ve experienced in the concert hall”.

After the concert, the orchestra began looking for the child – and his grandparents eventually got in touch, after initial hesitation due to concerns of reproach.

The moment went viral as a sheer demonstration of the power of music, and the importance of any appreciation of it being allowed to ring loud and clear in the concert hall.

“These sort of moments, like Ronan’s wonderful ‘wow’ moment, are just electrifying for us, and actually just make us realise exactly what we’re here doing,” the orchestra’s Artistic Director, Harry Christophers, tells The Globe.

“We’re here to give people a release from their daily existence,” Christophers continues. “With Ronan, it’s spontaneous, it’s an innocence, it’s just lovely.”

Good Samaritan finds an ingenious way to contact man who lost his wallet,http://brecorder.com/2019/10/16/531468/good-samaritan-finds-an-ingenious-way-to-contact-a-man-who-lost-his-wallet/,"Tim Cameron lost his wallet when he was returning to his home.

He got notification that someone had made four transactions in his account.

A pedestrian came up with a clever idea of contacting Tim Cameron when he found no way to get in touch with Cameron whose wallet he found on the road.

Cameron took to his Twitter handle and wrote that he lost his wallet on his way to home from work. He said his wallet contained no identification, address or his contact number. However, Cameron said that his wallet did have details of his bank account and number through which a 'good Samaritan' got hold of him.

He added that he got notification that someone had made four transactions in his account. When he checked the detail, he saw that in each transaction a person had written him notes. Under each transfer, which allows a reference up to 18 characters, the person who found his wallet had written to him giving Cameron his phone number to contact him as he had found his wallet."
Wisconsin Becomes 12th State to Recognize Indigenous Peoples Day; Students Celebrate with Powwow,http://madison365.com/wisconsin-becomes-12th-state-to-recognize-indigenous-peoples-day-students-celebrate-with-powwow/,"From our content partner, Madison Commons.

After decades of pushing and waiting, indigenous people have scored at least a partial victory: the second Monday in October, still federally recognized as Columbus Day, is now Indigenous Peoples Day in Wisconsin and 11 other states, as well as the District of Columbia. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued an executive order declaring the day last week. Wisconsin is home to 11 federally recognized indigenous nations

Since 1989, national indigenous advocacy groups have been pushing for this alteration, in hopes of repositioning the idea of what it means to be American. Many cities have previously recognized the day, including Madison.

Observances took place across Madison on Monday, including a small powwow at Dejope Residence Hall on the UW campus. The organization leading the event, Wunk Sheek, aims to connect indigenous students with one another and foster positive dialogue surrounding their identity.

The emcee of the event, Dylan Bizhikiins Jennings of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, acknowledged why the formal recognition of the holiday is so impactful.

“It’s a paradigm shift for a lot of people in acknowledging that our indigenous communities have always been here,” said Jennings. “For us, it’s about physically acknowledging this day in a much more substantial way that acknowledges not only the trauma, but also the resiliency of our communities.”

The powwow welcomed folks of all ethnicities and backgrounds in honoring native traditions and culture.

Thundering drums and harmonious vocals filled the Lake Mendota Room as various song and dance groups offered celebratory performances. Spuds flew across the floor as first-timers tried their hand (and head) at the potato dance, in which two people hold a potato between their foreheads while moving in a large circle. A feast lined the walls as natives and non-natives came together for an evening of respect and commemoration — rather than one glamorizing colonization and indigenous erasure in the United States.

Other celebrations across town included community picnics, poetry readings by Iroquois author Louis V. Clark III, statements from Madison’s first Native American alder, Arvina Martin, and more. Sauk County even stretched out the celebration a bit — with a corresponding Day of Restoration, Day of Celebration, and Day of Commemoration with Ho-Chunk basket demonstrations, mural painting, and a flag ceremony.

Folks like Jennings highlight the importance of attending such events, especially among non-native folks, as education and mutual experiences are valuable in recognizing America’s violent past, while still honoring our indigenous population.

“We’re very lucky to come from a state with really rich diversity, as far as tribal communities go,” said Jennings. ”So reaching out to our tribal communities and coming to these public events to learn, to engage, and also to share is one of the best ways to participate in Indigenous Peoples’ Day.”"

"'We should cherish Japan's history-making moment - they deserve it'. Japan deserve to reach the quarter-finals in what is a history-making moment, says World Cup winner Matt Dawson.",https://bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/50034071,"2019 Rugby World Cup Hosts: Japan Dates: 20 September to 2 November Coverage: Full commentary on every game across BBC Radio 5 Live and Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, plus text updates on the BBC Sport website and app.

Japan reaching the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time is a major step forward for world rugby and we have to cherish this history-making moment.

The Brave Blossoms' 28-21 victory over Scotland in Yokohama on Sunday was such an epic game.

They play with such intensity and their ability to handle the ball at such pace takes an incredible amount of accuracy.

In that first half, there would have been few sides able to stop Japan scoring a couple of tries.

I don't think they're going to win the tournament, but I don't think anybody will want to play Japan.

Japan celebrate beating Scotland to reach the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time

I am so pleased for everybody involved that the hosts have qualified from their pool. Not just the team and the squad, but everyone in the country.

I'm pleased for World Rugby. The governing body made exactly the right decision to wait until Typhoon Hagibis had passed to confirm the game was on.

The tournament has been top drawer - one of the most exciting World Cups, if not the most exciting ever - and Japan are putting on an amazing event.

I wouldn't be surprised if there was a little bit of raw emotion coming out in the players during the win over Scotland, and perhaps individually they were hurt by a lot of the media coverage this week.

The focus all of a sudden was whether the tournament would be remembered for the games that were cancelled.

I found it insane that people were trying to belittle the enormity of what was going on. The reality is people have unfortunately died and been injured in a natural disaster and that takes precedence over any kind of sport or game.

It's a game of rugby, get over yourselves and focus on what's important.

Canada's game against Namibia was called off on Sunday morning because of safety concerns, but the players weren't whinging and moaning.

They did something about it and helped with the recovery efforts in Kamaishi.

Sometimes in sport, because of the commerciality and the enormity of it all, we slightly get ahead of ourselves.

Japan deserve it both on and off the pitch to be in the knockout stages.

It would have taken a monumental amount of effort from the players to convince themselves Sunday's game was going to be on when they were sat in the middle of a super typhoon.

The passion and emotion at the game was heightened because the press are asking them constant questions, their friends at home are asking 'have you heard, is it on, is it off?'.

You're going to be told in all the team meetings, 'right, let's focus like the game is going to be on. If it changes fine, but we are preparing this week for the game to be on'.

Off the pitch, it should be a huge inspiration for millions of people watching the way Japan as a country have held themselves.

They have the infrastructure and ability to fix things very quickly after a typhoon. You can only imagine the whole of Yokohama and Tokyo pulling together and saying 'we are going to do whatever it takes to make sure when the world is watching, we are going to deliver'.

Japan will give South Africa a run for their money in the quarter-finals because they play a unique style. Not even the All Blacks play at some of the speed they do.

The way they transition from short-side to wide is phenomenal. They get the ball out wide really quickly from lots of different situations and run on to the ball at pace.

It's very difficult to stop when you have Kenki Fukuoka and Kotaro Matsushima on the wing. They're just electric, not only in the way they finish their tries but with their support lines and the footwork in the forwards, the likes of Isileli Nakajima coming on and picking up the intensity up front.

The players are oozing confidence. Scrum-half Yutaka Nagare ran the show against Scotland. He knew where his team were supposed to play and where the opposition were weak.

Japan are creating their own unique style of rugby that is very difficult to play against, but it takes a monumental amount of fitness and that is probably why they looked a little bit tired in that last 15-20 minutes on Sunday.

They're going to have to rest up and get themselves rehabbed and ready for the weekend.

Expect an upset in the quarter-finals

Japan getting in the quarter-final mix is the story of the tournament so far, but historically at this stage there is an upset.

We remember when Japan shocked South Africa in the pool stage in 2015, but the Springboks were pretty poor and Japan capitalised on an average performance from their opposition.

I don't think South Africa will lose this time because for Japan it is back-to-back massive Test matches after that game against Scotland.

Well-rested and on good form, South Africa will probably be a little bit too strong.

I can't see New Zealand losing against Ireland but it is hard to call Wales versus France and England against Australia.

The Wallabies are yet to perform at this tournament but have plenty in their locker and England, after not playing for two weeks because their pool decider against France was cancelled, could be caught a little bit cold.

If you haven't been involved for two weeks it's quite tricky. England have got a real tough ask to get up to match pace straight away.

You do lots of stuff in training but you haven't necessarily gone through that whole mental preparation as well as the physical preparation.

It's knockout rugby so everything is at stake.

The referees are going to be under more pressure, they'll be a little bit nervous, the players will be a little bit nervous and so will the coaches.

What decisions are going to be made? What will the atmosphere be like? Who is going to feel like they're playing at home? What are the match conditions and the pitch going to be like?

There are so many mitigating circumstances as to whether you win or lose.

It won't just be as simple as saying it will be Wales v South Africa and England v New Zealand in the semi-finals - I think there will be an upset before then.

We have to take World Cup to tier-two nations

USA coach Gary Gold said this week that World Rugby should take the tournament to America in 2027

There are no 'ifs' or 'buts' here, we have to take the World Cup to other countries.

It is not going to be a smooth ride, there are going to be hiccups along the way, but if we want to move rugby into a truly global game and continue to make it great, we are going to have to do it.

Japan have got more of an infrastructure and ability to hold a world tournament than somewhere like New Zealand.

Why are we not thinking about taking it to Argentina or Canada? Or the USA? Give it to these places. Now we've had a go at Asia, why don't we try somewhere else in Europe? Maybe take it to Germany.

Let's absolutely knock it out of the park by making some big decisions that are long-term decisions for the game, like World Rugby did 10 years ago when they gave it to Japan.

This should be just the start, the stepping stone to seriously ramping it up.

"Government plans 1,400km long great 'green wall' of India",http://m.timesofindia.com/india/government-plans-1400km-long-great-green-wall-of-india/articleshow/71496260.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre is mulling an ambitious plan to create a 1,400km long and 5km wide green belt from Gujarat to the Delhi-Haryana border, on the lines of the “Great Green Wall” running through the width of Africa, from Dakar (Senegal) to Djibouti, to combat climate change and desertification .Though the idea is at a nascent stage, it has already generated a lot of excitement among officials in different ministries who believe that the project, if approved, may turn out to be a legacy programme in India’s efforts to deal with land degradation and the eastward march of the Thar desert.They believe the idea of forming a green belt from Porbandar to Panipat will not only help in restoring degraded land through afforestation along the Aravali hill range that spans across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi, but also act as a barrier for dust coming from the deserts in western India and Pakistan.“The idea of creating a huge green belt was part of the agenda of the recently held conference (COP14) of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in India. It, however, could not be taken up there as final clearance is still awaited,” said an official on condition of anonymity.Though the “Great Green Wall” of Africa, mooted almost a decade ago, is still far from reality due to the involvement of many countries in its implementation, India seeks replicate the idea as a national priority under its goal to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.However, no official was willing to speak about the plan on record, saying it would be premature to discuss it before the approval stage.They said the green belt may not be contiguous, but would roughly cover the entire degraded Aravali range through a massive afforestation exercise. Once approved, its implementation will start with degraded forest land with more stretches coming in for restoration after taking farmers (and other private landholders) on board.The Aravali has been identified as one of the key degraded zones to be taken up for greening under India’s target to restore 26 million hectares (mha) of its land. India has, at present, 96.4 mha of degraded land which is 29.3% of the country’s total geographical area (328.7 mha).The desertification and land degradation atlas of India, brought out by the ISRO in 2016, revealed that Gujarat, Rajasthan and Delhi were among states/UT where more than 50% of the total area was degraded land and those under the threat of desertification.“A legacy programme like converting such a huge tract of land as a green belt in high-intensive land-degraded states will be great boost towards meeting India’s target,” said an official. Besides afforestation, water resource management and sustainable farm practices are other ways to restore degraded land.On Africa’s Great Green Wall , African countries had during the COP14 last month sought global support in terms of finance to make it a reality in the continent’s Sahel region by 2030. The project was launched by the African Union a decade ago with the support of many partners including UNCCD, World Bank and the European Commission.So far, work on nearly 15% of the wall is under way.Besides the African efforts to implement the project, the COP14 had also seen announcements of a similar initiative — called Peace Forest Initiative (PFI) — to develop forests in conflict areas between two countries, including the demilitarised zone of South and North Korea. The PFI got its inspiration from the Peace Park between Peru and Ecuador.Read this story in Bengali"

Abraham & Mount on target in impressive Chelsea win. Tammy Abraham scores his eighth league goal of the season as in-form Chelsea sweep aside Southampton at St Mary's to climb to fifth in the Premier League.,https://bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49868086,"Maya Yoshida was unable to prevent Tammy Abraham's early strike from crossing the line

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard says his Blues side can get ""a lot better"" after they swept past Southampton to move up to fifth in the Premier League.

Tammy Abraham's looping finish from Callum Hudson-Odoi's pass gave the visitors the lead, before Mason Mount doubled Chelsea's advantage from close range.

Danny Ings reduced the arrears from Yan Valery's cut-back, but N'Golo Kante's deflected effort off Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Michy Batshuayi's neat finish put the seal on a comfortable victory for Lampard's side.

""I didn't think we started that well, even though doing so had been something we'd talked about before,"" said the former England midfielder. ""[Abraham's] goal came at the right time and after that I felt pretty comfortable.

""Getting four away from home - we're scoring - so it's a nice afternoon.

""Let's not get carried away, it's a long season and we feel we might have picked up more points than we've actually got. We've not been at our absolute best and we can be a lot better.

""We shouldn't be sloppy, and after going 2-0 up we should make it 3-0. We're scoring goals, but can we tighten up? Yes.""

Plain sailing for in-form Blues

After a stuttering start to the campaign, there are signs that this youthful Chelsea side are beginning to build up a head of steam under Lampard.

This was the Blues' fourth successive win in all competitions - a result which lifts them level on points with fourth-placed Leicester City and only two behind champions Manchester City, who lost 2-0 at home to Wolves.

Youngsters Abraham and Mount have taken the top flight by storm after spending last season on loan at Aston Villa and Derby County respectively, and the duo were heavily involved here as the visitors raced into an early lead.

Hudson-Odoi - making his first league start under Lampard - sent a long ball over the top of the Southampton defence and Abraham was first to it, his looping finish over Gunn crossing the line before Yoshida could clear the ball to safety.

Chelsea capitalised on a poor piece of Southampton defending to double their lead seven minutes later, Mount latching on to Willian's precise pass before slamming home his fourth goal of the campaign.

There appeared to be no way back for the Saints at that stage as Chelsea continued to lay siege to the home goal, but Ralph Hasenhuttl's side pulled a goal back out of nothing when Valery wriggled his way past several Blues defenders before setting up Ings, who was left with an easy finish.

There was an element of fortune about Chelsea's third - Kante's speculative drive deflecting off Hojbjerg and wrong-footing Gunn - but the dominant visitors could have won by a higher margin.

Hudson-Odoi was thwarted by Gunn four minutes after the restart, before Batshuayi eventually completed the scoring in the final minute of normal time with a confident finish from Christian Pulisic's through-ball.

""It's a transitional team but we don't have that in our heads,"" Mount told Match of the Day afterwards. ""We want to get as high in the table as we can.

""A lot of the young boys around us have played together for a long time. It's good having these boys around you in the senior team - it's a massive achievement and now we're looking forward to the international break.""

Sloppy Saints leave Hasenhuttl with plenty to ponder

The last time Southampton suffered five defeats in their opening eight league games, they were relegated from the Premier League.

Hasenhuttl reverted to a four-man defence at St Mary's, with Ryan Bertrand dropping to left-back and Yan Valery replacing the absent Jannik Vestergaard.

The tactical switch did little to solidify the Saints' rearguard, however. Nathan Redmond sent a dipping effort inches over Kepa Arrizabalaga's crossbar within the opening minute, but it proved to be a false dawn for the hosts as Chelsea quickly gained a stranglehold on proceedings.

Southampton were culpable in their own downfall, giving the ball away on numerous occasions in the first half in particular. Indeed, it was Jan Bednarek's poor header to Oriol Romeu which gifted Chelsea possession in the build-up to Mount's goal.

Ings' clinical finish from Valery's cut-back appeared to spark the hosts briefly into life. Redmond fired into the side-netting from a tight angle and Ings also had a goal-bound effort blocked, but their self-belief drained away with Kante's deflected effort shortly before the break.

With games against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Leicester City and Manchester City coming up, it is hard to see where Southampton's next victory is going to come from.

Man of the match - Jorginho (Chelsea)

No other player on the St Mary's pitch won back possession more frequently than Chelsea midfielder Jorginho, who also completed 86% of his attempted passes in the opposition half

No home comforts for Southampton - the stats

Southampton have lost three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2018, under Mark Hughes.

Chelsea have won each of their last four games in all competitions, equalling the longest win streak of Frank Lampard's managerial career to date (four games in August-September 2018 with Derby).

This was Southampton's heaviest defeat in a home Premier League game under Ralph Hasenhuttl. Indeed, the last time they lost by three or more goals in a home game in the competition was also against Chelsea (0-3 in October 2018).

Chelsea have scored three or more goals in three consecutive Premier League away games for the first time since August 2009.

Southampton have won just one point in Premier League home games this season (P4 W0 D1 L3) - the fewest in their opening four home games of a top-flight campaign since 2001-02 (also one point).

Tammy Abraham has scored nine goals for Chelsea across all competitions in 2019-20, the joint-most of any current Premier League player (along with Raheem Sterling).

No player in the top four tiers of English football has scored more league goals than Chelsea's Tammy Abraham in 2019 (20 - joint-most with Sergio Aguero, Teemu Pukki and James Collins).

Chelsea's Mason Mount has scored three goals in four away appearances in the Premier League this season, as many as he managed in 20 away league games under Frank Lampard at Derby last season (including play-offs).

'We can be a lot better' - what the managers said

Confidence is a problem at Saints - Hasenhuttl

Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We started well but to be honest we are far away from our best, and against the best opponents you only have the chance to take something if you play your best.

""We were too slow in our minds, too slow on the ball. They showed us every weakness we had and we have a lot of them at the moment.

""When they build up from behind and score we must say 'OK', but to give the chances we did against such an opponent, you cannot handle it. That was the reason we were 3-1 down in the first half. Second half was a little better but not really, we never had the chance to come back.

""We know it is a tough situation, but we must work really hard and that's what we will do.""

Southampton 1-4 Chelsea: Frank Lampard says his in-form team can get even better

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard, speaking to Match of the Day: ""Tammy's performance was great, his all-round performance and his work off the ball. But I must say, I thought Willian was immense - he was an example in what he was doing on and off the ball. He's a leader - not one that shouts - but in how he performs.""

On Callum Hudson-Odoi: ""I liked a lot of the stuff he did, there's competition in those wide areas now. I thought it was a really good performance, really bright stuff. I'm disappointed he didn't get his goal.""

What's next?

Southampton travel to Wolves in their first game after the international break on Saturday, 19 October (kick-off 15:00 BST), while Chelsea welcome Newcastle United to Stamford Bridge at the same time."
Forgiveness is a powerful thing,http://christianchronicle.org/i-love-you-as-a-person-and-i-dont-wish-anything-bad-on-you/,"Botham Jean's brother asked the judge for permission to hug Amber Guyger in the courtroom after sentencing.

It was an unexpected moment in the courtroom following the sentencing of Amber Guyger Wednesday afternoon.

“I forgive you, and I know if you go to God and ask him, he will forgive you.”

During a statement to the court, Botham Jean’s younger brother, Brandt, 18, asked the judge for permission to hug Amber Guyger.

Just before the request, he offered forgiveness to the woman now convicted of murdering his brother.

“I speak for myself,” he said. “I forgive you, and I know if you go to God and ask him, he will forgive you.”

He went on to tell Guyger he loves her as a person.

“I wasn’t going to say this in front of my family or anyone, but I don’t even want you to go to jail,” he said. “I want the best for you, because I know that’s what Botham would want … and the best would be to give your life to Christ. I love you as a person, and I don’t wish anything bad on you.”

“I want the best for you, because I know that’s what Botham would want.”

He then turned to Judge Tammy Kemp and said, “I don’t know if this is possible, but can I give her a hug? Please?”

Judge Kemp said, “Yes.”

Guyger and Brandt Jean then approached each other and embraced in a long, emotional hug.

It appeared they briefly spoke to each other as they embraced.

The touching moment was followed by audible sounds of crying from those watching within the courtroom.

There had been protesting outside of the courtroom following the announcement that Guyger would serve 10 years in prison.

However, reporters on the scene say the moment between Brandt Jean and Guyger seemed to change the mood of the crowd.

CBS 11 reports:

Pickett (a CBS 11 reporter) said individuals reacting outside the courtroom, showing passion and anger, changed considerably as they appeared to honor and respect the voice of Jean’s younger brother.

Guyger was found guilty Tuesday of murdering Harding University graduate and Dallas West Church of Christ member Botham Jean. Wednesday, the jury recommended a 10 year sentence for Guyger.

At the end of the sentencing, the judge hugged Amber Guyger before addressing the Jean family.

The Dallas Morning News reports about the hug:

As the two women embraced, Guyger whispered in her ear. Kemp responded loud enough for the few remaining in the courtroom to hear.

“Ma’am, it’s not because I am good,” the judge said. “It’s because I believe in Christ. None of us are worthy.

“Forgive yourself.”

Kemp told Guyger to start reading the Bible, telling her to take the one she was reading from. She turned to defense attorney Robert Rogers and told him she was bringing Guyger a study Bible on Thursday.

Allison Jean, the victim’s mother, spoke to the media following the closing of the trial. She said while she will be leaving Dallas soon, she hopes that this trial brings about positive change.

“The corruption that we saw during this process must stop, and it must stop for you,” Jean said. “Our lives must move on, but our lives must move on with change. There’s got to be a better day, and that better day starts with every one of us.”"
Willian volley gives Chelsea win at Lille. Willian's excellent second-half volley gives Chelsea victory over Lille in their second Champions League group stage match in France.,https://bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49874331,"Last updated on .From the section Champions League

Chelsea named four players in the starting line-up aged 22 or younger

Willian's excellent second-half volley gave Chelsea victory over Lille in their second Champions League group stage match in France.

The Brazilian put away substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi's cross in the 77th minute after Victor Osimhen had cancelled out Tammy Abraham's opener.

Chelsea sit third in Group H following Ajax's 3-0 win over Valencia.

However, they have kept just one clean sheet in 11 games under manager Frank Lampard, and none away from home.

The Blues lined up in a 3-4-2-1 formation as Lampard handed starts to 19-year-old Reece James and Fikayo Tomori, 21.

Both impressed but Lille were a threat throughout, and came close on several occasions in the second half.

Goalscorer Osimhen, bought as a summer replacement for Arsenal-bound Nicolas Pepe, caused problems in the air and it was his header which brought Lille level only 11 minutes after Abraham had given Chelsea the lead.

Benjamin Andre's header was tipped past the post by Kepa Arrizabalaga, and the Chelsea keeper had a couple of nervous moments when he was forced to come out to the edge of the box to stop quick counter-attacks.

But Chelsea were the better side and deserved victory - Jorginho smacked the outside of the right post with a curling effort in the first half and Mason Mount was denied from close range after the break.

Abraham fighting for England spot

Abraham has scored eight goals in 10 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea this season

It was another test for Chelsea's young squad, with four players in the starting XI who had played in the Championship last season.

Abraham, who turned 22 on Wednesday, was one of those, having spent 2018-19 on loan at Aston Villa.

He has impressed hugely since his return to Stamford Bridge, netting seven goals in as many Premier League games and picking up an assist in the Uefa Super Cup defeat by Liverpool.

And he was on the scoresheet again in France, bringing down Tomori's diagonal cross with an exquisite touch before sorting out his feet and coolly slotting into the bottom right corner.

It was the first time since March 2012 that two Englishmen combined to score in the Champions League for Chelsea - the last when current boss Lampard set up John Terry - and Abraham will be hoping for a call-up to his country's senior side when the squad is named on Thursday.

James became the first teenager to start for Chelsea in the Champions League since Ruben Loftus-Cheek in 2015 and was a threat from right wing-back - delivering dangerous crosses and using his pace to exploit the space in behind.

And Tomori was excellent at the back, while also recording his assist.

Willian's experience proves decisive

In a season where Chelsea's youngsters have impressed, it was 31-year-old Willian who provided the quality needed to win in Europe.

The technique in his volley was exquisite as he watched 18-year-old Hudson-Odoi's cross fly onto his boot before he fired it into the ground and over the keeper.

The goal was his first in Europe since March, and his second in the space of five days after he netted against Brighton at Stamford Bridge.

It had taken him eight months to score in the Premier League, but he finished with a game-high six shots against the Seagulls.

Willian was a threat all evening in France too, whipping in dangerous crosses for Mount and Abraham before eventually scoring the winner.

""It's never an easy place to play and Willian scores a worldie - no surprise there,"" Abraham told BT Sport.

Man of the match - Willian

Willian's goal was his 18th in the Champions League. He is the ninth Brazilian to reach this landmark

'Tomori was outstanding'

Chelsea boss Frank Lampard on BT Sport: ""It feels really good. This was a really hard place to come, added to the pressure of not beating Valencia. And it was the first time for a few travelling in Europe.

""Tomori was outstanding again. He has to keep on with that. Now Ajax have set their stall out in the group. This gives us confidence and points. Now the hard work begins.""

Abraham is a man in form - best of the stats

Chelsea ended a run of four games without a Champions League win (D2 L2), picking up their first victory in the competition since November 2017 (4-0 v Qarabag).

Lille are winless in their last nine home Champions League games (D3 L6), losing each of their last four.

In the 68 games that Frank Lampard has managed Derby and Chelsea in all competitions, his teams have only kept a clean sheet in 22% of their matches (15 out of 68).

Across all competitions, only Manchester City's Raheem Sterling (nine) has scored more goals for an English club than Chelsea's Abraham (eight) in 2019-20.

Since making his Champions League debut for Chelsea in September 2013, Willian has been directly involved in more goals than any other player for the club (15 - 10 goals and five assists)."
This couple envisioned a fall wedding. They got a winter wonderland instead and it turned out awesome.,http://tampabay.com/news/nation-world/2019/10/01/this-couple-envisioned-a-fall-wedding-it-got-a-winter-wonderland-instead/,"The wind was so strong, it blew the bride’s veil off her head. Her hair became so drenched, it had to be re-done three times.

One of the bridesmaids fell and did a faceplant into the snow.

And yet, they wouldn’t change a thing.

When an unseasonal snowstorm showed up as an uninvited guest at their fall wedding Saturday near Spokane, Wash., Brittany and Sean Tuohy and photographer Jaime Fletcher made the best of a frigid situation.

The photos, meant to celebrate autumn and their love for one another, are more breathtaking than those on any winter holiday card.

“I envisioned a fall wedding,” Brittany said, “and I got a winter wonderland.”

Brittany, 29, and Sean, 32, live in Fort Mohave, Ariz. For their wedding, they wanted to return home to Spokane, where they met 11 years ago, for a fall ceremony.

Brittany remembered a friend’s wedding at Bear Creek Lodge & Event Center, at the entrance to Mt. Spokane State Park, and pictured something similar. Sun in the sky. Temperatures in the 70s. Dinner and reception outside. An open, grassy area with trees in the background as the perfect setting for fall photos.

“I envisioned her wedding,"" Brittany said. “I fell in love with her wedding.”

After nearly a year of planning, Brittany checked the weather daily over the past few months. It fluctuated between the 60s and 70s.

But about a week before the wedding, she started hearing about storms in the northwest. She first worried about rain, then heard a news report about 18 to 36 inches of snow on the way.

The day of the wedding, snow started falling around 3 a.m. The couple awoke to find snow on the roofs but nothing had yet accumulated on the ground. It continued to fall throughout the day, growing thicker and thicker.

At the time of the reception, there was about a foot of snow on the ground. Before the day was over, it would pile close to 2 feet.

This wasn’t supposed to happen. Spokane’s last recorded September snow was in 1926.

Brittany was prepared for temperatures in the 50s, maybe even the 30s. But it was colder still. Twenty-six degrees, with 30 mile-per-hour winds, according to photographer Jaime Fletcher.

“We haven’t ever seen snow like that,” she said.

The lodge was about a 20-minute drive up the mountain. Trees were down, and about 15 to 20 guests were unable to make it, due to the weather.

When Jaime arrived at the site, she dreaded going inside. Brittany’s maid-of-honor had connected her with Brittany, and they had spoken numerous times over the phone. But this would be their first face-to-face meeting.

“I imagined the bride was going to be in tears,” Jaime said. “But when I walked in, she was laughing.”

Brittany attributed the weather to her bad luck. When she and Sean went camping on their first date, his 4-wheeler broke down and they had to spend the night in the woods because they weren’t sure how to get back to camp. It’s also why they wanted to get married in the mountains. It’s where they met, and they’ve skied there, as well.

She just didn’t expect weather suited for skiing on her wedding day.

The ceremony was moved inside, with guests sitting at the same tables they would have for the reception. An aisle was laid down between the tables.

But Brittany and Jaime still wanted to try to shoot photos of the wedding party outside.

“We have to suck it up for the photos,” Brittany told her bridesmaids.

She got some funny looks, but the wedding party — warmed by beers, Jaime said — took everything in stride, despite the fog, freezing temperatures and swirling winds.

Jaime threw a scarf over her head and cameras and stepped out into the cold. She didn’t have time to change the lighting, since the snow was coming down too hard.

The shoot was over in 10 minutes.

By the end, the wedding party — cold and tired and wet — was joking about going sledding.

“Everybody was just super,” Jaime said. “They thought it was funny. That’s why they’re laughing in all the pictures.”

Brittany and Sean were easy-going and comfortable around each other, Jaime said. They interacted like best friends, Jaime noting how Sean carefully covered Brittany’s hair before she went outside and noticed when she had snow on her eyelashes.

“They were just very sweet and accommodating to each other,” she said. “It was really sweet to see how sweet they were with each other.”

Brittany’s favorite photos are one where the wind catches her veil just perfectly, gently lifting it off her neck, and another shot from behind the couple in the street. Sean likes one where Brittany is looking at the camera, and he is looking at Brittany.

“You can see the chaos in (the photos),” Brittany said, “but how beautiful it is kind of made up for it.”

Brittany and Sean will get to experience the fall weather that escaped their wedding during their honeymoon in Europe. They plan to spend about four days at Oktoberfest in Germany and then a day and a half in London before returning home. Brittany packed a dirndl dress for the occasion. Sean will wear Lederhosen.

As she thought back to her wedding day, Brittany recalled how perfectly everything worked out. The hues of the bridesmaid’s dresses — fall colors, she once thought — blended well with the wintry background. The cowboy boots worn by the wedding party and long-sleeved dresses on the flower girls were equally suited to the cold weather.

It was almost as if she’d planned for it.

“A few years back, I told my friends I wanted a winter wedding,” Brittany said. “A lot of times you don’t get snow. But it turns out, I guess, subconsciously, I planned for it. Mother Nature just knew, and I got my winter wedding.""

Christina Vithoulkas became a paraplegic after crashing her motorbike during a jump in September 2018 She has defied doctors' expectations and has been back riding a two-wheel motorcycle

She has defied doctors' expectations and has been back riding a two-wheel motorcycle Ms Vithoulkas has been sharing her positive attitude with students

In an instant she became a paraplegic, with complete loss of movement and feeling below her T5 vertebrae.

Ms Vithoulkas's injury left her unable to walk again and needing help with some of the most basic, everyday tasks.

But the love of family, friends, and complete strangers has given her a new perspective on life, and remarkably, it has made the 24-year-old a happier person.

She said she often found herself curbing her positivity because she knew people would find her perspective hard to believe.

""It's hard when people ask me [how I am],"" Ms Vithoulkas said.

""I hold back because I don't think they will believe me, that I'm doing better now than I was before my accident.""

Christina Vithoulkas loved the feeling of riding and competed at both local and state levels before her accident. ( Supplied: Grant Schwartzkopff )

Back in September, Ms Vithoulkas had been motorcycle riding for five years, competing in local and state motocross titles before becoming one of Australia's first female freestyle riders.

She said she had no regrets about competing in the sport she loves.

""I know it sounds stupid, but I wouldn't take all of it back if I knew I was going to be paralysed,"" she said.

Breaking down stereotypes

Ms Vithoulkas has been keen to show others that having a spinal injury was not the end of the world, trying to break the stigma by speaking candidly about details of her life as a paraplegic.

After her accident, Ms Vithoulkas returned to her childhood home of Barmera in the Riverland region of South Australia.

She has used her YouTube and Instagram accounts to answer questions about topics including how she dresses and undresses, toileting, and even about her sex life and ability to have children.

She was also invited to address students at her former school, Glossop High, to share her experiences.

""I feel like if I can share [the details] and it can make them feel more comfortable, it's worth it,"" she said.

""I've had people message me to say one of their best mates is paralysed and I've helped them understand what their friend goes through.""

She said she hoped that young people who see her enjoying life, despite losing her independence, would encourage students to believe they could also overcome challenges.

""I feel like if I can get through this, the kids — if they are going through a rough patch — they can get through it too,"" Ms Vithoulkas said.

""It's important for people to be able to spread hope to others.

""Some people just need that one person in their life and they can change.""

The day that changed her life forever

Ms Vithoulkas said she could clearly remember the jump that cost her the use of her legs.

""On my very first jump as I left the ramp I went a bit slower than I should have,"" she said.

""The back of my bike hit the top of the table top which threw my legs up.""

Christina Vithoulkas is passionate about motorbike riding and has no regrets. ( Supplied: Grant Schwartzkopff )

She crashed her bike and landed on her head and shoulders as her body ""folded in half"".

Ms Vithoulkas said she knew immediately that her injuries were permanent.

""I sat there for a few minutes trying to accept the fact that I was going to live in a wheelchair for the rest of my life,"" she said.

The crash followed an accident only nine months earlier which had left her with a compressed T6 vertebrae.

She stopped performing jumps for a while after that — believing it was not worth the risk of further injury — but found she had lost her zest for life without the adrenaline of freestyle riding.

""You've got to think about the best day of your life. Would you want to get rid of that?"" Ms Vithoulkas said.

""I'm 100 per cent truthful when I say I don't regret any of it [freestyle riding].

""It gave me so much joy [and] I grew so much as a person.""

Dream of returning to competitive riding

After the accident, doctors told Ms Vithoulkas that she would also never be able to ride a two-wheel motorbike again and suggested she should move to a city to be closer to medical services.

""I just love to prove them wrong, that I can live my normal life. Just a bit differently,"" she said.

Already Ms Vithoulkas has been back on a two-wheel bike thanks to a specialist frame being installed to protect her legs.

It has been the first step in her dream to return to the sport competitively.

Gold Coast rider Andy Hensel and United States rider Bruce Cook have proved it is possible to return to freestyle riding after becoming a paraplegic.

Now Ms Vithoulkas said she wants to become the first female paraplegic motocross rider in Australia.

""Whether it takes me two years, five years, or 10 years, that's my goal. I would love to go back out there and race,"" she said."
"Jose Jose, one of Mexico's most-loved voices, dies at 71. Mexican singer Jose Jose, whose powerful, romantic ballads captivated Latin America for more than half a century, died on Saturday.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mexico-josejose/jose-jose-one-of-mexicos-most-loved-voices-dies-at-71-idUKKBN1WD0OL,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican singer Jose Jose, whose powerful, romantic ballads captivated Latin America for more than half a century, died on Saturday.

FILE PHOTO: Mexican singer Jose' Jose' is interviewed at the 2005 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year event honoring him, in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. November 1, 2005. REUTERS/Chris Pizzello/File Photo

Mexico’s Culture Ministry expressed its condolences in a statement, calling Jose Jose, whose real name was Jose Romulo Sosa Ortiz, “one of Mexico’s most loved voices.”

Jose Jose received several Grammy nominations, sold more than 250 million albums and was once courted by music legend Frank Sinatra, who wanted to win him for his own label.

He is often considered Mexico’s most successful singer and was also an occasional actor.

“It is sad, his passing,” Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters. Mexico City residents gathered for an impromptu tribute at a statue of the singer, laying wreaths, and singing his songs. Some were in tears.

“The Prince of Song,” as the Mexican was affectionately called by his fans, was born into a family of musicians and raised in Mexico City.

Son of tenor Jose Sosa Esquivel and pianist Margarita Ortiz Pensado, Jose Jose began his musical career as a child: he debuted in school choir and in 1963 formed a musical trio formally starting his career at age 15.

Slideshow ( 3 images )

Initially, he appeared in nightclubs and even formed a jazz and bossa nova group in which he played the double bass; later, he scored a contract with the Mexican subsidiary of the international label RCA Victor.

In 1969, he released his first album under the pseudonym of “Jose Jose.” The singer said later that his artistic name was inspired by the name of his father, who died in 1968 of alcoholism.

Jose Jose conquered the Spanish-speaking world with the interpretation of “El Triste” at the 1970 Latin Song Festival that took place in the Mexican capital. It became the performance that catapulted him to stardom.

The sudden fame also brought negative consequences. Like his father, he fell into alcoholism and had to take some time out. He returned to the stage in 1971, but continued to suffer from alcoholism for 30 more years.

The 1980s became the most successful decade of his career, during which he sold two million copies of his album “Secrets” in just a few weeks while also making his debut in the cinema.

But his dipsomania and lack of rest irreparably damaged his vocal cords, forcing him to undergo several operations that failed to restore them. In 2007, he also suffered a facial paralysis.

As a result of his alcohol addiction, Jose Jose’s health deteriorated rapidly since the 1990s. Even so, supported by his wife, Cuban Sarita Salazar, Jose Jose recovered and continued his career. In recent years he gained a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Mexican broadcaster Televisa reported the singer died in Miami at 71 after complications following treatment for pancreatic cancer. Two years ago he announced that he had a tumor in the pancreas that was being treated with chemotherapy.

Many of his works inspired a younger generation of artists and musicians, including Latin pop star Julio Iglesias, who interpreted Jose Jose’s first big hit “The Ship of Oblivion.”

otters are so cute,http://sciencemag.org/news/2019/09/unlikely-savior-california-s-coastal-ecosystems-orphaned-sea-otters,"An unlikely savior for California’s coastal ecosystems: orphaned sea otters

Stranded or orphaned baby sea otters have been given a new lease on life—and a mission: restoring damaged ecosystems along the California coast.

Sea otters are a keystone species in their native coastal environments. They prey on small herbivorous sea creatures like sea urchins, which can lead to more kelp and healthier seagrass in an area. But after being hunted for their fur to near extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries, otter populations along the California coast are still struggling. Restoring populations is not as simple as bringing in new otters, though. The animals often have strong ties to their homes, and some relocated otters have made journeys of more than 100 kilometers to return to their birthplaces.

To solve this problem, scientists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California created the sea otter surrogacy program in 2002. So far, they have rescued 37 stranded or orphaned otters, many of which were suffering from dehydration or hypothermia. The researchers placed the pups with surrogate mothers—captive female otters at the aquarium—until they fully recovered. When the pups were 6 months to 1 year old (the typical age an otter is weaned), the researchers released them into Elkhorn Slough (shown above), a tidal wetland about 1.5 hours south of San Francisco, California. Because the orphaned otters were very young when they were rescued, they did not have strong ties to their home ranges and most thrived in the new environment, the researchers report today in Oryx–The International Journal of Conservation .

Computer models showed that the populations had increased exponentially thanks to the new otters as well as the natural migration of otters from other communities. The models suggested the surrogate-raised otters and their offspring were responsible for more than 50% of the population growth over the study period. As the otter population grew, eelgrass and other native species thrived. The researchers say similar efforts could help restore degraded ecosystems along the California coast—and keep aquariums stocked with adorable otter pups."

Want Less Stress? Try Kindness

Researchers say helping others is calming, life extending, and just feels great

You’ve tried it all. From deep breathing, to taking a nap, to venting to your friends, and yet you still feel stressed.

Why not try a little kindness?

Stress seems to be an epidemic these days. And if we’re not careful, today’s stress can become tomorrow’s anxiety, depression, or worse. But as we seek ways to help ourselves, perhaps the solution actually lies in helping others.

It turns out that when we put our own troubles aside and focus our energy on being kind and helping others, our stress levels decrease. Kindness positively impacts hormonal levels in our bodies, leading to both mental and physical health benefits.

For example, those who strive to be kind have 23 percent less cortisol (the stress hormone) and age slower than the average population. Kindness also stimulates the production of serotonin (the feel-good hormone), helping calm the mind and elevate mood.

Not only do stress levels decrease, but so does blood pressure and pain level. Being kind to others releases chemicals like endorphins and oxytocin. Oxytocin dilates blood vessels, which in turn helps decrease blood pressure, while endorphins act as our body’s natural pain killers.

And if you’re feeling a little sluggish, try spreading some kindness for a natural energy boost.

One study reported about half the study participants felt stronger and more energetic after helping others, with many participants saying they felt calmer, less depressed, or had greater feelings of self-worth.

A Yale University study published in Clinical Psychological Science found that even basic politeness helps to decrease stress levels. Participants were asked to track how often they performed prosocial behaviors every day over a two week period. Performing behaviors as simple as asking someone if they need help, or opening the door for someone, led participants to rate their mood as more positive when compared to days when they were not as helpful. The authors point out that “[These] results suggest that even brief periods of supporting or helping others might help to mitigate the negative emotional effects of daily stress.”

And what better way to help others than by doing volunteer work? Studies show that those who volunteer reap just as many benefits as those they are helping.

Research finds people 55 and older who volunteer for two or more organizations are less likely to die early, a staggering 44 percent less likely.

But when helping others, it turns out that motives matter. A study published in Health Psychology found that people who volunteer with some regularity live longer, but it’s interesting to note that these benefits were seen only if they were volunteering to truly help others, rather than to make themselves feel better or look good to others. In other words, their motives had to be altruistic rather than self-serving.

So what if we find ourselves a little rusty at flexing our kindness muscle? Don’t despair. Kindness can be learned.

“It’s kind of like weight training; we found that people can actually build up their compassion ‘muscle’ and respond to others’ suffering with care and a desire to help,” Helen Weng, a graduate student in clinical psychology and lead author, wrote in a 2013 paper on the brain and compassion.

And the great thing is, kindness is contagious. Good deeds catch on like a yawn, which means kindness in a crowd can spread like ripples through a pond.

Why not give it a try? Just one act of kindness can make the difference between a good day and a bad day. So make it a good day, not just for yourself, but for the person you’re helping and those witnessing your kindness.

In the words of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, the purpose of life is “To serve others and do good.” If research is any indication, acts of kindness and serving others may also be the recipe for combating stress and maintaining good health.

"'Chernobyl,' 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,' 'Fleabag' haul in Emmys. Female-driven comedies ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" and ""Fleabag"" dominated the early awards at the Emmys on Sunday, picking up five statuettes for their stars and writers.",https://reuters.com/article/us-awards-emmys/chernobyl-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-fleabag-haul-in-emmys-idUSKBN1W70FF,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Medieval drama “Game of Thrones” closed its run with a fourth Emmy award for best drama series while British comedy “Fleabag” was the upset winner for best comedy series on Sunday on a night that rewarded newcomers over old favorites.

Billy Porter, the star of LGBTQ series “Pose,” became the first openly gay black man to win a best dramatic actor Emmy, while British newcomer Jodie Comer took the Emmy for her lead actress role as a psychotic assassin in the quirky BBC America drama “Killing Eve.”

“I am so overjoyed to have lived long enough to see this day,” said Porter, 50, crowning a standout year in which he made waves on red carpets at the Oscars and the Met Gala for his gender-fluid outfits.

The Emmys are Hollywood’s top honors in television, and the night belonged to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the star and creator of Amazon Studios’ “Fleabag” who also created “Killing Eve.”

Waller-Bridge took the trophy for best comedy actress, beating out six-time “Veep” actress winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus as well as last year’s Emmy champ Rachel Brosnahan for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” Waller-Bridge also won an Emmy for comedy writing.

“This is just getting ridiculous!,” Waller-Bridge said as she accepted the comedy series Emmy.

“It’s really wonderful to know, and reassuring, that a dirty, pervy, angry, messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys,” Waller-Bridge added.

Already the most-awarded series in Emmy history with 38 wins, HBO’s “Game of Thrones” went into Sunday’s awards show as the clear front runner, despite a fan uproar over the conclusion of the series.

It emerged from the Emmys with a leading 12 wins, with Soviet nuclear accident drama “Chernobyl” taking 10 and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” winning eight, including for supporting actors Tony Shalhoub and Alex Borstein.

‘FIRE AND ICE’

Among networks, HBO won 34 Emmys overall, followed by Netflix with 27.

“These last 10 years have been the best years of our lives,” “Game of Thrones” co-creator David Benioff said.

“I can’t believe we finished it, I can’t believe we did it. We did it all together and it’s over, and we shall never see your like again,” he added.

Peter Dinklage was the only one of the nine nominated “Game of Thrones” actors to win, for his supporting role as Tyrion Lannister.

“We literally walked through fire and ice for you, and I would do it all again in a heartbeat,” Dinklage said, thanking Benioff and co-creator D.B. Weiss.

In the closely contested limited series category, the Television Academy spread its honors among “Chernobyl,” wrenching social justice drama “When They See Us” and “Fosse/Verdon,” starring Michelle Williams as Broadway singer and dancer Gwen Verdon.

Williams used her acceptance speech to thank the FX network and make an impassioned plea for pay equity in Hollywood.

“They (FX) understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their inherent value, and where do they put that value? They put it into their work,” Williams said.

Newcomer Jharrel Jerome was named best actor for “When They See Us,” the Netflix dramatization of the men known as the Central Park Five who were wrongly accused and imprisoned for rape in 1980s New York.

Jerome dedicated his honor to “the men we know as the exonerated five,” and the five men, seated in the audiences, stood and pumped their fists.

Other first time Emmy winners included Julia Garner for drug trafficking thriller “Ozark,” British actor Ben Whishaw for “A Very English Scandal,” and Jesse Armstrong, the creator of media conglomerate family drama “Succession.”"

"Reading, a relatively new skill for humans, can peacefully coexist with an ancient skill like observing the world, instead of competing with it for brainpower: ""We found that literacy enhances responses to other visual input in early visual areas and enhances representational similarity.""",http://inverse.com/article/59385-learn-to-read-brain-changes,"Conventional wisdom says that brain space is like Manhattan real estate: limited and extremely valuable. In turn, researchers have suspected that certain activities that are processed in the brain, like learning to read or observing a person’s face, compete for that precious headspace.

However, this study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances argues that the opposite occurs. Reading, a relatively new skill for humans, can peacefully coexist with an ancient skill like observing the world, instead of competing with it for brainpower. Acquiring literacy actually enhances the brain’s ability to visually process non-language stimuli, like faces, houses, or tools.

Lead by Falk Huettig, Ph.D., a senior investigator at the Max Planck Institute and Professor of Psycholinguistics and Cultural Cognition at Radboud University Nijmegen, and Alexis Hervais-Adelman, Ph.D., head of the Neurolinguistics Division at the Psychology Institute of the University of Zurich, the researchers say that learning to read is good for the brain, regardless of whatever you’re actually reading.

As humans learn to read, a brain region called the “visual word form area” (VWFA) becomes sensitive to letters or characters. Previous studies suggested that developing the VWFA takes up space otherwise available for processing visual information linked to objects. However, Huettig explained Wednesday that “far from cannibalizing the territory of its neighbors, the visual word form area (VWFA) is rather overlaid upon these, remaining responsive to other visual categories.”

“Thus learning to read is good for you,” Huettig continues. “It sharpens visual brain responses beyond reading, and has a general positive impact on your visual system.”

To determine how reading positively affected the brain’s visual system, Huettig and colleagues scanned the brains of over 90 adults living in Northern India with varying degrees of literacy. Twenty-nine of these participants were illiterate, and between the ages of 23 to 39. After recruitment, the participants were invited to take part in a six-month literacy training program, where they learned basic reading and writing skills in Devanagari, the writing system for Hindi.

Subsequently, their brains were analyzed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During these scans, participants were shown sentences, letters, and other visual categories, such as faces. The goal was to see whether or not their brains had changed since learning to read — and whether or not those changes altered other parts of their brain.

The other participants in the study included those who were also illiterate and did not receive literacy training, as well as a third group of established readers. These two groups also had their brains scanned and served as a point of comparison to the illiterate group.

Ultimately, the team found that the brains of the once-illiterate individuals, after they learned to read, changed. There was increased activity in a network incorporating various parts of the brain: the occipital lobe, ventral visual areas, inferior parietal, premotor, and supplementary motor regions. These are the same regions that are also activated when an individual observes visual objects.

“When we learn to read, we exploit the brain’s capacity to form category-selective patches in visual brain areas,” Hervais-Adelman explains. “These arise in the same cortical territory as specializations for other categories that are important to people, such as faces and houses.”

Essentially, learning to read did not make participants worse at processing non-word objects — it actually improved that ability.

This study supports the notion that learning to read recycles existing mechanisms for processing objects, rather than destroying them and adds to the growing knowledge about the neural bases for reading.

Reading, and other mentally challenging leisure activities, have been shown to help the aged stay sharp, increase empathy, and lead to more white brain matter in young children, which improves communication in the brain.

Abstract:

Learning to read is associated with the appearance of an orthographically sensitive brain region known as the visual word form area. It has been claimed that development of this area proceeds by impinging upon territory otherwise available for the processing of culturally relevant stimuli such as faces and houses. In a large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging study of a group of individuals of varying degrees of literacy (from completely illiterate to highly literate), we examined cortical responses to orthographic and nonorthographic visual stimuli. We found that literacy enhances responses to other visual input in early visual areas and enhances representational similarity between text and faces, without reducing the extent of response to nonorthographic input. Thus, acquisition of literacy in childhood recycles existing object representation mechanisms but without destructive competition."
Boris Johnson goes from Incredible Hulk to Incredible Sulk in the space of 24 hours,http://irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/brexit-boris-johnson-skips-press-conference-near-noisy-protesters-1.4019492,"Talks in Luxembourg between Boris Johnson and Jean Claude Juncker failed to make any ground on the central challenge of the Northern Ireland backstop on Monday as EU officials insisted that the UK has still failed to produce proposals for a specific, legally operable alternative.

The British prime minister and the European Commission president met for a heavily hyped working lunch aimed at “taking stock” of the state of play in talks. But its aftermath descended into farce as noisy Remain demonstrators forced Mr Johnson to abandon a planned open-air press conference.

His departure was followed by a solo performance by Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel, who rounded on his absent guest over the handling of the Brexit mess as entirely “homemade problems” which had created a “nightmare” for EU citizens.

He would not comment on Mr Johnson’s apparent willingness to defy parliament and the law, save to observe acidly “that would not happen in Luxembourg”. “Don’t make the EU the bad guy,” Mr Bettel added, as the podium meant for Mr Johnson beside him sat conspicuously empty.

Mr Johnson and Mr Juncker agreed to accelerate the ongoing talks from twice weekly to daily at a political level, and to bring in Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay for face-to-face discussions with chief negotiator Michel Barnier.

“We need to accelerate talks if we are going to make any progress,” Mr Johnson told the BBC.

Brussels was less optimistic. The problem, sources said, is not the pace of talks but the absence of content and of new proposals from the UK. Negotiators say they are bewildered by Mr Johnson’s repeated insistence that progress is being made.

A spokesman for the commission said of the talks: “President Juncker underlined the commission’s continued willingness and openness to examine whether such proposals meet the objectives of the backstop. Such proposals have not yet been made.”

Mr Johnson, however, insisted afterwards on Sky News that he thinks there is still time for a deal to be done, “just the right amount of time”, by the end of October. “If that is not possible, the UK will leave by 31st October.”

Though he admitted to the BBC that the talks were in a “difficult moment” he insisted that “Yes, there is a good chance of a deal, yes I can see the shape of it. Everybody can see roughly what could be done,” he said. He said a deal was not necessarily “in the bag”.

The commission said it “will remain available to work 24/7. The October European Council will be an important milestone in the process. The EU27 remain united.”

A statement from Downing Street said that “the prime minister reconfirmed his commitment to the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement and his determination to reach a deal with the backstop removed, that UK parliamentarians could support.

The prime minister also reiterated that he would not request an extension.”"
"A year ago, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell held a ""remarkably positive outlook"" for an economy enjoying a ""historically rare"" combination of good news including low unemployment, steady inflation and strong growth that were all expected to continue.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-fed-economy/fed-trades-remarkably-positive-for-no-precedents-after-volatile-year-idUKKBN1W00EQ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year ago, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell held a “remarkably positive outlook” for an economy enjoying a “historically rare” combination of good news including low unemployment, steady inflation and strong growth that were all expected to continue.

When the Fed meets this week, the discussion will be about just how badly that outlook has eroded, and whether officials should still describe themselves as simply tinkering with policies that are about right, or embarked on a more aggressive fight to keep the U.S. recovery on track.

A headline decision to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point is widely expected. More importantly, the Fed’s language and new economic projections will show how deeply a summer of trouble has been felt - from an intensifying U.S.-China trade war and the relaunch of crisis-style stimulus by the European Central Bank to a stream of weak manufacturing data that may hint at larger problems for the United States.

“At the end of 2018 it looked like the economy was moving forward in a continued solid manner,” said David Wilcox, director for the Fed’s division of statistics and research until the end of last year and now a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

“The risks were predominantly to the upside and it was not prominent on our radar screen or anybody’s that the trade war’s machinations would be taken to the extent that they have been...The news from abroad, by wide consensus, has been disappointing.”

The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a press conference by Powell scheduled to follow the release of the central bank’s statement.

The Fed’s likely action to lower its target policy rate to a range of between 1.75% and 2.00%, policymakers hope, will boost the economy by easing borrowing costs on everything from car loans to corporate bonds.

MARKDOWNS AT THE FED

Since the end of last year, Fed decisions - to take rate hikes off the table in January and then to cut rates in July for the first time in a decade - have helped drive the average 30-year fixed rate home mortgage from an eight-year high of 4.94% to around 3.5%, for example, enough to save a homeowner more than $200 a month on a $250,000 loan. Since the July rate cut corporate bond issuance has surged as firms take advantage of record low long-term borrowing rates, saving them money or providing capital for projects.

Between September 2018 and their last set of quarterly forecasts issued in June, Fed officials slashed half a percentage point of expected growth from their median projection for 2019 and marked down inflation further away from their 2% target. At that September 2018 meeting, they had also projected that the fed funds rate would hit 3.1% by the end of 2019. It is currently at around 2.1% and likely heading lower.

New projections issued Wednesday will show whether officials think things are getting worse, and how much further they think they need to go in terms of rate cuts or other steps to stay ahead of any developing problems.

It’s a tough call that has divided Fed officials among those who want to cut fast and deep, those who want to go slow, and those who want to do nothing at all.

The “range of views,” as Powell calls it, reflects the uncertainty of the past 12 months, an era that may ultimately be seen as one of self-inflicted wounds that pushed the United States - and the world - from a period of steady and broad-based growth into a potential rut.

In a rosy-hued speech in October, Powell detailed risks he thought the Fed faced at that point. They were of a conventional sort - an unexpected jump in inflation, for example, that might force the Fed to raise interest rates even faster to discourage spending and slow the pace of price increases.There was only passing mention of a trade dispute whose larger-than-expected impacts and quick shifts of direction broadsided the Fed this year, and no way to anticipate a coming bond market convulsion that signaled rising recession risks and a conviction that the Fed as of late last year had hiked rates too far for economic conditions.

The shifting sands of 2019:

IT’S ALL THE ECONOMIES

U.S. data have been mixed since the Fed last met in July.

Business investment has remained weak. Indicators of manufacturing output fell. Employment growth slowed.

Yet even at the lower-than-expected level of 130,000, the number of jobs created in August is more than enough to absorb new entrants into the workforce and keep the unemployment rate at 3.7%.

Wage growth has continued, and “consumers remain the locomotive of the economy,” JP Morgan economist Michael Feroli said after retail sales jumped more than expected in August. “There is little reason to expect a near-term retrenchment,” as households benefit from a tight job market and, if the Fed cuts interest rates as anticipated, lower costs to fund home improvements or other large purchases.

In his final public comments before the upcoming meeting, Powell described the U.S. labor market as in “quite a strong position,” and downplayed any risk of recession in the United States.

Yet it is not just U.S. data Powell is concerned with.

Increasingly, with developed nations worried about larger trends like the aging populations and low productivity they all seem to share, U.S. officials are also looking over their shoulders at the now endemic stagnation in Europe and Japan’s generational struggle to maintain growth, and wondering what they need to do to avoid the same fate.

President Donald Trump this week said the Fed should follow Europe’s lead into the realm of negative interest rates. That suggestion may have been framed by the trouble the president expects if he carries a slowing economy into a reelection campaign next year. But JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said last week his company’s officials were also discussing what to do if the Fed ends up cutting rates back to zero.

At the Fed’s annual research conference in Wyoming last month, Powell acknowledged not only the rising risks to the economy, but the Fed’s own inability to see too far ahead in what has become an unpredictable world.

Fed officials “have much experience in addressing typical macroeconomic developments,” Powell said. “There are, however, no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation.”"

One of the best preserved texts in the Dead Sea scrolls has prompted further mystery after a study into the document found chemicals from outside the region had been used to preserve it.,http://independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/dead-sea-scrolls-israel-temple-parchment-chemical-preserved-study-a9095586.html,"One of the best preserved texts in the Dead Sea scrolls has prompted further mystery after a study into the document found chemicals from outside the region had been used to preserve it.

The first of the Dead Sea scrolls, a collection of ancient Jewish texts predominantly written in Hebrew, were found in 1947 by Bedouin shepherds looking for a lost sheep.

The discovery prompted years of archaeological work in 11 caves surrounding the salt lake, and unearthed some of the most well-preserved ancient texts ever found.

The Temple scroll is the among the largest and best preserved of the 900 texts discovered in jars around the region, unfurling to a length of more than eight metres. It describes an unbuilt Jewish temple as well as regulations on sacrifices and temple practices.

However, a study carried by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has revealed that the text is preserved by minerals that cannot be found in the surrounding area – leading to questions over where and how the ancient text was produced.

Published in the journal Science Advances, the study found a continuous layer of glauberite and thenardite – sulphate minerals that “are not commonly found in the Dead Sea region” – had been spread across the text.

It added that the discovery posed “intriguing questions on the provenance of the Temple scroll”.

Dr Ira Rabin of the Federal Institute of Materials Research and Testing and Hamburg University, who was involved in the study, told MIT’s news department: “This study has far-reaching implications beyond the Dead Sea scrolls.

“For example, it shows that at the dawn of parchment making in the Middle East, several techniques were in use, which is in stark contrast to the single technique used in the middle ages.”

Parchments discovered in the caves were divided into three types of treatments – leather parchments, brown parchments that were tanned in a style typical of eastern cultures, and untanned, ivory white parchments typical of western practices.

The Temple scroll, a sheet of material so thin experts have suggested it may be based on an animal skin that has been split in two, is among the untanned texts – however it is the only one found to have potentially been preserved using the sulphites from outside the Dead Sea region.

It is now hoped the discovery will ensure the text can be better preserved in the future – with the salt base uncovered making even the slightest change in humidity potentially destructive.

Dr Rabin added: “There could be an unanticipated sensitivity to even small-scale changes in humidity."

Simple worksheets dramatically boost learning in STEM classes,http://science.ubc.ca/news/small-changes-big-gains-simple-worksheets-dramatically-boost-learning-stem-classes,"The study involved more than 3,700 UBC Science students.

Low-cost, active teaching techniques—particularly group work and worksheets—substantially improve learning in university science classes, according to a new study involving 3,700 University of British Columbia (UBC) biology students.

""Many university STEM classes continue to rely on conventional lectures, despite substantial research that suggests active teaching techniques like peer instruction and group discussion are more effective,"" said UBC researcher Patricia Schulte, senior author of the study, published today in PLOS-One.

""But this confirms that group work significantly enhances how well students grasp and retain concepts. And strikingly, having students go through worksheets in groups—an easily implemented, low cost classroom technique—resulted in particularly strong improvements in scores.""

Increasing class time dedicated to group work just 10 per cent (five minutes in a 50-minute class) correlated with roughly a three per cent improvement in student performance. That equates to almost one letter grade, depending on the institution. Using in-class worksheets—a wide variety of structured handouts that contain a few questions or tasks related to a concept—resulted in even more significant increases in student scores.

In general, classes had to spend half or more of their time in groupwork to see significant boost in learning.

The study is the first large-scale, direct observation of classes across a curriculum that examines the impact of different active learning approaches. The researchers observed classroom practices across 31 lecture sections in the biology program at UBC, classifying classes by the degree of group work conducted in each. They administered tests to more than 3,700 students at the beginning and end of term to assess the extent of their learning, independent of regular course exams. Most students were in first and second year.

Most of the previous work on active learning is based on instructor self-reports, qualitative surveys, or indirect observations of active learning, rather than direct assessments of teaching practices and independent assessments of learning.

The study was a collaboration among UBC science education fellows, led by Laura Weir, currently with Saint Mary's University, and colleagues now at St. Francis Xavier University, University of California San Diego, and Simon Fraser University. At UBC, long-term science education initiatives—working with departments and with students—have transformed more than 200 courses to improve the learning and success of 16,000 students a year."

Artificial Memories Were Successfully Created in Mice,http://scientificamerican.com/article/a-successful-artificial-memory-has-been-created/,"We learn from our personal interaction with the world, and our memories of those experiences help guide our behaviors. Experience and memory are inexorably linked, or at least they seemed to be before a recent report on the formation of completely artificial memories. Using laboratory animals, investigators reverse engineered a specific natural memory by mapping the brain circuits underlying its formation. They then “trained” another animal by stimulating brain cells in the pattern of the natural memory. Doing so created an artificial memory that was retained and recalled in a manner indistinguishable from a natural one.

Memories are essential to the sense of identity that emerges from the narrative of personal experience. This study is remarkable because it demonstrates that by manipulating specific circuits in the brain, memories can be separated from that narrative and formed in the complete absence of real experience. The work shows that brain circuits that normally respond to specific experiences can be artificially stimulated and linked together in an artificial memory. That memory can be elicited by the appropriate sensory cues in the real environment. The research provides some fundamental understanding of how memories are formed in the brain and is part of a burgeoning science of memory manipulation that includes the transfer, prosthetic enhancement and erasure of memory. These efforts could have a tremendous impact on a wide range of individuals, from those struggling with memory impairments to those enduring traumatic memories, and they also have broad social and ethical implications.

In the recent study, the natural memory was formed by training mice to associate a specific odor (cherry blossoms) with a foot shock, which they learned to avoid by passing down a rectangular test chamber to another end that was infused with a different odor (caraway). The caraway scent came from a chemical called carvone, while the cherry blossom scent came from another chemical, acetophenone. The researchers found that acetophenone activates a specific type of receptor on a discrete type of olfactory sensory nerve cell.

They then turned to a sophisticated technique, optogenetics, to activate those olfactory nerve cells. With optogenetics, light-sensitive proteins are used to stimulate specific neurons in response to light delivered to the brain through surgically implanted optic fibers. In their first experiments, the researchers used transgenic animals that only made the protein in acetophenone-sensitive olfactory nerves. By pairing the electrical foot shock with optogenetic light stimulation of the acetophenone-sensitive olfactory nerves, the researchers taught the animals to associate the shock with activity of these specific acetophenone-sensitive sensory nerves. By pairing the electrical foot shock with optogenetic light stimulation of the acetophenone-sensitive olfactory nerves, the researchers taught the animals to associate the two. When they later tested the mice, they avoided the cherry blossom odor.

These first steps showed that the animals did not need to actually experience the odor to remember a connection between that smell and a noxious foot shock. But this was not a completely artificial memory, because the shock was still quite real. In order to construct an entirely artificial memory, the scientists needed to stimulate the brain in such a way as to mimic the nerve activity caused by the foot shock as well.

Earlier studies had shown that specific nerve pathways leading to a structure known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were important for the aversive nature of the foot shock. To create a truly artificial memory, the researchers needed to stimulate the VTA in the same way as they stimulated the olfactory sensory nerves, but the transgenic animals only made the light-sensitive proteins in those nerves. In order to use optogenetic stimulation, they stimulated the olfactory nerves in the same genetically engineered mice , and they employed a virus to place light-sensitive proteins in the VTA as well. They stimulated the olfactory receptors with light to simulate the odor of cherry blossoms, then stimulated the VTA to mimic the aversive foot shock. The animals recalled the artificial memory, responding to an odor they had never encountered by avoiding a shock they had never received.

For a long time, it has been a mystery how memories are formed in the brain—and what physical changes in the brain accompany their formation. In this study, the electrical stimulation of specific brain regions that led to a new memory also activated other brain regions known to be involved in memory formation, including an area called the basolateral amygdala. Because nerve cells communicate with one another through junctions called synapses, it has been assumed that changes in synaptic activity account for the formation of memories. In simple animals, such as the sea slug Aplysia, memories can be transferred from one individual to another using RNA extracted from the one who experienced them. The RNA contains the codes for proteins made in the nerves of the animal associated with the memory. Memories have been partially transferred in rodents by using recordings of electrical activity of a trained animal’s memory center (the hippocampus) to stimulate similar patterns of nerve activity in a recipient animal. This process is similar to the new report described here, in that stimulating the electrical activity of specific neural circuits is used to elicit a memory. In the case of memory transfer, that pattern came from trained animals, whereas in the optogenetics study, the pattern of electrical activity associated with the memory was built de novo within brain of the mouse. This is the first report of a completely artificial memory, and it helps establish some fundamental understanding of how memories may be manipulated.

Research into memory and efforts to manipulate it have progressed at a rapid pace. A “memory prosthetic” designed to enhance its formation and recall by electrical stimulation of the memory center in the human brain has been developed with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In contrast, memory erasure using what has been nicknamed the Eternal Sunshine drug (zeta inhibitory peptide, or ZIP)—after Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a Hollywood movie with a mnemonic theme—is being developed to treat recollections of chronic pain.

There are legitimate motives underlying these efforts. Memory has been called “the scribe of the soul,” and it is the source of one’s personal history. Some people may seek to recover lost or partially lost memories. Others, such as those afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder or chronic pain, might seek relief from traumatic memories by trying to erase them.

The methods used here to create artificial memories will not be employed in humans anytime soon: none of us are transgenic like the animals used in the experiment, nor are we likely to accept multiple implanted fiber-optic cables and viral injections. Nevertheless, as technologies and strategies evolve, the possibility of manipulating human memories becomes all the more real. And the involvement of military agencies such as DARPA invariably renders the motivations behind these efforts suspect. Are there things we all need to be afraid of or that we must or must not do? The dystopian possibilities are obvious.

Creating artificial memories brings us closer to learning how memories form and could ultimately help us understand and treat dreadful diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Memories, however, cut to the core of our humanity, and we need to be vigilant that any manipulations are approached ethically."
"A Costco opens in China, draws such massive crowds it has to close early",http://nbcnews.com/news/world/costco-opens-china-draws-such-massive-crowds-it-has-close-n1046801,"SHANGHAI — Costco was forced to shut its first store in China early on its opening day on Tuesday, according to state media, after large crowds flocked through the door and caused neighborhood traffic jams.

Videos posted on Chinese social media showed thousands of people crowding the aisles of the store in Shanghai's Minhang district, while signs outside warned incoming shoppers that they might have to wait three hours to park.

One nearby school sent out an advisory to parents warning them about the traffic conditions. ""Please expect the student dismissal this afternoon to be severely delayed due to the grand opening of Costco Supermarket,"" said the message.

The Paper, a media outlet run by the Shanghai government, reported on social media at 2:43 p.m. that the store had shut early, citing the local district government.

""Due to the extremely large crowds at the newly opened supermarket, for the safety of the public we urge that residents consume in a rational manner and choose to go shopping at an off-peak time,"" it quoted government officials as saying.

Costco did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Costco announced last month that it would open its first store in China. It first entered the country in 2014 through opening an online store on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Tmall online marketplace.

Its busy first day came as other big-name Western retailers such as Amazon, Tesco Plc and Carrefour, are retreating from China having struggled to win market share in the face of strong competition from domestic rivals."
The Glimmer of a Climate New World Order,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/climate-at-the-g-7-glimmers-of-a-new-world-order.html,"The Amazon fires provoked a promising response at the G-7. Photo: Victor Moriyama/Getty Images

I didn’t know politics could move this fast. It has been barely a week since the world woke up to reports of fires tearing through the Amazon rainforest, and already a new sort of global red line has been established — the first of its kind to be drawn around climate behavior. Led by grandstanding French president Emmanuel Macron, the leaders of the G-7 have essentially told Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro that the burning of the Amazon simply cannot stand.

Bolsonaro is himself a showboat, of course, usually excited by the opportunity to troll the community of globalists and liberal cosmopolitans almost literally embodied in the leaders of the G-7 — and particularly in forums bringing those leaders together as though they are puppet-mastering the rest of the world over a continental breakfast. And yet, over the last few days, Bolsonaro has performed a dramatic about-face, moving from shrugging his shoulders at the fires and blaming them on leftist NGOs, to acknowledging they are a problem and deploying his military to put them out. Presumably, this is not just the result of Macron’s rhetoric — “our house is on fire,” the French leader tweeted late last week — but what followed: a promise to spike a major European trade deal with Brazil if Bolsonaro did not take the fires seriously. In other words, a threat to apply the same tools of leverage and sanction and shame to crimes of climate as have been applied, in the past, to violations of human rights and territorial sovereignty.

This is, of course, unprecedented—and much more significant than the paltry $20 million the nations of the G7 pledged to send to Brazil to help fight the fires. It was also, in a way, inevitable. If climate change does transform life on this planet at anything like the scale and speed scientists promise it will, our politics will change with it — and probably quite dramatically. One question this raises is: In what ways? Another is: Will we like what warming does to us? The answers to both are very much open, and we’ve barely begun to develop a political science around climate change that might help us think through the possibilities.

On Friday, I wrote about the fact that, on the very same day that the Brazilian fires became news in America, the U.S. lost its one candidate for president, Jay Inslee, who was committed to taking climate change as seriously as the world’s scientists insist we all must — and I suggested that action on climate may well require an entirely different kind of politics than one that consigns principled crusaders like Inslee to the bin of also-rans. Less than 24 hours after Inslee dropped out, Bernie Sanders dropped his own climate plan — one much grander than anything even Inslee proposed. If Sanders’s gambit represents one new kind of climate politics, this G-7 climate shaming surely counts as another. But what kind is it?

Saturday at the Atlantic, Franklin Foer proposed that meaningful action to combat warming may require that the bedrock principle of national sovereignty be retired, such that leaders like Bolsonaro (or, for that matter, Trump) won’t be able to operate with impunity on climate issues which, despite playing out within those nations’ borders, impact the rest of the world as well (often more so, since impacts are distributed unequally). “If there were a functioning global community, it would be wrestling with how to more aggressively save the Amazon, and acknowledging that the battle against climate change demands not only new international cooperation but, perhaps, the weakening of traditional concepts of the nation-state,” he wrote. “The case for territorial incursion in the Amazon is far stronger than the justifications for most war.”

Foer was writing before Bolsonaro “capitulated,” but the prospect of climate wars seems even more pressing now. The G-7 shame campaign was only a modest step in that direction — individual nation-states acting in concert, not to undermine the sovereignty of a bad actor but to remind him how dependent his country is on the support of other nations, and to threaten to withdraw that support. But it nevertheless allows you to imagine a possible world, probably at least a few years away, in which a similar group of nations — or a similarly concerned single superpower — does take the next step and threatens military action. That is, of course, what often does follow from a sequence of sanctions, and it is more or less how in the aftermath of World War II the nations of the west “consecrated” the principle of human rights. (That is, by fighting wars in its name, if often for other material reasons). If the 21st century is conducted in the shadow of warming as the second half of the 20th was in the shadow of the Holocaust, that sort of succession — from human rights to climate change as the universal touchstone of geopolitics and speakable expression of great-power rivalry — seems not just possible but inevitable.

So — is that where we are headed? Honestly, I don’t know, and don’t know anyone who does. As with everything else when it comes to climate, we are headed into a brave new world with nothing resembling a playbook. But in their brilliant book Climate Leviathan, the political scientists Geoff Mann and Joel Wainwright plot a matrix of possible future political responses to climate. The two axes are the relationship to the nation state (i.e., does the world recognize national sovereignty in the face of climate change?); and the relationship to capitalism (i.e., does the world respond to the crisis by doubling down on the importance of capital, or does it retreat from it?). They name the resulting quadrants: Climate Mao (anti-capitalist and nationalist); Climate Behemoth (capitalist and nationalist), Climate Leviathan (capitalist and globalist) and Climate X (anti-capitalist and globalist, basically ecosocialism, which they’re rooting for). But they also acknowledge that each category is too neat — a conceptual framework, not a map of our future. My own guess is that they’re right: that we won’t have any one new paradigm for climate politics, that no one prediction will come to pass in any total way, but that we will evolve those new politics along many different ideological axes.

What would that mean? That there won’t just be ecofascism of the kind that’s been talked about a lot over the last month — right-wing governments throwing up border walls and defining the needs of their own people, in a resource-scarce world, as infinitely more important than the needs of anyone else. There could also be ecofascism of the environmentalist stripe, governments running roughshod over the rights of their citizens to impose deeply disruptive responses to warming and all its impacts — eminent domain on environmental-panic steroids, decarbonization on a military footing. There will likely be more moderated forms of both — some rise in nativism that doesn’t totally revolutionize existing political cultures, some expansion of government authority that adds to rather than obliterates status-quo powers. There may be some form of ecosocialism and, elsewhere, some rejection of economic growth and an embrace of what’s been called “de-growth.” But on the left, some modulated versions are probably likelier, too: a more empathic and redistributive politics that stops short of true collectivization, for instance, and some growing awareness among left-wing leaders around the world that growth is merely one measure of progress, and perhaps a misleading or counterproductive one. In New Zealand, prime minister Jacinda Adern is already pointing the way there.

And probably it won’t be any one of these futures but something more like all of them, all at once, in different places at different times — with different nations responding differently to the challenge, even different parts of single nations, with some regions and some parts of government acting from one set of ideological goals while others move in different directions. That is to say, it is likely to be all quite messy, as politics always is, however much we might wish to imagine a single future, or a single climate “solution” — and however much the neoliberal order of the last political generation promised that all plots moved predictably markets-ward.

In a weird way, the G-7 bullying this past weekend extends the same promise — and makes the awakening of climate conscience among the world’s most powerful nations look somewhat less like a radical political departure than the simple extension of existing (and imperiled) neoliberalism into the realm of climate concern. Still, this is progress. In fact, quite significant progress, I think, since market forces remain quite powerful tools, and since we need all the tools we can get in addressing a crisis of this scale. But, of course, it also has some blindspots.

To begin with, the fires, judged on their own, actually aren’t all that significant a climate event. They are bad, since all fires are bad, climate-wise. But the relatively limited aid the G7 will be sending to fight them is a sign that these fires are neither catastrophic in the short term nor hard to control—$20 million being less than one percent the annual budget of CalFire, the California state fire program. Of course, Bolsonaro’s broader plan to develop and deforest the Amazon would be such an outrageous carbon catastrophe — it could release, over a decade, as much carbon as the U.S. and China, the world’s two biggest emitters, release in a year — that it would represent the enactment of a sort of great-man theory of climate disaster. But the fires burning this month are, as the New York Times has shown, mostly on land that has already been deforested — farmers clearing their land as part of their annual rhythm, if on land that was once rainforest and perhaps in a coordinated way to make an ugly gesture of solidarity with their president and his plan to open up yet more of the land. There are more fires burning today in Congo and Angola than in Brazil, almost none of which are true wildfires, like those we’ve seen devastate California and Siberia, but are controlled and defeatable with a relatively minimal effort.

This all makes the G-7 campaign an important symbolic gesture, but perhaps only that, and one for which the ultimate test is what happens after the fires are put out: Will Bolsonaro’s deforestation plan continue, or not? Or perhaps that is only the penultimate test, since there is also the question of whether pressure like this can be employed by nations like France and Canada and the UK to punch up and not just punch down — to influence the world’s biggest carbon emitters, namely China and the United States.

And if the gesture is mostly symbolic, what is the symbol obscuring? Canada’s Justin Trudeau was the first leader to echo Macron’s call to action, but he recently approved the TransMountain pipeline; Japan is financing coal plants built abroad that are as much as 40 times more polluting than those they allow within their borders. In fact, every single member nation of the G-7 is hiding some significant climate hypocrisy behind their pressure on Bolsonaro, however laudable that pressure is. But if the sum total of their collective action this year will be effectively dispatching the Brazilian military to fight fires local farmers had mostly under control, it will be a critically insufficient response. If their pressure forces Bolsonaro to abandon his plans for the Amazon, that would be considerably better. And yet there is much more to be done still, in each of their home countries, none of which are meeting the pledges they made under the Paris accords just three years ago. To pretend that Bolsonaro is the world’s only climate villain, or the Amazon the only region in the world currently in climate crisis, is an act of grand self-delusion.

Still, the value of symbolism is not to be discarded. For a very long time, climate scientists and activists lamented the disinterest of the average person in the issue, in part blaming the media for failing to communicate the scale of the crisis and the urgency of action. They were right, in a way: climate change simply wasn’t on the front page of the New York Times or Washington Post every day, and almost never made it onto television news. On the newspaper side, that has already changed, with quite remarkable speed: It’s not every day yet, but the country’s major papers do now devote enviable acreage to the story, often several times a week and frequently illustrated with dramatic above-the-fold photography. The progress in television has been slower, but here the Amazon fires may mark a different kind of turning point — and a recognition among producers that, while climate change may have a longstanding reputation as a ratings-killer, natural disasters do not, especially those that produce fire. Perhaps the blockbuster wall-to-wall coverage of the recent burning of Notre Dame was good training on this point, too.

This fire season has been an unusually mild one, so far, for California, and we’ve yet to see the major hurricane events that have whipped through the Caribbean each of the past two summers. But the coverage of the Amazon fires suggests that, when those terrifying impacts happen, producers may finally be ready to showcase them in the way they should. It is horrible for anyone living in their path, of course, that disasters are getting more frequent and more punishing. But judged strictly from the semi-sociopathic perspective of journalistic narrative, the climate change story is getting “better.” Rather than relying on dry-sounding predictions of centuries-long sea-level rise measured in the centimeters or inches, natural disasters and extreme weather are teaching us all how to tell stories that horrify us into action, even of an imperfect kind."

"During mind-wandering, heroic music evokes more empowering and motivating thoughts, and sad music more relaxing or depressive thoughts, suggests a new study (n=62), which may have implications for the use of music to promote health and well-being in both clinical populations and healthy individuals.",http://nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46266-w,"Participants

Sixty-two participants (37 females, mean age = 24.9 years, SD = 9.7) took part in the experiment. None of the participants was a professional musician, 38% reported to have no musical training, 49% reported to have less than, and 13% of the participants more than five years of extra-curricular music lessons. Participants were compensated with a gift card (80 NOK, about 10 USD). Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Because the experimental procedure was non-invasive and did not involve the collection of any personal information that could be used to identify the participants, no further approval was required (according to the Norwegian Centre for Research Data; NSD).

Stimuli and material

The stimulus-set consisted of six musical excerpts (Supplementary Table S3), selected based on a pilot study (for details see below). The stimuli were organized in three pairs, each pair consisting of one excerpt with a heroic and one excerpt with a sad emotional expression. The stimuli within each pair had equal tempo to ensure that any observed effects resulted only from the different emotional expression of the music, and not the tempo. The tempo of the excerpts belonging to the stimulus pairs was “slow” (64 beats per minute; BPM) for one pair, “medium” (95 BPM) for another pair, and “fast” (115 BPM) for the third pair. The presentation order of pairs, as well as whether the heroic or the sad excerpt within the pairs was presented first, was counter-balanced across subjects. This arrangement also ensured that the participants were not exposed to excerpts with the same emotional expression in succession. Each excerpt had a duration of two minutes, with a stable emotional expression from start to end. The stimuli were adjusted to the same loudness and had a 1.5-second fade in and -out. None of the stimuli contained any lyrics, and all pieces were orchestral, neo-orchestral, or string-orchestral music. Stimuli were selected out of 15 relatively unknown musical pieces based on a pilot study with 43 participants (for details see Supplementary Text S2).

The music stimulus and questionnaires were presented using PsychoPy (version 1.85.3)42 on two Lenovo laptops (G500 and B560). All of the instructions and questions presented during the experiment were in Norwegian. The participants listened to the music through headphones (Sennheiser DT770 PRO or Sony MDR-1000X). They responded to the questionnaires with the numeric buttons, and the whole keyboard for answering the free response task. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was acquired from the extremity leads using a made-to-order ECG-device (Research and Transfer Center at the University of Applied Sciences Leipzig, Germany). The ECG served to assess heart rate as an objective measure of physiological arousal during the music exposure.

Procedure

Participants were seated in a comfortable chair with pillows for neck and lumbar support. The chairs were placed inside a semi-enclosed booth, so that the participants could not see the experimenters during the experiment. A footstool was provided to support and elevate their legs. The laptop was placed on a removable table over the participant’s lap.

Participants were first informed about the experiment and gave signed informed consent, then they answered a questionnaire concerning their musical background. Before the experiment, four electrodes for ECG-measurements were fitted on the extremities (left and right upper arm and left and right shinbone). The participants were then informed that the experiment was about music and relaxation, and instructed on how to use the keyboard and the different rating scales. They were asked to relax, follow the instructions on the screen, listen to the music passively, and remain still during the music session and the resting period to reduce artifacts in the ECG-recordings. Before the first musical excerpts was presented, participants answered the 10-items International positive and negative affect schedule short-form (I-PANAS-SF25; translated to Norwegian, and referred to as PANAS throughout this article) to acquire a baseline of the participants’ affective state.

The experiment encompassed 6 trials with three pairs of heroic and sad pieces. Before the presentation of each musical excerpt within a trial, the participants were instructed to sit back, relax and close their eyes to promote relaxation and perceptual decoupling. After two minutes of music-listening, a thought sampling probe was obtained, for which the participants were instructed to hold on to the last thought they had before the music stopped. They were then asked to answer items of a questionnaire designed to measure: if (or to what degree) the participants were mind-wandering; controlled focus of attention; meta-awareness; self-involvement; involvement of others; valence; arousal; temporal orientation of thoughts; relevance to current life-reality; as well as the constructiveness and motivational properties of the thought-content (the wording of all items is listed in Supplementary Table S5). While the first nine items were taken from our previous study20, the items on constructiveness and motivation were added to assess possible empowering effects of the heroic music on the contents of thoughts. Then, the participants were asked to write a short description of what they were thinking about (“free writing task”). Each trial ended with the 10-item PANAS, to examine (1) whether the different musical stimuli were able to elicit different affective states, and (2) whether thought-contents reflected the participant’s affective state. Excerpts with either heroic or sad emotional expression were presented in alternation in each new trial. The experiment finished with a five-minute resting period to measure mean heart rate and heart rate variability43, before the participants were debriefed and given contact information, in case of any inquiries or concerns. The total duration of the experimental session was approximately 45 minutes.

Data analysis

Four different classes of analyses were carried out, assessing: (a) the occurrence of mind wandering, (b) physiological arousal (assessed using the mean heart rate), (c) thought content and (d) positive vs. negative affect. Before analyzing the data, the scales for the items assessing thought content (which ranged initially from 1 to 7) were recoded from −3 to +3 to better differentiate between negative, neutral and positive responses. For the scales assessing positive vs. negative affect, the baseline assessment of each scale (acquired before listening to the musical excerpts) was subtracted from the assessments after listening to each excerpt.

All data were analyzed using analyses of variance (ANOVA) employing the General Linear Model. Whenever these comparisons involved several items, appropriate Bonferroni-correction was used. The threshold depended on the number of items: For the ten items assessing thought-content the significance threshold was set to p = 0.0050 (p = 0.05/10). For the two subscales and the ten individual items assessing positive-negative affect it was set to p = 0.0042 (p = 0.05/12; because the correction diminished the significance thresholds by a factor of around 10, we report four decimal numbers for the p-values). An ANOVA for repeated measurements was used to assess what influence the emotional expression, and the tempo, of the musical excerpts had on the occurrence of mind-wandering. The model used the emotional expression (heroic vs. sad) and the tempo of the music (slow, medium, and fast) as within-subject factors, and the presentation order (heroic first vs. sad first) as between-subjects factor. A repeated-measurement ANOVA with the same factors (emotional expression, tempo and presentation order) was used to explore the physiological arousal (assessed via the mean heart rate).

Analyses evaluating the thought-content and PANAS items were restricted to trials where mind-wandering occurred, responses within trials without mind-wandering were excluded. The items eliciting mind-wandering were reorganized so that each item represented one measurement point. The reorganization required to control for the participants’ mean, given that there were six measurements for each participant (two emotional expressions × three tempi). Therefore, in the ANOVAs assessing thought-content, “participant-ID” served as random factor of no interest. In the ANOVAs assessing positive vs. negative affect the subtraction of the individual baseline measure served as control for the participants’ mean.

For the items assessing thought-content, two sets of models were used in the analyses; either of them using univariate ANOVAs. The first set of models used the within-subject factors emotional expression and tempo, while the participant-ID served as random factor of no interest. A second set of models evaluated whether the thought-content was modulated by physiological arousal. Given that tempo and physiological arousal covaried strongly, it was not possible to include both factors. Therefore, the second set of models employed the within-subject factors emotional expression and physiological arousal as well as participant-ID as random factor of no interest. For the items assessing positive vs. negative affect, only one set of models controlling for physiological arousal was used. These univariate ANOVAs used the within-subject factors emotional expression and physiological arousal.

Whenever a significant main effect for items assessing thought-content or affect (as measured with the PANAS) was obtained, follow-up analyses using one-sample t-tests were employed. For the items assessing thought-content, these tests evaluated whether values differed from a neutral response (i.e. zero), and for PANAS-items the tests evaluated whether values differed from the baseline values. For these models, appropriate Bonferroni-correction served to control for multiple comparisons. For items assessing thought-content (with four significant main effects × two conditions = 8 comparisons) the Bonferroni-corrected significance level was set to 0.0063 (0.05/8); for items assessing positive and negative affect (with seven significant main effects × two conditions = 14 comparisons) it was set to 0.0035 (0.05/14).

Similar to our previous study20, a word-cloud was created depicting the most common words in the participants’ free responses44,45. To this end, the frequency of word occurrences in the texts of the free writing task was computed. Misspelled words were corrected, and synonyms or related terms combined into a common denominator (e.g., “father”, “dad”, “mom”, and “mother” were combined into “parents”). Afterwards, words were removed if they were contained in the presented items or the instructions (e.g., “music”, “thinking”, “I”, “me”) or non-content words (e.g., “this”, “with”). For the final list of words used to create the word cloud, only words with at least six occurrences were chosen. The list contained (a) the word, (b) its frequency of occurrence (determining the word size in Fig. 2; sum of both conditions), and (c) whether the word appeared more often in one than the other condition (occurrences after heroic music divided by the total occurrences, determining the word color in Fig. 2)."
Katie Ormerod wins big air silver on World Cup return in New Zealand. British snowboarder Katie Ormerod finishes second in the big air event on her first World Cup appearance in almost two years.,https://bbc.co.uk/sport/winter-sports/49458472,"Last updated on .From the section Winter Sports

Katie Ormerod was tipped as a Winter Olympic medal contender before breaking her heel in a training run at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games

British snowboarder Katie Ormerod won silver in the big air event in New Zealand on her first World Cup appearance in almost two years.

Ormerod, who broke her heel before the 2018 Winter Olympics, earned a seventh World Cup podium after the final was cancelled because of high winds.

That meant the 21-year-old's score from qualifying stood (83.75), as Finland's Enni Rukajvari, 29, took gold (86.00).

""It couldn't be a better way for me to start the season,"" said Ormerod.

""I'm so excited to come second in my first World Cup back since injury. It was great to ride in such a high level contest and I'm really happy with my riding.""

Last season, Ormerod secured two Europa Cup slopestyle podium finishes on her comeback to competition.

In her first World Cup appearance in 629 days, she was third after the first run at Cardrona, then improved to second place with her backside 720 mute.

The result is an early birthday present for Ormerod who turns 22 on Sunday. She has drawn level with Zoe Gillings-Brier and James Woods with seven top-three World Cup finishes, equal fifth on Britain's all-time list."
Bernie Sanders's Climate Plan Is More Radical Than His Opponents' And More Likely to Succeed,http://theintercept.com/2019/08/22/bernie-sanders-climate-policy/,"If you tried to design a program with the aim of offending the top brass of the world’s most powerful corporations and the politicians whose careers they bankroll, you’d get something like what Bernie Sanders unveiled today in his $16.3 trillion Green New Deal platform. That’s part of the point. “We need a president who has the courage, the vision, and the record to face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action,” the plan’s opening salvo states, going on to echo a famous line from Franklin Delano Roosevelt. “We need a president who welcomes their hatred.” Sanders outlines an expansive system, building on the resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey in April, that would generate publicly owned clean energy and 20 million new jobs, end fossil fuels imports and exports, revivify the social safety net, redress historical injustices like environmental racism, and make prolific investments toward decarbonization at home and abroad — among many, many other things. It would not only transition American society away from fossil fuels but renegotiate decades-old nostrums, championed by the right, about the respective roles of the government and the economy. “It definitely is the biggest and boldest plan and vision out there,” Evan Weber, political director for the Sunrise Movement, told The Intercept, “both in the sheer scale of it and also in a lot of the mechanisms for achieving that scale, that really seem like [Sanders is] pushing the boundaries of how American society currently is structured.” There are novel, meaty policy proposals that make Sanders’s proposal stand out from an already ambitious field: a cash-for-clunkers and financial assistance program to scale up electric vehicle usage, and plans to boost public transit ridership 65 percent by 2030; a requirement that the Congressional Budget Office work with the Environmental Protection Agency to give new legislation a “climate score,” like the budget scores it currently doles out; and abiding by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to ensure the free, prior, and informed consent by Indigenous peoples.

It’s also sparked controversy among energy wonks who see anti-nuclear provisions as antithetical to decarbonization. The plan also rules out carbon capture and storage, which experts suggest may be necessary in the short-run to transition hard-to-decarbonize sectors — but that fossil fuel executives have also long pushed as a way to extend its life indefinitely. Carbon taxes have been a mainstay of Sanders’s climate plans, and his Green New Deal blueprint doesn’t foreclose on the option but also doesn’t emphasize it.

“Most importantly, we must build an unprecedented grassroots movement that is powerful enough to take them on, and win.”

Running through the plan is a different and more explicit theory of change than the lofty platforms other candidates have laid out; it’s built on organizing and naming enemies. Sanders promises to take on the “fossil fuel billionaires whose greed lies at the very heart of the climate crisis,” who, he argues, “have spent hundreds of millions of dollars protecting their profits at the expense of our future” and “will do whatever it takes to squeeze every last penny out of the Earth.” Outlining how the plan will be financed, it notes that he will get $3.085 trillion by making “the fossil fuel industry pay for their pollution, through litigation, fees, and taxes, and eliminating federal fossil fuel subsidies.” “Most importantly,” he says, “we must build an unprecedented grassroots movement that is powerful enough to take them on, and win. Young people, advocates, tribes, cities and states all over this country have already begun this important work, and we will continue to follow their lead.” It’s an approach that distinguishes Sanders’s not just from the primary field but from the last 30-plus years of mainstream climate policymaking in the United States. The closest the U.S. has ever come to passing comprehensive carbon reduction legislation was the doomed congressional fight over cap-and-trade legislation in 2009 and 2010. There are as many explanations for why that plan failed as there are potential Green New Deal programs, and many unfortunate factors converged to torpedo its chances. One major reason why that plan flopped? Some of its most influential advocates were more concerned about winning over corporations than convincing the public it was a good idea. The key to getting Republican support, they reasoned, was to win over the business community, taking advantage of historically strong ties between corporations and the GOP. The vehicle to do that would be a cap-and-trade program, placing a limit, or “cap,” on the total pollution companies could emit by allocating a set number of total permits. If one firm overshot, it could buy more from another or sell, or “trade,” any excess it had left over on what’s known as a carbon market. In 2007, the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, or USCAP, helmed by the Environmental Defense Fund, convened Beltway green organizations and Fortune 500 companies — including BP America, PG&E, Duke Energy, and Lehman Brothers — to start shepherding a plan through with allies on the Hill. Because it was thought that climate policy could be designed and passed largely behind closed doors, advocates for cap-and-trade never went out of their way to explain either what the policy meant to the general public, or — in the grips of a deepening recession — how it could improve their lives, opting instead to spread the word about what a grave threat global warming was.

One major reason why that plan flopped is that some of its most influential advocates were more concerned about winning over corporations than convincing the public it was a good idea.

The 1,000-plus-page House cap-and-trade bill, Waxman-Markey, made it through after careful vote whipping and considerable compromise. As climate writer David Roberts has pointed out, the bill itself was more expansive than many of its critics have given it credit for. But the politics driving it — reflecting broader dynamics in Washington, and within the Democratic Party in particular — hinged on a shaky premise: that Republicans and corporations were willing to negotiate in good faith on climate legislation. The tea party movement was quickly gaining momentum, and the Koch brothers spent the summer after the House vote mobilizing its fossil fuel empire against moderate Republicans who had backed the bill and even some who didn’t, bolstering groups like Americans for Prosperity to gin up an anti-“crap-and-tax” revolt and pull the party far to the right. By the time a companion bill to Waxman-Markey arrived in the Senate that fall, the mood for climate action had already chilled. Corporations, meanwhile, could easily play both sides of the climate policymaking field: watering down bills that seemed like they might pass, while funding effort to make sure they never did. In a 2015 paper, political scientist Jake Grumbach points out that several companies who joined USCAP simultaneously supported lobbying against climate action. Shell, BP, and ConocoPhillips were all members of USCAP and the American Petroleum Institute, and through that helped to bolster API’s “Energy Citizen” campaign, which hosted astroturf rallies around the country in opposition to cap-and-trade, targeting senators in their districts for the summer recess. Those events were planned in coordination with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, of which USCAP members Chrysler, Deere, Dow Chemical, Duke Energy, GE, PepsiCo, PNM Resources, and Siemens were all members. This allowed companies to effectively weaken policy and collect positive PR in the process by appearing to support a solution to the problem. “The business stakeholders not only maximized their chances by pulling potential climate legislation closer to their interests and shaping future political terrain,” Grumbach writes. “They were simultaneously able to spend resources to shift the political debate in their favor in order to prevent the legislation from passing in the first place.” All this, of course, came after the fossil fuel industry and some of the same companies, think tanks, and business associations that battled cap-and-trade had spent two decades spreading elaborate misinformation campaigns to cast doubt on the reality of global warming, shifting the grounds of the political debate on which the cap-and-trade battle was playing out.

With neither Republican nor corporate support moving into a Senate fight, and few people outside the Beltway excited to go to bat for it, cap-and-trade died with a whimper. In an extensive 2013 analysis, Theda Skocpol, professor of sociology at Harvard University, wrote, “During this pivotal year, Republicans, including long-time supposed friends of the environmental movement like John McCain, simply melted away; and in the end GOP Senators unanimously refused to support of any variant of cap and trade.” The upshot here is that Sanders’s Green New Deal plan offers an approach that couldn’t be more different than the climate push on the Hill a decade ago — and by abandoning that insiders-only strategy, it has a real shot at succeeding. As Skocpol wrote in 2013: The political tide can be turned over the next decade only by the creation of a climate-change politics that includes broad popular mobilization on the center left. That is what it will take to counter the recently jelled combination of free-market elite opposition and right-wing popular mobilization against global warming remedies. … In the meantime, liberals and friendly moderates need to build a populist anti-global warming movement on their own side of the political spectrum. Sanders, of course, isn’t the only one adopting a movement-centered approach, an extension of his longtime call for a “political revolution.” It’s also core to how Sunrise organizers think about winning climate policy. Among their biggest takeaways from studying the cap-and-trade fight, Weber told me, “is that you really need a movement that is going to push on this during the campaign and beyond, and you have to pressure politicians. It’s not enough to just win elections.” As Weber said, structural reforms like ending the filibuster and abolishing the Electoral College — calls that don’t appear in Sanders’s plan — will almost certainly be key to getting legislation passed. But designing policy aimed at building a movement is what’s needed to make a floor vote possible.

“The political tide can be turned over the next decade only by the creation of a climate-change politics that includes broad popular mobilization on the center left,” Skocpol wrote in 2013.

If one major mistake of Waxman-Markey was its backers’ inability to articulate how that climate bill would make people’s lives easier, the Green New Deal framework operates by constantly delivering and broadcasting tangible quality of life improvements, using early victories as an opportunity to enlist more support among the many, many people needed to challenge the colossal power of the fossil fuel executives, who are going to put up a massive fight one way or another. Sanders’s Green New Deal offers voters a vision of how much better the world could be without them; its policy and its politics aren’t unrelated. Sanders’s plan offers a battery of investments both in workers and communities already being hit hard by a decline in jobs in carbon-intensive industries like coal. His just transition provisions would provide five years of unemployment insurance, a wage guarantee, and a host of other benefits to workers, as well as $5.9 billion in funding to regional economic development agencies like the Appalachian Regional Commission. Undergirding just how substantial the transition will be, the Green New Deal will spend its first two years “very aggressively laying down a social safety net to ensure that no one is left behind,” expanding welfare state programs — like free school lunches and SNAP benefits — that have in recent decades come under attack from Democrats and Republicans both. There are also frequent references to implementing Medicare for All and dramatically increasing union membership along the lines the Sanders team laid out in another plan this week for sectoral bargaining. Communities around the country could also receive financial assistance to take control of their private electric utilities, and the plan boldly lays out an elaborate blueprint to “end greed in our energy system” and ensure that the “renewable energy generated by the Green New Deal will be publicly owned” — a provision sure to rankle investor-owned utilities that have spent millions blocking climate measures at just about every level of government. While the government will initially collect revenue from new state-owned electric utilities, that renewable energy, the plan notes, will after 2035 be “virtually free.”"

Fun to watch the craziness.,http://foxnews.com/science/storm-area-51-spurs-rural-nevada-county-emergency-plan,"Before the masses descend on the Nevada desert next month as part of the ""Storm Area 51"" event, local officials are pulling out all stops to ensure they will be able to handle whatever crowds may come.

The Lincoln County Board of Commissioners on Monday drafted an emergency declaration for the rural county as part of the ongoing planning process with state officials for the possible alien-obsessed crowds that the ""Storm Area 51"" event may bring into the area.

County Commission Chairman Varlin Higbee told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that officials are taking seriously the possibility that a surge of visitors could overwhelm campsites, fuel stops, and public medical, internet and cellphone services.

“Oh, we’re taking this seriously,” Higbee told the newspaper. “With the possibility of 35,000-40,000 people showing up, yeah, this is serious.”

WHAT'S AREA 51, AND WHY IS IT SO POPULAR RIGHT NOW? 4 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE TOP-SECRET SITE

Lincoln County Emergency Manager Eric Holt told the Review-Journal the pre-signing of the emergency declaration is due to the threat of local resources being at risk by the event, both emergency response and financial, due to personnel potentially working overtime.

In addition to drafting the emergency plan, lawmakers also conditionally approved two events in tiny desert towns near the once top-secret U.S. Air Force test area.

The Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel is scheduling an event called Alienstock on Sept. 20-22, while The Alien Research Center souvenir shop in Hiko has planned a Sept. 20-21 expo.

Little A’Le’Inn owner Connie West told FOX5 on Monday she's in the process of transforming 30 acres of land into where ""Alienstock"" will take place while figuring out how to bring in enough food, water, porta-potties, and fuel for those who come.

""I don’t think anybody could ever prepare for anything like this but we're doing our absolute best and hopefully it turns out to be a phenomenal event,"" West said Monday.

'STORM AREA 51' CRAZE CONTINUES AS 2M PEOPLE PLEDGE TO RAID SECRET GOV'T MILITARY BASE

The Little A'Le'Inn is located in the town of Rachel, which has a population of only 54 and no gas station. The town's website says the nearest gas stations are located 50 miles south in Ash Springs and 110 miles north in Tonopah.

""Other than the Little A'Le'Inn, a small bar/restaurant/motel, there are no services in Rachel. There is no gas and no store,"" a post from the town reads. ""The Inn is booked for that weekend. If you plan on attending the event you must be experienced in camping, hiking and surviving in a harsh desert environment and have a vehicle in good shape.""

Officials also said they expect cell phone service and internet in the town to ""be offline,"" meaning that credit card processing will not work and those looking to venture out should bring enough cash.

""This event will undoubtedly attract crooks trying to capitalize on the chaos. Be on your guard and always lock your vehicle,"" the town states. ""And stay away from the residential part of Rachel. Most residents do not like where this event is going and will respond accordingly.""

Cory Lytle, the Lincoln County planning department director, told FOX5 the approvals were the ""lesser of two evils"" and could be revoked if the permit-holding organizers don't have insurance and traffic plans figured out by Sept. 3.

Area 51 is popularly known as the site of rumored government studies of outer space aliens. The ""Storm Area 51"" Facebook event went viral last month as people pledged to crash the secret military base in an attempt to ""see them aliens"" and has grown in scale in recent weeks. More than 2 million Facebook users have now said they are going, with over 1.4 million replying they were interested.

The event, which is scheduled to take place Friday, Sept. 20 between 3 AM and 6 AM PDT, has garnered significant media attention, enough for the Air Force to issue a statement saying that it ""would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces."" It added that it [the U.S. Air Force] ""always stands ready to protect America and its assets.""

Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee told KLAS-TV on Monday his department is reaching out to ""all our partners,"" including federal, state, and local agencies to find out what resources they'd be able to send. Lee's department only has 28 uniformed officers to cover 11,000 square miles.

""Again we don't know what to plan for,"" he said Monday. ""We're only planning for the worst, and hoping for the best.""

This Tasty Seaweed Reduces Cow Emissions by 99%and It Could Soon Be a Climate Gamechanger,http://goodnewsnetwork.org/gamechanging-pink-seaweed-reduces-cow-emissions/,"A puffy pink seaweed that can stop cows from burping out methane is being primed for mass farming by Australian researchers.

The particular seaweed species, called Asparagopsis, grows prolifically off the Queensland Coast, and was the only seaweed found to have the effect in a study five years ago led by CSIRO. Even a small amount of the seaweed in a cow’s diet was shown to reduce the animal’s gases by 99%.

Associate Professor Nick Paul, who is the leader of the Seaweed Research Group at the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC), said that if Australia could grow enough of the seaweed for every cow in the nation, the country could cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 10%.

“Seaweed is something that cows are known to eat. They will actually wander down to the beach and have a bit of a nibble,” Dr. Paul said.

“When added to cow feed at less than 2% of the dry matter, this particular seaweed completely knocks out methane production. It contains chemicals that reduce the microbes in the cows’ stomachs that cause them to burp when they eat grass.”

The USC team is working at the Bribie Island Research Centre in Moreton Bay to learn more about how to grow the seaweed species, with the goal of informing a scale-up of production that could supplement cow feed on a national—and even global scale.

“This seaweed has caused a lot of global interest and people around the world are working to make sure the cows are healthy, the beef and the milk are good quality,” Dr. Paul said.

“That’s all happening right now. But the one missing step, the big thing that is going to make sure this works at a global scale, is to make sure we can produce the seaweed sustainably.

“If we’re able to work out how to scale up the seaweed to such a level to that can feed all of the cows and the sheep and the goats around the world, then it’s going to have a huge impact on the climate; it’s going to address a whole lot of carbon-neutral agendas that different countries have; and it’s ultimately going to save us all billions of dollars,” he concluded.

The first ever early clinical trial for a vaccine for genital chlamydia has shown it to be safe and effective at provoking an immune response,http://imperial.ac.uk/news/192449/first-vaccine-chlamydia-shows-promise-early/,"The first ever early clinical trial for a vaccine for genital chlamydia has shown it to be safe and effective at provoking an immune response.

The latest findings, from a randomised controlled trial of 35 healthy women led by Imperial College London and the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, demonstrate promising early signs of what could be an effective vaccine against chlamydia.

The infection is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide and it can lead to infertility.

One of the problems we see is that people get repeatedly re-infected. If you could introduce a protective vaccine, you could break that cycle. Professor Robin Shattock Department of Infectious Disease

The researchers highlight that the work is an ‘important first step’ but add that further trials are now needed to determine whether the immune response provoked by the vaccine will effectively protect against chlamydia infection.

Professor Robin Shattock, Head of Mucosal Infection and Immunity within the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial said: “The findings are encouraging as they show the vaccine is safe and produces the type of immune response that could potentially protect against chlamydia.

""The next step is to take the vaccine forward to further trials, but until that’s done, we won’t know whether it is truly protective or not.”

Most prevalent bacterial STI

Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the most prevalent bacterial STIs, representing a major global health burden, with 131 million new cases occurring each year. However, as many as 3 out of 4 infections are symptomless, so the number of cases is likely to be underestimated.

National screening programmes and antibiotic treatment have failed to reduce infection rates, and the highest number of new cases are found in teenagers and young adults.

While infection can often be treated with antibiotics, complications can include inflammation, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, arthritis and even an increased susceptibility to other STIs, including HIV.

Professor Robin Shattock, who led the clinical research at Imperial, says the UK plays a leading role in vaccine research and development. (Image: Imperial College London / Dan Weill)

“The major issue with chlamydia is the long-term consequences,” explained Professor Shattock. “It is very treatable if identified, but as many people don’t have symptoms it can be missed, and the biggest problem is that it can go on to cause infertility in women.”

He added: “One of the problems we see with current efforts to treat chlamydia is that despite a very big screening, test and treat programme, people get repeatedly re-infected. If you could introduce a protective vaccine, you could break that cycle.”

Encouraging early results

In the latest trial, researchers compared two different formulations of the new vaccine to examine which would perform better. The 35 women not infected with chlamydia included in the trial were randomly assigned to three different groups: 15 participants received the vaccine with liposomes, 15 received the vaccine with aluminium hydroxide, and 5 received saline solution (placebo).

In total, participants received five vaccinations with three intramuscular injections in the arm over several months, followed by two intranasal boosts.

Both formulations of the vaccine provoked an immune response in 100% of participants, whereas no participants in the placebo group achieved an immune response.

Although both formulations of the vaccine were found to provoke an immune response, the added liposomes consistently performed better and produced more antibodies, so the authors suggest this formulation should be pursued for further clinical development.

The full findings are published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The group is now planning phase 2 trials.

UK risks being 'left behind'

The research was made possible through grants from the European Commission. Professor Shattock raised concerns about the future of such international collaborations and whether UK institutions can maintain their leading role in vaccine research.

“Increasingly vaccine development requires multiple partners,” said Professor Shattock. “We have a wealth of world-leading expertise in the UK, with our scientists working to tackle infections, and to discover and develop new vaccines. But if we are no longer part of that European network we may be left behind.

“It’s not just about the funding, it’s about being part of these larger projects that bring together companies and academics and a much wider portfolio of experience, technology and expertise to solve global health problems.”

The clinical trial was carried out at the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Clinical Research Facility.

Disneyland Star Wars Flops,http://foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/disneyland-slashing-worker-hours-star-wars-flops-source,"The force is not strong at Disneyland this summer and employees are feeling the pinch.

Continue Reading Below

The new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Land made its debut to the public in May of 2019 at Southern California’s Disneyland and has become a bit of a disappointment to the theme park employees whose hours and paychecks have suffered due to lack of attendance.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % DIS WALT DISNEY COMPANY 120.25 +1.71 +1.44%

“Wait times this summer for the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run ride were expected to be over 2 hours long all summer, but in reality, the lines have been averaging half that or less,” an employee, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, tells FOX Business. ""As a result, the company has been forced to cut our hours. The need for us to work simply isn't there.""

Employees are now working under 40 hours per week. “Our hours have been cut to as low as 30-35 hours some weeks, even though we have both worked for the park for years. It makes life challenging when your paychecks get cut unexpectedly"" the same source explained. A worker can earn around $15 per hour. The reduced workweek means a paycheck, before taxes, could fall from $600 to $450.

“I feel the problem is Star Wars took too long to build so they rushed the opening with only one cool feature. The only other big ride isn’t even scheduled to open until the end of the year,” the source elaborated. Disney's blog announced that the second major Galaxy's Edge feature, Star Wars: Rise Of The Resistance, won't open until early 2020.

“Some people stayed away just because they expected that it would not be a great guest experience,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said on a recent earnings call. “The second attraction in Anaheim will open in January. So we feel great about the product that we’ve created. It’s just going to take some time for things to work themselves out in terms of how the marketplace is reacting.""

Media anaylst Porter Bibb, of MediaTech Capital Partners, explains why the new Star Wars land may be struggling to pull in big numbers in it's opening fiscal quarter, ""It experienced some malfunctions due to the complex, sophisticated features but will be a compelling.attraction, especially once the new Star Wars film opens in Q4.""

“Part of the problem too has been all the hype surrounding the new Star Wars land,” the source shared. “Tourists fear the anticipated crowds and the Los Angeles locals seem to be waiting out the summer crowds too."" The source continued, ""Admission to the park is not cheap either, it is $149.00 for one park or $199.00 during peak summer weekends for a park hopper ticket. For many families, that adds up real quick.”

A spokesperson for Disney tells FOX Business, “Full-time cast members know that they are regularly scheduled between 30 and 40 hours per week and that their schedules vary depending on a number of factors.”"
"Machete plays real life Superhero Danny Trejo, rescuing boy from an overturned car.",http://usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/danny-trejo-helps-rescue-baby-from-overturned-car/amp/,"Danny Trejo is best known for playing the villain in many popular Hollywood movies, but the actor just proved offscreen he’s a real-life superhero.

The Machete actor, 75, helped rescue a little boy from an overturned car in Los Angeles following a car accident on Wednesday, August 7. Trejo — who was not involved in the crash but saw it happen — and another woman worked together to get the child out of the vehicle while firemen assisted the boy’s grandmother, who was pinned in the car.

“He was panicked. I said, ‘OK we have to use our superpowers,’” Trejo explained to ABC7, noting that he held the boy facing away from the scene in order to keep him calm. “So he screamed, ‘Superpowers’ and we started yelling, ‘Superpowers.'”

The actor later told CNN affiliate KABC: “Everything good that has happened to me has happened as a direct result of helping someone else. Everything.”

Trejo quickly became a trending topic on Twitter following the news of his heroic act. Social media users took the opportunity to praise the California native for not only his actions on Wednesday, but for the other positive work he does off movie screens.

“Danny Trejo is a f–king badass. Massive respect to him for not only this, but also for his years of volunteer work helping get drug addicts and incarcerated kids back on their feet,” one Twitter user wrote.

Another added: “We can be tough guys and compassionate…”

The official Twitter page for East LA Interchange, the 2015 documentary that Trejo narrated, also shared a sweet message in his honor.

“Our narrator Danny Trejo is a hero & an amazing human being! After saving a child from a car wreck yesterday, he said, ‘Everything good that has happened to me has happened as a direct result of helping someone else. Everything.’ Thanks @officialDannyT, for all you do for others!” the post read."

Greg Randolph said he hopes others can learn from his ordeal.

“When I go out on a desert trip any more, my neighbors are going to know where I’m going to be, what area,” Randolph said. “I’m going to take food. I’m going to take bunches of water. I’m going to be prepared. ... And I will have my medicines with me.”

“Don’t repeat what I did,” Randolph continued. “That’s what I want people to understand. That’s what I hope they get out of this little story.”

Randolph spoke to The Oregonian/OregonLive this week from his Lakeview home, where he and his dogs are recovering after a backcountry cyclist from Portland on July 18 happened upon Randolph, collapsed and in the early stages of a diabetic coma on a rarely traveled dirt road.

Randolph’s story, first reported by The Oregonian/OregonLive, has made national and international headlines as a survival tale to be celebrated, with an improbable rescue from a stranger on two wheels.

Randolph said he is a retired technician for the Oregon Air National Guard, where he welded and made parts for jets. On Sundays after church, he likes to explore the remote high desert region of Lake County, situated above the Oregon-California border with a population 7,900.

It was 10 a.m. Sunday, July 14, when Randolph set out with Cruella, his Shih Tzu, and Buddy, a Yorkshire mix, to explore the Guano Creek Slough, he said. It was a two-hour drive from Randolph’s home, and maybe 40 miles from the nearest town.

Randolph stopped and filled up the tank of his 1988 Jeep Cherokee, bought a foot-long Subway sandwich and some ice to chill the 13 bottles of water he had with him. When he got to the slough, he maneuvered off road and up a dry creek bed.

“The driving was OK,” Randolph said. “I wasn’t even in four-wheel drive yet. It was sandy and flat, and the Jeep maneuvered pretty well through it.”

When the driving got rougher and the sand softer, he shifted into four-wheel drive.

“I came around this corner and all of a sudden ... I saw this rock in front of my Jeep,” Randolph said. “Before I could react, the tire went into a depression right in front of the rock.”

The Jeep wouldn’t budge.

""I had a shovel, but I didn’t have a jack. ... Then I realized I had left my medicine at home,” said Randolph, who has Type 1 diabetes. ”I didn’t have any other food except for the Subway sandwich.”

Cellphone coverage was nonexistent.

It was about 1 p.m., and the temperature soared into the 90s, he said. Over the course of hours, he tried digging out the tires or positioning rocks underneath to give them some traction, with no success.

“I just decided ‘There’s no way you’re going to get this out,’” Randolph said.

He folded down the back seat and unrolled some sleeping bags.

“Towards about 5 o’clock, 6 o’clock, I just decided to relax and take it easy,” Randolph said. “The puppies and I, we started to sleep on and off.”

In the middle of the night, he heard screaming, which he thought sounded like a cougar. But he felt secure as long as he and his dogs stayed in the Jeep.

Randolph said Monday and Tuesday came and went, with no one passing by. He realized he needed a change of plan.

“So Tuesday night, before we settled down for the night, I started talking to the puppies,” Randolph said. “I said: ‘Now you guys, I think we’re going to have to walk out tomorrow. It’s going to be tough because once the sun gets up, it gets really hot.’”

Wednesday at 6 a.m. he grabbed his handgun for protection from cougars, wolves and rattlesnakes. Then they started walking out the way they’d driven in.

By evening, they’d made it to the Shirk Ranch, an 1881 homestead that has long since been abandoned.

“At that time, I had one bottle of water left, because I was sharing the water with my puppies,” Randolph said. “I didn’t want anything to happen to them, either.”

He barricaded himself in a bedroom and lay down on some old mattresses, with no padding and only the box springs remaining.

""About 1 o’clock in the morning, the dogs started barking and wouldn’t stop,” Randolph said. “And I’m thinking there’s something outside and it’s going around the house, because ... the dogs kept moving ... around the room. I thought something was tracking us from outside.”

It was difficult to sleep knowing that.

By Thursday at dawn, Randolph was shaking uncontrollably from the desert cold. He was wearing jeans, but only a short-sleeved T-shirt on top. He downed the last drop of water and trekked toward Highway 140, his best chance at encountering a car.

Randolph was very weak, but he thinks his military service -- he said that includes two tours during the Vietnam War -- gave him the toughness he needed to soldier on.

Randolph said he also was delirious on his fourth day with no medication. At some point, he fired off three shots with his handgun, in an international SOS signal. No one came. But the loud noise had the effect of scaring off Buddy, who ran back in the direction of the stranded Jeep, Randolph said.

“After I did that, I walked some more,” he said. “I don’t know how far, but that’s when I passed out. And the next thing I know I feel this pushing on my shoulder.”

It was Tomas Quinones, the mountain bicyclist who was on Day 6 of a 7-day, 360-mile camping trip. It was sometime after 11 a.m., and Quinones had come around a bend in the remote dirt road and spotted what he thought was a dead cow.

Quinones already had seen three so far on his trip. But when Randolph twitched, Quinones realized he was approaching a person, not a bovine.

“I thought ‘This is not good,’” Quinones later recounted. Quinones detailed the encounter on his bike camping blog.

Randolph wasn’t able to comprehend how his fortune had just turned.

Quinones told The Oregonian/OregonLive that Randolph was rolling his eyes, grunting, incoherent, sunburned and badly dehydrated. Quinones said he gave Randolph and Cruella some water, then set up his tent and tried to get Randolph inside into the shade. But he couldn’t get Randolph to move.

Quinones, 42, used his Spot personal locator beacon to summon an ambulance and a Lake County Sheriff’s deputy. With the push of an “SOS” button, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then notifies dispatchers that help is needed at specific GPS coordinates.

They waited maybe an hour, Quinones estimated, before the ambulance arrived. Randolph said he realized he was finally being rescued somewhere along that long, bumpy ride.

“When I got to Lakeview and I was in the ER, I thought I was at a Navajo hospital,” Randolph said. “That’s how far I was out.”

Doctors told Randolph his kidneys were failing and his liver was in bad shape, too, he said. That’s the first time he worried that he might die.

Deputy Buck Maganzini told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he worried Randolph might be the victim of a crime -- that someone had hurt him and then dumped him in the desert. The deputy tried to interview Randolph that first night, but his throat was too dry and he couldn’t talk. Randolph got a few words out the second day, then on the third day told the deputy the basics of what he’d been through.

That day, July 20, was the same day Oregon State Police used an airplane to locate Randolph’s Jeep and Buddy, who had managed to find his way back there. Police brought Buddy to a Lakeview animal hospital, where he joined Cruella in receiving medical care.

Maganzini estimated that Randolph walked 14 miles before collapsing. Randolph estimates it could have been twice that distance.

Randolph said his desert experience was enormously taxing, both physically and mentally. He still needs to take frequent naps, and his mind isn’t yet functioning at 100% yet.

He said he’s enormously grateful to his neighbors, friends and family. His ex-wife traveled down from Portland last weekend to clean his home and cook. One of his adult daughters ordered him a new cellphone, because he lost his somewhere on the hike out. Neighbors have checked in on him, reminded him of upcoming doctor’s appointments and picked up new medications.

Randolph said a Jeep aficionados’ club has offered to retrieve his SUV from its marooned location this weekend.

“I’ve lived in Lake County for 10 years, and I love it,” he said. “This community is really a care-about-everybody kind of community.”

His new cellphone arrived a few days ago, and now he said he has a lot of “thank yous” to make. High up on his list is Quinones.

“Thank God for Tomas,” Randolph said. “He saved my life.”

"Donald Trump on Friday downplayed recent missile tests by North Korea and flattered the country's leader as a friend with a ""great and beautiful vision for his country""",http://yahoo.com/news/us-negotiator-good-talks-japan-051947687.html#,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed recent missile tests by North Korea and flattered the country's leader as a friend with a ""great and beautiful vision for his country,"" as the U.S. tries to lure Kim Jong Un back to nuclear talks.

Trump's series of three tweets — which take great pains to excuse the actions of a man he once dismissed as ""Little Rocket Man"" — shows just how much the president has riding on North Korea. Despite widespread skepticism that Kim will give up his prized nuclear weapons program, Trump regularly touts his personal diplomacy with Kim as a great success.

Trump tweeted that North Korea's recent tests of short-range missiles weren't part of the commitments he and Kim made at their historic June 2018 summit in Singapore , although he conceded they might be in violation of a U.N. resolution.

""There may be a United Nations violation, but Chairman Kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust,"" Trump tweeted. ""There is far too much for North Korea to gain - the potential as a Country, under Kim Jong Un's leadership, is unlimited.""

Trump said Kim can only achieve his ""great and beautiful vision for his country"" if he is the U.S. president.

""He will do the right thing because he is far too smart not to, and he does not want to disappoint his friend, President Trump!""

Trump has frequently called his diplomacy a success and said the U.S. would have been war with North Korea if he hadn't made a breakthrough with Kim.

The North's new missile launches came as the United Kingdom, France and Germany — following a closed U.N. Security Council briefing — condemned the North's recent ballistic activity as violations of U.N. sanctions and urged Pyongyang to engage in ""meaningful negotiations"" with the United States on eliminating its nuclear weapons.

Trump's chief U.S. envoy to North Korea, Stephen Biegun, had hoped to meet Friday in Thailand with a representative of North Korea. But North Korea stayed away from the annual gathering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has served as a venue for their talks in the past.

Story continues

Unable to meet with a North Korean official, Biegun met with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts to discuss prospects for resuming the stalled denuclearization negotiations with the North.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier Friday that he wished North Korea had sent its foreign minister to the meeting. But he also expressed optimism that talks would resume soon.

""I always look forward to a chance to talk with him,"" Pompeo told an audience at the Siam Society. ""I wish they'd have come here. I think it would have given us an opportunity to have another set of conversations, and I hope it won't be too long before I have a chance to do that.""

Pompeo said diplomacy is often fraught with ""bumps"" and ""tos and fros,"" but stressed that the Trump administration remains willing to restart the talks, which broke down after Trump's second summit with Kim in Vietnam in late February.

Trump and Kim met again in June at the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. After that, U.S. officials expressed hope talks would resume in a matter of weeks. Despite that hope, the negotiations have remained stalled.

""We are still fully committed to achieving the outcome that we have laid out — the fully verified denuclearization of North Korea — and to do so through the use of diplomacy,"" Pompeo said Friday."
"LGBTQ Northern Ireland: 'I have never experienced any hate crime'. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Jennifer Rogan tells the BBC of her positive story.",https://bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-49194678,"Two in five LGBTQ+ people in the UK have experienced abuse in the past 12 months due to their sexuality.

In the year to the end of March, there were 281 homophobic incidents recorded by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), 201 of which were labelled as crimes - up 38 on the previous year.

Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK which has not legalised same-sex marriage - an issue that has divided the two main political parties.

After a vote by MPs, same-sex marriage and abortion - issues that have long divided the Stormont parties - now look certain to change, unless a power-sharing government returns by 21 October.

Jennifer Rogan from west Belfast, tells BBC News NI of her own predominantly positive experience of living as a gay woman in Northern Ireland.

Man successfully walks from Minneapolis to California for good cause,http://fox10phoenix.com/news/offbeat/man-successfully-walks-from-minneapolis-to-california-for-good-cause,"Several weeks ago, a young man began his journey walking from Minneapolis to California.

Now, by the end of July, Jeremy Floyd has made it.

Floyd walked halfway across the country to bring attention to homelessness and addiction. During his journey, Floyd stopped at youth shelters and rehab centers along the way to help others.

The 32-year-old man made a goal to walk 30 miles a day until he reaches his final destination: the Santa Monica Pier.

Jeremy Floyd posted to Facebook Tuesday as he crossed into San Bernadino County, gleaming with joy in front of a ""Welcome to California"" sign. He told FOX 9 he tore his meniscus in Wyoming, but met with a doctor and has been able to keep going at an average of about 26 miles per day.

""I just had to be smart and walk as much as was good for me,"" he said.

Floyd said that he's excited to return to Minnesota - especially for the State Fair!"
Employee happiness and business success are linked,http://economist.com/business/2019/07/28/employee-happiness-and-business-success-are-linked?,"O UR STAFF are our most important asset. Many managers have intoned this mantra over the years but plenty of employees have probably thought to themselves that, deep down, executives place a higher value on the machines on the factory floor or cash in the bank.

That impression can be reinforced when executives refer to the need to maximise “shareholder value”. The implication is that keeping equity investors happy is a company’s main priority. Employees fall into the lesser category of “stakeholders”, along with component suppliers.

To many American businesspeople, the concept of “stakeholder capitalism” is often seen as a woolly European notion. The assumption is that firms that focus on stakeholders will struggle to survive in the Darwinian world of multinational business.

It is easy to be cynical about some of the language used by those who argue that employees should be treated better. One obvious example is a book called “Humane Capital” by Vlatka Hlupic, which includes a foreword by the Dalai Lama and is dedicated, portentously, “to humanity”.

But there is a serious point hidden amid its grandiose statements. Too many companies operate a top-down “command and control” system, Ms Hlupic argues, when they would be better served by giving employees more freedom to make their own decisions.

However, hard-headed executives will be won round only by hard facts. A convincing case can be found in a recent * by Christian Krekel, George Ward and Jan-Emmanuel de Neve. The study, based on data compiled by Gallup, a polling organisation, covers nearly 1.9m employees across 230 separate organisations in 73 countries.

The authors studied four potential measures of corporate performance: customer loyalty, employee productivity, profitability and staff turnover. They found that employee satisfaction had a negative link with staff turnover and a substantial positive correlation with customer loyalty. It was correlated with higher productivity and, less strongly, with profitability.

Of course, correlation does not prove causality. It could be the case that working for a successful company makes employees more contented, rather than the other way round. However, the authors cite studies of changes within individual firms and organisations which seem to show that improvements in employee morale precede gains in productivity, rather than the reverse.

What might explain the link? One school of thought, known as human-relations theory, has long argued that higher employee well-being is associated with higher productivity, not least because happy workers are less prone to absenteeism or quitting. However, as the authors of the paper admit, there is precious little research on the best measures that managers can take to improve employee well-being, or indeed which are the most cost-effective.

Rather like the judge’s famous dictum about obscenity, a well-run company may be hard to define but you can recognise it when you see it. Workers will be well informed about a company’s plans and consulted about the roles they will play. Staff will feel able to raise problems with managers without fearing for their jobs. Bullying and sexual harassment will not be permitted. Employees may work hard, but they will be allowed sufficient time to recuperate, and enjoy time with their families. In short, staff will be treated as people, not as mere accounting units.

That may be a difficult approach for executives brought up on the philosophy of Frederick Winslow Taylor, an efficiency guru of the late 19th and early 20th century, who wrote of the danger that workers “tend to become more or less shiftless, extravagant and dissipated”. Armed with a stopwatch, Taylor dragooned employees into increasing production in the iron and steel industries.

Most employees no longer cart heavy loads around all day, of course. Their tasks involve creativity and empathy when dealing with the public. In service industries, staff really are a company’s most important asset. And that is why the best executives will realise that a contented workforce is a prerequisite for corporate success.■

"Disneyland ticket prices have increased more than 5,000% since 1955 opening, study finds",http://pe.com/2019/07/23/disneyland-ticket-prices-have-increased-more-than-5000-since-1955-opening-study-finds/,"Disneyland ticket prices have skyrocketed more than 5,000% since the Anaheim theme park opened in 1955, according to a new study.

A study from the United Kingdom-based Play Like Mum mommy blog looked at the rising costs of admission tickets over the past six decades at Disney theme parks around the world.

Disneyland admission cost $2.50 in 1955 compared to a $129 “regular” park ticket today, an increase of 5,060%, according to the study. Disneyland admission today costs more than 50 times as much as it did on opening day, the study found.

Disneyland officials said the experience from 64 years ago cannot be compared to today’s resort that includes two theme parks, three hotels and an outdoor shopping mall.

“Our pricing reflects a full-day of family entertainment with world-class attractions and experiences,” Disneyland officials said in a prepared statement. “Over time, our pricing model has evolved, providing guests with a variety of ticket offerings to meet their needs, while helping us to spread visitation, better manage demand and deliver a great experience, like our new 14-acre Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge.”

Adjusting for inflation, the $2.50 ticket from 1955 would cost $23.89 in 2019 dollars, an increase of 440% from Disneyland’s opening to today.

The study used Disneyland’s current $129 “regular” price ticket for comparison. Disneyland’s lowest-priced $104 off-peak “value” ticket represents a 4,060% increase compared to the 1955 ticket price. Adjusted for inflation, today’s value ticket represents a 335% increase compared to 1955.

The 1955 Disneyland admission price was based on an adult “Deluxe 15” ticket book that included admission to the park and 15 attractions.

By the park’s 10th anniversary, Disneyland’s prices rose to $7.30 and remained at that level through the 20th anniversary, the study found.

In the summer of 1981, Disneyland began offering an all-inclusive ticket with unlimited access to the theme park’s attractions as an alternative to the traditional booklet with A- to E-tickets. The next summer, the ticket books were phased out completely.

Disneyland ticket prices rose steadily to $16.50 in 1985, $31 in 1995, $56 in 2005 and $99 in 2015, according to the study.

Of course, Disneyland has changed since 1955. Back then, there was only one theme park with 33 attractions that were individually priced and accepted lettered tickets from a booklet. Today, Disneyland has tiered pricing that offers access to 56 attractions with a single admission ticket. Since 1955, Disneyland has added entire themed lands — including New Orleans Square, Critter Country, Mickey’s Toontown and Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. In 2001, the separate-admission Disney California Adventure opened in the former Disneyland parking lot.

The study found that admission prices have risen steadily at Disney theme parks around the world. Magic Kingdom ticket prices have increased more than 3,000% since the Florida park opened in 1971 at Walt Disney World, according to the study. Admission prices are up 76% at Tokyo Disneyland since 1983, 140% at Disneyland Paris since 1992 and 83% at Hong Kong Disneyland since 2005, the study found.

Disneyland raised prices in January on single- and multi-day tickets as well as annual passes ahead of the grand opening of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge."
This Incredible Device Removes Almost 100% of Salt From Seawater Using Solar Power,http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/EE/C9EE00692C#!divAbstract,"As a low-cost green technology, solar steam generation using nanostructured photothermal materials has been drawing increasing attention in various applications, e.g. seawater desalination, and zero liquid discharge of industrial wastewater. However, the crystallisation of salts on the surface of photothermal materials during steam generation leads to a gradual decline in the water evaporation rate. Herein, this challenge was overcome by a novel design involving controlled water transport, edge-preferential crystallisation and gravity-assisted salt harvesting. The crystallisation sites of the salt were spatially isolated from the water evaporation surface, achieving continuous steam generation and salt harvesting in over 600 hours of non-stop operation. The study provides new insights into the design of solar steam generators and advances their applications in sustainable seawater desalination and wastewater management."
Sometimes humans are really great. Football team steps in to make sure boy with autism has a great bday party,http://cnn.com/2019/07/24/us/birthday-party-football-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Christian Larsen begged his mother, Lindsay, to throw him a ninth birthday party so he could invite all of his friends. Finally, she gave in, sending out invitations -- and waiting.

But only one person RSVP'd.

Christian, who has autism, attends Hillsdale Elementary in Meridian, Idaho. At the picnic marking the end of the school year, Larsen says, she saw firsthand how some of the children interacted with her son: either ignoring Christian or telling him no when he asked them to attend his party. It made her think that there might be something more to the lack of responses.

On May 31, Lindsay posted on Facebook about the lack of responses, and her friend Blythe Ben-David stepped in to make a birthday miracle happen.

Ben-David lives in South Texas, far from the Larsen family. She couldn't be there for the party, so she reached out to Dan Holtry, a family friend and the football coach at Nampa High School in Idaho.

Enriched Instant Coffee Significantly Reduces Visceral and Total Fat,http://mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/7/1617/htm,"In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of daily consumption of instant coffee containing high CGA levels and decreased oxidant capacity over the course of 12 weeks in healthy overweight adult men and women (BMI ≥ 25 to <30 kg/m) for reducing abdominal fat area, with VFA as the primary endpoint measure. A significant decrease in VFA was detected in cross-sectional CT images. The secondary outcomes were TFA, body weight, BMI, and WC. Furthermore, according to the results of the diaries of subjects and physician interviews during the trial, there were no adverse events from drinking instant coffee containing high CGA levels. In a review article describing the effects of coffee on the risk of diabetes, Greenberg et al. [ 31 ] suggested that caffeine and CGA have a body weight-reducing effect. Previous studies reported benefits related to an increased CGA content, such as reductions in glucose absorption, body weight, body fat, and DNA damage [ 25 32 ]. Few randomized control trial studies, however, described the influence of CGA on body fat or abdominal visceral fat accumulation. In the present trial, compared with the control group, the CGA group showed significant decreases in VFA at 12 weeks relative to baseline. Similar results were observed for TFA. Moreover, group × time interactions were observed for BMI, body weight, and WC, which showed significant decreases relative to the control group. WC is highly correlated with VFA [ 31 ], and the findings that not only VFA, but also BMI, body weight, and WC, were significantly decreased suggest that CGA coffee has a body fat-reducing effect. The changes in body weight, BMI, and WC in the CGA group tended to be smaller than that in previous studies [ 20 26 ]. This discrepancy may be related to the seasons during which the intervention periods occurred and the daily conditions of the subjects. Further comparison studies are needed. Food intake and physical activity during the trial did not differ significantly between groups. The CGA coffee and control coffee were both instant black coffee with essentially the same amounts of caffeine and calories. Because the only difference between the components of each drink was the amount of CGA, these results suggest that CGA was responsible for the decreases in VFA, BMI, body weight, and WC. Although no studies clearly demonstrated a relationship between oxidative stress and abdominal visceral fat, one study reported that oxidant components enhance the energy expenditure and fat oxidation effects of CGA-containing coffee [ 33 ]. The mechanism underlying the effect of instant coffee containing high amounts of CGA and decreased amounts of oxidant components on decreasing abdominal visceral fat might involve both increased energy expenditure and increased fat burning. According to a human clinical trial comparing daily consumption of roasted coffee containing 359 mg CGA and placebo coffee for one week, repeated consumption of CGA decreased the respiratory quotient and increased oxygen consumption [ 34 ], which means that both energy expenditure and fat oxidation were increased. Furthermore, feeding green coffee bean extract containing CGA to mice with diet-induced obesity affects body fat accumulation, with a dose-dependent inhibition of the increase in body weight and accumulation of visceral fat and liver fat [ 35 ]. In addition, analysis of the expression of energy metabolism-related genes in the liver revealed significantly decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and ACC2, which are involved in fatty-acid oxidation, after mice were administered green coffee bean extract containing CGA for two weeks. Decreased expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and ACC1, which are involved in fatty-acid synthesis, promotes energy expenditure, and decreased ACC2 expression increases fatty-acid oxidation in the mitochondria through the reduced production of malonyl CoA, which inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 [ 36 ]. Although CGA reportedly has a hypotensive effect [ 17 38 ], no significant changes in blood pressure were observed in the present trial. Because we did not target a population with blood pressure classified as greater or equal to stage I hypertension, as in previous trials studying the hypotensive effect of CGA, we were unable to observe any blood pressure-lowering effects. In terms of safety, although we found changes in the blood concentrations of potassium, the fluctuations were within the reference range (3.5–5.3 mEg/L) and were, thus, unlikely to be clinically problematic. Moreover, urinalysis revealed no problematic changes, and no adverse events considered to be due to the test drink were reported. This study had some limitations. Firstly, our subjects were Japanese; thus, whether the same effects might occur in other populations (e.g., Western populations) remains unclear. Secondly, although CGA was the effective component in the coffee used in this trial, blood CGA concentrations were not measured. Thus, the relationships between the blood CGA concentration and the outcome measures (e.g., VFA) are unclear. Extending the test period might have revealed a clearer difference in the effect."

This US city ranks the best in the world to be a woman entrepreneur,http://cnbc.com/2019/07/16/san-francisco-bay-ranks-the-best-city-for-women-entrepreneurs-dell.html,"The Bay Area's progress this year saw New York to drop to second place, followed by London (3rd), Boston (4th) and Los Angeles (5th). The top 10 was rounded out by Washington D.C. (6th), Seattle (7th), Paris (8th), Toronto (9th) and Stockholm (10th).

Indeed, the tech hub outperformed across the report's five main metrics — markets, talent, capital, culture and technology — to surpass the high previously set by New York in 2017.

Efforts to eliminate the so-called bro culture, increased access to funding for women and ongoing tech developments were some of the ways in which the Bay Area leapfrogged its East Coast rival to rank top of the 2019 Women Entrepreneur Cities (WE Cities) Index.

The San Francisco Bay Area has overtaken New York City as the most accommodative place in the world to be a female entrepreneur, according to a new study.

The WE Cities Index, which is a joint venture between Dell Technologies and global research firm IHS Markit, ranks 50 global cities on their ability to ""attract and support high potential women entrepreneurs.""

It was launched three years ago to test how well ""already proven"" entrepreneurial hubs ""perform across the board,"" specifically in regards to women business owners, Karen Quintos, Dell's executive vice president and chief customer officer, told CNBC Make It at the launch of the report in Singapore.

While all cities recorded improvements since 2017's benchmark index, Quintos noted that all were ""still well below the 100 mark"" — the total achievable score — and showed plenty of room for progress.

The top performer, the Bay Area, scored 63.7%, marginally above the 62.9% high set by New York in 2017. The medium score across the 50 cities in 2019 was 40.3% versus 39.3%.

North America featured the greatest number of cities in the year's top 10, with a total of seven, followed by Europe, which had three. Cities in the Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East regions meanwhile were absent from the top ranks.

No region performed universally well across the five key metrics, however. While North America rose to the top of the culture pillar for its ability to embrace women entrepreneurs, Europe showed the most progress in terms of access to capital.

Latin America showed the most improvement in its ability to operate fair markets, the Middle East demonstrated the greatest tech progress and Asia Pacific exhibited an improved talent pool.

Chris Turner, vice president of government affairs at Dell, said the top performing cities were all united by strong support at a government level, which demonstrated the need for top-down action.

That should come in the form of supportive policies and business partnerships, as well as installing strong role models. ""Appointing women into government positions is one of the biggest takeaways,"" he said.

""When we invest in women, we invest in the future; communities prosper, economies thrive and the next generation leads with purpose,"" Quintos added."
The incredible correlation between IQ & income,http://pumpkinperson.com/2016/02/11/the-incredible-correlation-between-iq-income/,"In this post, I summarize all that I have learned about the actual test scores of different income levels. In particular, I compare actual psychometric data of seven U.S. economic classes: (1) the homeless, (2) welfare recipients, (3) median Americans, (4) self-made millionaires (5) self-made decamillionaires, (6) self-made billionaires, and (7) self-made decabillionaires, and largely confirm my repeated assertion that average IQ increases by 8-10 points for every ten-fold increase in income, though there may be a few major exceptions to this overall trend. Also, by analyzing the slope of the standardized regression line predicting IQ from income, I find evidence that the true correlation between IQ and income (at least in America) is much higher than the 0.23 reported in a 2006 meta-analysis and even higher than the 0.4 correlation asserted by Arthur Jensen, and may even approach 0.5.

I also find tentative but shocking evidence that the IQ gap between the richest and poorest Americans may exceed an astonishing 70 points!

In this analysis I am limiting myself entirely to test score data so IQ estimates based on ethnic composition or educational achievements of various economic classes are only occasionally mentioned to buttress the actual psychometric results. In several cases, the data is somewhat anecdotal, and speculative statistical inferences are sometimes made.

Technical note

For each economic class, I provide two normalized Z scores; one measuring the median financial success, and one measuring the mean or median cognitive ability. The normalized Z scores are just measures of where each economic class ranks (in financial success or IQ) compared to a reference group (in this case U.S. adults in general, or U.S. adults of a specific age). For example a Z of +2.33 means you’re in the top 1%, and a Z of -2.33 means you’re in the bottom 1%. A Z of 0 means you’re right in the middle, etc.

THE HOMELESS: Mean IQ 83 (U.S. norms); IQ 80 (U.S. white norms)

Median financial success: 0.09 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -3.13)

In 2015, roughly 423,750 American adults were homeless on a given night: One in 572 American adults (0.17%). Thus it can be estimated that the median homeless person is financially in the bottom 0.09%

Median cognitive ability: 12.8 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -1.17)

A 2004 study found that 90 homeless men living in a large shelter in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, had a mean WASI full-scale IQ of 83.92 (standard deviation = 15.24). The WASI was published in 1999, and this study was published in 2004, so we should subtract 1.5 points for old norms which are thought to expire at a rate of 0.3 points a year (the Flynn effect), so the homeless likely have a mean IQ of 82.5 (U.S. norms) or about 80 (U.S. white norms).

One problem with this study is that 81% of the sample was black (much higher than the 45% among homeless Americans in general) and these tend to score lower on IQ tests, at least in the general population, however a UK sample of homeless obtained virtually identical scores on the WASI, despite being 96% white.

In the UK study, the WASI full-scale IQ distribution of the homeless has a mean of 84.3. In this study, published in 2011, the WASI norms were by now even more outdated, so we should probably subtract 3.6 points for old norms, so this homeless sample have a mean IQ of 80.7 (U.S. norms) or about 78 (U.S. white norms).

Given the IQ of 80.7 (U.S. norms) among the the virtually all-white U.K. homeless sample, the IQ of 82.5 among the mostly blacks American sample is unlikely to be deflated by race, thus 83 is considered the best estimate of the American homeless.

WELFARE RECIPIENTS: Mean IQ 92 (U.S. norms); IQ 90 (U.S. white norms)

Median financial success: 8.5 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -1.4)

About 17% of U.S. adults between age 18 and 64 receive public assistance. Thus the median welfare recipient can be thought of as in the bottom 8.5% financially.

Mean cognitive ability: 30 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -0.53)

It’s common knowledge in psychometric circles that reading comprehension tests are statistically equivalent to IQ tests, and a literacy study found that about 2/3 to 3/4 of adult welfare recipients (about 71%) have what’s classified as Level 1 or Level 2 literacy. By contrast, 1/2 of the general adult population are at these levels.

Since by definition, 1/2 of Americans have IQs below 100, it can be deduced that 71% of welfare recipients have IQs below 100. In a normal distribution, the 71 percentile is 8 IQ points (0.53 sigma) above the mean, so if IQ 100 is the 71 percentile among welfare recipients, the average welfare recipient should have an IQ 8 points less.

In other words, American welfare recipients average IQ 92 (U.S. norms) or about 90 (U.S. white norms).

Some might object that my analysis falsely assumes welfare recipients have the same IQ variance as the general U.S. population, but the above cited studies of the homeless suggest that poor Americans do indeed have a similar variance to Americans on the whole.

MEDIAN AMERICAN: Mean IQ 100 (U.S. norms); IQ 97-98 (U.S. white norms)

Median financial success: 50th percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = 0)

By definition, the median American is at the 50th percentile financially.

Median cognitive ability: 50th percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = 0)

By definition, the median American is at the 50th percentile cognitively.

SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRES: Mean IQ of 118 (U.S. norms); IQ 117 (U.S. white norms)

Median financial success: 99th percentile of Americans in their 50s (normalized Z = +2.33)

According to the 2000 book The Millionaire Mind by Thomas J. Stanley, which reported on a survey of 773 millionaires (defined here by household, not individual net-worth), the typical self-made millionaire is a 54 year-old man. In the year 1998 (when the millionaires were surveyed), it took an individual income of about $340,000 to make the top 1% for 52-58-year-olds. The surveyed millionaires had a median income of $436,000, but because this was household income, their spouses likely contributed, so in individual income they were likely not much higher than the top 1%

Mean cognitive ability: 88th percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +1.2)

The average self-reported SAT score of the millionaires Stanley survey was 1190, which Stanley adjusted to about 1100 because of self-reporting bias (millionaires who were “A students” were more likely to recall their scores than “C students”). Since 90% of the sample were college graduates it’s likely virtually all took the SAT.

Since the typical self-made millionaire in the sample was 54 as of 1998, it’s likely he took the SAT circa 1961 (when he was 17). According to the book The Bell Curve (page 422), if all American young adults (not just the college bound elite) had taken the SAT in 1960, the average score (IQ 100; U.S. norms) would have been 784. Meanwhile prior to 1974, an SAT score of 1300 was considered Mensa level (IQ 130). Extrapolating from these two data points, the average self-made millionaire has an IQ of 118 (U.S. norms); 117 (U.S. white norms).

SELF-MADE DECAMILLIONAIRES: Mean IQ of 118 (U.S. norms); IQ 117 (U.S. white norms)

Image found here

Median financial status: 99.9th percentile of Americans in their 50s (normalized Z = +3.1)

20% of Stanley’s millionaire sample earned at least $1 million a year in household income, and many of these probably earned much more than that, and presumably the bulk of this was individual income made by by the head of households Stanley surveyed, not their spouses. Anyone in their 50s who has been earning a million a year for a long period of time, likely has, or will have, a net worth over $10 million (decamillionaire status). In the year 1998 (when the millionaires were surveyed), it took an individual income of about $1.25 million to make the top 0.1% for 52-58-year-olds.

Mean cognitive ability: 88th percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +1.2)

Above I noted that millionaires had a mean SAT score equating to IQ 118 (U.S. norms); 117 (U.S. white norms). Because Stanley found virtually no correlation between income or net-worth among the millionaires themselves it might be assumed that the decamillionaires in his sample also averaged IQ 118. Of course if the data was not normalized, the zero correlation might be misleading.

SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRES: Mean IQ 133 (U.S. norms); IQ 132 (U.S. white norms)

Median financial success: 99.99993 percentile for baby boomers (normalized Z = +4.8)

About 80 million Americans were born between 1946 and 1964 (the baby boomers). People in this age groups are about 42% of the richest Americans. There are 277 self-made billionaires in America (see appendix A of this document). If we assume 42% of these are boomers, then 116 of America’s 80 million boomers are self-made billionaires, which means the median self-made billionaire boomer is the 58th most prosperous out of 80 million, equating to the 99.99993 percentile.

Mean cognitive ability: 98.6 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +2.2)

Several boomer billionaires have SAT scores that are apparently publicly known. Bill Gates claims to have scored 1590 and Paul Allen reportedly scored 1600. On the pre-1995 SAT, these scores equate to IQs of about 170. I can no longer find any internet sources reporting Steve Ballmer’s composite SAT scores, but he reportedly scored a perfect 800 on the math section of the SAT which seems to equate to an IQ of 150, but given that he hit the ceiling on the test, and is rumored to be in the same IQ league as Gates himself, this is likely an underestimate. Perhaps the best publicly known measure of his IQ is his performance on William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition where he performed even better than Gates. If this source is reliable, Ballmer got one of the 100 best scores on the exam in 1974, but probably not one of the top 45, so let’s split the difference and assume he came in 73rd.

Ballmer was one of the 4,308,000 Americans born in 1956, and assuming almost all of the top math talent from his cohort went on to compete in the 1974 Putman (and whatever shortfall was made up by top foreign talent and by older and younger talent), then Ballmer’s score equates to the top 73 out of 4,308,000 (one in 59,000 level) which equates to an IQ of 162.

Thus at least three of the roughly 116 self-made boomer billionaires in America (2.6%) have tested IQ equivalents of at least 162+. It’s possible some of these scores have been exaggerated, but it’s also possible there are other super brilliant self-made billionaires with unknown high test scores. Both possibilities negate one another, making 2.6% perhaps a reasonable estimate.

In the general U.S. population, the top 2.6% have IQs of 129+, but in the self-made boomer billionaire population, the top 2.6% have IQs of 162+. This suggests their entire bell curve is shifted 33 IQ points to the right, so just as the average American has an IQ of 100, the average self-made boomer billionaire should have an IQ of 133, though given that the average is extrapolated from just three outliers (Gates, Allen and Ballmer) who all got rich from one company (Microsoft), it should be interpreted with great caution. Nonetheless, it is roughly consistent with research showing that 43% of self-made billionaires attended colleges indicative of top 1% ability (IQ 135+) (see table 1 of this document) and is also roughly consistent with the ethnic composition of the Forbes 400 richest American list, though there are some anomalies.

Some might object that my estimate for the average IQ of self-made boomer billionaires assumes the super rich have the same IQ variance as the general U.S. population, however a study of the homeless (cited way above) found that even folks at the economic extreme have a standard deviation of 15, like Americans as a whole.

SELF-MADE DECABILLIONAIRES: Mean IQ 151 (U.S. norms); IQ 151 (U.S. white norms)

Median financial status: 99.99999th percentile of baby boomers (normalized Z = +5.23)

Of the 80 million Americans baby boomers, only 13 were self-made decabillionaires in the Oct 19, 2015 issue of Forbes magazine, so the median self-made decabillionaire boomer is the 6.5th most prosperous person in that age group (one in 12.3 million)

Mean cognitive ability: 99.97 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +3.4)

Of the 13 self-made decabillionaire boomers, at least three (23%) reportedly have test scores equating to IQs of 162+ (Gates, Allen and Ballmer as mentioned above).

If we assume that the IQs of self-made decabillionaire boomers are roughly normally distributed with the same variance as in the general U.S. population (see above), then the fact that 23% have 162+ IQs implies an average IQ of 151, though given the small number of data points, this could just be a fluke.

But it’s worth noting that self-made decabillionaires have perhaps roughly double the rate of elite college attendance as U.S. self-made billionaires in general. Futher, when I analyzed the ethnic and racial background of self-made decabillionaires in 2009 (all generations) it implied a mean IQ of about 150.

Despite this corroboration, an IQ of 151 is so incredibly high that it should still be considered tentative. And even assuming its veracity, it may only apply to decabillionaires of the baby boomer cohort and younger. Older decabillionaires came of age before the rise of high tech and big data, and thus may not have needed anywhere near as much IQ to get rich.

One might not think an IQ of 151 is that extreme for elites given that SAT IQ equivalents this high are not uncommon at the most elite colleges in America, however it’s worth repeating yet again that the IQs of elite college students will regress precipitously when they move from the SAT (the test that selected them) to a neutral IQ test. By contrast, decabillionaires were mostly selected by the market, and only partly by their SAT scores creating opportunities, so unlike Ivy League students, their SAT IQ equivalents are perhaps not inflated by selection bias.

Summary

Below is a summary of the data in bar graph form:

Below is a summary of the above data in table form.

economic class median earned income median wealth financial success (normalized u.s. z for age grouping) iq (u.s. z) iq (u.s. norms) iq (u.s. white norms) self-made decabillionaires 10 figures 11 figures +5.23 +3.4 151 151 self-made billionaires 9 figures 10 figures +4.8 +2.2 133 132 self-made decamillionaires 7 figures 8 figures +3.1 +1.2 118 117 self-made millionaires 6 figures 7 figures +2.33 +1.2 118 117 median income 5 figures 5 figures 0 0 100 97-98 welfare 4 figures 4 figures -1.4 -0.53 92 90 homeless 3 figures 1 figure -3.13 -1.17 83 80

For every ten-fold increase in income, mean IQ increases 8-10 points

The simplest way to think of the IQ income relationship is that for every ten-fold increase in income, average IQ increases 8-10 points (U.S. white norms). Of course there are some major anomalies. Self-made decabillionaires are 10 times more prosperous than self-made billionaires, yet appear to score 19 IQ points higher, though these numbers are tentative given limited data. Meanwhile self-made decamillionaires are ten times more prosperous than self-made millionaires, yet appear, based on Thomas Stanley’s research, to be equally intelligent. One possible reason for this is that the the correlation between IQ and money is partly mediated by years of education, but once you have enough education to be a millionaire (i.e. law school or medical school), even more schooling doesn’t help much. and may even have opportunity costs.

These anomalies notwithstanding, when I graphed average IQ (Y axis) as a function of income (number of figures earned per year)(X axis), there was a nice linear relationship overall: IQ (U.S. white norms) = 9.487319(number of figures) + 52.57971

Standardized regression slope & correlation coefficient

I also graphed average IQ as a function of money again, but this time expressed as normalized Z scores, with average IQ of the seven economic classes on the Y axis, and median financial success on the X axis:

IQ Z score = 0.489421(financial normalized Z score) + 0.135804

As the above graph shows, there’s a virtually perfect (r = +0.97) correlation between economic class and mean/median measured intelligence, when both variables are expressed as normalized Z scores.

Note, this near-perfect correlation between median financial success and mean IQ should not be confused with the correlation between individual IQ and individual financial success. The former is known as as an “ecological” correlation commonly used in epidemiological research, and tends to be higher because individual level variation cancels outs. However because the Z scores are based on the normalized distributions of individuals, the slope of the regression line (+0.49) will equal the individual level correlation.

The actual scatter plot of a random group of individuals (with IQ Z on the Y axis and income Z on the X axis) would probably look as follows:

Notice first that the range of Z scores on both the X and Y and axis is much less. That’s because most people in a random sample of Americans are ordinary in both income and IQ. Note also the enormous variation around the line of best fit.

Now if you extended the range of X and Y much much further, and if you plotted the mean Y for every X, instead of every Y for every X, you should get a scatter plot that looks very much like the ecological scatter plot.

But note that in both the the ecological scatter plot, and the individual scatter plot, the slope should be the same because the line of best fit can be thought of as a line connecting the average Y of a given X, so graphing average Ys instead of individual Ys, does not change the line of best fit, it simply eliminates almost all the scatter around it.

Discussion

A correlation of 0.49 is more than double the 0.23 correlation between IQ and income reported in a 2006 meta-analysis by Tarmo Strenze and nearly triple the 0.16 correlation between IQ and net-worth found in a 2007 study by Jay L Zagorsky, however it is similar to the 0.4 correlation between IQ and income asserted by authoritative Arthur Jensen in his 1998 book The g Factor.

Why did my indirect method (regression slope analysis) result in double the correlation found by Strenze’s meta-analysis of direct studies of IQ and income?

Many studies are based on individual income instead of household income. Because many women (and some men) choose not to work outside the home, their individual incomes are technically zero, but they should not be considered the equivalent to a homeless person with zero income, because they are in fact working in the home and thus earning at least some of their household income. Because there’s no agreement on how to quantify such indirect forms of income, it’s not counted which greatly limits the IQ-income correlation. Using household income instead of individual income seems to result in a higher correlation between IQ and income (+0.37) but even this is an imperfect solution, because all adults within a household don’t contribute equally to the household income.

In addition, many studies use only a single year’s income which is obviously quite unreliable, since massive income fluctuations can occur from year to year.

In my analysis, both of these problems were sidestepped because data points were collected primarily from head of households (self-made millionaires, self-made billionaires) or non-households (the homeless) so you didn’t have to worry about how to deal with indirect income (i.e. the spouse of a millionaire who technically earns nothing, but earns her million dollar life by being a good wife).

Also, my analysis focused on fairly stable economic classes (homeless, welfare, millionaires, billionaires) that reflect lifelong patterns of financial success, and not just a single year’s income.

All this may explain why I found a much higher IQ-income correlation than is usually reported.

A reader informed me of an excellent analysis by Dalliard of Human Varities who found that in a large representative sample of Americans in their 30s and 40s, a single year’s income correlated 0.31 with IQ, but averaging income over many years increased the correlation to 0.36. When Dalliard looked at the correlation in only men (thus, also sidestepping the complication that many women earn their lifestyle as wives instead of through direct income), the correlation leaped to 0.48 (virtually identical to the 0.49 correlation I also found by sidestepping these two problems)."
"Reassuring Chinese data nudges shares higher. Surprisingly upbeat economic soundings from China lifted the global markets mood on Monday, pushing world shares towards an 18-month high and steering the Aussie dollar and copper upwards.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-global-markets/reassuring-chinese-data-nudges-shares-higher-idUKKCN1UA01H,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks rose modestly on Monday after economic data from China came in as expected, but equities on Wall Street slipped on weakness in financials in the wake of Citigroup’s earnings report.

China’s second-quarter annual GDP growth rate fell to a 27-year low of 6.2%, as expected, while June reports on industrial production, retail sales and urban investment were above forecasts.

On Wall Street, major indexes were near flat, with the S&P kept in check after its first close above the 3,000 mark by a 0.5% decline in financial stocks following Citigroup earnings. The bank’s shares were last off 0.06% after losing as much as 2.4%.

“It’s definitely a wait-and-see environment,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.

“If (results) are better than expected, then we can see another leg up.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26.86 points, or 0.1%, to 27,358.89, the S&P 500 gained 0.52 point, or 0.02%, to 3,014.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.04 points, or 0.17%, to 8,258.19.

Equities have rallied since a sell-off in May as investors have grown more confident the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate by at least a quarter point late this month. Improving economic data, however, could complicate the Fed’s ability to lower rates.

Corporate earnings are also moving into focus with a slew of banks scheduled to follow Citi this week, including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. According to Refinitiv data, S&P 500 companies’ earnings are expected to show a decline of 0.3 percent for the quarter.

Other major companies scheduled to post results this week include Netflix, Microsoft and Honeywell.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.23% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.14%.

Germany’s Economy Ministry said it expected the economy to turn in a weak second quarter and said significant risks remain, buoying expectations the European Central Bank would take further easing measures at its meeting next week. Germany’s DAX closed up 0.52%.

Later in the week, U.S. retail sales and industrial production data will provide clues about the health of the world’s largest economy. The Fed will release its “Beige Book” on Wednesday and investors will look to it for insight on how trade tensions are affecting the business outlook.

U.S. Treasury yields were lower with investors eyeing the retail sales data due on Tuesday. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.0887%, down from 2.106% late on Thursday.

Oil prices lost ground on signals the impact of Tropical Storm Barry on the U.S. Gulf Coast would have a short-term impact on production. U.S. crude settled down 1.05% at $59.58 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.48, down 0.36% on the day.

High school students offer a silent ovation while a classmate with autism receives his diploma,http://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/07/09/us/jack-higgins-autism-silent-graduation-trnd/index.html?__twitter_impression=true,"(CNN) At his high school graduation, Jack Higgins approached the stage to receive his diploma with his fingers in his ears to block what he thought would be applause and cheers.

Instead, he was met by silence.

Higgins is a familiar face in the cafeteria, library, hallways and classrooms of Carmel High School, and he's well-known there. He has a severe form of autism and is sensitive to noise. After eight years in the school's program for students with cognitive, learning or behavior challenges, he was ready to graduate on June 20.

His parents, Barbara and Pat, wanted him to participate in the ceremony, and they approached his teacher Erin Appelle about it. However, there were concerns that he would be overwhelmed sitting for hours in a large auditorium surrounded by hundreds of people.

""In our school we have a banner as you enter all of our school buildings # WhatsBestforKids,"" Lou Riolo, principal of Carmel High in Putnam County, New York, wrote in an email. ""It sounds corny but makes sense. But in this case what was best for Jack?""

Riolo had an idea: have everyone sit in silence as Higgins walked across the stage.

Knowing that this was an important moment for Higgins, Riolo approached members of his staff, and they immediately bought in. Higgins' parents were thrilled with the idea as well.

""It was important to pull this off,"" Riolo said. ""First off for Jack, second for his family who could experience the same event as every other parent/family whose child reaches this milestone was of great importance. Lastly to give the opportunity to everyone in that arena a chance to assist in making one young man's and his families graduation dreams a reality.""

Students can often be unpredictable and rebellious, and getting everyone to agree would not be easy. But when people asked Riolo whether the staff thought they could pull it off, his answer was always yes.

""You often have to give people the opportunity to rise to an occasion,"" he said. ""I truly believe people have a kind, compassionate soul and they want to help and this was one of those occasions.""

Before calling Higgins to the graduation stage, Riolo asked everyone in attendance at Western Connecticut State University's O'Neill Center to keep quiet and offer only a soft golf clap.

Flanked by his two brothers and school aide Rob Ancona, Higgins approached the stage with his fingers in his ears, but the loud noises he expected after weeks of practice runs with his teacher were nowhere to be heard.

He received a silent standing ovation.

""The students were amazing,"" Riolo said. ""They are a class act and superseded expectations. For example them rising to their feet after Jack received his diploma was them. It was not preplanned and no one told them to act like that that. They felt compelled to show their support in that way. They made that amazing compassionate gesture on their own.

""I have been lucky and blessed to see some really remarkable things in my 31 year career but this so far has to be the most incredible. But as much as the students rose to the occasion so did Jack. Since Jack is very limited verbally, how overwhelming was if for him with a large crowd and expectation that it would be loud.? It was so brave of him to take that walk which must have seemed like forever and he did it with grace, class and strength."""
Promising approach to curing spina bifida gets $5.6 million,http://health.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/surgery/13373,"(SACRAMENTO) —

The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) has awarded a $5.66 million grant to UC Davis Health researchers who are pursuing a new approach to repairing the birth defect that causes spina bifida.

Diana Farmer, with Aijun Wang (center) and their research team in 2015.

Led by Diana Farmer, professor and chair of surgery, and Aijun Wang, associate professor of surgery and biomedical engineering, a UC Davis research team will have the funding to continue its work with mesenchymal stem cells, taken from a donor placenta, and a form of biomaterial scaffold that is placed over the condition’s injury site in the womb. Animal modeling has shown this approach capable of repairing the defect caused by spina bifida and preventing the paralysis associated with it.

­­In spina bifida, the spinal cord doesn’t form properly and in many cases it leaves a section of it open, exposing tissues and nerves. The condition is the most common cause of lifelong paralysis and frequently leads to other serious health problems affecting the bowel and bladder. The current standard of care is surgery, which still leaves almost 60 percent of children unable to walk independently.

Three years ago, the state stem cell agency provided Farmer and Wang with an initial $2.2 million preclinical development award to advance their innovative work to help address what is a devastating condition for babies born with the disorder and the families who care for them. In 2017, the team announced that two bulldog puppies were the first “patients” to be successfully treated with their unique stem cell therapy.

“CIRM has funded this important work from its earliest stages and we are committed to working with Dr. Farmer’s team to moving this work to the stage where it can be tested in patients.” said Maria T. Millan, and CEO of CIRM, in a statement announcing the award.

This latest grant provides funding will enable the UC Davis team to perform final testing and preparations needed for FDA approval to start a human clinical trial.

Farmer, Wang and their research team have been working on their novel approach for more than 10 years, and they are excited about being able to take it to the next step.

“There were many times of frustration, many times when cell types we explored and worked with didn’t work,” Farmer said. “But it’s the patients, seeing them, talking to them and working with them, that keeps me motivated to do the science, to keep persevering.”

Farmer, Wang and their UC Davis colleagues note that if their therapy is successful it will have an economic benefit for California and beyond. Because spina bifida is a lifelong condition involving multiple surgeries, many stays in the hospital and, in some cases, the lifelong use of a wheelchair, it has enormous financial and psychological impacts on families.

“This work is so fulfilling, and we are grateful to CIRM for enabling it to continue,” added Wang, who also is co-director of the university’s Surgical Bioengineering Laboratory and a principal investigator at the Institute for Pediatric Regenerative Medicine. “Because this is a rare disease, funding can be very difficult. California’s stem cell agency has been a perfect partner in helping bring our approach, blending stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, together to help these patients and their families.”"
High school students offer a silent ovation while a classmate with autism receives his diploma,http://cnn.com/2019/07/09/us/jack-higgins-autism-silent-graduation-trnd/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2019-07-09T20%3A04%3A01&utm_source=fbCNN&r=http%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com,"(CNN) At his high school graduation, Jack Higgins approached the stage to receive his diploma with his fingers in his ears to block what he thought would be applause and cheers.

Instead, he was met by silence.

Higgins is a familiar face in the cafeteria, library, hallways and classrooms of Carmel High School, and he's well-known there. He has a severe form of autism and is sensitive to noise. After eight years in the school's program for students with cognitive, learning or behavior challenges, he was ready to graduate on June 20.

His parents, Barbara and Pat, wanted him to participate in the ceremony, and they approached his teacher Erin Appelle about it. However, there were concerns that he would be overwhelmed sitting for hours in a large auditorium surrounded by hundreds of people.

""In our school we have a banner as you enter all of our school buildings # WhatsBestforKids,"" Lou Riolo, principal of Carmel High in Putnam County, New York, wrote in an email. ""It sounds corny but makes sense. But in this case what was best for Jack?""

New Zealander with 'notorious' face tattoo is grateful he's finally got a job,http://ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/new-zealander-with-notorious-face-tattoo-is-grateful-he-s-finally-got-a-job-1.4498675,"Having rapper 50 Cent mocking you for being unemployed wasn’t the greatest feeling in the world for one New Zealander.

Last month, famed drug dealer-turned-rapper 50 Cent posted a screenshot of an article about a former inmate who said his biggest hurdle to landing a job was the black and red “notorious” tattoo that covers most of his face.

50 Cent sarcastically wrote on Instagram: “I wonder why he couldn’t get a job.” The subject of the rapper’s mockery was 31-year-old Puk Kireka.

Since 2008, Kireka has been a member of the Mongrel Mob -- an organized New Zealand street gang made up of 30 chapters, some of which are connected with drug dealing and a handful of murders.

While he was deeply involved with the gang, Kireka had half of his face inked to honour his “brothers who’ve passed away.” He said the tattoo carries a lot of meaning to him but “doesn’t expect a lot of people to understand.”

“When I first got the tattoo, everywhere I went, everyone would just be staring at me and looking at me like I wasn’t even a human sometimes,” he told CTVNews.ca via Instagram.

Kireka has been in prison twice – serving three years for violent crimes and two years for extortion -- but he said he hasn’t been back since 2016.

Since then, the father of three has been trying to turn his life around. He’s stopped using methamphetamine, landed a spot as a player on the Tamatea Rugby Club, and joined a 13-month fitness program with the team’s head coach Levi Armstrong.

“There, I fell in love with fitness and sports and made me want to get a career in it,” Kireka said. He soon enrolled at the Eastern Institute of Technology in Napier, New Zealand, where he’ll start a four-year degree in sport and exercise science later this month.

But the problem was he had no way to pay for it. Last month, his story went viral with several local news outlets reporting how Kireka hadn’t been able to find a job.



KIREKA’S NEW BOSS OFFERING TO PAY FOR HIS SCHOOL

He was widely mocked on social media but one local business owner Robbie Gale had a different response.

Gale told CTVNews.ca over Facebook he was inspired by Kireka’s determination and offered him a job as his personal trainer and a labourer at a local construction firm.

When Gale reached out, Kireka said he felt “pretty excited. I didn’t know what to think at the time.” And, as an act of good faith, his new employer even agreed to pay for his first year of tuition.

Gale told Stuff magazine the gesture was all about having Kierka’s long-term success be an example to other gang members.

""I have invested in Puk to teach him skills that will not only change his life but that of his future generations,"" Gale told the publication. “I think if we all commit to helping just one person in their life, we could solve a lot of the problems that exist in our society.""

Kireka said he “felt real thankful that he (Robbie) had come into his life at the right time. I believe that everything happens for a reason.”

Since last week, he and Gale have begun training and will attend five gym sessions a week together.

Kireka is grateful for the steady work because, after being rejected so many times, he was in a “place in your mind where you feel like nobody is going to help you.”

When pressed by CTVNews.ca if he’d remain with his gang, he said he wasn’t going to renounce his membership any time soon. But he hoped his example of walking the straight and narrow will inspire others to stop their criminal activities like him.

""I will always be a mobster but it's important to show we can have better lifestyles,” he told The New Zealand Herald newspaper. “I want to bring some of the others on board this better lifestyle.

But Kireka admits that he probably wouldn’t have landed his job without his story being mocked by the likes of 50 Cent.

""Well now, I’m kind of grateful for it all,” he laughed, adding he doesn't regret getting his tattoo -- even after everything he's been through."
Cockroaches are becoming immune to insecticides. Have a great day.,http://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/02/us/cockroaches-resistant-super-bug-insecticide-trnd/index.html?utm_source=fbCNN&utm_content=2019-07-03T01%3A01%3A47&utm_term=link&utm_medium=social,"(CNN) If it's not the heat death of the Earth that consumes us; if we are not snuffed out by blight, famine and the volatile hubris of mankind, it's only a matter of time before the cockroaches rise up and conquer us all. They are growing stronger.

They are keen to our defenses and devour them, snickering all the while at our impotent pest control burlesque. If things continue down this dark path the exterminated, in time, will become the exterminators.

This fatalistic vision is brought to you by the very disturbing news that cockroaches have apparently begun to develop a cross-resistance to powerful insecticides.

Scientists from Purdue exposed German cockroaches to different insecticides , and found that the cockroach populations not only developed a resistance to the insecticide they were exposed to, but also picked up resistances to other insecticides.

The super-immune insects can then pass their resistance on to their offspring, making it only a matter of time before a given population becomes, essentially, insecticide-proof.

"A Total Solar Eclipse Is Coming Tomorrow, And It Will Be a Striking Amber Colour",http://sciencealert.com/the-world-s-about-to-experience-another-solar-eclipse,"It's been nearly two years since the ""Great American Eclipse"". Millions crammed into a 70-mile (110-kilometer) wide path of totality stretching from coast to coast, where the Moon blotted out the Sun to usher in a spontaneous nightfall. It was a planetary cavalcade unlike anything most had seen.

This Tuesday, Earth will again find itself the backdrop of the Moon's shadow, but this time, basking in the lunar umbra won't be so easy. Though the path of totality spans 6,000 miles (9,600 kilometres), most of it is over the remote South Pacific.

Only a narrow zone in Chile and Argentina will witness totality before sunset - weather permitting.

This time around will be a higher-stakes but higher-reward event. It's winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and Mother Nature's caprice manifests itself in the chaotic conditions of the Andes Mountains.

La Serena - a coastal city of 200,000 about 250 miles (400 kilometres) north of Santiago and the first community to be plunged into darkness - is frequently buried beneath a deck of marine stratus clouds.

Making matters more complicated is the low elevation of the Sun. Since totality strikes at 4:38 pm local time - just one hour, 18 minutes before sunset - the solar disk will hover a mere 13 degrees above the northwest horizon as the Moon intercepts its light.

That means even distant clouds could spoil the show. During the 2017 eclipse, the Sun was 60 degrees high, so the only clouds that mattered were the those directly above. The eclipse in Chile will be much trickier.

The eclipse also could boost cloud cover near the coast. As incoming light drops and temperatures fall, an ""inversion"" will strengthen as the ground cools faster than the air. That will speed up the production of ocean stratus clouds even more.

There is the option to go inland in hopes of escaping the pesky marine layer, but that would be no easy feat. Only one major road - Route 41, partially paved and largely dirt - snakes its way inward within the path of totality.

What are your plans for 2 July? We're celebrating 50 years of La Silla Observatory #LaSilla50Years and a Total Solar Eclipse #LaSillaTSE. Watch our live webcast of the eclipse at https://t.co/bXJPfeOhji (photo simulation) https://t.co/yZrGz0ands pic.twitter.com/ocnCIlYPr7 — ESO (@ESO) June 24, 2019

The addition of hundreds of thousands of astrotourists will bring traffic like never before, meaning anyone hoping to spot the eclipse needs to be in position by lunchtime. And that late in the day, many viewing locations will be shadowed by mountains and hills, making finding an unobstructed viewing location all the more challenging.

Amid all the hurdles, the payoff of this eclipse will be worth it. The reason? It has to do with the shape and speed of the Moon's umbra, the dark center portion of its shadow.

Because the eclipse occurs within an hour-and-a-half of sunset, the corona will appear tinged in a splendid amber shade.

The corona is the Sun's atmosphere, and the only time us earth-dwellers can bask in its glory is during a solar eclipse. (For those who haven't seen it, no picture or words can describe it. You have to see it to understand why people fly 10,000 miles for something that lasts 2½ minutes.)

Because of the low Sun angle, the umbra will be longer. It's like how your shadows lengthen as the day wears on. That will push the 360-degree sunrise effect farther down toward the horizon, darkening the skies directly above and allowing more stars to shine than in 2017.

Chile is known for having little light pollution, and with many towns escaping the ""thick air"" near the ground at elevations of 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) or more, the eclipsed sky will be even more spectacular.

Chile's characteristically dark skies make it a utopia for astronomers. Some of the best observatories in the world - such as the La Silla or Gemini South observatories - are in the path of totality.

The shadow also will move in faster than during 2017, heightening the experience of sudden nightfall. And with an eclipsed Sun close to the horizon, it will be possible to line up epic shots of ground features with the eclipse.

The 130-mile (210 kilometer) wide shadow will continue east at speeds topping 10,000 mph (16,000 km/h), arriving in the southern suburbs of Buenos Aires minutes before sunset.

Anyone in Argentina's capital can drive 20 minutes south to watch the eclipsed Sun sink below the horizon.

Within a couple weeks of the eclipse, it's also possible to predict the shape of the corona. Due to a lack of sunspots and a quiet time in the solar cycle, the corona won't be quite as dynamic as last time - but an elegant double-petal pattern should still gracefully emerge.

This is what the corona will likely resemble during the #eclipse on July 2nd.



Why not a more dynamic corona? We're at solar minimum, meaning - save for connecting field lined between the poles - we have few regions of magnetic flux or any coronal loops. https://t.co/0YAq3GT9QI pic.twitter.com/mM4qVtVR94 — Matthew Cappucci (@MatthewCappucci) June 22, 2019

This will mark the second of three total solar eclipses in Chile and Argentina this decade. The next - on 14 December 2020 - will pass over Chile's highly scenic lakes region before swooping east into Argentina.

And an added bonus? It will occur during the Geminid Meteor Shower, meaning the darkened midday sky will feature a spattering of shooting stars.

Here in the US, we only have to wait five more years: The next total solar eclipse will occur on 8 April 2024.

Breathtaking: Keanu Reeves supports Rome cinema collective attacked by far right.,http://theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/keanu-reeves-supports-rome-cinema-collective-attacked-by-far-right,"Hollywood names including Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe and Alejandro González Iñárritu have come out in support of an Italian cinema collective who have become a target of the far right.

Cinema America, which organises free outdoor movie screenings in Rome, has issued a message of support on its Facebook page after four people were attacked following a showing of the Paul Schrader film First Reformed. The message reads in Italian: “It is unacceptable that there is still someone that thinks they can impose their view through the use of violence … We can’t accept a wound of this kind, inflicted not only to the world of art and cinema but to the whole world.” The letter was also signed by the directors Alfonso Cuarón, Spike Lee, Guillermo del Toro, and Stephen Frears and the actors Jeremy Irons, Debra Winger, Richard Gere and John Malkovich.

Reports in the Italian media suggest that at least one of the men accused of perpetrating the attack on 16 June belong to the far-right Blocco Studentesco (Students’ Bloc), the youth wing of the neo-fascist CasaPound political party.

In an interview with Indiewire, Cinema America’s founder, Valerio Carocci, said: “We are under attack because we can talk to the vast majority of people in a very bipartisan way. It is pretty clear that all over the world right now, there is some message going on that the use of private violence is OK.”

Schrader, who also signed the letter, said: “What’s happening here is something that is very reminiscent of what was happening almost 50 years ago, where a cinema movement is morphing into a political movement.”"
"I have smoked cannabis for almost 20 years and I've loved every minute. I have never considered the fact that I have stopped dreaming, & I get mega lucid dreams when I stop for a few days. What is happening here? Some say CBD makes you dream again too has anyone found the same?",http://canaxen.com/news/does-cbd-oil-affect-dreams/,"Does CBD Oil Affect Your Dreams? Many Peo…

Have you noticed any changes to your dreaming after using CBD oil? Many people are coming forward with stories of increased lucid dreaming & better recall.

2 minute read

Stop Yawnings, Improve Mornings

CBD oil for us at CanaXen has always had an alerting effect. An awesome natural alternative to coffee, that stops the yawns.

“it is clear that pure CBD in low to moderate doses is alerting, some Califonians are using CBD to replace Caffiene”

Ethan Russo Ph.D. – Neuroscientist & Director of R & D at the International Cannabis & Cannabinoids Institute

Odd then that we should be discussing its power on sleep and dreaming. Not so!

From as far back as 2011 when we first started making oils. Our founder heard how CBD had assisted sleep for many customers.

CBD, In Your Dreams

People would seek CBD oil for certain issues. But be pleasantly surprised with something unexpected like sleep improvements.

What did shock us, however, were reports about CBD and dreams. This is something we have heard very little of until recently.

“The most important thing is to sleep eight hours the night before a shoot but it’s hard because the mind gets anxious, so I use CBD oil & it helps me drift off.”

Allessandro Ambrosio – Victoria’s Secret Model

When we looked deeper what we found was rather exciting. It seems CBD has a profound and exciting effect on dreaming.

This effect does not seem to be true across the board. Most of the lucid dreamers used whole plant extract rather than CBD crystals!

So what is actually going on here if CBD acts as a wake-up aid?!

Dream On, THC

If you have ever consumed regular cannabis frequently. You may be aware that dreaming can be very much affected.

We do not suggest you try this at home to find out. Very little is actually known about this frequently reported phenomena.

“THC affects dreams. Stoners say they don’t have dreams but if they stop smoking for a few days, they are inundated with them.”

Dr. Jann Gumbiner Ph.D.

Apparently, we still dream whilst in THC affected REM sleep. But perhaps the mechanisms we use to recall nightly wanderings.

Are simply switched off when folk consume high levels of THC.

The High at Night

Studies have been conducted regarding this subject. Although few and far between some amazing insights have been noted.

“Feinberg, et al. (1975) reported reduced eye movement activity and less REM sleep in the THC condition. They also reported a REM rebound effect, that is more REM activity, on withdrawal from THC.”

Gumbiner Continued.

In the study, it suggests different levels of REM sleep. Cannabis bypasses the first layers by leaping straight to the deeper ones.

So we still dream we just don’t spend much time, if any. Basking in the relevant REM sleep level for dream recall.

“So there exists some scientific evidence that cannabis interferes with REM sleep.”

Gumbiner Finished

Fear not if you are a cannabis smoker, it is likely no damage being caused. But think of the amazing dreams you are missing.

Why not get into CBD oil and stop hurting your lungs with cannabis smoke!

Why Does CBD Do This?

What then could be causing the lucid dreaming? The answer lies in the oils themselves.

Crystal CBD mixed into olive oil or similar has become the norm. Most products you see today are the result of hundreds of people who have simply jumped on the CBD bandwagon and decided to ‘make their own’.

These oils may be a good wake-up and assist you in staying on your A game. They do not have the power of a whole plant extract.

Why Whole Plant?

Products that contain everything from the incredible plant are simply better for you. Much like orange juice with bits in.

“Other influences can be operative with regards to dreaming, we can thank CBD for the better recall and lucidity i feel.”

Dr. Russo Said

In a whole plant oil, you will find terpenes such as mycrene. This could be one of the reasons CBD oils are improving dreams.

Many studies have found that mycrene, as well as other terpenes and flavonoids. Have profound effects on the body.

“Specifically, most whole plant CBD extracts are rich in myrcene, producing the misimpression that CBD is sedating, that would also encourage sleep.”

He Finished.

These amazing compounds seem to affect systems from homeostasis to the ECS. Last but not least, sleep and dreaming.

Interestingly enough these are the compounds that give oranges, fruits, herbs their incredible flavours and tastes."
New research provides medical proof vacation is good for your heart,http://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-06/su-nrp062019.php,"Research conducted at Syracuse University provides medical evidence that a person can reduce their metabolic symptoms - and therefore their risk of cardiovascular disease - simply by going on vacation

We all treasure our vacation time and look forward to that time when we can get away from work. With the arrival of summer comes the prime vacation season and along with it one more reasons to appreciate our vacation time: the value to our heart health. While there has been much anecdotal evidence about the benefits of taking a vacation from work, a new study by Syracuse University professors Bryce Hruska and Brooks Gump and other researchers reveals the benefits of a vacation for our heart health.

""What we found is that people who vacation more frequently in the past 12 months have a lowered risk for metabolic syndrome and metabolic symptoms,"" says Bryce Hruska, an assistant professor of public health at Syracuse University's Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics. ""Metabolic syndrome is a collection of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. If you have more of them you are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. This is important because we are actually seeing a reduction in the risk for cardiovascular disease the more vacationing a person does. Because metabolic symptoms are modifiable, it means they can change or be eliminated.""

Bottom line: A person can reduce their metabolic symptoms - and therefore their risk of cardiovascular disease - simply by going on vacation.

Hruska says that we are still learning what it is about vacations that make them beneficial for heart health, but at this point, what we do know that it is important for people to use the vacation time that is available to them. ""One of the important takeaways is that vacation time is available to nearly 80 percent of full-time employees, but fewer than half utilize all the time available to them. Our research suggests that if people use more of this benefit, one that's already available to them, it would translate into a tangible health benefit.""

"If you want to be healthy and happy, choose a conscientious partner, suggests a new study (n=182 couples), which found that a conscientious partner is good for your health, and also good for your quality of life, showing how your partner's personality can influence your life.",http://theconversation.com/want-to-be-healthy-and-happy-choose-a-c-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-t-i-o-u-s-p-a-r-t-n-e-r-114520,"Y⁠o⁠u⁠r⁠ ⁠p⁠a⁠r⁠t⁠n⁠e⁠r⁠’⁠s⁠ ⁠p⁠e⁠r⁠s⁠o⁠n⁠a⁠l⁠i⁠t⁠y⁠ ⁠c⁠a⁠n⁠ ⁠i⁠n⁠f⁠l⁠u⁠e⁠n⁠c⁠e⁠ ⁠y⁠o⁠u⁠r⁠ ⁠l⁠i⁠f⁠e⁠ ⁠i⁠n⁠ ⁠a⁠l⁠l⁠ ⁠s⁠o⁠r⁠t⁠s⁠ ⁠o⁠f⁠ ⁠w⁠a⁠y⁠s⁠. For example, studies have shown that a conscientious partner i⁠s⁠ ⁠g⁠o⁠o⁠d⁠ ⁠f⁠o⁠r⁠ ⁠y⁠o⁠u⁠r⁠ ⁠h⁠e⁠a⁠l⁠t⁠h. Our latest study shows that they are also good for your quality of life.

Personality reflects a person’s characteristic way of thinking, feeling and behaving. Psychologists tend to examine personality across five key traits: extroversion, openness to experiences, conscientiousness, emotional stability and agreeableness. Typically, these traits are measured using questionnaires that help psychologists build up a profile of a person’s personality.

Personality characteristics can have a strong impact on health, even influencing how long you live. Research shows that the more conscientious a person is, the longer they live. Conscientiousness is defined by high levels of self-discipline. Because conscientious people are more organised and careful they are more likely to lead healthier lives than their less conscientious peers. For instance, they may be more likely to follow their doctor’s advice, eat more healthily and do more exercise.

It’s not just your own personality that can strongly influence your health, though – your partner’s can too. A US study examined the relationship between partner conscientiousness and health ratings in 2,203 older couples. They found that husbands’ conscientiousness influenced wives’ health, and wives’ conscientiousness influenced husbands’ health. The same findings were also replicated in a more recent study.

These results showed something particularly interesting: conscientiousness had a compensatory effect, meaning that having a more conscientious spouse predicted better health, even after taking into account a participant’s own conscientiousness. A finding that the researchers described as “compensatory conscientiousness”.

A better quality of life

We recently carried out a study to see if we could find similar effects in younger adults. We also wanted to see if a person’s conscientiousness influenced their partner’s quality of life. The term “quality of life” reflects a person’s satisfaction with their life, including physical health, psychological state and social relationships.

We talked to 182 romantically involved couples, asking each person to complete a questionnaire. The participants were aged from 18 to 78, with an average age of 36. To qualify to take part, couples had to have been in a relationship for at least six months. Just under half the sample was married and most couples lived together. On average, the couples had been together for just over ten years.

Each person completed the questionnaire separately from their partner so that they could not discuss their answers. The survey questions let us measure their personality, using the ten-item personality inventory and ask them questions about their quality of life using questions developed by the World Health Organisation.

Our analysis showed that an individual’s own level of conscientiousness was related to their quality of life, with participants who had higher levels of conscientiousness reporting a better quality of life. We also found that people who had partners with higher levels of conscientiousness also reported having a better quality of life. This finding was true for both men and women.

Our findings raise the question of how a person’s conscientiousness influences their partner’s health. It is likely that partners high in conscientiousness help to create an environment that leads to greater health. For instance, a conscientious partner likes to plan and be organised and so they may provide their partners with useful health reminders, such as to take medication or attend a doctor’s appointment. Conscientious partners are also dependable and so are likely to be good providers of social support for their partner.

These findings show that our partner’s personality is important for our health, so choose your life partner carefully."
Milford Man Turns 105. My grandpa is cooler than yours.,http://spinalcolumnonline.com/articles/milford-man-turns-105/,"For a man who was told he might not live past the age of 40, Tony Celano has defied the odds and then some.

Celano turned 105 on May 16 and celebrated with family and friends at American House Senior Living in Milford, his residence for the past seven years.

“He is truly an amazing person in so many ways,” said his niece, Vikki Adams, who travelled from her home in San Francisco to help her uncle celebrate. “He is 105 but still lives life instead of simply existing.”

A World War II veteran, Celano served stateside in the Army Medical Corps, training medics for field service before they were shipped overseas. He met the love of his life, Henrietta Ludwig, at a dance at Camp Robinson in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Tony asked Henrietta out to dinner and to see “Gone With the Wind” for their first date. They married in 1942 and spent over 70 years together, until Henrietta’s death at age 94 in 2013.

“She was my soul mate,” he told The Spinal Column in 2014. “I never wanted anyone else.”

After the war ended, Tony and Henrietta returned to Detroit and Tony went to work in a barber shop. In 1954, they moved to Redford Township where they raised their five children.

As the children got older, Henrietta went to beauty school and joined Tony at work in the barber shop.

“We worked together in the business for a while,” remembers Celano. “And I also made some of my living doing art – I sold paintings.”

Celano took art courses and had a studio in his basement where he spent many hours painting landscapes and portraits. He continued painting until age 100.

In 1981, Tony and Henrietta retired to Lake LeAnn, south of Jackson, Michigan, where they enjoyed a slower lifestyle. In 2012, at the ages of 98 and 93 respectively, Tony and Henrietta made the move to assisted living at American House in Milford to be closer to family. Son Ron Celano lives in Highland and daughter Sandy Weaver lives in Milford .

What does Tony attribute his longevity to?

“Well, there’s no secret,” he said. “It’s just good genes. But I did do everything in moderation.”

A laid-back attitude and active lifestyle helped, said Sandy and Ron.

Following his instincts has served him well, too. The doctors who were concerned about high blood pressure when he was young advised he take it easy.

“He had to go to a special room at school called the fresh air room and lay down for an hour,” said Sandy. “They told him not to do anything, but he didn’t listen to the doctors and went and worked out with weights, figuring the heart is a muscle, and he just went against everything.”

Nice,http://jpost.com/Israel-News/Israel-forms-rare-partnership-with-Arab-nations-to-protect-Red-Sea-corals-591784,"Under the mediation of a neutral third-party, Israel will partner with neighboring Red Sea countries – including Saudi Arabia and Sudan – to establish a research center for the study, monitoring and protection of coral reef ecosystems.



The Red Sea Transnational Research Center in the Swiss city of Bern – initiated by Prof. Maoz Fine of Bar-Ilan University’s Mina and Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences – will include partners from Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen and Djibouti. Facilitating partnerships between stakeholders without diplomatic relations, the center will be led by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).

Coral reefs, a critically important home to millions of marine species, are threatened and dying as a result of global climate change and more local factors, including pollution, over-fishing and physical destruction. Recent studies have shown that coral reefs in the Red Sea are extremely resistant to stress induced by global warming and rising seawater temperatures.



Researchers have demonstrated that Red Sea corals, including in the Gulf of Aqaba, are the most likely to survive due to their evolution in geological and environmental settings that are unique to the region since the Ice Age. The corals are still threatened, however, by fish-farming, agricultural run-off, industrial and urban waste discharge, and future seawater desalination activities.



According to the researchers, however, these threats can best be overcome through knowledge-sharing, and regional coordination through the establishment of the Red Sea Transnational Research Center. The center was inaugurated in March by Ignazio Cassis, head of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.



“The relatively narrow sea is surrounded by countries and people who are directly dependent on the well-being of the coral reefs,” said Fine. “At the same time, the proximity of urban areas and tourism to the reef may inflict damage to it if we aren’t wise enough to coordinate our actions when using this asset. Our lab at Bar-Ilan University and the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat is focused on understanding resilience, and how local disturbances adversely affect this unique resilience to global change.”

The center will bring together scientists from each country from a wide range of disciplines, including oceanography, biology, genetics, ecology, geology, nature conservancy, and civil and environmental engineering.



It aims to monitor and protect Red Sea coral reefs by studying their health and biodiversity, and researching the impact of human activity along the shores of the Red Sea, such as agriculture, urbanization, coastal infrastructure, fishing and industrialization. The findings will supply policy makers with scientific analyses for decision-making regarding societal development and environmental protection.



New monitoring stations will be established under the initiative, in addition to making use of existing research infrastructures, including the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat and Jordan’s Marine Science Station in the Gulf of Aqaba."
Stanford University mechanical engineers have developed a more stable prosthetic leg and a better way of designing them that could make challenging terrain more manageable for people who have lost a lower leg.,http://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/prosthetic-foot-can-handle-tough-ground?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=reddit-tests&utm_content=reddit-prosthetic,"Taking on a hiking trail or a cobblestone street with a prosthetic leg is a risky proposition — it’s possible, but even in relatively easy terrain, people who use prostheses to walk are more likely to fall than others.

Now, Stanford University mechanical engineers have developed a more stable prosthetic leg — and a better way of designing them — that could make challenging terrain more manageable for people who have lost a lower leg.

The cornerstone of the new design is a kind of tripod foot that responds to rough terrain by actively shifting pressure between three different contact points. As important as the foot is a tool, the team developed for quickly emulating and improving their prototypes.

“Prosthetic emulators allow us to try lots of different designs without the overhead of new hardware,” said Steven Collins, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and a member of Stanford Bio-X. “Basically, we can try any kind of crazy design ideas we might have and see how people respond to them,” he said, without having to build each idea separately, an effort that can take months or years for each different design.

Graduate student Vincent Chiu, postdoctoral researcher Alexandra Voloshina and Collins describe the construction and first tests of their prosthetic emulator in a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering.

Adjusting to the terrain

Around half a million people in the United States have lost a lower limb, with effects that go beyond simply making it harder to move around. People with a leg amputation are five times more likely to fall in the course of a year, which may contribute to why they are also less socially engaged. A better prosthetic limb could improve not just mobility but overall quality of life as well.

One area of particular interest is making prosthetic limbs that can better handle rough ground. The solution, Chiu, Voloshina and Collins thought, might be a tripod with a rear-facing heel and two forward-facing toes. Outfitted with position sensors and motors, the foot could adjust its orientation to respond to varying terrain, much as someone with an intact foot could move their toes and flex their ankles to compensate while walking over rough ground.

But the engineers knew that perfecting the design would be tough — even with simple designs, a conventional approach can take years or more. “First you have to come up with an idea and then you prototype it and then you make a nice machined version,” Chiu said. “It could take several years, and most of the time you find out that it doesn’t actually work.”

Accelerating design

Chiu and his team thought they could accelerate the process by developing an emulator, which flips the design process on its head. Rather than building a prosthetic limb someone could test in the real world, the team instead built a basic tripod foot, then hooked it up to powerful off-board motors and computer systems that control how the foot responds as a user moves over all kinds of terrain.

In doing so, the team can put their design focus on how the prosthesis should function — how hard one toe should push off while walking, how springy the heel should be and so forth — without having to worry about how to make the device lightweight and inexpensive at the same time.

So far the team has reported results from work with one participant, a 60-year-old man who lost his leg below the knee due to diabetes, and the early results are promising — making the team hopeful they can take those results and turn them into more capable prosthetics.

“One of the things we’re excited to do is translate what we find in the lab into lightweight and low power and therefore inexpensive devices that can be tested outside the lab,” Collins said. “And if that goes well, we’d like to help make this a product that people can use in everyday life.”

Dad Hugs Strangers at Pride Parade,http://cbsn.ws/2IfeFow,"Helping others is not something new to one Pennsylvania man, who attended and received over 700 hugs in two and a half hours from individuals at the Pittsburgh Pride parade on Saturday. Going to the parade gave Scott Dittman, who is married to a woman and has two kids, a new outlook on issues people in the LGBT community faced in their personal lives, specifically their relationships with parents.

""You go in thinking you're just going to put a smile on a few peoples faces, and you come out knowing or understanding their struggle,"" Dittman told CBS News. ""It was life-changing, it really was.""

Dittman learned about the event from a friend on Facebook, who is part of the organization Free Mom Hugs — which works with LGBT people and gives hugs at Pride events. He decided to attend the parade with his own T-shirt, which read ""Free Dad Hugs.""

""My first thought was, I'm thinking the rate of rejection from fathers is probably higher than mothers,"" Dittman told CBS News. ""I can give dad hugs.""

The tee prompted hundreds of hugs from strangers filled with deep emotions.

""She had tears welled up in her eyes and she was just staring at me,"" said Dittman. ""She just wrapped her arms around me and she didn't let go — and I wasn't going to let go.""

Since the parade, Dittman has gone viral with a Facebook post addressed to parents, which has garnered over 231,000 shares. ""Imagine that your child feels so lost from you that they sink into the arms of a complete stranger,"" wrote Dittman. ""Try to imagine how deep those cuts must be.""

PARENTS. A handful of us went to the Pittsburgh Pride Parade today, sporting our FREE DAD HUGS and FREE MOM HUGS... Posted by Howie Dittman on Sunday, June 9, 2019

Twenty-six percent of LGBT youth say their biggest problems are not feeling accepted by their family; trouble at school and bullying; and a fear to be out and open, while 22 percent of non-LGBT youth say their biggest problems are trouble with class, exams and grades, according to a survey by Human Rights Campaign.

Dittman said he received over 1,500 messages, which varied from praise to distress. He said one individual wrote him on the ""day that they saw the post was going to be their last day on earth."" Dittman said the supportive messages, words of encouragement and Dittman's post helped prevent a tragedy.

LGBT youth who come from highly rejecting families are 8.4 times as likely to have attempted suicide as LGBT peers who reported no or low levels of family rejection, according to The Trevor Project, a non-profit organization focused on suicide prevention for LGBT youth.

The parade was not Dittman's first time volunteering to support people in various communities. He is the founder of Helping Butler County, a local volunteer group with nearly 4,000 members and the goal of helping those in need.

His appearances at the parade was a massive success, but he said he isn't retiring from the ""Free Dad Hug"" business anytime soon. ""If we can just be cool and be good humans and do a good job as humans,"" said Dittman. ""It won't matter if someone identifies themselves as gay or bi."""

"A simple tweak to the sleeping patterns of 'night owls' -- people with extreme late sleeping and waking habits -- could lead to significant improvements in sleep/wake timings, improved performance in the mornings, better eating habits and a decrease in depression and stress",http://birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2019/06/night-owls-can-retrain-their-body-clocks-to-improve-well-being-and-performance.aspx,"Night owls can 'retrain' their body clocks to improve mental well-being and performance

A simple tweak to the sleeping patterns of ‘night owls’ – people with extreme late sleeping and waking habits – could lead to significant improvements in sleep/wake timings, improved performance in the mornings, better eating habits and a decrease in depression and stress.

New international research by the Universities of Birmingham and Surrey in the UK, and Monash University in Australia, showed that, over a three-week period, it was possible to shift the circadian rhythm of ‘night owls’ using non-pharmacological and practical interventions.

The study, published in Sleep Medicine, showed participants were able to bring forward their sleep/wake timings by two hours, while having no negative effect on sleep duration. In addition, participants reported a decrease in feelings of depression and stress, as well as in daytime sleepiness.

“Our research findings highlight the ability of a simple non-pharmacological intervention to phase advance ‘night owls’, reduce negative elements of mental health and sleepiness, as well as manipulate peak performance times in the real world,” lead researcher Dr Elise Facer-Childs from Monash University’s Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health said.

‘Night owls’ are individuals whose internal body clock dictates later-than-usual sleep and wake times – in this study participants had an average bedtime of 2.30am and wake-up time of 10.15am.

Disturbances to the sleep/wake system have been linked to a variety of health issues, including mood swings, increased morbidity and mortality rates, and declines in cognitive and physical performance.

“Having a late sleep pattern puts you at odds with the standard societal days, which can lead to a range of adverse outcomes – from daytime sleepiness to poorer mental wellbeing,” says study co-author Dr Andrew Bagshaw from the University of Birmingham's Centre for Human Brain Health.

“We wanted to see if there were simple things people could do at home to solve this issue. This was successful, on average allowing people to get to sleep and wake up around two hours earlier than they were before. Most interestingly, this was also associated with improvements in mental wellbeing and perceived sleepiness, meaning that it was a very positive outcome for the participants. We now need to understand how habitual sleep patterns are related to the brain, how this links with mental wellbeing and whether the interventions lead to long-term changes.”

Twenty-two healthy individuals participated in the study. For a period of three weeks participants in the experimental group were asked to:

Wake up 2-3 hours before regular wake up time and maximise outdoor light during the mornings.

Go to bed 2-3 hours before habitual bedtime and limit light exposure in the evening.

Keep sleep/wake times fixed on both work days and free days.

Have breakfast as soon as possible after waking up, eat lunch at the same time each day, and refrain from eating dinner after 7pm.

The results highlighted an increase in cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance during the morning when tiredness is often very high in ‘night owls’, as well as a shift in peak performance times from evening to afternoon. It also increased the number of days in which breakfast was consumed and led to better mental well-being, with participants reporting a decrease in feelings of stress and depression.

“Establishing simple routines could help ‘night owls’ adjust their body clocks and improve their overall physical and mental health. Insufficient levels of sleep and circadian misalignment can disrupt many bodily processes putting us at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes,” Professor Debra Skene from the University of Surrey said.

Dr Facer-Childs said ‘night owls’, compared to ‘morning larks’, tended to be more compromised in our society due to having to fit to work/school schedules that are out of sync with their preferred patterns.

“By acknowledging these differences and providing tools to improve outcomes we can go a long way in a society that is under constant pressure to achieve optimal productivity and performance,” she said.

This intervention could also be applied within more niche settings, such as industry or within sporting sectors, which have a key focus on developing strategies to maximise productivity and optimise performance at certain times and in different conditions.

"Metal foam stops .50 caliber rounds as well as steel - at less than half the weight - finds a new study. CMFs, in addition to being lightweight, are very effective at shielding X-rays, gamma rays and neutron radiation - and can handle fire and heat twice as well as the plain metals they are made of.",http://news.ncsu.edu/2019/06/metal-foam-stops-50-caliber/,"Researchers have demonstrated that vehicle armor using composite metal foam (CMF) can stop ball and armor-piercing .50 caliber rounds as well as conventional steel armor, even though it weighs less than half as much. The finding means that vehicle designers will be able to develop lighter military vehicles without sacrificing safety, or can improve protection without making vehicles heavier.

CMF is a foam that consists of hollow, metallic spheres – made of materials such as stainless steel or titanium – embedded in a metallic matrix made of steel, titanium, aluminum or other metallic alloys. In this study, the researchers used steel-steel CMF, meaning that both the spheres and the matrix were made of steel.

For the study, researchers manufactured a hard armor system consisting of a ceramic faceplate, a CMF core and a thin back plate made of aluminum. The armor was tested using .50 caliber ball and armor-piercing rounds. The armor was tested with the rounds being fired at impact velocities from 500 meters per second up to 885 meters per second.

The CMF layer of the armor was able to absorb 72-75% of the kinetic energy of the ball rounds, and 68-78% of the kinetic energy of the armor-piercing rounds.

“The CMF armor was less than half the weight of the rolled homogeneous steel armor needed to achieve the same level of protection,” says Afsaneh Rabiei, corresponding author of a paper on the work and a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University. Rabiei, the inventor of CMF, has spent years developing and testing CMF materials.

“In other words, we were able to achieve significant weight savings – which benefits vehicle performance and fuel efficiency – without sacrificing protection,” Rabiei says.

“This work shows that CMF can offer a significant advantage for vehicle armor, but there is still room for improvement,” Rabiei says. “These findings stem from testing armors we made by simply combining steel-steel CMF with off-the-shelf ceramic face plates, aluminum back plate and adhesive material. We only optimized our CMF material and replaced the steel plate in standard vehicle armor with steel-steel CMF armor. There is additional work we could do to make it even better. For example, we would like to optimize the adhesion and thickness of the ceramic, CMF and aluminum layers, which may lead to even lower total weight and improved efficiency of the final armor.”

In previous work, Rabiei and her collaborators demonstrated that CMF could block blast pressure and fragmentation at 5,000 feet per second from high explosive incendiary rounds detonating only 18 inches away. Her team also showed that CMF could stop a 7.62 x 63 millimeter M2 armor piercing projectile at a total thickness of less than an inch, while the indentation on the back was less than 8 millimeters. For context, the National Institute of Justice standard allows up to 44 millimeters indentation in the back of armor.

In addition, Rabiei’s group has shown that CMFs, in addition to being lightweight, are very effective at shielding X-rays, gamma rays and neutron radiation – and can handle fire and heat twice as well as the plain metals they are made of.

“In short, CMFs hold promise for a variety of applications: from space exploration to shipping nuclear waste, explosives and hazardous materials, to military and security applications and even cars, buses and trains,” Rabiei says.

The new paper, “Ballistic Performance of Composite Metal Foam against Large Caliber Threats,” is published in the journal Composite Structures. First author of the paper is Jacob Marx, a Ph.D. student at NC State. The paper was co-authored by Marc Portanova of the Aviation Development Directorate in the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command.

Abstract: The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of Composite Metal Foam (CMF) armors against 0.50 caliber ballistic threats. A hard armor was manufactured using a sandwich panel construction consisting of a ceramic faceplate, a CMF core, and a thin aluminum back plate. The hard armor system was tested against 0.50 caliber (12.7 x 99 mm) ball and armor piercing (AP) rounds. The CMF armors were tested with a variety of areal densities at impact velocities between 500-885 m/s. The armors stopped the threats at speeds up to 819 m/s without penetration. The CMF layer was found to absorb 72-75% and 68-78% of the kinetic energy of the ball and AP round respectively. When compared to rolled homogeneous steel armor (RHA), the CMF hard armors, in their current unoptimized condition, have a mass efficiency of approximately 2.1. The CMF armor offers a much needed weight savings without sacrificing protection. Finite element analysis was completed using ANSYS/AUTODYN Explicit Dynamics solver to study the material interactions and impact. The results are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental findings."
"Five things we have learned from Trump's state visit. Donald Trump has moved his focus beyond Theresa May, but the Queen can still inspire awe in the President.",https://bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48531769,"Five things we have learned from Trump's state visit By James Landale

Diplomatic correspondent Published duration 5 June 2019 Related Topics New UK prime minister

image copyright PA Wire image caption Mr Trump praised both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in his joint press conference with Mrs May

As President Trump leaves the UK on the final day of the US state visit, what can we say we have learned from the last three days?

1. We are all getting used to Donald Trump

Whisper it quietly, but the capacity of the president to shock appears to be waning.

His visit resulted in much diplomatic carnage - the row with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan; the pre-trip newspaper interviews advising on Brexit - but little seemed unexpected, as if Mr Trump was following a script with which we are now familiar.

There were the usual half-lies - the numbers protesting against his visit, about the extent of US-UK trade. There were the abrupt policy changes over whether or not the NHS would be involved in any future trade deal.

And there was the unapologetic advice about who our next prime minister should be, and what policy he or she should adopt over Brexit. But few appeared to be surprised by this.

People will continue to approve or disapprove of Mr Trump, depending on their viewpoint, but somehow the phenomenon that is Trumpism has become normal.

There were fewer protesters on the streets than last time.

The president, in turn, showed he could do modest, conducting a news conference with less bombast than usual where he praised Theresa May's handling of Brexit.

He even managed to get through an entire day with the royal family without breaking protocol.

This visit seemed to show that for all the reservations some may feel, Britain is beginning to realise that Mr Trump is here to stay and it had better get used to him.

2. Britain can still put on a good show

British diplomats can hardly contain their relief and pleasure that the state visit went off with hardly a foot wrong.

""We showed we can still do it,"" one told me.

The marching bands, the scarlet Grenadiers, the grandeur of the state banquet, the pomp, the pageantry and the royals, the royals! One senior official described the Queen as ""our secret weapon"".

She is clearly one of the few people in the world who can inspire awe in President Trump: the sheer weight of her experience, longevity and acquaintance with eleven of his predecessors placing a lid on the braggadocio - at least for a moment or two.

image copyright Getty Images image caption The Queen gave a speech at the state banquet on Monday night

Only she could have got away with using her banquet speech to deliver a firm message about the importance of the post-war international institutions that Mr Trump distrusts.

This was followed by a successful piece of diplomacy by the UK in getting the president to sign up to a joint D-Day proclamation with 15 other countries in favour of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law.

The aim was to use the occasion once again to remind Mr Trump of the importance of the international rules-based order and the crucial role the transatlantic relationship has played in that.

But for all the backslapping among Britain's diplomats, there is still the risk that the success of the state visit and D-Day commemorations is used to cover up the UK's relative weakness, the vain hope that a display of ceremonial prowess with echoes of past military glory can somehow correct the international damage the Brexit debate has inflicted on Britain's reputation overseas.

3. D-Day holds a special place in our nation's story...

...but will it be seen as a high-water mark for the special relationship?

At the start of the week British officials emphasised that the D-Day commemorations were the thing that mattered and that the long-delayed state visit was happening only because of the anniversary.

It would be a moment that really mattered - a reminder of the shared sacrifice that formed the foundation of the US-UK relationship.

The danger is that the history and the memories simply put in sharp focus the realisation that the world has moved on, that we are now in a new century where the transatlantic relationship is less central than before.

The focus now is on China and the new bipolar world. The UK has used this visit to remind the president of the importance of the transatlantic relationship, something Britain will need even more once it leaves the European Union.

image copyright Empics image caption Mr Trump sat next to the Queen during the D-Day commemorations

But Mr Trump has given no evidence that his transactional, bilateral view of world affairs has changed, and that alliances are based not on past nostalgia but current interests. He made it clear that future trade talks with Britain would be hard.

He had no compunction in dismissing Jeremy Corbyn as a ""negative force"", a man who as leader of the opposition could one day face him across the table in Downing Street.

It was noticeable, too, how many Conservative leadership contenders were willing to challenge openly Mr Trump's promise - since revoked - to include the NHS in any future trade deal.

In other words, for all the talk of a special relationship, our future prime minister (whoever he or she will be) was quite happy to define themselves against the US president, even when Mr Trump was in Britain as an honoured guest of the Queen.

4. There was no great row over Huawei

Ahead of the state visit, there was much commentary suggesting there would be a row over Britain's attitude towards the Chinese telecoms giant.

The US believes the firm is too close to the Chinese state.

And when the UK suggested it might be possible for Huawei to provide part of its future 5G phone network, there were grim warnings that the US might as a result restrict the intelligence it shares with Britain.

Yet this seems to have been the dog that did not bark over the last few days.

President Trump declared that ""we are going to be able to work out any differences"" and ""we will have no problem with that."" So what reassured him? British officials deny that any decision has been made, let alone communicated to Mr Trump.

But clearly the UK's promise that the security of its intelligence network will be paramount in any decision has gone a long way to take the heat out of this row.

And the reason this matters is because intelligence is a core element of the UK-US relationship, and any potential threat to that relationship would matter.

We should not forget that only recently Mr Trump repeated his claim that British intelligence agencies spied on his election campaign in 2016.

5. Donald Trump has moved his focus beyond Theresa May

Theresa May is prime minister and will remain so until such time that the Conservative party elects her successor at the end of July.

Yet her imminent departure hung over this visit like a thin mist.

Donald Trump felt able to joke about it, telling her publicly: ""I don't know exactly what your timing is but stick around, let's do this (trade) deal"".

The president appeared to spend more time alone with Conservative leadership contenders than he did with the prime minister, holding a meeting with Jeremy Hunt, chatting to Michael Gove at the state banquet and having a 20 minute phone call with Boris Johnson.

media caption President Trump gives his opinion on three Tory leadership hopefuls

Mr Trump also met other Brexiteer politicians such as Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and the former Conservative cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson.

During his news conference, Mr Trump felt able to praise both Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt, and even cheekily asked the foreign secretary whether Mr Gove might make a good prime minister.

On one level this was extraordinary, an astonishingly rude intervention in the domestic politics of another country.

But Mrs May is such a lame duck that Mr Trump got away with it.

She, in turn, felt more able to be explicit about her differences with the president, whether on Iran or China, warning him about the benefits of ""cooperation and compromise""."

My hometown is doing amazing things.,http://eastcountytoday.net/antioch-middle-school-district-office-raise-pride-flag-in-honor-of-pride-month/,"On Monday, Antioch Middle School became the first and only school in the Antioch Unified School District to raise the Rainbow Flag joining the District Office.

The move came after the Antioch School Board voted 3-2 on May 29 that recognizes June as LGBTQ Pride Month and flying the Rainbow Pride Flag.

During the month of June, the Antioch Unified School District urges all schools and individual citizens to participate in LGBTQ Pride Month and celebrate the identities and contributions of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ) community.

According to Antioch Middle School Principal Lindsay Wisely, she explained the flag went up after the board direction and she stated that she wanted to create a welcoming environment for not only the students, but parents, staff and members of the community.

It was during the May 29 meeting where School Board Trustee Ellie Householder suggested that along with the proclamation, they fly the LGBTQ Pride Flag at the District office while encouraging other schools to also fly the flag.

“It may seem like a small thing raising a flag or having this resolution, but for students and young people who have been constantly been under attack for being who they are, this type of visibility does matter and could be the difference of a young person potentially committing suicide and them not committing suicide just by having their District and community stand behind them and recognize them saying we see you, we love you, we are with you and we stand with you,” stated Householder during the meeting.

The school district stated Monday that they were unaware of any other school in the District flying the flag other than Antioch Middle School.

Pluto has an underground ocean kept warm by a layer of gassy ice,http://newscientist.com/article/2203696-pluto-has-an-underground-ocean-kept-warm-by-a-layer-of-gassy-ice/,"What’s beneath the surface? NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI

We think that Pluto is hiding a liquid ocean, but why it hasn’t frozen is a big mystery. Now it seems that gas trapped inside the bottom layer of its icy outer shell may be keeping it warm.

A number of observations point towards an underground ocean on Pluto, including deep cracks on its surface that seem to come from subsurface water freezing and expanding. But unlike other subsurface ocean worlds in our solar system, such as the icy moons Europa and Enceladus, Pluto is not stretched and warmed by the gravitational pull of a larger nearby object, meaning its ocean should be frozen.

To solve this puzzle, we need to figure out how Pluto is trapping the small amount of heat from the decay of radioactive elements in its rocky core. Francis Nimmo at the University of California, Santa Cruz and his colleagues have proposed that an extra layer between the ocean and the shell would do the trick.

Advertisement

The layer would be made out of a material called a gas hydrate, which occurs when gas molecules get trapped between frozen water molecules. “It’s not bubbles, it’s a little microscopic cage for keeping gas atoms in,” says Nimmo. “It doesn’t look very different from regular ice, but it’s got all that gas in there.”

Gas hydrates are much better insulators than water ice, so the researchers calculated that this extra layer could keep the ocean around and maintain the ice shell as we see it now. This may help explain why Pluto’s tenuous atmosphere has lots of nitrogen but almost no methane – it’s much easier for methane to get caught in a gas hydrate and kept underground.

Maintaining a liquid ocean would be good for any potential life under the shell, but the layer of gas hydrates might not be, because it keeps the ice above it extremely cold, Nimmo says. “If the ice above is really cold and stiff, that’s going to make it much harder to get stuff from the surface down to the ocean, and people often think that’s an important part to keeping life going,” he says.

She was the world's smallest baby. Now she's a healthy infant,http://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/29/us/worlds-smallest-baby-leaves-the-hospital-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The smallest surviving baby in the world left the hospital five months after she came into the world at a San Diego, California hospital.

Baby Saybie was born at 23 weeks and three days last December, weighing in at just 8.6 ounces about the weight of a large apple -- making her the smallest surviving baby in the world, according to officials at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital . She was released from the hospital earlier this month weighing 5.6 pounds, CNN affiliate KSWB reported.

""After experiencing severe pregnancy complications, Saybie's mother gave birth via emergency cesarean section at 23 weeks, 3 days gestation in the womb,"" the hospital explained at a news conference. ""Doctors said the preterm birth was necessary after they found that the baby was not gaining weight and her mother's life was at immediate risk.""

Saybie was deemed the world's smallest surviving newborn by the Tiniest Babies Registry that is maintained by the University of Iowa. According to the hospital, she weighed 7 grams less than the previous smallest baby, who was born in Germany in 2015.

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that baby Saybie was released from the hospital Wednesday. She was released earlier this month."

Two teenagers found a wallet full of cash and credit cards on the street in January. Instead of keeping it, they immediately returned it to its owner. Four months later, they ― and everyone at their school ― received surprise rewards.





On May 20, 125 pizzas were delivered to Seogwipo Middle School on Jeju Island, police said Wednesday. Oh Seung-jin, the wallet's owner, sent the pizzas as a token of his appreciation for their good deed.





""The students refused to receive any reward, so I called their teacher to ask how to express my gratitude,"" Oh said.





The seniors ― Han Woong and Kang Tae-won ― found the wallet on Jan. 30. After checking the identification card, they located Oh's house and returned the wallet.





Oh, who had lost hope on the wallet by then, offered them money, but they politely turned it down. He later called their teacher to find a way to express his gratitude and came up with the pizza idea.





Their story was posted on the National Police Agency's social media channels.

"Exercise may help teens sleep longer, more efficiently. Research found that for every extra hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, the teens fell asleep 18 minutes earlier, slept 10 minutes longer and had about one percent greater sleep maintenance efficiency that night.",http://news.psu.edu/story/575392/2019/05/22/research/exercise-may-help-teens-sleep-longer-more-efficiently,"UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Getting more exercise than normal — or being more sedentary than usual — for one day may be enough to affect sleep later that night, according to a new study led by Penn State.

In a one-week, micro-longitudinal study, the researchers found that when teenagers got more physical activity than they usually did, they fell asleep earlier, slept longer and slept better that night.

Specifically, the team found that for every extra hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, the teens fell asleep 18 minutes earlier, slept 10 minutes longer and had about one percent greater sleep maintenance efficiency that night.

""Adolescence is a critical period to obtain adequate sleep, as sleep can affect cognitive and classroom performance, stress, and eating behaviors,"" said Lindsay Master, data scientist at Penn State. ""Our research suggests that encouraging adolescents to spend more time exercising during the day may help their sleep health later that night.""

In contrast, the researchers also found that being sedentary more during the day was associated with worse sleep health. When participants were sedentary for more minutes during the day, they fell asleep and woke up later but slept for a shorter amount of time overall.

Orfeu Buxton, professor of biobehavioral health at Penn State, said the findings, published today (May 22) in Scientific Reports, help illuminate the complex relationship between physical activity and sleep.

""You can think of these relationships between physical activity and sleep almost like a teeter totter,"" Buxton said. ""When you're getting more steps, essentially, your sleep begins earlier, expands in duration, and is more efficient. Whereas if you're spending more time sedentary, it's like sitting on your sleep health: Sleep length and quality goes down.""

While previous research suggests that adolescents need eight to ten hours of sleep a night, recent estimates suggest that as many as 73 percent of adolescents are getting less than eight.

Previous research has also found that people who are generally more physically active tend to sleep longer and have better sleep quality. But the researchers said less has been known about whether day-to-day changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior affected sleep length and quality.

For this study, the researchers used data from 417 participants in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study, a national cohort from 20 United States cities. When the participants were 15 years old, they wore accelerometers on their wrists and hips to measure sleep and physical activity for one week.

""One of the strengths of this study was using the devices to get precise measurements about sleep and activity instead of asking participants about their own behavior, which can sometimes be skewed,"" Master said. ""The hip device measured activity during the day, and the wrist device measured what time the participants fell asleep and woke up, and also how efficiently they slept, which means how often they were sleeping versus tossing and turning.""

In addition to finding links between how physical activity affects sleep later that night, the researchers also found connections between sleep and activity the following day. They found that when participants slept longer and woke up later, they engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior the next day.

""This finding might be related to a lack of time and opportunity the following day,"" Master said. ""We can't know for sure, but it's possible that if you're sleeping later into the day, you won't have as much time to spend exercising or even being sedentary.""

Buxton said improving health is something that can, and should, take place over time.

""Becoming our best selves means being more like our best selves more often,"" Buxton said. ""We were able to show that the beneficial effects of exercise and sleep go together, and that health risk behaviors like sedentary time affect sleep that same night. So if we can encourage people to engage in more physical activity and better sleep health behaviors on a more regular basis, it could improve their health over time.""

In the future, the researchers will continue to follow up with the participants to see how health and health risk behaviors continue to interact, and how sleep health influences thriving in early adulthood.

Russell T. Nye, graduate student at Penn State; Nicole G. Nahmod, Penn State; Soomi Lee, assistant professor at the University of South Florida; Sara Mariani, Harvard Medical School; and Lauren Hale, professor at Stony Brook University, also participated in this work.

The research was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health, as well as a consortium of private foundations."

What is surprising is the paradox between this and the fact that they still use animals in captivity for tourism and to drag logs.



Just this month in North-Eastern India, an elephant calf lost his mother and became stranded in the Deepor Beel lake in the Kamrup district.



We can clearly see the elephant struggling to keep his head outside of the water.

The forest officials and volunteers using boats and perseverance, succeeded to get the baby out of the reeds and to step into the forest.



The crowds cheered and the “National Disaster Response Force” says they are actively looking for the mother.



It is important to protect Asian elephants and increase their population.



The University of Sheffield UK and the the University of Turku in Finland have joined forces to increase the number of Asian elephants born in captivity.



In countries like India and Thailand, almost a third of elephants are in captivity not only for tourism but also to drag logs.



Last April, an episode of “The Amazing Race” made contestants ride Asian elephants across a river in Laos and started a controversy on human cruelty.



https://www.care2.com/causes/amazing-race-promotes-riding-elephants-to-its-millions-of-viewers.html

According to the show host, the Elephant Conservation Center is funded by ecotourism and in fact, a two year study published in 2017 by the World Animal Protection, who list the Elephant Conservation Centre among one having the best conditions for these animals.



And FYI, The controversy is about the fact that the center do no offer elephant rides. (I will let you decide what to think about this.)



It is important talk about animal cruelty in general so that in the long term the same organizations that offer the rides will have to provide better care for their animals.

Easier Access to Naloxone Linked to Fewer Opioid Deaths,http://directorsblog.nih.gov/2019/05/14/study-finds-easier-access-to-naloxone-cuts-opioid-deaths/,"Easier Access to Naloxone Linked to Fewer Opioid Deaths

Posted on May 14th, 2019 by Dr. Francis Collins

Credit: HHS

A few weeks ago, I was pleased to take part in the announcement of NIH’s HEALing Communities Study in four states hard hit by the opioid epidemic. This study will test a comprehensive, evidence-based approach—which includes the wide distribution of naloxone to reverse overdoses—with the aim of reducing opioid-related deaths in selected communities by 40 percent over three years.

That’s a very ambitious goal. So, I was encouraged to read about new findings that indicate such reductions may be within our reach if society implements a number of key changes. Among those is the need to arm friends, family members, and others with the ability to save lives from opioid overdoses. Between 2013 and 2016, nine states instituted laws that give pharmacists direct authority to dispense naloxone to anyone without a prescription. However, the impact of such changes has remained rather unclear. Now, an NIH-funded analysis has found that within a couple of years of these new laws taking effect, fatal opioid overdoses in these states fell significantly [1].

The misuse and overuse of opioids, which include heroin, fentanyl, and prescription painkillers, poses an unprecedented public health crisis. Every day, more than 130 people in the United States die from opioid overdoses [2]. Not only are far too many families losing their loved ones, this crisis is costing our nation tens of billions of dollars a year in lost productivity and added expenses for healthcare, addiction treatment, and criminal justice.

Opioid overdoses lead to respiratory arrest. If not reversed in a few minutes, this will be fatal. In an effort to address this crisis, the federal government and many states have pursued various strategies to increase access to naloxone, which is a medication that can quickly restore breathing in a person overdosing on opioids. Naloxone, which can be delivered via nasal spray or injection, works by binding opioid receptors to reverse or block the effect of opioids. The challenge is to get naloxone to those who need it before it’s too late.

In some states, a physician still must prescribe naloxone. In others, naloxone access laws (NALs) have given pharmacists the authority to supply naloxone without a doctor’s orders. But not all NALs are the same.

Some NALs, including those in Alaska, California, Connecticut, Idaho, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, and South Carolina, give pharmacists direct authority to dispense naloxone to anyone who requests it. But NALs in certain other states only give pharmacists indirect authority to dispense naloxone to people enrolled in certain treatment programs, or who meet other specific criteria.

In the new analysis, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, a team that included Rahi Abouk, William Paterson University, Wayne, NJ, and Rosalie Liccardo Pacula and David Powell, RAND Corp., Arlington, VA, asked: Do state laws to improve naloxone access lead to reductions in fatal overdoses involving opioids? The answer appears to be “yes,” but success seems to hinge on the details of those laws.

The evidence shows that states allowing pharmacists direct authority to dispense naloxone to anyone have seen large increases in the dispensing of the medication. In contrast, states granting pharmacists’ only indirect authority to dispense naloxone have experienced little change.

Most importantly, the research team found that states that adopted direct authority NALs experienced far greater reductions in opioid-related deaths than states with indirect authority NALs or no NALs. Specifically, the analysis showed that in the year after direct authority NALs were enacted, fatal opioid overdoses in those states fell an average of 27 percent, with even steeper declines in ensuing years. Longer-term data are needed, and, as in all observational studies of this sort, one must be careful not to equate correlation with causation. But these findings are certainly encouraging.

There were some other intriguing trends. For instance, the researchers found that states that allow pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a prescription also saw an increase in the number of patients treated at emergency departments for nonfatal overdoses. This finding highlights the importance of combining strategies to improve naloxone access with other proven interventions and access to medications aimed to treat opioid addiction. Integration of all possible interventions is exactly the goal of the HEALing Communities Study mentioned above.

Successfully tackling the opioid epidemic will require a multi-pronged approach, including concerted efforts and research advances in overdose reversal, addiction treatment, and non-addictive pain management . As I’ve noted before, we cannot solve the opioid addiction and overdose crisis without finding innovative new ways to treat pain. The NIH is partnering with pharmaceutical industry leaders to accelerate this process, but it will take time. The good news based on this new study is that, with thoughtful strategies and policies in place, many of the tools needed to help address this epidemic and save lives may already be at our disposal.

British heavyweight Tyson Fury says he loves boxing ""more than ever"" and lives his life ""like a training camp"" as he prepares for his Las Vegas debut against German Tom Schwarz on 15 June.

Fury, 30, made his comeback after a 32-month absence in June 2018 and earned a stunning draw with WBC champion Deontay Wilder in December.

The Schwarz fight will be his first under a lucrative new deal with ESPN.

""It is something I am enjoying as an athlete, a person and boxer,"" he said.

Fury, who beat Wladimir Klitschko to win the WBA, IBF and WBO world titles in 2015 and claims to be the lineal champion, added: ""I really love my job at the minute, more than I have ever done before. I used to think boxing was a chore, a job to go to.

""I trained hard for a fight and then put a ton of weight back on. Now I enjoy what I do, keep fit even when I am not boxing. I almost live my life as a routine training camp now.""

Wilder faces fellow American Dominic Breazeale on 18 May, while WBA, IBF and WBO champion Anthony Joshua takes on American Andy Ruiz Jr in New York on 1 June.

Fury is unbeaten in his 28 fights, while 24-year-old Schwarz - ranked number two in the world with the WBO - has 24 wins from 24 bouts.

""It's been a long time coming,"" said Fury. ""I have never been to Vegas. The big fights happen in Vegas. I remember waking up to watch Ricky Hatton and Floyd Mayweather [in 2007] at the MGM. A lot of iconic fights have been there so for me to put my name down on that list is another tick off the list.

""I made a promise to myself when I was younger I wouldn't go to Vegas until I fought there. Thirty years later I get the opportunity to fight on the biggest platform in the world.""

Speaking about his 6ft 5in opponent, he added: ""He is hungry and ambitious, and I am sure he will come for a war.

""He is not ill-preparing for this and turning up for a pay check. He is turning up to take the lineal championship of the world. It will be an epic fight - it's Las Vegas, it's showtime and I will look to put on an explosive performance in the States."""

Pochettino reacts at the final whistle in the Johan Cruyff Arena

In the end, it was all too much for Mauricio Pochettino.

Having seen his Tottenham side stage a remarkable fightback from 3-0 down on aggregate away to Ajax to reach a first Champions League final, the Argentine could not contain his emotions.

BBC Sport looks at how the Spurs boss and others reacted on an astonishing night in Amsterdam for the north London club.

'Emotional seeing what it means to Poch'

When German referee Felix Brych signalled the end of a pulsating semi-final moments after Lucas Moura's dramatic 96th-minute winner, Pochettino sprinted onto the pitch to celebrate with his players.

The 47-year-old, who hinted on the eve of the game he could leave the club if they win the Champions League this year, sank to his knees and then came the tears of joy which continued during his post-match television interview.

""I want to remember my family... it's amazing to reward them,"" Pochettino, who celebrates his fifth anniversary in charge of Spurs before the final with Liverpool in Madrid on 1 June, told BT Sport.

""The emotion is amazing, thank you to football. Thank you football - this type of emotion without football is not possible.

""Thank you to everyone who has believed in us. To describe this in words is difficult.""

Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher got emotional watching Pochettino get emotional.

""Pochettino is crying like a baby and he was on his knees when they scored,"" Fletcher told BBC Radio 5 Live.

""It gets you emotional watching him and seeing how much it means to him.""

It was not just Pochettino who struggled to contain themselves at the end in the Johan Cruyff Arena.

""There was some screaming and then I completely choked up and lost my voice,"" former Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas told BBC Radio 5 Live.

""I was all over the place and it was raw emotion - disbelief and shock.

""Certain players like Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have been at that club for a long time, trying to develop themselves, and I do not think they envisaged playing in a European Cup final for Tottenham.

""Spurs need these days, and if they can win it, it sends them into a completely different stratosphere. It is the best night in the club's history.

""Managers have everything thrown at them and that was a night for Mauricio Pochettino. He may never get this sort of game ever again and I'm delighted for him and the football club.""

'It almost makes you speechless'

Even former players who never wore the Tottenham shirt got caught up in the emotion of their incredible achievement.

""It almost makes you speechless what happened,"" said ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand, who was working for BT Sport.

""You need heart, desire and effort. It's about putting your heart on the line.""

But that did not stop the England captain rushing on to the pitch at the end to celebrate with his jubilant team-mates.

""I'm a fan first and foremost and I know how much it means to the club,"" said Kane, who hopes to be fit for next month's final.

These Super-Precise Clocks Help Weave Together Space And Time,http://wired.com/story/these-super-precise-clocks-help-weave-together-space-and-time/,"The world’s most precise clock sits on a table in Jun Ye’s lab in Boulder, Colorado. A tangle of electronics, fiber-optic cables, and laser beams, the clock is still a prototype, so no one actually uses it to tell time. Ye, a physicist at the research institute JILA, and his team have demonstrated that the clock can produce a second with precision in the parts per quintillion—that’s 10 -19, some hundred billion times more precise than a quartz wristwatch. Put another way, if the clock had started ticking at the Big Bang, by today it would have lost or gained no more than a second. It’s not just the most precise clock in the world—it’s the most precise device in the world.

The heart of the clock is a chamber of around 100,000 strontium atoms that Ye has trapped using lasers. These atoms, when hit with a certain laser, emit red light with a wavelength of exactly 698 nanometers, which corresponds to some 430 trillion cycles of an electromagnetic wave per second. The rate of the oscillation depends on the fundamental structure of the atom, which means Ye’s sheltered strontium atoms tick with exceptional consistency. Compare that to the pendulum of a grandfather clock, which expands and contracts with changes in temperature and humidity to speed up or slow down.

In the future, the US government will likely use some iteration of Ye’s clock to set the time across the country, so you can get to your social engagements on time. But that’s probably the least interesting use for this clock. Astrophysicists have their eye on these tools too. They think that this clock’s near-perfectly spaced ticks can help them venture deeper into space.

That’s right: By studying time, they can study space. The concept relies on a postulate in Einstein’s theory of special relativity, which says that light travels at a fixed speed of 299,792,458 meters per second in the vacuum of empty space. If you can precisely measure how long it takes light to travel from point A to point B, you can figure out the distance between A and B. This is actually how GPS works. Satellites pinpoint your location on Earth by precisely measuring how long it takes a radio signal to bounce from your phone back to space. Hence, the word “spacetime”—measuring time is equivalent to measuring spatial distances, and vice versa. A clock doesn’t just count seconds; because the speed of light is predictable, a clock is also a cosmological tape measure."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park has its first female head ranger,http://cnbc.com/2019/03/01/great-smoky-mountains-national-park-has-its-first-female-head-ranger.html,"The most visited national park in the nation will now have a female lead ranger for the first time in its 85-year history.

Tennessee native Lisa Hendy will become the Great Smokey Mountains National Park's chief ranger in April and help look after the 522,419 acres of protected land that runs between Tennessee and North Carolina, reports CNN.

She will make the move after finishing her stint as the chief ranger at Big Bend National Park in Texas. Before that she served at a host of other national parks such as Yosemite, Grand Canyon and Yellowstone.

Hendy says she see the move as a homecoming. She grew up in Chattanooga, Tenn., and had her first backcountry experiences in the Smokies.

""I am looking forward to returning to my home state in the park that provided my first real outdoor adventures,"" she said in a press release. ""It will be a pleasure to be involved in the efforts to protect a place that was so instrumental in defining my passions and ultimately my career.""

In her new role, Hendy will oversee all the park rangers responsible for law enforcement, wildland fire operations, emergency medical services, search and rescue operations, backcountry operations, and emergency communications center, according to the National Park Service. That amounts to managing about 240 permanent and 80-plus seasonal employees.

""Lisa has demonstrated incredible leadership in managing law enforcement, fire and search and rescue operations at some of the nation's busiest parks,"" National Park Service Superintendent Cassius Cash said in a press statement. ""She's built strong programs by investing in local partnerships with neighboring agencies to help make areas safer for visitors and residents. She is going to be a great addition to the park's management team.""

Hendy received the Harry Yount National Park Ranger Award in 2011, one of the highest accolades a park ranger can receive and before that, in 2007, she received an Intermountain Region Exemplary Service Award for life saving efforts within Grand Canyon National Park.

A graduate of Auburn University and Utah State University, Hendy not is a only a park ranger but a certified paramedic, firefighter, aviation manager and swiftwater rescuer.

Congratulations to Heather Baker Named 2019 Women's Own Worth Woman of the Year!,http://aymag.com/2019-woman-heather-baker,"You might have seen our publisher Heather Baker on your television set lately. Or on vacation with her husband and children in AY Magazine. Or at her kids’ activities. But what you don’t see about a very active publisher is her commitment to organizations that honor and protect women and their families.

This is why Women’s Own Worth has just named Heather Baker Woman of the Year for 2019, and she will be honored at WOWapalooza at the Governor’s Mansion Friday, October 11, 2019.

W.O.W. founder Jajuan Archer said, “There are so many great people in our state making a difference but one who stands out is Heather Baker. She uses her job as publisher of her magazines to share stories of hope to inspire people and empower women to know their own worth.”

Archer continued, “Heather has worked tirelessly for our organization and also helping others in central Arkansas. Whether it is for children in foster care or being a champion for the family of Ebby Steppach, the Little Rock girl who went missing in 2015 and whose body was discovered in 2018, Heather continues to fight to have their stories heard in a statewide platform.”

Lisa Fischer, editor-at-large, said, “We are in no way surprised that W. O. W. would honor Heather this way. She brings her passion to the office every day for different organizations, but W.O.W. has been something she has championed from day one. AY Magazine is proud to have partnered with Jajuan so she could tell her story with dignity.”"

2 high school sweethearts found love again 44 years later,http://today.com/news/how-2-high-school-sweethearts-found-love-again-44-years-t152413,"Terry Farley hadn't seen her high school boyfriend in three decades when one day Steve Downey's photo popped up while she was on LinkedIn.

It brought her back to the time when the two first met in 1971 at a Catholic youth organization conference in Washington, D.C., when Downey was 16 and Farley was 14.

""I just thought he was the cutest thing I ever saw,'' Farley said Thursday as part of the Lost & Found series on the 3rd hour of TODAY.

""We were very innocent. When we held hands, it felt very dicey.""

The two dated throughout high school before losing touch in 1980 after they went off to separate colleges.

Both went on to marry other people. But in 2009, Downey's wife died of cancer, right around the same time Farley was going through a painful divorce.

""I had one blind date, and it was a disaster,'' Farley said.

When Downey's photo popped up on LinkedIn in 2012, Farley couldn't help but smile. However, she was hesitant to contact him.

""I did not message him because ... I didn't want to pop into his life,'' Farley said. ""So I just sort of looked at the picture and reminisced a little.""

Finding each other on LinkedIn led to Farley and Downey getting married in 2015. Aaron Benjamin

About a month later, Downey was on LinkedIn and looking at the section that tells you who has been looking at your profile when he saw Farley's name.

""I just felt motivated to send her a message,'' he said. ""I just said, 'Hey, Terry, this is the Steve Downey you used to know.'""

""I get Steve's message, and I was like, 'Oh, my goodness,''' Farley said.

The couple had found one another again after decades apart. Phone calls and emails turned into an invitation from Farley, 62, for Downey, 64, to come visit at her home in Tallahassee, Florida, according to NPR.

""When I saw Steve at the airport, I didn't see the gray hair,'' Farley said. ""I didn't see anything except my first love, my first crush. In my eyes, he was exactly the same person. It felt like we were picking up where we left off.""

The high school sweethearts ended up getting married in 2015, more than four decades after they first met. Aaron Benjamin

That meeting began a long-distance relationship until Downey decided to move to Tallahassee.

It led to them eventually getting married in 2015, a joyous day that came 44 years after they first met.

""I am just so grateful to have had this opportunity to be with this person again,'' Downey said.

""He has made my life so rich,'' Farley said. ""I can't imagine it without him."""
Sickeningly Sweet: iochemist Dr. Lewis Cantley is Finding Increasing Evidence of a Strong Connection Between Sugar and Cancer,http://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2019/03/sickeningly-sweet,"By Amy Crawford

Illustration by Jennifer Kloiber Infante





Dr. Lewis Cantley hasn’t eaten sugar in decades. “I have a very simple rule,” he says. “I eat fruit, but I don’t eat anything that has sugar added to it. And I guarantee everybody would be better off if they ate zero sugar.”

Swearing off sugar may sound like a difficult proposition in a society where the sweet stuff—in Halloween candy or birthday cake, breakfast cereal or caramel macchiatos—is not only ubiquitous but central to our daily rituals and major celebrations. Indeed, according to the World Health Organization, the average American consumes 126 grams of sugar a day, more than people in any other country and nearly four times what nutritionists recommend. “It’s an addiction,” maintains Dr. Cantley, the Meyer Director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, who was inspired to become a sugar teetotaler when he saw friends and relatives struggling with their weight in the ’70s, at the dawn of the American obesity epidemic. “If I say to someone, ‘Don’t eat anything sweet for two days,’ they’ll look at me like, ‘That’s impossible, nobody can do that.’ It’s very much like an opioid addiction or an addiction to nicotine.”

And it’s an addiction with consequences, Dr. Cantley notes. A diet high in sugar is a known risk factor for health problems including obesity and diabetes—a risk that reducing sugar intake seems to mitigate. But according to an accumulating body of research by Dr. Cantley and his team at Weill Cornell Medicine, excess sugar also helps many types of cancer to grow more rapidly. The findings have implications for cancer prevention, and they could help unlock the potential of new drugs to shrink and destroy tumors. An evolving understanding of how sugar feeds cancer may also lead to a new approach to treatment: alongside chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, a cancer patient could be prescribed a diet plan that might help those treatments work better. “We’re beginning to conduct trials, but in the meantime the pre-clinical data is overwhelmingly supportive, and the retrospective data in patients is strong,” says Dr. Cantley, also a professor of cancer biology in medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. “As we learn more and more about cancer metabolism, we understand that individual cancers are addicted to particular things. In a lot of cancers, that’s insulin—and sugar.”

A Vital Pathway

Dr. Cantley was a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine in the ’80s when he identified a previously unknown enzyme, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, or PI3K, that would turn out to be a sort of master switch for cancer. The protein’s normal function is to alert cells to the presence of insulin, prompting them to pump in glucose, cells’ metabolic fuel. This signaling pathway is crucial to cells’ growth, proliferation and survival, so it makes sense that malfunctions can cause serious problems. If the pathway runs too slowly, the body becomes insulin-resistant and cells fail to take up enough glucose: this is Type II diabetes. In cancer, however, the pathway shifts into high gear, providing tumors with an overabundant supply of glucose, which drives their growth.

It turned out that the gene that encodes PI3K is the most frequently mutated cancer-promoting gene in humans—and in the years since Dr. Cantley’s revolutionary discovery, it has been implicated in as many as 80 percent of cancers, including those of the breast, brain and bladder. The pathway has also served as a target for new drugs, including the breakthrough lymphoma and leukemia drug idelalisib, which in 2014 became the first PI3K inhibitor to be approved by the FDA. Dr. Cantley came to Weill Cornell Medicine in 2012, his scientific reputation well-established; he has won a host of prestigious international awards, and his name comes up frequently when colleagues speculate about future Nobel laureates. Since setting up his lab at Weill Cornell Medicine, he has continued to investigate the role of PI3K.

One of oncology’s major frustrations is that some drugs that aim to inhibit PI3K have been less successful in clinical trials than originally hoped. Blocking the enzyme should impede the signals that allow cancer cells to take in the high levels of glucose they need to survive, but it doesn’t always work that way. In many patients, PI3K inhibitors cause blood sugar to spike, suggesting that the drugs meant to starve tumors were telling the liver that the body itself was starving, too. In response, the liver—which stores extra glucose in the form of a compound called glycogen—was sending too much sugar into the blood, which triggered the pancreas to release excess insulin. Meanwhile, these patients’ tumors continued to grow.

Dr. Cantley and his colleagues wondered whether the excess insulin might be countering the effect of the drugs by reactivating the PI3K pathway in the cancer cells. They theorized that a diet very low in carbohydrates—limiting both sugar and starch, which breaks down into simple sugars in the body—would prevent spikes in blood sugar and might help the drug do its work, starving the tumor while the patient’s body fueled itself with fat and protein instead, a state called ketosis. So researchers in Dr. Cantley’s lab, including instructor in medicine Dr. Benjamin Hopkins, worked with colleagues at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian to test the hypothesis.

VICIOUS CYCLE: An illustration of how fatty and sugary foods, such as butter and soda, can fuel obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance—potentially feeding cancers.

Using mice that had been genetically engineered to develop pancreatic, bladder, endometrial and breast cancers and treated with a new PI3K inhibitor (which is currently in clinical trials), they demonstrated that spikes of insulin did indeed reactivate the pathway in tumors, countering the anti-cancer effect of the drug. But when the researchers severely restricted the mice’s carbohydrate intake, putting them on what’s known as a ketogenic diet in addition to the medication, the tumors shrank. (Adding a diabetes drug meant to lower blood sugar levels also helped, but the effects of the diet in conjunction with the PI3K inhibitor were more dramatic.) The encouraging results were published in the journal Nature in July 2018 with Dr. Hopkins as lead author. “The mutations to the PI3K pathway that cause cancer also enhance the ability of insulin to activate the enzyme,” Dr. Cantley explains. “Our preclinical research suggests that if somewhere in your body you have one of these PI3K mutations and you eat a lot of rapid-release carbohydrates, every time your insulin goes up, it will drive the growth of a tumor. The evidence really suggests that if you have cancer, the sugar you’re eating may be making it grow faster.”

Is Ketosis Key?

The Internet is full of diet advice, and among today’s hottest fads is a low-carb regimen popularly known as “keto.” It was the most Googled diet trend of 2018, a popular weight loss strategy among celebrities like reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian and basketball icon Lebron James, who sometimes refer to it as “paleo,” for its supposed resemblance to the diets of our Paleolithic ancestors. But that’s not what clinicians or researchers mean when they talk about a ketogenic diet, explains Dr. Katie Hootman, a registered dietician and director of the Metabolic Research Unit at Weill Cornell Medicine’s Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC). “The diets on the internet tend to be way too high in protein,” she says. “There is a pretty big difference between that and a clinical ketogenic diet, one that’s actually intended to get the patient into ketosis.”

Ketosis, Dr. Hootman explains, is a state in which the body relies on the metabolism of fat as the primary fuel to meet energy demands, rather than glucose, cells’ preferred source of energy. From the breakdown of fat, the liver circulates molecules called ketone bodies, which cells use as fuel until carbohydrates become abundant again. This metabolic process evolved to help mammals survive food shortages, but in a clinical context it has been used since the early 20th century to reduce seizures in people with epilepsy. A few studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries suggested a ketogenic diet might also be helpful against some forms of cancer, but it is only recently that researchers have studied its usefulness in conjunction with anti-cancer drugs. Among the clearest evidence is the Dr. Cantley Lab’s mouse study, which Dr. Hootman is now helping to translate to human patients.

Dr. Marcus Goncalves, an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and an endocrinology fellow in the Cantley Lab, and Dr. Vicky Makker, a clinical investigator and gynecological medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, are working with Dr. Hootman and the CTSC to investigate whether a ketogenic diet reduces tumor growth in pre-surgical patients with endometrial cancer. “Endometrial cancer is one of the most insulin-sensitive tumors, and that’s because over 90 percent of those tumors have some genetic alteration in PI3K signaling,” says Dr. Goncalves, an endocrinologist. “Even a small amount of insulin will drive tumor growth.”

The diet Dr. Hootman and her team designed for the study derives about 85 percent of its calories from fat, 10 percent from protein and 5 percent from carbohydrates. That’s a major change for anyone used to eating a typical American diet, in which as many as 65 percent of the calories come from carbs. Recipes, including options like chicken stir fry and beef stroganoff, as well as nut flour-based bread and muffins, are developed, tested and prepared in the CTSC Metabolic Research Kitchen, with meals packaged in coolers for Memorial Sloan Kettering patients to pick up once a week. “We get as much fat as we can into the recipe—we use cream instead of skim milk, or add extra oil,” Dr. Hootman says. “We try to make the foods seem like typical foods, so when the patients are consuming it, not only does it taste good and look good, but it’s also similar to what the people they live with might be eating, just a high-fat version.” And so far study participants have appreciated the culinary team’s efforts, says Dr. Makker. “The food is delicious. They don’t feel deprived. They don’t feel hungry.”

The trial, which will ultimately enroll 30 women, was designed as a proof of concept. The researchers hope to show that patients are willing to eat this way, and that restricting carbohydrates will reduce insulin to levels that starve their tumors. Eventually, Dr. Goncalves says, cancer patients may routinely be treated with what he and his colleagues are already referring to as “precision nutrition,” a diet tailored to the unique genetic profile of a patient’s tumor. “Ultimately,” he says, “we’d like to say, ‘Okay, if you’re receiving a certain type of cancer treatment, you should be on a diet that facilitates its effectiveness—it’s just part of your therapy.’”

EXPLORING ‘PRECISION NUTRITION’: Dr. Marcus Goncalves in the lab. Photo credit: John Abbott

Cautious optimism is de rigueur when speculating about future treatment for cancer—an incredibly complex and challenging disease—and Dr. Makker cautions that although the initial findings of a connection between nutrition and cancer are encouraging, “we need to learn more about what really happens at the blood serum and tissue levels. We’re still investigating all of this.” Nonetheless, Dr. Cantley and his colleagues are excited by the possibilities their recent work has opened up. One of the most common questions newly diagnosed patients ask of their clinicians is whether a change in diet might help them get well. Now, physicians can say they’re looking for an answer. “You need to know the logic of the cancer in order to understand what would be the best dietary intervention for a given patient,” Dr. Cantley says, explaining that what dietary changes a patient may need to make will depend on the genetics of his or her tumor. “Some cancers are addicted to sugar, but others depend on very high levels of the amino acids glutamine or serine, for example.”

Indeed, in 2017, researchers in the United Kingdom published a study in Nature that showed that limiting certain non-essential amino acids in the diets of mice slowed the growth of lymphoma and intestinal cancer. It was a strictly controlled regimen, and not one that patients would be encouraged to try for themselves—but like the Cantley Lab’s work, it points to a day when a personalized diet may be just as important to cancer treatment as chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. As Dr. Makker notes, “so much about cancer is out of the patient’s control”; while oncologists may be loathe to suggest burdensome lifestyle changes when patients are already reeling from their diagnosis, she says, “it could be wonderful if they feel like there is something that they can control—that through diet, they can participate in their treatment and potentially affect their long-term outcome.”

In the meantime, Dr. Cantley—ever the anti-sugar evangelist—adds that limiting sweets certainly couldn’t hurt. Eating less sugar, he says, is clearly beneficial. “It’ll help you in so many different ways, with so many different diseases,” he says. “And once you don’t have that addiction anymore, it’s actually quite easy. After all, I’ve had no trouble doing it for 40 years.”

Dr. Cantley is a founder of and holds equity in Agios Pharmaceuticals and Petra Pharmaceuticals and is a member of the scientific advisory board for these companies. Petra provides financial support for his laboratory research. Dr. Cantley is also a member of the scientific advisory boards of Cell Signaling Technologies and EIP and holds equity in these companies. Dr. Vicky Makker has served on the advisory board of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd., and currently serves on the advisory boards of Eisai Co, Ltd., ArQule and Merck, from which she also receives honoraria.

"Danny Rumsey has Down syndrome, but he has also found love",http://abc.net.au/news/2019-04-17/danny-rumsey-finds-love/11019932,"There is a constant question in the minds of parents of children with disabilities about who will care for their loved ones after they have gone.

Key points: John and Sue Rumsey are ""relieved"" their adult son with Down Syndrome, Danny, has found a partner and is engaged

John and Sue Rumsey are ""relieved"" their adult son with Down Syndrome, Danny, has found a partner and is engaged They say they are ""very lucky"" to know Danny will not be left on his own when they die

They say they are ""very lucky"" to know Danny will not be left on his own when they die Danny met his fiancé Jodie Boland while working together at a local garden centre

John and Sue Rumsey have lived with this lingering doubt since they became the proud parents of Danny, a man with Down syndrome.

""In the back of your mind, every day, is 'what happens when I'm gone?',"" Mr Rumsey said.

Elena Katrakis from Carers NSW said this was a common fear for carers,

""It's a real worry for parents of people with disabilities,"" she said.

""You really have to plan for the future.""

But for Danny and his parents, the future is not so frightening anymore thanks to a little love story.

Lucky in love

The Rumseys are from Bundanoon in the New South Wales Southern Highlands, and Danny is a world champion swimmer for people with Down syndrome.

When he is not doing laps or singing with community band, The Hidden Wonders, Danny has been working at the Welby Garden Centre, which was established by Challenge Southern Highlands to offer a range of assisted employment for people with disabilities.

Danny met Jodie Boland, who has an intellectual disability, at work.

A few years ago Danny and Jodie became an item, and now the couple are engaged.

""We're not getting married just yet — little steps,"" Jodie said.

""Yeah, little steps,"" Danny said.

""Jodie's been with us about 15 years, and Danny about 10,"" said Tony McIlhenney, manager of Challenge Southern Highlands.

""They're both very capable individuals — always happy to do work.""

When asked if relationships often formed among his staff, Mr McIlhenney said it happened frequently.

""We have about 50 people here, and they all have their likes and dislikes.

""And at the end of the day, Danny and Jodie are just two young people who enjoy being together.""

Carolyn Frichot of Down syndrome NSW said social contact was an important aspect of life for people living with Downs syndrome.

""One of the biggest challenges for people with Down syndrome is social disconnection,"" she said.

""They just want to live their lives as meaningfully and richly as everyone else. So connection is really important.""

'We've watched her blossom'

Jodie and Danny enjoy spending their time together at work and in The Hidden Wonders community band. ( ABC Illawarra: Sarah Moss )

Danny and Jodie's relationship has been a delight to Danny's parents.

""When they leave work they will have seen each other all day at Welby, then they go to rehearsal with the band, then when they get home they spend an hour or two on the phone,"" Mr Rumsey said.

The relationship has had a profound effect on both of them.

""When they started getting serious Danny decided that he couldn't do five or six sessions in the pool every week any more, because Jodie was more important than more medals,"" Mr Rumsey said.

""And we've watched Jodie blossom. She's been on two cruises with us, first of all in a cabin with Sue, then she shared one with Danny.

""We love her — mostly because she's so easy to wind up.""

Peace-of-mind for parents

Ageing carers can be under a lot of pressure to support dependent adult children who live with a disability.

""You're always thinking, researching, wondering whether they're going to be left on their own, and who's going to be there for them,"" Mr Rumsey said.

""But that's partly relieved now, because they've got each other.

""We're very very lucky."""
"Atmospheric currents are transporting plastic pollution into remote, pristine areas, showing the global nature of the problem.",http://scientificamerican.com/article/microplastics-are-blowing-in-the-wind/,"Amid the rugged peaks of the Vicdessos region of the French Pyrenees, the only visible signs of a human presence are a smattering of villages and the odd hiker or skier; it is considered a pristine environment. But even here, scientists have detected tiny pieces of plastic falling out of the air like artificial dust.

A first-of-its-kind study finds these particles have blown in on the wind from at least 100 kilometers away and likely much farther. This is a clear indication that atmospheric transport is yet another way plastic pollution is being distributed around the planet, even to remote areas. “And it suggests that this is a far bigger problem than we have currently thought about,” says study co-author Deonie Allen, of the École Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de Toulouse (ENSAT).

The study, published Monday in Nature Geoscience, is one of only a handful that have attempted to measure how much plastic is falling from the atmosphere. It marks the first wave in what is likely to be a flood of such studies in the coming years, in an effort to fill in the picture of how microplastics move around the environment and how humans might be exposed to them.

“Nobody Had Looked Up”

Microplastics are tiny pieces that break off larger plastic items (such as bottles and bags) as they degrade in the environment, as well as the fibers that slough off synthetic fabrics. They come in a wide range of sizes—from a grain of rice down to a virus—and are made up of a complex variety of polymers and added chemicals.

Most research to detect microplastics in the environment has been done in the ocean, where they were first noticed, but scientists have slowly realized they are also present in freshwater systems, soil and the atmosphere. The first study to measure plastic fallout from the atmosphere—conducted in Paris—was published only in 2015. The recent attention to the issue means that there are only a handful of measurements of airborne plastic, and little sense of how the numbers might vary from place to place, depending on weather conditions and where the material is ultimately coming from.

Allen and her colleagues knew microplastics had been found in rivers and sediments in the Pyrenees, but no one had determined the sources. The bulk could not have come from local sources because of the small human population and limited industrial activity, so Allen was struck by a key question: “Why haven’t we looked up?”

That is what she and her colleagues did, taking advantage of atmospheric measuring equipment already in place in the Pyrenees and sampling over five months. They found plastic fibers, films and shards, all in a range of sizes. Most of the polymers that turned up in the samples were polystyrene, polyethylene and polypropylene, which are all common in single-use plastic products such as bags and foam food containers.

A First Peek

Because the new study included smaller sizes of particles than previous studies, the researchers found more plastic particles overall; this bears out a recurring trend in microplastics research findings that the smaller the size of the particles, the more of them there are. When comparing only the size ranges examined in the 2015 Paris study, Allen and her colleagues found a similar amount of microplastic, which was unexpected given the disparate environments of the two studies. This could mean that the new study “gives us a background level of microplastic that you probably get pretty much everywhere in the world,” says Melanie Bergmann, a marine ecologist with the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), who studies microplastics but was not involved in the new research. But because the samples were averaged over a whole month, it could be that the background level in the Pyrenees is lower but is punctuated by periodic plumes of microplastics coming in from populated areas.

The study did not pinpoint precisely where the microplastics originated, but used computer models of atmospheric currents to attempt to back-trace the air that brought them in—the first study to do so. They could only trace the air masses regionally, but were able to show the primary directions they came from. It was clear that the relatively small towns and villages were unlikely to account for all of the plastic they detected, which suggests the ultimate sources are more distant.

While such tracking is “an important step,” says microplastic researcher Stephanie Wright, of King’s College London, who wasn’t involved in the research, “you kind of need to know the sources to understand the back trajectory more.” Different plastics may be coming from different sources, and “an airstream could just pick up bits as it goes,” she says.

The authors say their work is only a first peek at the larger airborne microplastics picture. Many more samples from across the world—as well as lab experiments that see how different shapes, types and sizes of plastics behave in different meteorological conditions—are needed to understand the full scope of the situation, including how much microplastics humans might be inhaling. Both Wright and Bergmann have pending studies that measure microplastic fallout in London and the Arctic, respectively, and these will add more data. Allen and her colleagues, too, are working to expand their research. Co-author Steve Allen, of ENSAT and the University of Strathclyde, says that “we should, in the next few years, get a much better picture of what’s going on.”"
'It's a godsend': the healthcare scheme bringing hope to India's sick | Global development,http://theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/21/godsend-healthcare-scheme-bringing-hope-india-sick-ayushman-bharat,"Rajiv Gupta has a distinct spring in his step. He has brought his mother to New Delhi from the northern state of Bihar for a hip replacement, for which he won’t have to pay. His mother qualified for free treatment under Ayushman Bharat, the government’s ambitious new health insurance scheme.

“I can’t quite believe this is happening. When the doctors in Bihar told me it would cost 200,000 rupees [£2,180], I took mum home. That kind of money is impossible for me. I just run a tiny sari shop. And now she’s getting it done here free,” says Gupta. Then he hurries off as though scared he has got it wrong and someone is going to present him with a bill.

Millions of people in India live in fear of getting sick, and not just because of the physical symptoms. For some, the cost of treatment can be equivalent to two years’ wages.

Launched just under six months ago, Ayushman Bharat aims to provide 500 million Indian families with health insurance of 500,000 rupees (£5,450) a year for secondary and tertiary medical care. Those eligible are the most vulnerable sections of the population.

Rapid economic growth over two decades has improved the lives of millions of people, but medical care is still unaffordable for many. Though a doctor’s consultation in government hospitals is largely free, patients have to pay for implants or stents, along with medical consumables. The cost of hospital treatment can be catastrophic, pushing an already poor family into debt.

“It is early days, but this is a game-changer,” says Dr Randeep Guleria, pulmonologist and director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the Indian capital. “Hospital treatment is an impossible cost for the poor – even for sections of the middle class. It’s a godsend to those who would have been kept at home by their families and left to die.”

Finance minister Arun Jaitley said recently that 62% of the Indian population have to pay healthcare bills themselves and most find it unaffordable. On Wednesday he said it was fast becoming the world’s largest free healthcare scheme.

A poster campaign aims to raise awareness about the Ayushman Bharat scheme

According to official data, more than 20.3 million Indians have so far qualified for the scheme. About 1.4 million people have received free treatment.

While the scheme is off to a good start, Guleria says challenges remain. The biggest is making people aware of it. Although almost 8 million people have checked on the Ayushman portal to see if they are eligible, some patients at Guleria’s hospital had no idea they could become part of the scheme.

Attempts are being made to inform the public, even in the remotest villages. Posters and banners are up at railway stations. When he drives to work, Guleria hears the radio station repeatedly playing a government jingle urging listeners to dial a number to check if they could benefit.

The national health authority, which runs the plan, is teaming up with Uber, Flipkart, Amazon and other companies to access their employee database. The scheme’s CEO, Indu Bhushan, believes many of their employees will be eligible and must be tracked down to be told of their rights.

“Currently, about 400,000 people are registering every month. We want to push this up to 1 million a month,” said Bhushan.

A second challenge is fraud, which Bhushan is anxious to prevent. “Abuse will not only be an extra financial burden, it will damage our reputation, so we need to clamp down firmly right away on fraud, on people falsely claiming this benefit, or on hospital and patient collusion to cheat the state,” he says.

A third issue is persuading more private hospitals to join the scheme. The free treatment is to be offered in government and independent hospitals, but the involvement of the latter is crucial.

Only a handful of government hospitals, such as AIIMS, offer specialist care for complex treatments and procedures, according to Girdhar J Gyani, director general of the Association of Healthcare Providers of India. “More than 80% of tertiary care in India is provided by private hospitals. But the reimbursement rates under Ayushman are irrational and far too low,” he says. “So, for example, the reimbursement for a knee replacement is nowhere near the cost incurred by a private hospital.”

If the scheme is to be implemented in letter and spirit, he added, the reimbursement rates have to be increased. The government has set up a committee to review the rates.

That said, about 6,000 private hospitals, mainly smaller ones, have joined the scheme. Some beneficiaries have been surprised to find themselves being treated at a private hospital, the exclusive enclave of the wealthy. About 60% of the scheme’s patients have been treated in private hospitals.

Shah Mohammed, 50, is recuperating at SGT hospital in Gurgaon, a large private institution in the middle of a deserted, dusty plain that caters to the surrounding villages. Mohammed suffered a fractured jaw and haematoma after his scooter crashed into another vehicle.

“I hadn’t heard of this Ayushman,” he says. “But when I was admitted here, the staff checked and found that I qualified. I can’t get over the fact that when I am discharged, I will walk out of a private hospital without paying a rupee.”

‘I didn’t expect to be treated at a private hospital’: Ramesh Kumar at SGT hospital, in Gurgaon

In another ward at SGT, Ramesh Kumar, a 50-year-old tailor, is recovering from respiratory failure. “My wife would have had to borrow money. We just don’t have that kind of cash at home. I knew it was going to be free but I didn’t expect to be treated at a private hospital,” he says.

Government or private, none of this matters to Sunny Kumar and his mother, Asha. Their father has been operated on for a hole in the heart at AIIMS and is doing well. “This is the first time the government has done something really concrete for the poor,” says Asha.

Nine-year-old Shiv Shankar Kumar suffers from a leaky heart valve. When his father, Mahesh Mandal, was told in his hometown of Bihar last month that treatment would cost 300,000 rupees, he took Shiv home. “My wife and I had no choice but to leave his fate to God,” says Mandal.

Later, he heard about Ayushman Bharat and registered. The day after he received his gold card, he picked his son up in his arms and boarded a train to AIIMS. Shiv has been successfully treated. Mandal swipes his phone to show his picture. “I can’t wait to take him home so that he can start his life again,” he says."
"This is making me happy, David Vaughan has found a way to restore the corals in the ocean. The corals Play a major role in the Marine ecosystem.",http://oceangreatideas.com/2016/02/10/coral-reef-revival-david-vaughans-microfragmenting-allows-growth-more-than-25-times-faster-than-normal/,"The world’s coral reefs are in perilous danger due to overfishing, pollution and climate change. But a team of scuba-diving scientists has developed a groundbreaking method for speeding up coral growth in hopes of stemming the underwater crisis.

Dave Vaughan is Executive Director of the Mote Tropical Research Laboratory in Summerland Key, Florida. He is also the manager of the Coral Restoration program and manages the Protect Our Reef Grants program. Dr. Vaughan directed research and education programs previously at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution and the Oceanic Institute.

David Vaughan works on the Florida Reef Tract, the third largest coral reef in the world and a vastly important ecosystem for sustaining underwater life. He and a team of scientists are working to combat the crisis in the world’s coral reefs—that is, that human beings have lost 25 to 40 percentof the world’s corals in recent decades due largely to seawater temperature rise and continued acidification of the ocean.

Vaughan has developed a technique called “microfragmenting” that allows corals to grow more than 25 times faster than normal, which could rapidly restore the dwindling population of healthy coral reefs. The Atlantic went inside the Mote Tropical Research Laboratory in Summerland Key, Florida, where Vaughan is the executive director, to uncover how the process works and understand how much hope there is to reverse the damage caused by humans.

Source: theatlantic.com / a coral reef revival

For the past few years, he and Mr. Page have focused on “massive” corals, the species that create most of the structure on a living reef. These corals have proved less susceptible than other species to the effects of rising ocean temperatures, pollution and changes in water chemistry. But unlike fast-growing branching corals, massive species like brain, star, boulder and mounding corals naturally grow less than two inches a year — so slowly they are nicknamed “living rocks.”

Scientists and marine aquaculturists are successfully growing staghorn and other branching corals in offshore nurseries for replanting in the wild. But until now, the slow growth rate of massive corals has stymied all efforts to produce these species in sufficient quantities for reef restoration.

Dr. Vaughan stumbled upon the microfragmenting idea about 10 years ago. He was transferring colonies of elkhorn coral between aquariums in his lab. He reached to the bottom of a tank to retrieve a colony growing on a two-inch concrete puck.

“Part of the coral had grown over the back side and had attached to the bottom of the aquarium,” he said. When he grabbed it, “it broke off and left two or three polyps behind. I thought I just killed those. But oh, well, I moved the puck over.”

A week later he happened to glance at the abandoned polyps — the individual hydra-shaped, genetically identical organisms that make up a coral colony — on the bottom of the aquarium. “I noticed that those one to three polyps were now five to seven polyps,” he said. “They not only had lived — they had grown and had doubled in size.”

Will coddled corals survive in the wild?

Early tests have been encouraging. More than a year after they were transplanted to offshore test sites, 134 of 150 colonies grown from microfragments continue to flourish, Mr. Page said. Last year he planted eight fragments of brain coral on 18 dead coral “heads” — colonies of genetically identical polyps — each about two feet wide.

“They’re doing well,” he said. “They’re sheeting over the entire structure really nicely. In a year or maybe two from now, you will see one continuous colony that would have taken 15 to 30 years to grow” in the wild.

The goal, Dr. Vaughan said, is to create “in a very short period of time a reef like the reefs we remember” from decades ago. They plan to use their nursery-raised corals to restore other degraded reef sites throughout the Keys and train others to set up their own coral factories.

Time is running out. “This may be our last, best chance,” he said.

b'Tiger and the Masters victory even he never saw coming',http://espn.com/golf/story/_/id/26522684/tiger-masters-victory-even-never-saw-coming,"AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Before Jack Nicklaus authored the most iconic moment in Masters history, when he charged back from 4 shots down and shot 6-under 30 on the second nine to win his sixth green jacket in 1986, he was considered nothing more than a long shot at age 46.

Nicklaus arrived at Augusta National Golf Club that season having missed the cut in three of seven tournaments and withdrawing from another. He was 160th on the PGA money list. He hadn't won a major in six years. He hadn't won the Masters in 11.

Sound familiar?

While Tiger Woods might be three years younger than Nicklaus was 33 years ago, and while he hasn't yet reached the same golden age as the Golden Bear in 1986 because of improved technology and the marvels of medicine, what he accomplished in the 83rd edition of the Masters on Sunday is every bit as remarkable.

For the first time in his career, Woods came from behind to win a major championship. He started Sunday's final round trailing Italy's Francesco Molinari by 2 shots, and sat 3 behind after 11, but chased the reigning Open champion down with a 2-under 70.

Woods won the Masters for the fifth time -- second to only Nicklaus' six titles -- and claimed his 15th major championship, which trails only Nicklaus' 18.

Woods also became the second-oldest man to win a green jacket at 43 years, 3 months and 15 days. Nicklaus was the oldest Masters champion at 46 years, 2 months and 23 days.

Twenty-two years ago, at the age of 21 and less than a year after he turned pro, Woods became the youngest Masters champion, winning the 1997 tournament by a staggering 12 strokes. He won his second Masters at 25, his third at 26 and his fourth at 29.

Woods waited 14 years to win his fifth, the longest gap between green jackets in Masters history. The last one might have been the most extraordinary achievement in his most extraordinary career.

Yes, Woods is ranked 12th in the Official World Golf Rankings. Yes, he won the Tour Championship at East Lake in Atlanta in September, was runner-up at the PGA Championship in August and tied for sixth at The Open in July.

Yes, Woods was among the betting favorites this week. He's always a factor at Augusta National, where the club lengthened half of the holes to ""Tiger-proof"" the course after his 2001 victory.

In an effort to keep Woods from continuing to dominate the most fabled golf course in the world, Masters officials moved back tees. They added trees to the sides of fairways to make them narrower. They watered greens less to make them firmer and less receptive.

Woods was a very young man in 1997. Now, the most famous golfer in the world is battling time and decline, just like Nicklaus did more than three decades ago.

To truly appreciate what Woods did on Sunday, you have to consider where he was two years ago.

In April 2017, Woods' career was in jeopardy because of a debilitating back injury. Before Woods arrived at Augusta National to take his seat at the champions dinner, he needed a nerve block to endure sitting in a chair.

Immediately after the dinner, Woods flew to London to meet with specialists, who recommended spinal fusion surgery to alleviate back spasms and pain and discomfort in his leg. He had surgery in Texas later that month, the fourth back surgery of his career.

Some of his problems have been self-inflicted. On May 29, 2017, Woods was arrested on DUI charges near his home in Jupiter Island, Florida. Officers found him asleep in his car. He pleaded guilty to reckless driving and entered a treatment program. That incident followed a very public divorce in 2010 from his wife, Elin Nordegren, which revealed details of his infidelity.

""It was not a fun time,"" Woods said earlier this week, after receiving the Ben Hogan Award, given to the comeback player of the year, at the Golf Writers Association of America dinner in Augusta. ""It was a tough couple of years there. But I was able to start to walk again. I was able to participate in life.

""I was able to be around my kids again and go to their games and practices and take them to school again. These are all things I couldn't do for a very long time.""

Woods faced months of rehabilitation and recovery. He didn't play golf competitively for months. The first time he hit a driver again, it went 90 yards. He was afraid to take a swing. He had to rebuild his game from scratch.

""Golf was not in my near future or even the distant future,"" Woods said. ""I knew that I was going to be a part of the game, but play the game again, I couldn't even do that with my son Charlie. I couldn't even putt in the backyard.""

By December 2017, the player who spent a staggering 281 consecutive weeks ranked No. 1 in the world was ranked 1,199th.

While others might have wondered whether Nicklaus was finished when he won his last green jacket, even Woods questioned whether his professional career was over.

""I was done,"" Woods said.

Now, two years later, Woods is a Masters champion again. The 14-year gap between his 2005 victory at Augusta National and the title on Sunday is the longest in Masters history. Gary Player went 13 years between winning green jackets in 1961 and 1974.

Before Sunday, Woods hadn't won a major championship since the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines -- a span of 3,954 days. It's the fifth-longest drought in majors history. He had gone 0-for-28 in majors he had played since then.

Since Woods previously won the Masters in 2005, 55 majors had been played and 35 different players -- including 32 first-timers -- had won. It seemed that younger players like Molinari, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy had evened the playing field or even surpassed him.

In his younger years, Woods routinely outdrove opponents by 30 or 40 yards. At the Masters, it might not have mattered if he was teeing off from the Kroger parking lot across Washington Road. Compared to Woods, it seemed as if everyone else was playing with hickory shafts.

This week, Woods didn't even rank among the top 40 players in driving distance. He relied on his course knowledge, iron play and short game to come out on top. He was No. 1 in greens in regulation and ranked in the top 15 in putting.

For four days in Augusta, Woods played like a champion again. And his play resembled the great Masters champions before him.

""I don't think there's ever been a man that had as much talent,"" said Player, a three-time Masters champion. ""He had his difficulties to encounter, and I always said if Tiger never had the problems he had, which were numerous, he would have won at least 20, 21 majors. I don't think there's a debate about that. I don't think anybody would ever deny that.""

The question now is whether the most talented golfer in history can become the greatest player in history. Nicklaus never won another major on the PGA Tour after winning the Masters for the final time.

Was Sunday also Woods' final crowning achievement, or is there more to come?"

"London to New York in 3.5 hours: Mini-Concorde Baby Boom plane that will travel at 1,687mph is a step closer to take off after a 'milestone' engine delivery",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5526555/Supersonic-Baby-Boom-mini-Concorde-track-year.html,"Advertisement

Supersonic air travel could be making a return if a plane that aims to replace Concorde takes to the skies.

Richard Branson-backed Boom Supersonic expects a prototype of its passenger plane to make its first test flight by the end of this year.

The firm this week came a step closer to that goal after announcing a 'milestone' engine delivery for the two-seater, known as XB-1, or 'Baby Boom'

CEO Blake Scholl tweeted: 'Milestone coming up: XB-1 engines are on a truck and will arrive at @boomaero hangar within a week.'

'Baby Boom' is a 1,687mph (2,716kph) demonstrator jet designed to test the firm's supersonic technology that could take passengers from London to New York in just 3.5 hours - around half the time it currently takes.

If its full-size 55-seat plane is approved, the first passengers could be travelling at supersonic speeds around the world by 2023.

A supersonic jet that travels from London to New York in just 3 hours 15 minutes is a step closer to reality after engineering firm Boom Supersonic announced a major update CEO Blake Scholl, who plans to begin test flights of the plane – called the XB-1 (pictured) – this year, revealed that the craft's engines are ready

Mr Scholl's announcement means the Boom passenger plane's test model is set to be assembled – 15 years after the last Concorde flight.

According to the company's website, the XB-1 will 'refine our design and engineering, test key supersonic technologies, and ensure efficiency, safety, and reliability'.

Reports suggest that five unnamed airlines are interested in purchasing 76 of Boom's 55-seater jetliners.

The aircraft will have one business-class seat on either side of the aisle so each passenger gets both window and aisle access. Tickets could cost as much as £1,700 ($2,500) according to some estimates.

Boom has confirmed that Virgin Galactic and Japan Airlines will operate the aircraft, with Japan Airlines investing £7 million ($10 million) in Boom Supersonic in December 2017.

As part of the deal Japan's number two carrier has the option to purchase up to 20 Boom aircraft and will provide its knowledge and experience as an airline to hone the aircraft design and help refine the passenger experience.

XB-1 (top), also known as the 'Baby Boom', is a 1,687mph (2,716kph) two-seater demonstrator jet designed to test the firm's supersonic technology, but Boom is also developing a 55-seat passenger plane (bottom) that it says will halve trans-Atlantic flight times

WHAT ARE THE SPECS OF BOOM'S 55-SEAT SUPERSONIC PASSENGER AIRLINER? US engineering firm Boom Supersonic is developing a 55-seat passenger plane capable of reaching Mach 2.2 that is expected to enter service by the mid 2020s. The company says it will be 10 per cent faster, 30 times quieter and 75 per cent more affordable than Concorde. - Crew: Two - Length: 170 feet (52m) - Wingspan: 60 feet (18m) - Passengers: 45 standard (up to 55 in high density) - Flight attendants: Up to 4 - Lavatories: 2 - Powerplane: 3X non-afterburning medium bypass turbofan; proprietary variable geometry intake and exhaust - Aerodynamics: Chine, refined delta wing with swept trailing edge Long Range - Cruise: Mach 2.2 (1,451mph, 2,335 km/h) - Nose Temperature: 307°F (345°F on ISA+20 day) - Maximum Design Route: 4,500 nautical miles without refuel (8300km) US engineering firm Boom Supersonic is developing a 55-seat passenger jet (artist's impression) capable of reaching Mach 2.2 that is expected to enter service by the mid 2020s Advertisement

The aircraft is expected to produce a sonic boom that would be at least 30 times quieter than Concorde's, which was dogged by high operating costs and fuel consumption and low capacity utilisation.

The Denver-based startup estimates that fares for its aircraft would be 75 per cent lower than Concorde's and comparable to current business class tickets, due to its better fuel efficiency.

In a written statement, Blake Scholl, founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic, said in December: 'We've been working with Japan Airlines (JAL) behind the scenes for over a year now.

Boom's jetliner aircraft is expected to produce a sonic boom that would be at least 30 times quieter than Concorde's, which was dogged by high operating costs and fuel consumption and low capacity utilisation

Boom's huge passenger jet (interior pictured), which could begin commercial flights by 2025, will have one business-class seat on either side of the aisle so each passenger gets both window and aisle access. Tickets could cost as much as £1,700 ($2,500) according to some estimates

'JAL's passionate, visionary team offers decades of practical knowledge and wisdom on everything from the passenger experience to technical operations.

'We're thrilled to be working with JAL to develop a reliable, easily-maintained aircraft that will provide revolutionary speed to passengers.

'Our goal is to develop an airliner that will be a great addition to any international airline's fleet.'

Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines, added: 'Through this partnership, we hope to contribute to the future of supersonic travel with the intent of providing more 'time' to our valued passengers while emphasising flight safety.'

Boom Supersonic has said its jetliner, expected to enter service by the mid 2020s, will fly at speeds of Mach 2.2, 10 per cent faster than Concorde. The firm says that the journey time from New York to London could be halved and could cost passengers as little as £1,907 ($2,500) each way

In November, Mr Scholl revealed that commercial flights on the aircraft could begin running by the mid-2020s, the vehicle cruising at up to 1,687mph (2,700kph) – 100mph (160kph) faster than the infamous Concorde.

Mr Scholl was speaking at the Dubai Airshow, when he revealed the details about the Boom Supersonic aircraft.

He said: 'Think about for a moment the families that are separated because of the long flights.

'Think about the trips not taken because when you add up the lost hours, the trip just doesn't feel worth it.

'That's where we come in. We are a team of engineers and technologists, brought together for the sole purpose of making our world dramatically more accessible.

'You won't have to be on the Forbes' list to be able to fly, it will cost about the same as flying business class today. The ultimate goal is to make supersonic affordable for anyone who flies.'

The firm showed off models of the plane at the Dubai Air show in November, where it also revealed the timeline for the project

The firm has previously revealed that initial test flights for its 1,451mph (2,330kph) aircraft, nicknamed the 'baby boom' (pictured) will begin by the end of 2018

While you might think that flying on such a high-speed aircraft could be a daunting experience, Mr Scholl reassured that passengers won't even notice the difference.

'This aircraft will be as quiet as the ones flying around the airports today,' he said, adding that it will also be 'significantly quieter than Concorde.'

Its prototype, the XB-1 jet, was created by top aviation experts with collective experience working at Nasa, SpaceX and Boeing.

Learning from the Concorde, they combined advanced aerodynamics, efficient engine technology and new composite materials to produce a 'safe and affordable' supersonic aircraft 2.6 times faster than current jetliners.

The prototype, backed by Sir Richard Branson, has been subjected to more than 1,000 simulated wind tunnel tests and features a tapered carbon fibre fuselage, and efficient turbofan jet engines.

In March 2017, Virgin told MailOnline Travel: 'Richard has long expressed interest in developing high speed flight and building high-speed flight R&D through Virgin Galactic and our manufacturing organisation, The Spaceship Company.

A concept drawing shows what the interior of the futuristic passenger jet could look like - all passengers would have a seat that sits both on the window and the aisle

'We can confirm that The Spaceship Company will provide engineering, design and manufacturing services, flight tests and operations and that we have an option on the first 10 airframes. It is still early days and just the start of what you'll hear about our shared ambitions and efforts.'

According to the simulations, Boom's design is quieter and 30 per cent more efficient than the Concorde.

To reduce weight, the seats are of the standard domestic first-class variety, so no lay-down beds.

To cut flight time, Boom's plane will cruise at 60,000 feet, where passengers will be able to see the curvature of the earth, while going 2.6 times faster than other passenger planes.

Mr Scholl said about 500 routes fit the craft's market, including a five-hour trip from San Francisco to Tokyo and a six-hour flight from Los Angeles to Sydney.

One third of EU leaders back call for second Brexit referendum,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/03/22/one-third-eu-leaders-back-call-second-brexit-referendum/,"Sir Vince Cable faced humiliation on Thursday after European Union leaders disowned claims that they had backed calls for a second Brexit referendum.

The Liberal Democrats said that eight Liberal prime ministers had agreed a joint statement calling for the British people to be given a “final say” on the terms of the UK’s withdrawal deal.

But the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) quickly distanced itself from the claims and said “no statement has been agreed upon or released”.

If the eight prime ministers had backed such a statement it would have represented a major challenge to Theresa May, the Prime Minister, as she arrived in Brussels for a summit of EU leaders to urge them to agree the terms of a Brexit transition period.

It would also have likely sparked a major backlash among Brexiteers and prompted fears of EU leaders trying to thwart the UK’s departure from the bloc."

"Number of UK children in poverty surges by 100,000 in a year, figures show - Government statistics show 4.1 million children now living in relative poverty compared with 4 million the previous year, accounting for more than 30 per cent of children",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/child-poverty-increase-children-family-benefit-households-a8268191.html,"The number of children in poverty across the UK has surged by 100,000 in a year, new figures show, prompting calls for ministers to urgently review cuts to child welfare.

Government statistics published on Thursday show 4.1 million children are now living in relative poverty after household costs, compared with four million the previous year, accounting for more than 30 per cent of children in the country.

Compared to the overall population, children remained the most likely to be in relative poverty, at almost one in three compared with 21 per cent of working age adults and 16 per cent of pensioners.

The figures will fuel concerns that benefit cuts and tax credits under the Tory Government are seeing children hardest hit, with around one and a half million more under-18s forecasted to live in households below the relative poverty line by 2022.

Relative child poverty is measured as children living in homes where the income is 60 per cent of the median household income in the UK, adjusted for family size and after housing costs.

Separate government statistics published on Thursday show the number of households in temporary accommodation has surged 64 per cent since the Tories came to power in 2010, of which more than 2,000 had children.

Responding to the rise in child poverty levels, Labour MP Margaret Greenwood, the Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: “These figures show that after eight years of Conservative austerity, Labour’s progress in tackling child poverty has been reversed with a shocking increase in the numbers of children living in poverty.

“No child should be forced to grow up in poverty. The next Labour government will make tackling child poverty an immediate priority.”

Chief executive of The Children’s Society Matthew Reed said the “shocking” statistics must “spur the Government into decisive action” to help the millions of children now living in poverty across the country.

He continued: “Growing up in poverty can affect every aspect of a child’s life: their home, health, education, family relationships and even friendships.

“These figures show the toll that systematic cuts to welfare, including the freeze on children’s benefits, have taken on low-income families and the Government must now urgently review this freeze.”

Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG)’s chief executive, Alison Garnham, accused the Government of being “in denial on child poverty”, urging that if it is to “make good” on its pledge of support for struggling families, ending the freeze on benefits for working and non-working families must be a priority.

“It’s bad enough that for a second year running our child poverty rate is at 30 per cent, largely driven by social security cuts, but for hard-pressed families there is worse to come,” she said.

Ms Garnham added that the four-year freeze on children’s benefits implemented two years ago was hitting family budgets “very hard”, with child benefit alone set lose 23 per cent of its value over the decade.

The Government highlighted that despite a decline in relative poverty among children, the figures also show that rates of absolute child poverty – which measures what people are living on in relation to a fixed median income in the past – currently pegged to 2010-2011, has fallen.

Minister for family support, housing and child maintenance Kit Malthouse said: “It’s fantastic news that one million fewer people are living in absolute poverty than in 2010, including 300,000 children.

“It makes sense that poverty rates are falling while the employment rate is increasing, and today’s figures confirm that work remains the best route out of poverty.

“We know there is more to do to ensure that every child gets the very best chances in life. Our welfare reforms offer parents tailored support to move into work, ensuring that even more families can enjoy the opportunities and benefits that work can bring.”

But Ms Garnham argued that absolute poverty should always be falling, and that that’s the “bare minimum” one can expect, adding: “Focusing on absolute poverty tells us nothing about how many people are drifting further away from the middle today.

“The problem we have is that four million children are in poverty, and some of the children due to be hit hardest by cuts – those in single parent families or families with more than two children – are seeing their risk of poverty rise.”

She said a ”serious policy response” was required to fill the current policy vacuum on child poverty and children’s life chances, warning: “Today’s figures should sound a warning bell that if we fail to invest in children we will damage the life chances of a generation and the long-term prosperity of the country.”

"Canadian activists praised Service Canada's decision to ask its employees to adopt gender-neutral language when interacting with the public as a step toward greater inclusivity, while members of the political opposition mocked the policy mercilessly.",https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/03/21/critics-mock-service-canadas-move-to-gender-neutral-language.html,"MONTREAL—Canadian activists praised Service Canada’s decision to ask its employees to adopt gender-neutral language when interacting with the public as a step toward greater inclusivity, while members of the political opposition mocked the policy mercilessly.

Families Minister Jean-Yves Duclos defended the federal institution’s internal directive Wednesday, saying it was a matter of respect and an effort “to adapt to the reality of 21st-century families.”

According to the directive issued to managers and team leaders in January, Service Canada employees are asked to use gender-neutral or gender-inclusive language to avoid “portraying a perceived bias toward a particular sex or gender.”

Workers are instructed to use a client’s full name or ask how they would prefer to be addressed instead of using honorifics such as Mr., Mrs. or Ms., which “can be seen as gender specific by a client,” reads the memo, which was first obtained by Radio-Canada.

They are also being asked to eschew the terms “father” and “mother” in favour of “parent.”

Some members of the opposition were quick to criticize the directive, including Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who described it as “ridiculous.”

Rheal Fortin, the former Bloc Québécois MP who now sits as an Independent, concurred, saying, “it’s bordering on hare-brained.”

“I almost want to say I’m glad they don’t have any bigger problems than that at Service Canada,” he joked.

But Duclos told reporters that Service Canada’s policies are a matter of respect.

He specified in a tweet the government department is not eliminating the use of Mr. or Ms.

“Let us be clear, @ServiceCanada_E will continue to use Mr/Ms when interacting with Canadians,” he wrote on social media.

“We are only confirming how people want to be addressed as a matter of respect.”

Two prominent activists praised the initiative, describing it as a positive step toward inclusivity.

Helen Kennedy, executive director of national LGBTQ human rights organization Egale Canada, praised the directive as “a good first step” but said it needs to be accompanied with more awareness training and education around non-binary and gender-neutral language.

“Some people may be very well-intentioned but they may not have the understanding or knowledge that they need in order to ask the right question in a manner that’s not going to be offensive,” she said in a phone interview.

The backlash from the opposition is a sign of how far Canadian society still has to come when it comes to inclusion, she said.

“Issues around gender-neutral language are extremely important, and they may not be important to the opposition but I can tell you they’re very important to members of our community,” Kennedy said.

Gabrielle Bouchard, the first transgender president of Quebec’s main women’s federation, called the move a step toward “making sure all Canadians can start an interaction with civil servants in the right way.”

In a phone interview, she said neither she nor the policy were advocating for an end to the use of gendered pronouns, noting that some transgender people prefer to use “Mr.” or “Ms.” as a way of reaffirming their gender.

“What we want isn’t the elimination of choice, what we want is to add more choice,” she said.

Duclos’ press secretary, Emilie Gauduchon-Campbell, said the directive was issued in response to requests from members of the public who criticized Service Canada for a lack of inclusivity, including same-sex parents who complained about the mother/father designation.

She added Duclos did not see the internal directive before it was circulated Jan. 18.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to respond Wednesday morning to the initial Radio-Canada report, saying he needed more time to look into the matter."

"The story of one man's pregnancy: 'It felt joyous, amazing and brilliant' | Life and style",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/22/story-one-mans-pregnancy-trans-jason-barker,"It’s hard to perform a somersault at 36 weeks pregnant. Towards the end of his debut feature film, Jason Barker is swimming in the London Fields lido in east London, a short walk from the flat he shares with his partner, Tracey. The screen is rinsed blue. Barker dances, makes a star. And then, very slowly, he turns full height in the water, his Hawaiian swim shorts flapping, his stomach a perfect, firm dome.

This is the viewer’s first sight of Barker’s pregnant belly in A Deal With the Universe, which premieres at the BFI Flare festival next week. And after seven years in which he and Tracey tried to conceive, it is a moment of pure levity and joy. “That swimming stuff that you see?” he says. “It felt like the first time I could ever say, ‘Yeah! I actually like this body. Love it. It’s brilliant.’”

Barker was born female. He transitioned roughly 20 years ago, at 26, soon after he met Tracey – though, as Barker says, before and after don’t really work in this story. The process of transitioning was gradual, “without hard edges”. The two of them hoped to start a family, but after a few years of Tracey trying to conceive with her own eggs, in 2003 they resorted to “plan B”. Tracey would be impregnated; Barker, who had undergone chest surgery but kept his ovaries, would supply the eggs. He bought a new camera to document it. Soon they would have a baby – and a film.

So Barker stopped taking testosterone. He delayed an appointment to discuss a hysterectomy. Well, it was just a short film. Not too disruptive. But the filming went on and on – and Barker ended up telling a very different story to the one he planned. The pregnancy he chronicled was not Tracey’s, but his own. And it changed his sense of who he was.

Pregnancy among transgender men is increasingly common. Sally Hines, a professor at the University of Leeds who is leading a three-year research project into the subject, says: “In the UK, if you look at how many people are accessing blogs and online forums and support groups, asking about healthcare because they are pregnant, or young guys thinking about the future … There is lots of anecdotal evidence that more people are doing it. When something becomes visible, more people think it’s possible.”

But 10 years after Thomas Beatie, from Hawaii, made headlines with his combination of beard and baby bump – the first publicised case of a legal male, in a traditional marriage to a woman, to give birth – the data remains scant. In Australia, 54 people who identified as men gave birth in 2014, according to Medicare statistics. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics collects no information on the gender of the birthing parent; neither does the NHS. Last year, British newspapers including the Sun and the Independent hailed Hayden Cross as “Britain’s first pregnant man”. Soon afterwards, they had to hail another man, Scott Parker, after he got in touch to say that he had given birth a few months earlier.

“There have been about six first pregnant men,” Barker notes wryly. His son turns eight this year.

And yet the idea of transmasculine pregnancy as a novelty holds sway. Each birth is greeted as the first. It is perennially surprising, and I wonder if this is because it is conceived by cis people as a double-edged contradiction that undermines both the common conception of pregnancy as inherently female and the sense of a completed transition – as if a trans man carrying a child constitutes a sort of U-turn. But, as Hines says, “Transition is not a straightforward A to B … Pregnancy is not an interruption, just another part of a long and complex journey.”

Barker’s film begins with him prizing a state of heightened masculinity. When Tracey can’t conceive, he longs for “a penis and testicles”. He strikes muscular poses while washing the windows of their caravan, and the thought of his eggs entering her makes him feel like “cock of the walk”. He says it in a way that emphasises the pun. But, as the film progresses, a subtler story emerges.

“I had this fantasy picture,” he says. “I thought, I’ll have a baby, and that night I’ll go and have a pint, and about two weeks after that I’ll start on the testosterone again … Job done.” Pregnancy was a transient state, “a strange bit of my life”, after which normality would be restored.

But, pretty quickly, the film begins to transmit more mixed messages. As soon as he is pregnant, Jason appears in a pair of denim dungarees, that classic of 1970s maternitywear. In labour, he looks forlorn in a cerise nightie with a cute animal motif. He laughs when I ask why, in pregnancy, he resorted to these conventional cues for femininity. “You just grow so massive and you’ve got nothing!” he says. Retailers of pregnancy clothing aren’t exactly teeming with options for trans men. Tracey went to New Look and bought a load of maternity trousers, but even the combats were embroidered with flowers. She had to get a needle and unpick them.

In pregnancy, Barker mostly passed “as a fat bloke”. No one offered him a seat on the bus. No one batted an eyelid when, dressed in jeans and a cardie, he walked along the canal towpath to Nando’s two days before giving birth. He was both in plain sight and, owing to the relative rarity of pregnant men, hidden. In an antenatal class, when the teacher instructed all the pregnant folks to feel their hips, and he obeyed, the man beside him gave a nudge and said: “I don’t think we have to bother, mate!”

For as long as he could remember, Barker had had a body that didn’t fit. “And now you’re here,” he tells his son in the film, “and I can’t think like that any more.”

It would be easy to imagine pregnancy as a time of heightened gender dysphoria for trans men. “I had expected most people to have more dissonance with their body during pregnancy,” says Alexis Hoffkling, a researcher and medical student at the University of California, San Francisco who is trans herself. A few years ago, she started interviewing trans men who had been pregnant and found that while “some had a lot harder time with their bodies … [others] felt empowered”. Some found it masculinising. “They were more like a fat dude than they had ever felt before. As their body got bigger, they felt stronger.”

When Barker began to piece together the 25 hours of tape he had recorded over eight years of trying to start a family, a worry began to form. “The proper story,” he thought, “would be that somebody keeps their gender identity regardless. ‘I’m a man and I’m pregnant but I’m still a man, and this is a man’s pregnant tummy.’ But for me, it felt really different.”

Barker says he is naturally a very binary person. “I’ve been ever so serious about gender in my life. That it’s this thing you have to be fully committed to. Because my generation of trans people had to be fully committed in order to access treatment.” It took a while, but slowly he began to let go of his self-interrogation, what he calls “the whole pregnant man thing”. He stops to think. The closest comparison, he says, is that being pregnant was like watching Mo Farah run. “He is so graceful. He’s not having to go, ‘I’m trying to run!’ like the rest of us. And that’s how it felt for me: ‘Wow. I’m just doing this.’ It felt joyous and amazing and brilliant.”

In the same way that Barker would always stand up for his friends against transphobic strangers, now he felt compelled to protect his pregnant body against his own sense of incongruence. “I would defend that body. That body is a beautiful thing because of what it’s doing and what it’s done,” he says. The body was “all about my kid”.

So, in a way, it was a selfless body? It didn’t feel right when Barker was its sole occupant, but when it acquired another, an other, it became a better fit? I wonder if Barker felt less male when pregnant. But he says only: “Honestly, I had a really lovely time.”

“I’m going to ask you a very personal question,” he says, leaning forward. “When people talk about getting broody again, it’s pretty ick, isn’t it? It’s icky because none of us likes to think we are ruled by our hormones?”

That’s true, I say. But, speaking personally, I did get broody again.

“Yes, so did I!” he exclaims, delighted. He and Tracey knew that they wouldn’t try for another child, because it had taken them a decade to conceive and they didn’t want to lose their son’s infancy in endless rounds of IVF. But for a long time after the birth, Barker lived with a sort of second, shadow baby.

“I’d have these fantasies that somehow, a few months later, they’d say, ‘Just a minute! We think there’s a twin in there!’ I’d think about it all the time, that I was somehow accidentally pregnant and nobody knew. ‘Kangaroos do it,’ I’d think. Would there possibly be a way? They’d say, ‘We don’t know how it’s happened but it’s like your body stored it.’ And I’d be, ‘Well, there you go! A miracle!,’” he says.

He never had the hysterectomy. He hasn’t taken testosterone in 15 years, since he and Tracey embarked on their plan B.

There is, as yet, no guidebook to pregnancy for trans men, though Barker’s film will fortify others who wish to follow in his footsteps. There is a memoir, Where’s the Mother? Stories from a Transgender Dad, by Trevor MacDonald, who lives in Manitoba, Canada, and who carried his own children, now three and seven. MacDonald founded a Facebook group on birthing and breast- or chestfeeding for men.

The questions that come up repeatedly are practical ones. What is the impact of testosterone on a trans man’s chances of conceiving? (Barker took it for three years.) How does chest surgery affect lactation? (This subject is off-limits for Barker, but MacDonald fed his own children and became the first openly trans volunteer at La Leche League, the breastfeeding support group, after they initially told him it was “inappropriate” for them to help him. From his own research conversations with trans men, he knows that some found nursing reduced their experience of gender dysphoria around their breasts: “It seemed to have to do with those body parts serving a purpose that they otherwise didn’t,” he says.)

Once, in hospital, the nurses called Barker ‘Mum’. But after racking his brains, that is the single misstep he can recall. MacDonald says he is amazed that Barker had such a smooth experience with his healthcare providers. There are plenty of stories of those who don’t – specimen bottles routinely given to thin female partners instead of the pregnant man, and so on.

Registering the birth was a hurdle, though. Barker had no choice but to officially be his son’s mother. As well as his name, he included his birth name under the designation “AKA”, because he dreaded “some kind of clerical error that would make the baby not mine”. That sounds “completely paranoid”, he says, but growing up with section 28 had given him the idea of “not thinking that you deserve to be spoken about, do certain jobs or have certain things”. And those things included, presumably, a child.

Mostly, though, parenthood has been free of administrative challenges. In fact, “Being out and about as a dad with a small baby attracted more attention than being a ‘pregnant man’ did!” he says. Barker is a writer, but he is also his son’s prime carer. “I remember him crying on a bus and a woman shouted, ‘Not as easy as you thought, was it?’ Also I once shocked the whole Stay and Play when I told them that my partner had gone back to work two weeks after the baby was born.”

Their little boy has grown up with an understanding of his family, how he came about. Ever since he was born, they have told it to him almost like a bedtime story. (He has heard it so often, he sometimes rebukes his dad for “boasting about being trans”.) Discussing Harry Potter one day, Barker’s son wanted to know which of the characters Barker would be if he could choose anyone. “Hagrid,” Barker replied. In the films, the hirsute, giant gamekeeper is played by Robbie Coltrane. “Well, you’ve already got the beard,” his son said, appreciatively.

A film needs an arc, of course – to end somewhere other than where it started. Barker’s worry about this, when he began to edit the footage last year, was, “My God, will somebody think I’m cured [of being trans]? It’s a horrible thought,” he says. It’s all right for Tracey, his indomitable partner, whose eyes continue to sparkle even through a mastectomy for breast cancer. She didn’t need an arc. She could just be brilliant all the way.

“I think my arc,” he says, “is going from somebody who thinks being an ordinary man is the best thing you can be to somebody who sees a different way of being. To a certain extent it’s about femininity,” he says, tapping the table as if he’s put his finger on it. “I’d pushed [it] away from a really young age, and I think it’s about bringing some of that back. And you realise how undervalued this work is … And it does make you think, ‘What was I pushing away? What was I scared of?’

“It’s about vulnerability, I think,” he says, and it is a surprise to hear him say it, because the quality he most wants to surface in the film is resilience. Of course, the two go together, and Barker’s story is about both of those things, and the personal regrowth that can come from giving birth. He not only challenged boundaries in the world around him, but in his own understanding of himself.

"The data analytics firm that worked on the Donald Trump election campaign was offered material from Israeli hackers who had accessed the private emails of two politicians who are now heads of state, witnesses have told the Guardian.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analytica-offered-politicians-hacked-emails-witnesses-say,"The data analytics firm that worked on the Donald Trump election campaign was offered material from Israeli hackers who had accessed the private emails of two politicians who are now heads of state, witnesses have told the Guardian.

Multiple sources have described how senior directors of Cambridge Analytica – including its chief executive, Alexander Nix – gave staff instructions to handle material provided by computer hackers in election campaigns in Nigeria and St Kitts and Nevis.

They claim there were two episodes in 2015 that alarmed members of staff and led them to refuse to handle the data, which they assumed would have been obtained illegally.

SCL Elections, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, denied taking possession of or using hacked or stolen personal information from such individuals for any purpose in either campaign.

The revelations are the latest to focus attention on Cambridge Analytica, whose activities are being investigated in the US by the special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible Russian collusion in the 2016 US presidential election.

Quick guide How the Cambridge Analytica story unfolded Show Hide In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.



Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.



She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.



While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.



The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.



But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.



Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.



Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.

The firm is under pressure to explain how it came to have unauthorised access to millions of Facebook profiles. Politicians in the US and UK have accused it of giving misleading statements about its work, and the information commissioner has demanded access to the company’s databases.

In all, the Guardian and Observer has spoken to seven individuals with knowledge of Cambridge Analytica and its campaign in Nigeria in early 2015.

Hired by a Nigerian billionaire to support the re-election of Goodluck Jonathan, Cambridge Analytica was paid an estimated £2m to orchestrate a ferocious campaign against his rival, the opposition leader Muhammadu Buhari. Jonathan lost out to Buhari in the presidential race. There is no suggestion Jonathan knew of the covert operation.

Staff working on the campaign say in early 2015 they met Israeli cybersecurity contractors in Cambridge Analytica’s offices in Mayfair, London. Employees say they were told the meeting was arranged by Brittany Kaiser, a senior director at the firm.

The Guardian and Observer have been told the Israelis brought a laptop from their office in Tel Aviv and handed employees a USB stick containing what they believed were hacked personal emails.

Sources said Nix, who was suspended on Tuesday, and other senior directors told staff to search for incriminating material that could be used to damage opposition candidates, including Buhari.

“It made everyone feel really uncomfortable,” said one source. “They wanted people to load it into their email programs.”

People “freaked out”, another employee said. “They wanted to have nothing to do with it.”

One member of the campaign team told the Guardian and Observer that the material they believed had been hacked included Buhari’s medical records. “I’m 99% sure of that. Or if they didn’t have his medical records they at least had emails that referred to what was going on.”

When news of the London meeting filtered back to Cambridge Analytica staff working on the ground in Nigeria, it caused panic, the source said. Local security advisers told the firm’s team to leave the country immediately because if opposition supporters found out, they could turn on them.

“What is clear is that the security of their employees didn’t even seem to have occurred to them,” said one former employee. “It was a very serious situation and they had to evacuate immediately.”

An SCL Elections spokesperson said team members working on the Nigeria campaign remained in the country throughout the original campaigning period, and left in accordance with the company’s campaign plan.

From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman. Controversies Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.

The Guardian has seen an email from Nix dated 26 January 2015, referring to the “Israeli team”.

It says: “Although it is outside of our remit, I have asked for an update on what the Israeli team has been working on and what they will be delivering between now and the election.”

In a second episode in early 2015, sources said the same Israeli team that had worked on the Nigeria campaign obtained private information of the St Kitts and Nevis politician Timothy Harris. At the time he was an opposition leader, and is now prime minister.

Sources have said staff did not want to handle what appeared to be stolen material. “Nobody wanted to have anything to do with it,” one employee said.

A statement from SCL Elections said: “During an election campaign, it is normal for SCL Elections to meet with vendors seeking to provide services as a subcontractor. SCL Elections did not take possession of or use any personal information from such individuals for any purposes. SCL Elections does not use ‘hacked’ or ‘stolen’ data.”

The statement added: “Members of the SCL Elections team that worked on the Nigeria campaign remained in country throughout the original campaigning period, although the election was rescheduled and SCL was not retained for the entirety of the extended campaign period.

“Team members left in accordance with the company’s campaign plan. Team members were regularly briefed about security concerns prior to and during deployment and measures were taken to ensure the team’s safety throughout.”

The revelations will add to the questions facing Cambridge Analytica and the techniques it uses to influence elections for its clients.

Gaddafi son willing to testify against Sarkozy in funds scandal,https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180321-gaddafi-son-willing-to-testify-against-sarkozy-in-funds-scandal/,"The son of ousted Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi has condoned the detention of former French president Nicholas Sarkozy and renewed calls he is willing to provide evidence that Sarkozy was backed by illicit funds.

Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi first mentioned the matter to Euronews in Tripoli in 2011 where he criticised the French justice system for taking seven years to act on the matter.

According to the French judiciary yesterday, Sarkozy was being held in police custody whilst an investigation into allegations he accepted Libyan funding from Gaddafi for his 2007 election campaign.

The inquiry was first opened by France in 2013 and in January this year the United Kingdom arrested and charged a French businessman suspected of funnelling money from Gaddafi to finance Sarkozy’s campaign.

Saif Al-Islam further added that there were several witnesses willing to testify against Sarkozy, including Abdallah Snoussi, the former director of the Libyan intelligence services, and also Bashir Saleh Bashir, the former CEO of Libya Investment.

Speaking to Africanews, Saif Al-Islam explained how Snoussi has a recording of the first meeting between Sarkozy and Gaddafi held in Tripoli before his 2007 election campaign and added his willingness to testify against Sarkozy after witnessing the delivery of the first portion of the money to Sarkozy’s former chief of staff, Claude Guant, in Tripoli.

Saif Al-Islam branded Sarkozy as a war criminal and responsible for the spread of terrorism and illegal immigration in Libya and urged French President Emmanuel Macron to prosecute him for crimes committed against Libya.

The former leader’s son announced last week that he plans to run in this year’s presidential elections in Libya. He has previously been convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death in 2015 whilst in detention but was released from prison in June last year six years after an uprising in 2011 that ousted and killed his father."
"Special Counsel studies Trump campaign ties to Cambridge Analytics, sources say",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-studies-trump-campaign-ties-cambridge-analytics/story?id=53903252,"Special Counsel studies Trump campaign ties to Cambridge Analytica, sources say Mueller's team is looking at ties between Trump's campaign, RNC

As questions have mounted about data firm Cambridge Analytica’s alleged misuse of Facebook data from up to 50 million user profiles, it has not only caught the eye of Congressional investigators but also the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team for the last several weeks has had a growing interest to better understand the relationship between the campaign, the Republican National Committee, and Cambridge Analytica, sources tell ABC News.

The company is also under investigation by British officials for its use of Facebook users’ data.

Sources tell ABC News several digital experts who worked in support of Trump’s bid in 2016 have met with Mueller's team for closed-door interviews. The staffers, most of whom were employed by the RNC, served as key members of the 2016 operation working closely with the campaign and the data firm, the sources said. The company worked closely with the Republican candidate’s political team.

The Trump campaign declined to comment and the Republican National Committee has not responded to ABC News' request for comment.

Cambridge Analytica was brought on by then-Trump campaign digital advisor Brad Parscale in early June 2016, after the data science firm pitched him on its services, sources told ABC News. Three Cambridge Analytica employees, including two data scientists, immediately moved to San Antonio to embed with Parscale's firm and by August, the number of fulltime staffers in Texas ballooned to 13.

The team led by Matt Oczkowski, who served as the data firm's chief product officer, was divided into three groups focusing on data science, research and polling and marketing.

Parscale would eventually leave Texas to move into Trump Tower in September, and the data firm sent a mid-level employee with him to interpret daily polling reports, according to sources.

Cambridge Analytica was one entity involved in creating the voter information and fundraising database now known as Project Alamo, built jointly by staffers from the RNC, the Trump campaign and Parscale's firm with data supplied by the RNC and the campaign, sources said.

A spokesperson for the Trump campaign told ABC News in a statement that they “used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica. Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.”

A source with direct knowledge who has met with the special counsel's team tells ABC News investigators have asked former senior level campaign staff about the digital operations, specifically how data was collected and used and how assets were targeted specifically in the battleground states. Mueller's team has asked witnesses about the process of ""micro targeting"" which is the process of using data to identify specific groups of individuals and thereby influence their thoughts and potentially their actions.

From the start, Trump and his top advisors have touted the campaign’s mastery of spinning pithy social media messages into votes.

""I understand social media. I understand Twitter, I understand the power of Twitter I understand the power of Facebook. Maybe better than almost anybody, based on my results,"" Trump said at a 2015 town hall in South Carolina.

Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and Parscale are among those who credited the use of targeted Facebook advertising – a strategy developed by Cambridge Analytica.

“We found that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. After the primary, we started ramping up because we knew that doing a national campaign is different than doing a primary campaign,"" Kushner told Forbes Magazine just after the election. ""That was when we formalized the system because we had to ramp up for digital fundraising. We brought in Cambridge Analytica.”

The Trump campaign paid the data firm more than $5.8 million for “data management” during the 2016 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Overseeing that effort was Parscale, the Trump family confidante who has been tapped to run Trump’s 2020 reelection bid. Parscale coordinated work with Cambridge Analytica executives to identify voters who were undecided and use social media to motivate them to support Trump over Hillary Clinton.

""I think Donald Trump won, but I think Facebook was the method–it was the highway in which his car drove on,"" Parscale told 60 Minutes last year.

In an undercover video aired on the British television Channel 4, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica's political division, Mark Turnbull, appears to describe, the effort to a reporter posing as a potential client.

Turnbull said his firm created memes around the “Crooked Hillary” brand, not necessarily the name itself.

“The brand was ‘Defeat crooked Hillary,’” he said. “Sometimes you could use proxy organizations… charities, or activist group. We feed them the material and they do the work. We just put the information into the bloodstream on the internet and then watch it grow. Give it a little push every once in a while. .. it’s un-attributable. Untraceable.”

Cambridge Analytica in a statement said it deleted all the Facebook data and related information in cooperation with the social media company, and that such information was never used as part of the data firm's work with the Trump presidential campaign. The data firm has said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party and that is was destroyed as soon as they were made aware.

Aleksandr Kogan, the psychology researcher at Cambridge University, who developed the app to collect the data from Facebook users that Cambridge Analytica used told the BBC that he is “being basically used as a scapegoat” by the social media company and data firm.

""Honestly, we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately, we thought we were doing something that was really normal,"" he told the news outlet.

The Trump campaign has said they never used data from Cambridge Analytica.

On Tuesday, the data firm announced CEO Alexander Nix’s suspension, pending an investigation and the release of several undercover videos, aired by Channel 4, of him bragging about Cambridge Analytica’s use of sex workers and bribes to damage politicians for their clients.

In the video, Nix is also recorded as saying the company used a method of communicating with clients that ensure emails “disappear” after they have been read.

“You send them and after they’ve been read, two hours later, they disappear,” Nix said in the undercover Channel 4 News video. “There’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing.”

ABC News has not verified Nix’s on camera claims in the Channel 4 reports.

The data firm has been under fire this week after reports that the company used data harvested from millions of Facebook users without consent beginning in 2014 through an app. The company claims the material was obtained by a third party and has denied wrongdoing.

“This Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign; personality targeted advertising was not carried out for this client either. The company has made this clear since 2016,” the company said in a statement.

Lawmakers involved in congressional investigations into Russian election interference have renewed interest in Facebook, calling for top company leaders to testify on Capitol Hill and more scrutiny of safeguards meant to protect user data.

“I think it’s time for the CEO, Mr. [Mark] Zuckerberg, and other top officials to come and testify and not tell part of the story, but tell the whole story of their involvement -- not only with the Trump campaign but their ability to have their platform misused by the Russians,” Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told ABC News.

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee may soon have the opportunity to question the former Cambridge employee who helped expose the company's use of millions of Facebook profiles without their knowledge to help its political messaging efforts during the 2016 presidential election.

Christopher Wylie, the former employee, told ABC News “one of the reasons why I’m speaking out is because I think that it’s really concerning that no one has really investigated Cambridge Analytica and its role in the 2016 election.”

Wylie confirmed to ABC News that he has accepted an invitation to appear for an interview with congressional investigators."

Because always, even behind the things that are not so good, there is something that will bring us to some truth'",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-priests-tattoos-roman-catholic-church-young-change-a8266401.html,"Pope Francis told aspiring young priests “not to be scared of tattoos” and to use them as a talking-point to encourage dialogue.

There was a problem with “exaggeration” where people are covering their bodies, the pontiff said, but there was no problem with tattoos specifically.

“Do not be scared of tattoos,"" he said, before pointing out to the 300 strong crowd at the Pre-Synodal meeting at the The Vatican, that for years Eritreans had made a cross on their foreheads.

""Also today we see them,"" he said. ""The cross was tattooed.

He added: “Yes, they are exaggerations, but today I see some…there can be a problem of exaggeration, but not of the tattoos themselves.

“Tattoos often signify membership in a community. You, young man, that you’re tattooed like that, what are you looking for? In this tattoo, which community membership are you expressing?”

His comments, originally reported by the Church Pop website, were made during a question and answer session, at which the Pope answered questions and discussed issues that are facing younger generations of Christians.

He also encouraged priests to not be scared of and use tattoos as a way to encourage dialogue.

"Ending a decade of silence, Israel confirms it blew up Assad's nuclear reactor",https://www.timesofisrael.com/ending-a-decade-of-silence-israel-reveals-it-blew-up-assads-nuclear-reactor/,"The State of Israel on Wednesday formally acknowledged that its air force blew up a Syrian nuclear reactor in the area of Deir Ezzor in the pre-dawn hours of September 6, 2007, in a mission known to much of the world as Operation Orchard.

The official confirmation ends a 10-and-a-half-year policy of referring to the event with a smirk and a wry “according to foreign reports.”

The strike constituted Israel’s second application of the Begin Doctrine, which calls on the Jewish state to destroy any enemy country’s nuclear capabilities. The doctrine was named for prime minister Menachem Begin, who set its precedent by ordering the bombing of Iraq’s nascent nuclear reactor in 1981. (In that instance, Israel took responsibility for the attack almost immediately, to much international reprobation.)

“The message of the attack on the reactor in 2007 is that Israel will not accept the construction of a capability that threatens the existence of the State of Israel. That was the message in ’81. That was the message in 2007. And that is the message to our enemies for the future,” IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot said in a statement regarding the 2007 bombing.

According to Israeli and American intelligence, the Deir Ezzor site, known in Syria as al-Kibar, contained a gas-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor that was capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, similar to North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear facility. It was close to being up and running when Israel destroyed it in Operation Orchard (which the army also refers to as Nigun Shaket, or Silent Melody, and Mihutz Lakufsa, or Outside the Box).

While this is the first time Israel has taken official responsibility for the attack (the reasons behind this decision are discussed below), the rest of the world has not kept mum about the historic raid.

Reports about the 2007 Syrian reactor mission leaked within days, including specific details such as the number of fighter jets that took part in it — eight — and that North Korea was believed to have supplied technical know-how and materials to Syria.

Then-opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu even landed himself in hot water in the weeks following the operation for discussing it too candidly, telling reporters that he’d given his go-ahead to then-prime minister Ehud Olmert for the attack.

The view that prevailed in Israel at the time was that keeping news of the strike as quiet as possible would help Syrian dictator Bashar Assad save face and prevent him from feeling he had to retaliate, which could have led to all-out war, something an Israel still reeling from the painful 2006 Second Lebanon War desperately wanted to avoid. Israeli officials refer to this policy as giving Assad a “zone of denial.”

In 2012, a comprehensive article by David Makovsky was published in the New Yorker. In it, the magazine claimed, was almost every detail about the operation, including the tonnage of the bombs — 17 — and the fact that Amir Peretz, the defense minister when Israel began planning the attack, had to use a prepared notecard in his conversation with his American counterpart because of his limited English.

Former US president George W. Bush even referred to the attack explicitly in his 2010 memoir, “Decision Points,” saying the success of the Israeli strike “made up for the confidence I had lost in the Israelis during the [2006] Lebanon war.”

And yet, for over a decade, one of the most daring missions in the history of the Jewish state could only be referred to by the Israeli press with a healthy dose of “allegedlys,” “purportedlys,” and “reportedlys” — something that irked journalists no end.

Not even when Deir Ezzor was captured by the Islamic State terror group in 2014 did Israel reveal that it had destroyed a nuclear reactor in the region. This, despite the fact that Israel would have been able to proudly tell the world that, had it not hit the reactor, we might all have been forced to deal with the chilling notion of that death cult getting its hands on atomic weapons. (It is possible that the Syrian army might have fought harder to hold the region, which it ultimately recaptured, if nuclear bombs had been at risk.)

Finally, on Wednesday — rather fittingly, in the pre-dawn hours — after 10 years, six months, and 15 days, Israel ended its silence.

Here is what happened:

Starting in late 2004, Military Intelligence and the Mossad espionage service began receiving unverified information about foreign experts helping Syria develop a military nuclear program.

The scanned cover sheet of a top-secret IDF document from the time shows that Israeli intelligence apparently suspected the experts were coming from North Korea, Pakistan, or a third, unknown, country.

Though the mission was ultimately successful, this would later turn out to have been something of an intelligence failure, as North Korea had been working with Syria since at least 2001 or 2002; accounts differ on the exact start time.

Over the next year and a half, the army and Mossad collected information concerning a Syrian nuclear program, getting their first break in January 2006, when they found the first piece of “substantial evidence” that Assad was building a reactor.

In April of that year, Military Intelligence’s Unit 9900, which specializes in analyzing satellite imagery, spotted a number of suspicious buildings on a site in the northern Deir Ezzor region that it designated “Rubik’s Cube,” according to a scan of an IDF document from the time.

Over the course of the next months, the army and Mossad gathered more intelligence on the suspected nuclear reactor.

“The assumption that there is indeed a Syrian nuclear project is being strengthened,” the Military Intelligence’s powerful Research Division wrote in a memo in November 2006.

In early March 2007, the investigation got a big break. Mossad agents obtained pictures that were shot inside the “Rubik’s Cube,” including ones showing North Korean officials at the site. The photographs confirmed Israel’s suspicions that it was indeed a plutonium reactor.

“Syria is building in its territory a nuclear reactor for the production of plutonium, with North Korea, which according to [initial] rigorous assessment is liable to be operational in about a year. To our assessment [redacted] it is clandestine and meant to achieve a nuclear weapon,” the Research Division wrote in an intelligence brief a few weeks later, according to a scan of the document released by the army.

At this point, Israel decided to bring the United States into the loop.

In April, Olmert dispatched then-defense minister Peretz to Washington — with his aforementioned notecard — to meet with then US secretary of defense Robert Gates and apprise him of the situation.

Bush instructed the CIA to verify Israel’s claims, which the security service largely succeeded in doing.

“If it’s not a nuclear reactor, then it’s a fake nuclear reactor,” a former senior US official told the New Yorker’s Makovsky in 2012.

Yet the United States was not entirely convinced that the reactor was actually capable of producing nuclear weapons and therefore wanted to address the issue diplomatically, according to Bush’s memoirs.

Olmert was concerned that Assad would stall the negotiations for long enough for the Syrians to bring the reactor online, and told Bush his “strategy is very disturbing to me.”

With the US unwilling to conduct a strike against the Syrian reactor, Olmert and Israel’s top defense officials set to work preparing to carry out the raid themselves.

By this point, Peretz had been replaced by Ehud Barak as head of the Labor party and also as defense minister.

There was some disagreement in the security cabinet over the timing of the preemptive strike on the nuclear reactor, with Barak pushing for it to be later and Olmert calling for it to happen as soon as possible. It remains a contested issue whether these differences of opinion stemmed from purely military concerns or from political considerations as well. In the aftermath of the failure-plagued Second Lebanon War, Barak might have thought he could win the next election and gain a feather in his cap by having the strike carried out under his premiership. Olmert may have been looking to regain some of the respect he lost for his management of the 2006 war.

Ultimately, however, on September 5, the security cabinet approved Olmert’s plan for an immediate attack, giving him, Barak, and then-foreign minister Tzipi Livni the authority to decide when exactly to conduct the strike.

Gabi Ashkenazi, the IDF chief of staff at the time, called for the attack to happen that night.

Up until that point, the number of people informed of the operation had been kept to an absolute bare minimum in order to ensure secrecy, with anyone informed of it being forced to sign a strict nondisclosure agreement.

Not even all of the pilots who conducted the raid knew about it until just before they took off. In the months preceding the attack, the teams had unknowingly been training for it, practicing the kind of dive-bombing that they would later perform for real in Deir Ezzor.

“They didn’t know the target; they didn’t understand why. In every squadron there was only one pilot who was the contact person. The other teams were only informed of the target just a few hours before the operation,” said Israeli Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin, who was head of air force operations at the time, in a statement released this week.

As the strike on Assad’s nuclear facility had the potential to spark an all-out war, a handful of senior army officers were informed of it in the hours before the operation began, in order to put their troops on high alert.

“The day before, I brought in all the heads of the divisions. I presented them with the intelligence assessment — generally, I mean; I didn’t give them the details on the target and its nature. But I told them that there would be a very serious attack in the coming 24 to 48 hours, which had a relatively low possibility of leading to war,” said current IDF chief Eisenkot, who was at the time head of the army’s Northern Command, in a video statement released this week.

Eisenkot noted that since the army was trying to keep the attack a secret, it made no visible preparations ahead of it, in effect “sacrificing preparedness for surprise.”

The airmen taking part in the operation came from three squadrons, Squadrons 119 and 253, which both fly the F-16I, and Squadron 69, which flies the F-15I.

During a briefing before the mission, the commander of Squadron 119 wrote in his notes that the operation “will change the face of the Middle East.”

On September 5, the head of the air force at the time, Eliezer Shkedi, gave the pilots and navigators their official orders, telling them the operation was “of the utmost importance to the State of Israel and the Jewish people.”

The document told them that their mission was to “destroy the target, break contact without losing a plane, and fly with a ‘low signature’ as much as possible.”

“The goal is that the operation will not be connected, at least not at first, to the State of Israel, and thus limit the potential for widespread war,” Shkedi’s orders stated.

At 10:30 p.m. on September 5, the fighter jets began takeoff procedures.

They were reportedly joined by an electronic warfare aircraft that would jam the Syrian air defenses, feeding them a false picture of empty skies. The army will still not officially comment on this aspect of the mission.

The Israeli planes flew north and then through Turkey to Syria, without permission, in order to conduct the surprise strike, for which Olmert later apologized to then-Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after the empty fuel tanks of some of the planes, which were dropped for weight reasons, were found in the Turkish countryside, near the Syrian border.

The night of the attack, Olmert, Barak, Livni, then IDF chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi, Shkedi, and other senior officials gathered in “the pit” — Habor, in Hebrew — a special command center deep underground in the army’s Tel Aviv headquarters, in order to monitor the operation.

At approximately midnight, the fighter jets reached their target and dropped — according to Makovsky — 17 tons of explosives on the site, which the air force had taken to calling Ein Habesor, or Habesor Spring, a reference to a location in southern Israel where, in the Bible, King David is said to have fought and killed the evil Amalekites.

Video footage from the strike, which was released by the army this week, shows multiple bombs hitting the main square building that is believed to have housed the nuclear reactor, reducing it to a fireball and then rubble. The planes can then be seen making a second pass and bombing the rubble, completely and utterly destroying the site and killing all those inside.

Shortly before 1 a.m., the pilots sent back the codeword indicating the operation was a success: “Arizona.”

Footage from air force control center in “the pit” shows the moment the bombs strike their target. Brig. Gen. Yohanan Locker, then head of the air force’s training and aerial activities, can be seen raising his hands in triumph, as Shkedi nods in satisfaction.

Images from the moments following the attack show the destruction of the al-Kibar site. Later, satellite pictures would show the results of the strike in far greater detail.

Shortly afterward, Ashkenazi praised the heads of the air force squadrons that took part in the operation.

“The aims of the strike were the destruction of the reactor, the prevention of escalations to war, and the strengthening of deterrence in the region. I think we have stood by these targets, at least for now, with great success,” he said.

Barak joined him in lauding the air force pilots, saying that not only was the mission an immediate success, but that it will also have an impact on the future.

“The operation removed an actual existential threat to Israel. The operation strengthened Israel’s ability to deter hostile countries and organizations, and our operational capabilities have been greatly empowered — from planning, to intelligence identifying capabilities, to carrying out missions,” Barak told the squadron commanders.

Immediately following the attack, Syria did not know how to react. Its official SANA news outlet initially reported that “air-defense units confronted [Israeli fighter jets] and forced them to leave after they dropped some ammunition in deserted areas without causing any human or material damage.”

Later, Assad acknowledged that a military facility had been hit, but denied that it was a nuclear reactor.

Olmert sent a message to Syria through Erdogan, telling Assad that Israel would not tolerate another Syrian attempt to build a reactor, and that Jerusalem was prepared to keep quiet about the strike as long as Damascus did the same, according to the 2009 Der Spiegel report.

The Israeli prime minister also had Erdogan relay an invitation to Assad for indirect peace talks. (Assad accepted, but these later fell apart and amounted to nothing.)

In 2008, Israel was largely vindicated, as the International Atomic Energy Agency tested the area around al-Kibar and found high levels of uranium. Later, graphite and barium sulfate, used in the reactor’s concrete, were also discovered in the immediate vicinity of the destroyed site, according to reports by the agency.

Syria officially denied the site was a nuclear reactor, telling IAEA the uranium came from the bombs used by Israel in the strike, something Israel categorically denied. The IAEA was also unconvinced of Syria’s claim. Later, the organization reported that the site was “very likely” an undocumented nuclear reactor.

Time passed. Netanyahu replaced Olmert as prime minister in 2009. Israel’s immediate concerns turned from Syria’s nuclear program to Iran’s, not that Tehran was ever out of Jerusalem’s sight. The Syrian civil war broke out. Deir Ezzor, specifically the area around al-Kibar, was conquered by the Islamic State group in 2014. People shuddered — what if?

And now, some 3,850 days since the IAF destroyed Syria’s al-Kibar nuclear reactor — give or take a few hours — Israeli news outlets can say as much, freely.

So why now?

There was no one reason given for the decision to remove the censorship on the al-Kibar strike, but it most likely came from a variety of considerations, among them repeated legal appeals by media outlets to get rid of the ban.

It is easiest to see this announcement as a not-so-subtle threat aimed at atomically ambitious Iran, especially given the fact that in the coming months US President Donald Trump may abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, unless significant alterations are made to it.

This can be seen most clearly in Eisenkot’s comment that the attack serves as a “message to our enemies for the future.”

The message of the attack on the reactor in 2007 is that Israel will not accept the construction of a capability that threatens the existence of the State of Israel

But former deputy national security adviser Chuck Freilich told The Times of Israel he’s not convinced that’s the full story.

“This may be part of a signal to the other side, but I think that’s reading a bit too much into it,” he said.

While Freilich acknowledged that Israel might be taking advantage of the announcement in order to send such a message to Iran, he also offered a somewhat less geopolitical and more patriotic reason for the decision to reveal the existence of the operation: next month marks Israel’s 70th anniversary of existence. The story of Israel’s bold and successful operation can serve as yet another feature in the showcase of the tiny Jewish state’s outsized achievements.

Indeed, Norkin credits the mission as being “one of the most important decisions that was made in the past 70 years.”

And domestically, Frelich added, “Netanyahu will be able to make use of this for his purposes as well.”

The current backdrop that is the devastating reality of war-torn Syria, where there have been numerous chemical weapons attacks over the past eight years, also helps justify Israel’s actions in 2007.

“Imagine that today there was a nuclear reactor in Syria. You can think to yourself what kind of situation we’d be in,” IAF chief Norkin said in a video statement released this week.

Over 10 years later, Syria is also far, far less likely to feel it has to respond, making it a bit safer for Israel to remove the “zone of denial.”

The air force chief noted that the pilots and teams that took part in the 2007 raid received no official accolades for their actions, due to the secrecy surrounding the operation. Perhaps it was also time for them to get what was due.

In November 2017, Eisenkot and Norkin held a ceremony and handed out official letters of appreciation to the soldiers who took part in the operation, though their identities remain a secret.

“Some of the fighters who led the operation are now at the highest ranks of the air force and IDF,” Norkin says.

Ultimately, though, the immediate cause for the timing of the revelation might be a bit more banal: Ehud Olmert wrote a memoir, which is due to be distributed shortly.

While this reporter has yet to read the book, “In First Person,” it’s hard to imagine that it doesn’t feature prominently.

How could Olmert, who left office under police investigation and was later sent to prison for corruption, and who sustained bitter criticism over his mishandling of the 2006 Lebanon war, leave out one of his crowning, lasting achievements?

But whatever the reason, Israeli journalists and officials can now drop the at-times farcical “according to foreign reports” from their coverage of this dramatic operation."
Alarming photos reveal devastating scale of rainforest destruction in Papua New Guinea - Impact of forest loss on communities and ecosystems revealed in series of images and footage collected by environmental campaigners Global Witness following report on illegal logging in the South Pacific nation,https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/papua-new-guinea-rainforest-destruction-photos-deforestation-global-witness-illegal-logging-a8265451.html,"Photos and footage documenting the devastating impact illegal logging on the people and ecosystems of Papua New Guinea, have been released by environmental campaigners.

One of the most biologically diverse countries in the world, the rainforests that cover much of the country and provide a home for many of its unique species are vanishing fast.

By 2014, nearly one third of the country's commercially viable forests had been logged and demand from the global timber trade is driving further deforestation and leading to abuses of indigenous communities’ rights.

Global Witness – supported by the People’s Postcode Lottery – released photos revealing the extent of forest destruction in the South Pacific nation to mark the International Day of Forests.

The organisation found that tens of thousands of Papua New Guinean people are having their land stolen by their own government.

Widespread abuse of a land-leasing scheme has resulted in 12 per cent of the country being given away to foreign-backed companies either for logging or to clear the land for crops.

Most timber from Papua New Guinea is processed in China before being sold around the world, largely for use in furniture and flooring.

Last year Global Witness released Stained Trade, a report tracing the timber supply chain spanning around 9,000 miles from Papua New Guinea’s forests to retail shelves in the US.

For the first time, the organisation revealed how companies are failing to screen out illegal timber, the risks this creates for businesses in the US and the impact these activities have on people in Papua New Guinea.

Paul Pavol, a landowner-turned-activist, said the leases the government used to give away his land to foreign businesses involved fraud and forgery.

He and his Mengen people have farmed, hunted and fished the Pomio region of the country for generations.

“The forest is our wholesale, forest is our timber yard, forest is our freezer, forest is our supplier,” said Mr Pavol. “Our land provided us with food and water, protein, building material, medicines, warmth and everything else.”

An area of rainforest in Pomio half the size of London has been cleared, producing an estimated £86m worth of timber as well as extensive palm oil plantations.

Some of the illegal leases are being challenged in court, but despite repeated public commitments from the Papua New Guinean government to cancel these leases altogether and return land to communities, for the most part such action has not been undertaken.

Interviews conducted by Global Witness with villagers in Papua New Guinea revealed loss of land and forests is having extensive negative impacts for the population including reduced access to food and clean water.

Aside from the human cost, the removal of forests from Papua New Guinea is likely to severely impact the rich biodiversity found there.

Austin Bombing Suspect Dead After Blowing Self Up - Report,http://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/live-austin-bombing-suspect-is-dead-after-blowing-self-up-with-explosive-sources-say/269-530544047,None
"A 1949 document unveiled by the Aichi Prefectural Government shows that the predecessor to the Justice Ministry tolerated ?body restraint, anesthesia and deception? in ?truly necessary and unavoidable? cases of the forced sterilization of people with disabilities under the now-defunct eugenics law.",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/03/21/national/documents-show-japan-tolerated-body-restraint-deception-anesthesia-cases-forced-sterilizations/#.WrHnD-hubIU,"A 1949 document unveiled by the Aichi Prefectural Government shows that the predecessor to the Justice Ministry tolerated “body restraint, anesthesia and deception” in “truly necessary and unavoidable” cases of the forced sterilization of people with disabilities under the now-defunct eugenics law.

The precursor to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry issued similar notifications to prefectural authorities the same year, according to a separate document unveiled by the Kyoto Prefectural Government.

The documents shed more light on the cases of historical human rights violations that have increasingly drawn the public’s attention.

Japan has recently moved to investigate the damage caused under the eugenics law, in place between 1948 and 1996, which authorized the sterilization of people with visual and hearing impairments, intellectual disabilities, mental illness or hereditary disorders in order to prevent births of “inferior” offspring.

Around 25,000 people had their reproductive capacity removed under the law, including roughly 16,500 without consent, according to the Japan Federation of Bar Associations.

The government had been reluctant to carry out a survey on the matter but changed its stance after an intellectually disabled Miyagi Prefecture woman, now in her 60s, filed the first compensation claim regarding the law against the government in January, saying she was forcibly sterilized as a teenager.

The move prompted lawmakers to set up a nonpartisan group to study how to help the victims."
Germany proposes Ulm as NATO logistics hub against Russia - Germany has put forward the city of Ulm as a potential candidate for a logistics base to counter potential Russian aggression on NATO's eastern flank.,http://www.dw.com/en/germany-proposes-ulm-as-nato-logistics-hub-against-russia/a-43052613,"Germany has put forward the southern city of Ulm as the site of a new logistics command to be built in response to Russian actions in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea.

If chosen, the city would be a base in any crisis operation to speed troops and equipment across Europe to NATO's eastern flank.

Ulm is already home to Germany's Multinational Joint Headquarters, which exercises command and control of operations for the United Nations, NATO and the European Union. The Defense Ministry also considered sites near the western cities of Bonn and Cologne.

Even without the base, Germany would be a hub in any military deployment on NATO's eastern fringes. Forces from the US and Canada would likely pass through Germany's North Sea ports such as Bremerhaven, while most ground troops from western European members would pass through German territory.

Germany's NATO missions Germany's role in NATO West Germany officially joined the trans-Atlantic alliance in 1955. However, it wasn't until after reunification in 1990 that the German government considered ""out of area"" missions led by NATO. From peacekeeping to deterrence, Germany's Bundeswehr has since been deployed in several countries across the globe in defense of its allies.

Germany's NATO missions Bosnia: Germany's first NATO mission In 1995, Germany participated in its first ""out of area"" NATO mission as part of a UN-mandated peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the deployment, German soldiers joined other NATO member forces to provide security in the wake of the Bosnian War. The peacekeeping mission included more than 60,000 troops from NATO's member states and partners.

Germany's NATO missions Keeping the peace in Kosovo Since the beginning of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, some 8,500 German soldiers have been deployed in the young country. In 1999, NATO launched an air assault against Serbian forces accused of carrying out a brutal crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists and their civilian supporters. Approximately 550 Bundeswehr troops are still stationed in Kosovo.

Germany's NATO missions Patrolling the Aegean Sea In 2016, Germany deployed its combat support ship ""Bonn"" to lead a NATO mission backed by the EU in the Aegean Sea. The mission included conducting ""reconnaissance, monitoring and surveillance of illegal crossings"" in Greek and Turkish territorial waters at the height of the migration crisis. Germany, Greece and Turkey had requested assistance from the trans-Atlantic alliance.

Germany's NATO missions More than a decade in Afghanistan In 2003, Germany's parliament voted to send Bundeswehr troops to Afghanistan in support of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Germany became the third-largest contributor of troops and led the Regional Command North. More than 50 German troops were killed during the mission. Nearly a thousand soldiers are still deployed in Afghanistan as part of Resolute Support.

Germany's NATO missions German tanks in Lithuania Forming part of NATO's ""enhanced forward presence"" in the Baltic states, 450 Bundeswehr soldiers have been deployed to Lithuania so far in 2017. The battalion-size battlegroups there are led by Germany, Canada, the UK and US to reinforce collective defense on the alliance's eastern flank. It forms the ""biggest reinforcement of Alliance collective defence in a generation,"" according to NATO.

Germany's NATO missions Taking over the leadership The Bundeswehr is due to take over leadership of NATO's multinational Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) at the start of 2019. The rapid reaction force has been set up to counter potential Russian aggression on the alliance's eastern flank. Author: Lewis Sanders IV



Plan to be ready for April

The US has also offered to host the proposed NATO command at Norfolk, Virginia.

Germany's Defense Ministry said a broad plan for the new Joint Support and Enabling Command (JSEC) would be ready by mid-April. A formal decision by NATO is expected at a meeting of defense ministers from June 7-8.

""As a framework nation for the JSEC, we can make a significant contribution to burden-sharing in the alliance,"" the Reuters news agency cited Peter Tauber, state secretary in the Defense Ministry, as telling German lawmakers on Tuesday.

A second command — a North Atlantic planning and strategy hub — is also planned to protect shipping lanes from enemy submarines. It is thought that each command would have about 1,500 employees. Proposed cities for the hub include the US's Norfolk and Germany's Cologne.

'Catastrophe' as France's bird population collapses due to pesticides,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/catastrophe-as-frances-bird-population-collapses-due-to-pesticides,"Dozens of species have seen their numbers decline, in some cases by two-thirds, because insects they feed on have disappeared

Bird populations across the French countryside have fallen by a third over the last decade and a half, researchers have said.



Dozens of species have seen their numbers decline, in some cases by two-thirds, the scientists said in a pair of studies – one national in scope and the other covering a large agricultural region in central France.

“The situation is catastrophic,” said Benoit Fontaine, a conservation biologist at France’s National Museum of Natural History and co-author of one of the studies.

Chanel's enchanted forest show angers environmentalists Read more

“Our countryside is in the process of becoming a veritable desert,” he said in a communique released by the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), which also contributed to the findings.

The common white throat, the ortolan bunting, the Eurasian skylark and other once-ubiquitous species have all fallen off by at least a third, according a detailed, annual census initiated at the start of the century.

A migratory song bird, the meadow pipit, has declined by nearly 70%.

The museum described the pace and extent of the wipe-out as “a level approaching an ecological catastrophe”.

The primary culprit, researchers speculate, is the intensive use of pesticides on vast tracts of monoculture crops, especially wheat and corn.

The problem is not that birds are being poisoned, but that the insects on which they depend for food have disappeared.

“There are hardly any insects left, that’s the number one problem,” said Vincent Bretagnolle, a CNRS ecologist at the Centre for Biological Studies in Chize.

Recent research, he noted, has uncovered similar trends across Europe, estimating that flying insects have declined by 80%, and bird populations has dropped by more than 400m in 30 years.

Despite a government plan to cut pesticide use in half by 2020, sales in France have climbed steadily, reaching more than 75,000 tonnes of active ingredient in 2014, according to European Union figures.

“What is really alarming, is that all the birds in an agricultural setting are declining at the same speed, even ’generalist’ birds,” which also thrive in other settings such as wooded areas, said Bretagnolle.

“That shows that the overall quality of the agricultural eco-system is deteriorating.”

Figures from the national survey – which relies on a network of hundreds of volunteer ornithologists – indicate the die-off gathered pace in 2016 and 2017.

Drivers of the drop in bird populations extend beyond the depletion of their main food source, the scientists said.

Shrinking woodlands, the absence of the once common practice of letting fields lie fallow and especially rapidly expanding expanses of mono-crops have each played a role.

“If the situation is not yet irreversible, all the actors in the agriculture sector must work together to change their practices,” Fontaine said."

Facebook's value plunges $37 billion on data controversy,http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/19/news/companies/zuckerberg-net-worth/index.html?sr=twCNN031918companies0452PMStory,"Facebook shares took a big hit Monday, shaving about $37 billion off the value of the company.

The stock tumbled about 7% Monday on news that data firm Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Trump's campaign, reportedly accessed information from about 50 million Facebook users. This is the stock's biggest drop, on a percentage basis, in four years.

Even after Monday's plunge, Facebook is still one of the nation's most valuable companies, with a market cap of about $500 billion. It's behind only Apple (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and about even with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA).

Related: Why nobody can tell Mark Zuckerberg what to do at Facebook

Mark Zuckerberg holds about 400 million shares of Facebook (FB), and his net worth plunged by about $5 billion Monday afternoon. Shares closed the day down $12.53.

Of course even with the single-day drop the value of his holdings, Zuckerberg still owns about $70 billion worth of Facebook shares. That's enough to make him the sixth richest man in the world, according to Forbes' real-time billionaire tracker.

To put the dollar drop in context though, when Zuckerberg took Facebook public in 2012, the value of Zuckerberg's Facebook shares was about $19 billion. Facebook posted a drop of greater than 7% in a single day on seven different occasions in its early days of trading. But this is the biggest single-day slide ever in terms of dollar value for the stock.

Related: Facebook is facing an existential crisis

The stock fell Monday after the Cambridge Analytica controversy prompted some outside observers to suggest that Facebook should be more regulated. Some users have vowed to stop using Facebook and there are also questions about what the company will have to do to restore public trust in Facebook's commitment to privacy and data protection.

"Footage has emerged which claims to show the horrific conditions endured by 500,000 chickens that lay eggs for the UK's largest egg producer and supermarkets. Big & Fresh brand of eggs are sold in most of UK's leading supermarkets, including Tesco and Asda.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/chickens-eggs-footage-noble-foods-big-fresh-walston-poultry-farm-a8262296.html,"Footage has emerged which claims to show the horrific conditions endured by 500,000 chickens that lay eggs for the UK’s largest egg producer and supermarkets.

Around 140 million eggs are laid each year at Walston Poultry Farm, prompting undercover investigators to obtain covert footage.

Investigators claim to have discovered the farm, which supplies eggs for Noble Foods’ Big & Fresh, breached animal welfare laws.

In the footage, chickens can be seen in cages stacked seven high (SWNS)

In footage taken at the farm in Blandford Forum, Dorset, chickens can be seen in cages stacked seven high and locked in sheds.

Big & Fresh, a brand of eggs from caged birds, is sold in most of the UK’s leading supermarkets, including Tesco and Asda.

Noble Foods said it has launched an internal investigation and audit.

Animal Equality, a leading international animal protection organisation, released the footage after obtaining it by placing hidden cameras at the farm.

Footage proves Noble farm is in breach of the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007, Animal Equality charity claims (SWNS)

They left one camera running for four days, and in that time the hens were checked only once.

Animal welfare law states that birds have to be checked “at least once a day” and inspections should be “sufficiently thorough to detect illness and injury of individual hens, and special attention should be paid to bodily condition”.

In the footage, dead hens can be seen lying in cages, and one dead bird was photographed in the same place for two consecutive days.

The footage proves that Noble farm is in breach of the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007, the charity claim.

One dead bird was photographed in the same place for two consecutive days (SWNS)

Dr Toni Shephard, the UK director of Animal Equality, said: “The pitiless practice of locking hens inside crowded cages inevitably leads to the frail, featherless birds and high mortality that we found on this farm.

“But the failure to even check on these poor, helpless hens once a day – as the law requires – shows complete disregard for them as living, feeling animals with fundamental needs.

“Consumers paying a premium for Happy Eggs will be horrified to learn they are indirectly supporting these cruel cages used on Noble Foods’ other farms. It is time for Noble to go cage-free across all of their brands.

“We wanted to show the conditions inside a typical caged hen farm.

“We know eggs in supermarkets will say from caged hens but for most consumers that doesn’t draw up the images to mind of what the practice looks like.

“They don’t picture the severity of the suffering.

“The images will be shocking to people, to see just how crowded those cages are and how severely the animals suffer from feather loss and the number of dead animals.

“For me, it’s the scale of the operation that is so shocking.

“There can be half a million birds on one farm but to drive past it you would have no idea, there’s no windows, no indication that these huge metal sheds contain living animals.

“Caging animals for their entire lives without fresh air, without daylight, never even standing on solid ground, that has got to be the most cruel form of farming that is currently practised in Britain.

“I’m very pleased the different agencies have committed to inspecting the farm, including Dorset trading standards and the British Lion code.

“They have both said they will be investigating the farm after getting our evidence, so we would certainly like to make sure the farm complies with at least the basic protection that farm animals have, to be inspected at least once a day.

“It’s going in the right direction, but too slowly for the animals that are suffering in these conditions.”

In the footage, dead hens can be seen lying in cages (SWNS)

A spokesperson for Noble Foods said: “Noble Foods takes the welfare of poultry on farms supplying the company very seriously.

“The egg industry and its customers require companies to be stringently checked by regular independent auditing procedures including spot checks via unannounced visits.

“All sites supplying Noble Foods are fully compliant with UK Government and European regulations on welfare of poultry.

“Having seen the report produced by Animal Equality, relating to our contract producer ‘Walston Poultry’ with whom we have a long-standing relationship, we have immediately launched an internal investigation and audit of the site highlighted.

“Separately, the farm will be visited, without notice, by the British Egg Industry Council responsible for the Lion Code of Practice, the officially approved scheme requiring egg producers to maintain the highest possible welfare standards and environmental controls.

“Our investigation into this matter is underway and Noble Foods remains committed and vigilant in demanding the highest standards from all its suppliers.”

Walston Poultry Farm did not respond to a request for comment.

According to their website, Walston supply eggs “as far afield as the Falkland Islands” and customers “include national retailers”."
"The guaimaro, a highly prized tree bearing nutritious fruit, once abundant throughout South America, is slowly being coaxed back from near extinction in Colombia. Deforestation has decimated the bountiful tree, whose leaves and fruit have for centuries sustained animals and humans alike.",http://www.straitstimes.com/world/americas/latin-americas-magic-tree-slowly-coming-back-to-life,"DIBULLA, COLOMBIA (AFP) - The guaimaro, a highly prized tree bearing nutritious fruit, once abundant throughout South America, is slowly being coaxed back from near extinction in Colombia.

Widely adaptable, the tree is resistant to drought - though not, sadly, to man. Deforestation has decimated the bountiful tree, whose leaves and fruit have for centuries sustained animals and humans alike.

""Without trees, there is no water, and without water, there are no trees. People cut it, burn it for cultivation, for their livestock. Wood is scarce and the rivers are drying up,"" lamented Manuel Duran.

With a weary hand, the 61-year-old farmer raised his straw hat and wiped the sweat from his brow.

A searing sun beat down on the dry forest near Duran's home outside Dibulla, in the foothills of the majestic Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains.

Here, in Colombia's northeastern Guajira region, new life is being breathed back into stocks of the beloved tree.

More than 900 kilometres (560 miles) away, in Medellin, hundreds of global experts are gathered around the planet's sickbed this week. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) will make its diagnosis later this month on the health of the world's fauna, flora and soil.

Conscious of the damage caused by rapacious agricultural practices, Duran has joined in a reforestation program run by a French-Colombian NGO.

""The guaimaro is a magic tree,"" said Daisy Tarrier, the 39-year-old director of the NGO Envol Vert. She enthusiastically lists the qualities of its fruit, a sort of orange nut rich in nutrients.

ANCESTRAL TREE

Brosimum alicastrum, to give the tree its scientific name, grows from Mexico to Brazil. Depending on the country, it is known variously as ramon, campeche, ojoche, mewu or, in English, as maya nut.

It was as essential to pre-Colombian civilisation as corn, and still is for a number of indigenous communities. But its qualities have been forgotten by many farmers.

In order to revive valuable knowledge in the fight against malnutrition with local food sources, Envol Vert organizes cooking workshops using the fruit.

""The fruit contains as much protein as milk, four times more potassium than bananas, as much iron as spinach, four times more magnesium than kidney beans,"" said Tarrier.

Biologists have discovered the evergreen tree balances acidic soils, and even secretes the greenhouse gas carbon monoxide into the soil. Unlike most trees when they die, it never releases it into the atmosphere.

It can grow to a height of 50 metres (165 feet), and its taproot sinks just as deep into the earth. That makes it very resistant to both drought and hurricanes. It even has phoenix-like qualities, scientists say, as it readily regrows after a fire.

""This tree has a great ability to adapt to different climates and can withstand various types of soils, humidity, altitude, temperature - and many animals feed on its fruit. It is an important species for conservation,"" said Colombian biologist Monica Florez.

A SURVIVOR OF DEFORESTATION

But the lust for hardwoods for housebuilding and furniture-making, as well as deforestation to clear land for cattle breeding and for crops such as oil palms, has taken its toll - not to mention the effect of Colombia's coca plantations to feed the demand for cocaine.

""We are still facing a huge challenge related to the control of deforestation,"" Colombia's minister for environment and sustainable development, Luis Gilberto Murillo, said last month.

But he pointed out that the rate of deforestation was decreasing, from more than 282,000 hectares (700,000 acres) in 2010 to about 170,000 hectares in 2017.

Working with nearly 200 families, including 87 from Santa Rita de la Sierra, a village for displaced people near Dibulla, Envol Vert has contributed since 2011 to planting more than 30,000 trees across some 20 species, including 6,000 guaimaros.

Nurseries are entrusted to communities who raise trees there to be transplanted in their own plots.

""I've always loved guaimaro because it gives shade, and when the leaves fall, they are eaten by the goats and by the cattle. Its roots strengthen the soil, keep the moisture, and its fruits are good for animals and for us humans,"" said Maria Alarcon, 64, who lost two brothers and a son in the country's decades-long war.

A guaimaro will produce about 180 kilos (400 pounds) of fruit a year across a lifespan of some 100 years. The fruit is consumed raw and in juices, soups or mashed like potatoes. It can even be grilled and ground to powder to make infusions, with the look and flavour of chocolate coffee.

Indigenous communities use guaimaro sap for medicinal purposes: for asthma in Central America, anemia in Mexico, or rheumatism in Peru.

Maria Alarcon, her hands in the earth, is all too aware of the damage already done, and of the long road to recovery.

""We will have to plant a lot to replace all the trees that have been lost,"" she warned."
'Japanized' ethnic minority in Taiwan struggling to restore their own language | The Japan Times,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/02/20/national/japanized-ethnic-minority-taiwan-struggling-restore-language/#.Wq57YyLgnYU,"At a general store in a thickly forested mountain valley in eastern Taiwan, villagers are not speaking Mandarin Chinese nor Taiwanese but, surprisingly, a variant form of Japanese.

Aohua village in Nanao township in Yilan County is home to indigenous Atayal people, whose language stems from the days when Japan pushed thorough Japanese-language education and promoted “Japanization” during its 50-year colonial rule of the island up to 1945.

“My father repeatedly told us before he died that Japanese people did us two good things and two bad things,” said 55-year-old store manager Sicyang Isaw.

“They helped us make our life better by introducing agriculture and taught us to be hardworking. On the other hand, their tight rein and forcing us to speak Japanese were bad,” she said.

The Atayal people originally lived by hunting in the mountains and were known as fierce fighters.

“Even after Japan left Taiwan, our parents raised us using familiar Japanese,” Sicyang said. “So our common language in the hamlet is still Japanese.”

The Japanese language has continued to be covertly used for more than half a century and has evolved into a unique variant, with particles frequently omitted.

During her high school years in an urban area, Sicyang was asked by one of her Han Chinese friends if she could speak the Atayal language. She answered “yes” and spoke some.

But the friend denied that she spoke an ethnic language and pointed out to her that she was using Japanese.

Her four children can’t speak the Atayal language. Her grandchildren started taking an ethnic-language class at school while speaking Chinese in their daily conversation. Sicyang herself regularly studies the Atayal language in an adult education class.

The ethnic-language education started during the administration of Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan’s first directly elected leader and who promoted democratization, and progressed largely under the following 2000-2008 Democratic Progressive Party presidency of Chen Shui-bian.

Indigenous people account for about 2 percent of Taiwan’s estimated population of 23.6 million. Among them, the Atayal are quite numerous, scattered across many parts of Taiwan.

They include Vivian Hsu, a TV personality active in Japan whose mother is a native Atayal.

Indigenous people face not only the language barrier but also environmental issues.

At a community center, a gathering of Aohua villagers discussed development plans for another stone pit on the upper side of the hamlet. They voiced concerns about the plans, with one saying “it may further the destruction of the environment” and another saying that “it might have adverse effects on the younger generation.”

There are numerous quarries on the nearby mountain and many men from the village make their living as truck drivers, transporting the stone quarried from the pits.

When Sicyang was a child, crabs could be caught in a mountain stream, but they are now long gone as sediment deposits have increased due to the quarrying.

Sicyang has launched a group to protect the Atayal ethnic identity, and to try to conserve the environment of the hamlet and revitalize their traditional culture.

“I believe there are similar problems around the world. The strong foist what they do not want on the ethnic minority’s land,” Hayung Noqan, a 47-year-old elementary school teacher, said after the briefing at the center. Born in Aohua, Hayung has studied the hamlet’s history.

Aohua and its vicinity once became a candidate for a final disposal site for radioactive waste from a nuclear power station in 2014.

The Aohua elementary school, where Hayung teaches, is the only primary school in the hamlet, which has a population of 1,000 people and 77 students in total.

In a classroom of first-graders, a 69-year-old female teacher wearing traditional costume teaches the Atayal language. The teacher, who is from another hamlet, said she grew up speaking the language at home. She also speaks Japanese.

Sicyang’s grandchild, Toli Iban, 9, is a third-grader at the school. At her store, Toli was asked to say something in Atayal and bashfully tried, quickly drawing loud laughter from the people around — because what he said was Japanese for “Where are you going?”

The environment these days for learning the Atayal language in schools has improved from years gone by, but Sicyang said that “taking a class once a week is too little.”

“We grew up hearing the Atayal language our parents and grandparents spoke in conversation. But our grandchildren have little opportunity to listen to the language in everyday life, so it’s the same as a foreign language,” she said while weaving an ethnic-patterned cloth.

“We have a sense of crisis that our own language may disappear. I hope we all will talk in Atayal, not in Japanese, in the future.”

Georgian President: West Awakening to Russian Security Threat in Historic 'Now Moment',https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-president-west-awakening-to-russian-threat/4301298.html,"WASHINGTON - Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili is calling for American and European leaders to capitalize on what he calls a palpable, growing international consensus about the scope, magnitude and immediacy of national security threats posed by Russian election interference and suspected assassination attempts on foreign soil.

“There is a ‘now moment’ here in the United States; there is a ‘now moment’ in London; there is a ‘now moment’ in Brussels ... a moment of comprehension of the [threats] to security for all nations that are challenged by Russia,” Margvelashvili said in a sit-down interview with VOA’s Georgian Service on Thursday.

“We have seen murders in London. We have seen the murder of a retired Georgian peacekeeper in Tskhinvali,” he told VOA, referring to Archil Tatunashvili, who died while in custody of Russian-backed security officials in Georgia’s occupied breakaway region of South Ossetia.

“There are problems that unite us and now is the moment to unite — now is the moment to craft a joint response to the Russian Federation by Georgia and by allies of (the) EU and NATO,” he said. “We have to stand united in our values, in our challenges, and we must have a united rational response on better peace, security, and stability for these regions and alliances.”

Military forces work on a van in Winterslow, Engla Military forces work on a van in Winterslow, England, March 12, 2018, as investigations continue into the nerve-agent poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, England, March 4, 2018. Military forces work on a van in Winterslow, England, March 12, 2018, as investigations continue into the nerve-agent poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, England, March 4, 2018.

Although Russia has denied any involvement in this month’s attempted murder of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain — even offering to assist in the investigation — leaders of Britain, France, Germany and the U.S. have jointly condemned the attack, blaming Moscow for “the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War.”

Russian tanks in Georgia

In Georgia, where Russian tank units maintain control over 20 percent of the terrain, a holdover from the August 2008 five-day war, officials have long espoused their conviction that Russia might one day attempt to annex portions of Ukraine, which it did in 2014.

Margvelashvili, who became president in 2013, is in Washington this week to meet with members of Congress and warn them against being naive about Russian aggression toward the West, a message his country has emphatically stressed since the 2008 invasion.

Although Georgia has enjoyed support from high profile legislators such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former vice president Joseph Biden, the current White House administration, while maintaining nonrecognition of Georgia’s two Russian-occupied, breakaway regions, has not revisited policy on Russian aggression in the region.

Margvelashvili is also seeking to expand support for Georgian efforts to join NATO, which it has been seeking since 2002. NATO leaders pledged in 2008 to secure membership for Georgia and Ukraine but stopped short of granting the former Soviet republics Membership Action Plan (MAP) status, which would have expedited membership.

Critics of Georgia’s NATO accession say Tbilisi has not yet proven its fiscal readiness, arguing that the southern Caucasus nation needs to improve its per capita income before it can assume the financial burden of NATO membership. Currently, Georgia’s per capita GDP is far below the NATO average, only one-fourth that of its Baltic neighbors to the north.

“There are [also] concerns in the Alliance about the Azerbaijani investigative reporter who was abducted, and the [fact that] Amnesty International issued a report expressing concern about issues in law enforcement and intelligence, saying there needs to be an independent assessment of these kinds of activities, further gains in that area,” former U.S. ambassador to Georgia William Courtney told VOA Georgian.

Georgia ready

Margvelashvili, however, insists Georgia has done its part.

“Georgia is committed” to securing NATO membership, he said, “and I believe Georgia is ready and even deserves NATO membership.”

“There are question regarding Georgia’s democratic developments both in [Washington] and Brussels, these questions are asked openly,” he said. “If we are unable to reform judiciary system, that would be a big challenge for our democracy and our place in European family.”

A top NATO official, who last week spoke with VOA Georgian on condition of anonymity, said NATO believes Georgia should be able to enter the alliance intact.

“Georgia will not be forced to choose between its territorial integrity and membership in NATO,” she said. “We call upon Russia to reverse its recognition of [Georgia’s occupied] territories, to stop the construction of borderlike obstacles along the administrative boundary lines and to abide by its international commitments.”

"German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer: 'Islam doesn't belong to Germany' - In a slight to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, new Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Islam is not part of German culture. His comments underscore his efforts to push the government to the right.",http://www.dw.com/en/german-interior-minister-horst-seehofer-islam-doesnt-belong-to-germany/a-42999726,"Germany's new government may now finally be in place, but Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition appears to be off to a rocky start.

On Thursday, newly inaugurated Interior Minister Horst Seehofer disagreed with the belief that the Islamic faith is part of German culture — a statement that Merkel has repeatedly made since 2015.

""No. Islam does not belong to Germany,"" he said in an interview with the German daily Bild newspaper. ""Germany has been shaped by Christianity.""

Certain Christian-inspired aspects are part of daily life and culture in Germany, Seehofer said, naming examples such as shops being closed on Sundays and public holidays that correspond to church holidays like Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.

Seehofer told the paper that people who practice Islam are, of course, part of Germany.

""The Muslims who live with us obviously belong to Germany,"" he noted, adding that ""false consideration for others clearly does not mean we give up our country-specific traditions and customs.""

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Chancellor: Angela Merkel (CDU) Christian Democrat (CDU) Angela Merkel is Germany's chancellor. She is in her fourth term as leader of the German government and in her third at the head of a ""grand coalition"" between the CDU, its conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democrats (SPD). Merkel says she will not run for chancellor at the next general election in 2021.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister of the Interior, Heimat and Construction: Horst Seehofer (CSU) Seehofer was Bavaria's state premier until he took over the interior portfolio in Merkel's Cabinet. This will be the first time that the vaguely patriotic ""Heimat"" concept (roughly ""homeland"") is included in the interior minister's domain. Bavaria, however, has had a state Heimat Ministry for five years. Seehofer remains head of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister for Foreign Affairs: Heiko Maas (SPD) Former Justice Minister Heiko Maas succeeded his Social Democrat colleague, Sigmar Gabriel, as foreign minister in March. Maas was in charge of the Justice Ministry when the government passed a controversial internet law to combat hate speech online.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Finance Minister: Olaf Scholz (SPD) Scholz served as mayor of Hamburg before moving to Berlin to take the reins at the Finance Ministry. The Finance Ministry's capture was a significant win for the SPD. Scholz will also serve as vice-chancellor. He had been in Merkel's Cabinet once before, as minister of labor and social affairs from 2007 to 2009.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister of Defense: Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) Von der Leyen has been defense minister since 2013 and kept her job in the new government. This comes despite numerous scandals within the Bundeswehr, Germany's military, that broke since she took over the Defense Ministry. Her relationship with the troops suffered, but Merkel trusts her.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Economic and Energy Affairs Minister: Peter Altmaier (CDU) Altmaier was Merkel's chief of staff at the Chancellery before his nomination to take over the Economy Ministry. The last time a CDU politician was in the post was half a century before. Altmaier is regarded as extremely loyal to the chancellor.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection: Katarina Barley (SPD) Katarina Barley took over as justice minister after serving as both minister of family affairs and labor in the previous government. The 49-year-old is a lawyer by training and holds both British and German citizenship.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister of Labor and Social Affairs: Hubertus Heil (SPD) Hubertus Heil succeeded Andrea Nahles, who stepped down to take over as head of the SPD. A member of the Bundestag since 1998, Heil has twice served as the party's secretary general.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister for the Environment: Svenja Schulze (SPD) Svenja Schulze replaced party colleague Barbara Hendricks, Germany's former minister for the environment, nature conservation and nuclear safety, in March. Schulze previously served as minister for innovation, science and research in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister for Health: Jens Spahn (CDU) Jens Spahn, 37, is representative of a new political generation within the CDU and seen as a future contender for party leadership. In the last government, he served as the parliamentary state secretary in the Finance Ministry. Prior to that, he helped lead the CDU's health policy in the Bundestag.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister of Education and Research: Anja Karliczek (CDU) Anja Karliczek, a former hotel manager who is relatively unknown, was nominated by Merkel to take over the Education Ministry. She had a lot of money to spend: The ministry's budget was increased by €11 billion ($13.6 billion) to pay for school and university improvements shortly before her appointment.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth: Franziska Giffey (SPD) Franziska Giffey's elevation from the mayor of Berlin's Neukölln district to cabinet minister was perhaps one of the most eye-catching appointments. Giffey bypassed the Bundestag altogether to ascend into government. But the SPD leadership believed her experience in charge of what has often been described as Berlin's ""troubled"" district made her the most suitable candidate for the role.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development: Gerd Müller (CSU) Gerd Müller, 62, retained his post as development minister, which he has held since December 2013. He won the job over fellow CSU member Dorothee Bär, who was also in the running. Bär became the state minister for digital affairs in the chancellery, a newly created job.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure: Andreas Scheuer (CSU) Scheuer, considered a close ally of CSU party head Seehofer, took over the Transport Ministry from party colleague Alexander Dobrindt. He is experienced in the field: From 2009 to 2013, he was parliamentary state secretary in the Transport Ministry. Prior to his latest appointment, he was the CSU's secretary general.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Minister for Food and Agriculture: Julia Klöckner (CDU) Klöckner previously worked as parliamentary state secretary in the Agriculture Ministry from 2009 to 2011. Between her ministerial stints in Berlin, she was deputy chair of the CDU and headed the CDU in the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Ministers under Merkel: Germany's new government Chief of Staff at the Chancellery: Helge Braun (CDU) Helge Braun took over from CDU colleague Peter Altmaier as Chancellery head in March. He had previously served in deputy positions in the Chancellery and Education Ministry. Author: Carla Bleiker, Alexander Pearson



Seehofer's move to the Heimat Ministry

Seehofer is taking the reins of the interior ministry, which is now officially called the Interior, Construction and Heimat Ministry. The term Heimat — which roughly translates to ""homeland"" — stirs up feelings of being at home and belonging to a place, but it also comes laden with connotations from the Nazi era.

During his interview with the Bild, Seehofer rejected the criticism that the new German Cabinet doesn't include any people of color, or those with an immigrant background.

""Do I have to be a doctor in order to be health minister?"" he asked, adding that an immigrant background does not make someone qualified to be a good politician.

Seehofer's comments also depict the Bavarian politician's intent to steer his Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) and the new German government into a more conservative direction and win back voters who switched to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).

The phrase ""Islam doesn't belong to Germany"" was a central pillar of the AfD's party platform in last year's general election. The populist party is now the third-largest bloc in parliament and Germany's largest opposition party.

Seehofer has also vowed to increase deportations of rejected asylum-seekers in his role as interior minister.

The CSU leader has frequently bumped heads with Merkel in the past and has been vocal in his criticism of the chancellor's refugee and immigration policies.

Merkel started a fourth term as chancellor on Wednesday after her Christian Democrats, the CSU and the Social Democrats sealed a coalition deal after months of negotiations.

"Teacher who used a chalkboard in a computer class with no computers, stars at Microsoft's Education Exchange",https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2018/03/15/teacher-who-used-a-chalkboard-in-computer-class-because-he-had-no-computer-stars-at-microsofts-education-exchange/,"Teacher who used a chalkboard in a computer class with no computers, stars at Microsoft’s Education Exchange

By Geoff Spencer, Microsoft Asia Writer

UPDATE: A Microsoft spokesman says: “Microsoft is committed to providing a full computer lab with initial support and training to the school and is currently in discussions with the Ministry of Education in Ghana on the most effective way to deliver this.”

A teacher who resorted to using a chalkboard in his computer studies class – because his school in Ghana had no working PCs – has been given a star treatment at an international educators’ conference hosted by Microsoft in Singapore.

Richard Appiah Akoto, 33, became a social media sensation after he posted pictures of himself painstakingly sketching out a mock-up of a Microsoft Word screen in colored chalk on his classroom blackboard so his students could learn digital skills even without devices.

He received a long ovation when he appeared on stage at the Education Exchange (E2) – a gathering of almost 400 educators and school leaders from 91 countries looking at how technology and new ways of teaching can prepare students for success in the digital age.

Anthony Salcito, Vice President, Worldwide Education at Microsoft, praised Richard as one example of the many teachers worldwide who overcome massive obstacles to meet their students’ needs every day.

“Your work has really inspired the world. It really shows the amazing innovation and commitment and passion that teachers have for helping their students get ready for the future,” Anthony said. “At Microsoft, we believe that educators are heroes and are pushing the boundaries of what is possible to transform learning and making a direct impact on the experiences and lifelong skills of their students.”

Microsoft was so impressed by Richard’s dedication and innovation that it flew him halfway around the world to Singapore – the first time Richard had ever left Ghana. Anthony said that by coming all that way to participate in E2, Richard was now part of a community of educators who share experiences and learn from one another on how to teach and engage with students.

Later, Richard said he has dedicated himself to teaching vital digital skills to his students, so they would not be left behind in life. “They have some knowledge about computers, but they don’t know how to actually operate one,” he said in an interview. But showing his class how to use a PC posed a fundamental problem as the school’s only computer and his own personal laptop were both broken.

“At Microsoft, we believe that educators are heroes and are pushing the boundaries of what is possible to transform learning and making a direct impact on the experiences and lifelong skills of their students.”

“I wanted to teach them how to launch Microsoft Word. But I had no computer to show them. I had to do my best. So, I decided to draw what the screen looks like on the blackboard with chalk,” he said. “I drew the features and labeled them correctly so that they would know what-was-what. Then I drew what you would see on your computer screen after launching Word.

I have been doing this every time the lesson I’m teaching demands it. I’ve drawn monitors, system units, keyboards, a mouse, a formatting toolbar, a drawing toolbar, and so on. The students were okay with that. They are used to me doing everything on the board for them. When I did this, it was nothing new or strange for them.”

But the rest of world thought it was something extraordinary after he posted his efforts on social media. Pictures of him drawing on his chalkboard went viral and make world headlines. As well as thousands of likes, Richard – who uses the social media pseudonym of Owura Kwadwo Hottish – got pledges of help from around the world.

Microsoft will be working with Richard through a local partner in Ghana to provide device and software support required for his students at the Betenase Municipal Assembly Junior High School in the town of Sekyedomase in rural Ghana. He will also gain access to the Microsoft Certified Educator Program (MCE) for professional development, so he can nurture his passion for teaching and build rich, custom learning experiences for his students. “Something very positive has come out of this and I am very happy. We are no longer going to use the chalkboard again. We will have computers.”

"'Biohacker' implants travel card in hand, gets ticket fine",https://www.cnet.com/news/biohacker-implants-travel-card-in-hand-court-says-nice-try/,"Science Party

Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow is (the real name of) a 33-year-old Australian man who's fighting a fine for not having a valid train ticket. His defence? He had a valid ticket the whole time -- inside his hand.

Meow-Meow appeared in Newtown Local Court in Sydney, New South Wales on Friday morning, where he pled guilty to the charge of travelling without a train ticket.

Meow-Meow is ""ahead of the law,"" his lawyer Nicholas Broadbent told the ruling Magistrate, according to BuzzFeed. Broadbent explained that Meow-Meow is a ""self-identified biohacker."" The prosecutor, Andrew Wozniak, argued that ""whatever was in the defendant's hand, it certainly wasn't a card.""

The Magistrate sided with the prosecution, ordering Meow-Meow to pay the fine and legal fees -- a total of AU$1,220 ($950, £680).

""This is a case where the law is behind the technology,"" Meow Meow said to CNET. ""And I think this is a good take-home message: The technology is moving in a certain direction, I've just moved quicker than the law in this case.""

Though he conceded that he accepted the ruling, he said ""everyone knows in their gut that after a period of time this stuff is gonna be commonplace and fine.""

New South Wales' Opal travel cards are used for trains, buses and ferries across the state. Meow-Meow, a co-founder of biohacking site Biofoundry, had his Opal card implanted in his hand in April 2017. The chip was cut out of the credit card-sized Opal, encased in plastic and implanted by a piercer.

""I accept the judges ruling, but does it discourage me from further biohacking? No, not at all,"" Meow-Meow said. ""I didn't do this to take this to court, I did this because it was convenient. And it was fun.""

Meow-Meow is a member of the Science Party, through which he hopes to score a seat in federal parliament. This is the type of legislation he'd like to change, he said."
Saudi crown prince vows to develop nuclear bomb if Iran does,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/saudi-crown-prince-vows-develop-nuclear-bomb-if-iran-does-n856886,"RIYADH — Saudi Arabia will develop a nuclear bomb if its arch-rival Iran does so, the kingdom's 32-year-old crown prince said in a preview of a television interview released on Thursday.

""Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,"" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS in an interview that will air on Sunday.

The kingdom, locked in a tussle for influence with Iran across the Middle East and beyond, is stepping up plans to develop a nuclear energy capability as part of a reform plan led by Prince Mohammed to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil.

The United States, South Korea, Russia, France and China are bidding on a multi-billion dollar tender to build Saudi Arabia's first two nuclear reactors.

The world's top oil exporter has previously said it wants nuclear technology only for peaceful uses but has left unclear whether it also wants to enrich uranium to produce nuclear fuel, a process which can also be used in the production of atomic weapons.

The Saudi government approved a national policy for its atomic energy program on Tuesday, including limiting all nuclear activities to peaceful purposes, within the limits defined by international treaties.

Reactors need uranium enriched to around five percent purity but the same technology in this process can also be used to enrich the heavy metal to a higher, weapons-grade level. This has been at the heart of Western and regional concerns over the nuclear work of Iran, Saudi Arabia’s arch-rival which enriches uranium domestically.

President Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday and announced he was replacing him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, citing differences over the nuclear deal between Iran and the West.

""I actually got along well with Rex, but really it was a different mindset, a different thinking,"" Trump said Tuesday as he departed the White House for a trip to California. ""When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. ... So we were not really thinking the same. With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process. I think it's going to go very well.""

The White House announced Monday that the president will meet with the Saudi crown prince on March 20, saying Trump ""looks forward to discussing ways to strengthen ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia and to advance our common security and economic priorities."""

Emmanuel Macron has said he will unveil measures against Russia in response to poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal on British soil in coming days. French president spoke with Theresa May on phone about ?progress of the investigation? in nerve agent attack.,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/emmanuel-macron-france-russia-nerve-agent-attack-spy-uk-salisbury-a8256951.html,"Emmanuel Macron has said he will unveil measures against Russia in response to the poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal on British soil in the coming days.

The French president spoke with Theresa May on the phone on Thursday morning about “progress of the investigation” in the nerve agent attack, which the British Government says was carried out by Russia.

The apparent about-face comes after a muted response from France, with one spokesperson having said yesterday the country would wait until the “elements are proven” instead of relying on “fantasy politics”.

But in a statement issued on Thursday morning, a spokesperson for Mr Macron said: “Since the beginning of the week, the United Kingdom has kept France closely informed of the evidence gathered by British investigators and evidence of Russia’s responsibility in the attack.

“France agrees with the United Kingdom that there is no other plausible explanation and reiterates its solidarity with its ally.”

Speaking separately to reporters in western France, Mr Macron himself added, according to the Reuters news agency: “Everything leads us to believe that responsibility is in fact attributable to Russia,” Macron told reporters in western France.

“I will announce in the coming days the measures that we intend to take.”

A Downing Street spokesperson said: “President Macron said that France completely shares the UK’s assessment that there is no plausible explanation other than that Russia was responsible for the attack and he once again expressed his full support for the UK as a close and strong ally.

Toys R Us Files for Bankruptcy Liquidation,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/03/15/toys-r-us-files-bankruptcy-liquidation/427129002/,"Toys R Us files for liquidation, likely spelling its end in the U.S.

Joan Verdon and Charisse Jones | The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record and USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption 30,000 jobs at risk as business fails at Toys 'R' Us Toys 'R' Us Inc, the iconic toy retailer, will shutter or sell its stores in the United States after failing to find a buyer or reach a deal to restructure billions in debt, putting at risk about 30,000 jobs.

Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this story misidentified the type of meeting where the CEO’s speech took place.

Toys R Us, the toy superstore that became a dream factory for kids nationwide, said in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing Thursday that it must liquidate, a move that would close 735 stores, leave 33,000 people without jobs and wrap up a 70-year run for a once-beloved holiday shopping spot.

The chain, whose chipper mascot Geoffrey the giraffe beckoned families to stores, said poor holiday sales caused its final demise. Online sales had undercut the popularity of its stores, and rampant discounting from the likes of Walmart and Target shaved away profits.

Saddled with enormous debt and piling up losses, the chain said it had no choice but to shut down. ""The stark reality is that the (chain is) projected to run out of cash in the U.S. in May,"" it said in its bankruptcy filing.

""I am devastated that we have reached this point,"" CEO Dave Brandon told corporate staff in a speech at company headquarters the day before.

Toys R Us said going-out-of-business sales would begin at all stores immediately.Gift cards can be redeemed for the next 30 days. Employees will be paid for ""no fewer than 60 days,"" the filing said.

Sad customers

The chain has been a critical part of the American retail landscape, one that still brings back fond memories for those who grew up around the store.

Dan Skinner of Naperville, Ill., in an email to USA TODAY, said he was awed by the size of the Toys R Us store that he used to visit growing up in Morristown, N.J.

""Toys and board games and bikes were stacked stories high,"" he wrote. ""When you were 8 years old, those displays felt like skyscrapers.""

He couldn't wait to visit.

""The drive over was always filled with anticipation. Typically we would go in celebration of a great report card or if I had birthday money to spend,"" he said.

Toys R Us said in its filing that its main lenders ""have determined that the best way to maximize their recoveries is to liquidate the existing inventory in all ... 735 remaining U.S. stores and begin an orderly wind-down of the U.S. operations.""

The company had initially hoped to be able to keep 400 stores open, according to the filing, but realized it didn’t have enough cash to preserve that many.

“Projected cash burn” according to the motion, was $50 million to $100 million a month, without even investing in any of the planned improvements to stores.

One sliver of hope: It said in the filing that it still hoped that 200 stores in the U.S. could be preserved in combination with its Canadian stores. It said is seeking a buyer for the Canadian operation.

Still, store fans were sad.

An adult customer, Bobby Armes, tweeted that Geoffrey the giraffe played a big role in his kids' lives.

""I remember that Geoffrey would give my children a phone call every year to wish them a happy birthday,"" tweeted Armes. ""That was special, and it was very appreciated.""

Holiday disaster

At a meeting Wednesday with corporate staff at the company's headquarters in Wayne, N.J., CEO Brandon said Toys R Us found itself ""in serious default on our financing covenants"" after a disastrous holiday season, according to a recording of the talk reviewed by The Record in Bergen County, N.J. For Christmas 2017, earnings were about half of what the company might expect in a normal year.

The holiday results showed lenders that Toys R Us is ""a company that consumes cash"" for most of the year, and earns money only during the holidays. When the holiday period underperformed, investors became justifiably nervous, he said.

While U.S. operations are ""subject to likely liquidation,"" Brandon said the Canadian, Central Europe and Asian divisions would be sold. At the court hearing, ""There is going to be an invitation sent around the world that all of these assets are available.""

Brandon also said the company would maintain the Babies R Us registry and the Web stores for the time being in hopes someone might want to buy that asset.

Born in a post-war baby boom

Toys R Us started as a children’s furniture store founded in 1948 by returning World War II vet Charles Lazarus. Taking advantage of the baby boom, Lazarus started opening toy superstores by 1957 as toy hits like Slinkys and Barbie dolls started hitting the market.

The chain's superstore concept triumphed as other chains with smaller stores and less selection fell. Yet Toys R Us finally was facing a foe it couldn't conquer: discounters like Walmart and online shopping dominated by Amazon. The digital era left it with too many stores.

Toys R Us shuttered dozens of stores as it attempted to deal with close to $5 billion in debt that resulted from a leveraged buyout in 2005 by private equity investors Bain Capital and KKR, and real estate trust Vornado.

'Here to stay'

When the company filed for bankruptcy protection in September, Brandon promised the court, in his opening declaration, that “Toys R Us is here to stay.”

Toy manufacturers and lenders who were owed money by Toys R Us, and landlords who owned store properties, backed nearly every request Toys R Us made as it attempted to reorganize. Toy makers said they needed the retailer to survive because it provided the best year-round showcase for all of their products, unlike retailers that only stock up on toys in November and December and shrink their toy aisles after the holidays.

Toys R Us also attempted to turn itself into a top destination once again, creating play areas where kids could try out toys, and introducing augmented reality to make its products come alive on screens as well as shelves.

But that wasn't enough to stop its slide.

While it's been years since Toys R Us was considered the only game in town when it came to picking up a birthday gift or treat, the disappearance of the one-time icon is one that many shoppers are likely to feel."

"Some 770,000 people settled in the UK do not speak English, Sajid Javid said as he defended the Government's proposals to encourage social integration...said there was a ?segregation problem? in some of England's schools and action was needed to tackle it.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/minister-says-770000-people-uk-cannot-speak-english-115007808.html,"Communities minister Sajid Javid says hundreds of thousands of people in the UK don’t speak English (Picture: PA)

Some 770,000 people settled in the UK do not speak English, Sajid Javid said as he defended the Government’s proposals to encourage social integration.

The plans, backed by £50 million of public money, include measures to boost English language skills and proposals to require schools whose pupils come from a single ethnic or religious community to ensure they mix with children from other backgrounds.

Communities Secretary Mr Javid said there was a “segregation problem” in some of England’s schools and action was needed to tackle it.

His comments come after a former government advisor said Britain needs to set a target date for everyone in the country to speak English.

The proposed Integrated Communities Strategy calls on schools to teach “British values” and sets out plans to boost English language skills and encourage women from minority communities to find jobs.

A consultation paper on the plans follows the 2016 Casey Review, which warned that social cohesion could not be taken for granted in the multicultural UK.

Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4’s Today there were about 770,000 people settled in Britain who “speak no or very poor English”.

“Just imagine the opportunities they have given up on, the inability they have to socially mix with others and really contribute to society.

” It’s not fair on them and it’s not fair on the rest of society,” he said.

Mr Javid, whose family came to the UK from Pakistan, said his mother took about 10 years to learn English.

“I remember as a six or seven-year-old going to the doctor’s surgery with her so I could interpret for her,” he said, but learning the language “absolutely transformed her life”.

Pressed on whether the money promised to support the strategy was enough, Mr Javid said: “It’s not just about the £50 million, there’s actually a substantial amount the Government already spends on helping people learn English.”

But “there hasn’t been enough of a joined-up approach” between Whitehall and local government, he acknowledged.

Highlighting the “segregation problem” in schools, Mr Javid said: “We believe about 60% of ethnic minority pupils… they go to schools where ethnic minority pupils are in the majority.

“If you just think about that and the amount of segregation that has been caused by schools, something new has to be done.”

Five pilot areas – Blackburn, Bradford, Peterborough, Walsall and the London borough of Waltham Forest – will develop local integration plans allowing new strategies to be tested as the programme develops.

The author of the 2016 report, Dame Louise Casey, welcomed measures to promote English tuition, telling Today: “It is really important that as a nation we are all able to speak a common language and that common language is English.”

Lady Casey said the strategy also included “very important, very powerful” proposals to tighten registration of home-schooling to protect children against exposure to extremist ideology.

But she warned that funding of £50 million over two years would not be enough to deliver the “seismic” shift needed.

Mr Javid’s Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is seeking responses to proposed initiatives set out in a new green paper.

Among the proposals are:

– A new community-based English language programme, with a network of conversation clubs and support for councils to improve provision of tuition.

– Personalised skills training to help women from “isolated” communities into work.

– Measures to ensure young people have the opportunity to mix and form lasting relationships with those from different backgrounds.

– Promotion of British values across the school curriculum.

– Increased take-up of the National Citizen Service.

Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: “We want to make sure that all children learn the values that underpin our society – including fairness, tolerance and respect.

“These are values that help knit our communities together, which is why education is at the heart of this strategy.”"
Panama Papers Law Firm Mossack Fonseca Closes Its Doors,https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/panama-papers-law-firm-mossack-fonseca-closes-doors/,"Mossack Fonseca, the offshore law firm whose 11.5 million leaked files were at the heart of the Panama Papers investigation, will close.

The law firm will shutter its remaining offices by the end of the month, according to a statement obtained by the the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).

“The reputational deterioration, the media campaign, the financial siege and the irregular actions of some Panamanian authorities have caused irreparable damage, whose obligatory consequence is the total cessation of operations to the public,” according to the law firm’s statement.

The firm said it would “continue to call for justice” and would cooperate with authorities to “demonstrate that no crime has been committed.”

In a statement sent to clients in November 2017, which seems to have foreshadowed the firm’s shutdown, Mossack Fonseca said it had to “significantly reduce” its staff due to changes to the laws and an “adverse business environment.”

The law firm’s demise comes almost two years after the Panama Papers investigation revealed the offshore ties of some of the world’s most powerful and most corrupt people. The firm’s leaked internal files contained information on more than 214,000 offshore entities tied to 12 current or former heads of state, 140 politicians and others. The investigation also brought down the prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan.

More than 400 journalists from 80 countries have published hundreds of stories since the first wave of revelations on April 3, 2016.

That month, police and investigators raided Mossack Fonseca offices in Panama and El Salvador. Authorities in Venezuela arrested a local employee. By the end of 2016, at least nine Mossack Fonseca offices, including one in the United States, had closed.

“For 40 years Mossack Fonseca has operated beyond reproach in our home country and other jurisdictions where we have operations,” a statement by the firm said at the time. “Our firm has never been accused or charged in connection with criminal wrongdoing.”

That changed in February 2017, when police in Panama arrested Mossack Fonseca’s founders, Ramon Fonseca and Jurgen Mossack, on money laundering charges as part of investigations into Brazil’s largest-ever bribery scandal. The pair were released that April. Separately, prosecutors in Panama launched an investigation into the law firm and the Panama Papers.

Founded in 1986, the Panama law firm grew into an offshore empire with more than 40 offices around the world, from the British Virgin Islands to New Zealand. In 2013, it employed more than 600 people and its billings exceeded $42 million.

Governments in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas have recovered more than $500 million as a result of the disclosures."
Military Brass Tells Congress It Has No Idea What Saudi Arabia Is Doing With U.S. Bombs in Yemen,https://theintercept.com/2018/03/14/yemen-war-centcom-elizabeth-warren/,"In a surprising admission on Tuesday, the head of U.S. Central Command — which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East and Central Asia — admitted that the Pentagon doesn’t know a whole lot about the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen that the United States is supporting through intelligence, munitions, and refueling. U.S. CENTCOM Cmdr. Gen. Joseph Votel made the admission in response to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “General Votel, does CENTCOM track the purpose of the missions it is refueling? In other words, where a U.S.-refueled aircraft is going, what targets it strikes, and the result of the mission?” Warren asked. “Senator, we do not,” Votel replied.

Warren followed up by describing an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition that struck civilians in February. The attack, in the northern Yemen town of Saada, killed five civilians. Medical staff who rushed in to help survivors were hit in a follow-up attack, Warren noted. (This is known as a “double-tap” airstrike.) “General Votel, when you receive reports like this from credible media organizations or outside observers, is CENTCOM able to tell if U.S. fuel or U.S. munitions were used in that strike?” “No, senator, I don’t believe we are,” he replied. Since the Yemen war started three years ago, the Saudi-led coalition has killed thousands of civilians, including in strikes on hospitals and civilian centers. U.S. tankers refuel planes from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and other coalition members, raising questions about American culpability in war crimes. Last month, Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; and Mike Lee, R-Utah introduced a resolution designed to end U.S. involvement in the war. In response to Votel’s answers, Warren said the lack of clarity about the specific role of the U.S. military in the conflict is one of the reasons she is backing the Sanders-Lee proposal. The Massachusetts senator pointed out that Iran also plays a role in fueling the conflict, but said U.S. support for Saudi Arabia makes it subject to more scrutiny. “We need to be clear about this: Saudi Arabia’s the one receiving American weapons and American support. And that means we bear some responsibility here. And that means we need to hold our partners and our allies accountable for how those resources are used,” she said."
Finland declared happiest country in the world in United Nations report,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/finland-happiest-country-united-nations-report-happiness-report-uk-us-a8256566.html,"Despite cold weather and long, dark winters, Finland is the happiest country in the world, according to a United Nations (UN) report.

The Nordic nation topped a list of 156 countries ranked in the World Happiness Report on factors such as life expectancy, social support and corruption.

Finland emerged as the happiest place even though its relatively little sun and low temperatures are often blamed for high rates of depression.

It vaulted to the top from fifth place in last year’s report, nudging Norway down into second.

Burundi was named the least happy country. The east African nation is one of the poorest in the world, and has been plagued by ethnic violence and political turmoil for decades.

The UK remained in 19th place, while the US slipped four places to 18th.

For the first time, the annual report published by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network also evaluated 117 countries by the happiness and well-being of their immigrants.

In 2015, more than a million migrants entered Europe, and a few thousand made it to Finland, a relatively homogenous country with about 300,000 foreigners and residents with foreign roots out of a population of 5.5 million.

Finland’s largest immigrant groups come from other European nations, but there also are communities from Afghanistan, China, Iraq and Somalia.

John Helliwell, a co-editor of the World Happiness Report and professor emeritus of economics at the University of British Columbia, noted that all the countries in the top 10 scored highest both in overall happiness and on the happiness of immigrants. He said a society’s happiness seemed to be contagious.

“The most striking finding of the report is the remarkable consistency between the happiness of immigrants and the locally born,” Mr Helliwell said. “Those who move to happier countries gain, while those who move to less happy countries lose.”

Europe’s Nordic nations, none particularly diverse, have dominated the index since it first was produced in 2012. Denmark was placed third this year and Iceland fourth.

“I think the basics are quite good in Finland... our politics and our economics,” said Sofia Holm, 24-year-old resident of Helsinki, the Nordic country’s capital. “We have the perfect circumstances to have a happy life here in Finland.”

​Inari Lepisto, 28, also of Helsinki, added: “It’s a great thing to live in the happiest country although it’s snowing and we are walking in this wet snow. Yes, we have many things that make me happy.”

Rounding out the top 10 were Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Australia.

Meik Wiking, chief executive of the Copenhagen-based Happiness Research Institute, said the five Nordic countries that reliably rank high in the index “are doing something right in terms of creating good conditions for good lives”.

He said the happiness revealed in the survey derives from healthy amounts of both personal freedoms and social security, which outweigh residents having to pay “some of the highest taxes in the world”.

“Briefly put, [Nordic countries] are good at converting wealth into well-being,” Mr Wiking said. The finding on the happiness of immigrants “shows the conditions that we live under matter greatly to our quality of life, that happiness is not only a matter of choice.”

The United States was 11th in the first index and has never been in the top 10. The report cited several factors to explain its falling ranking.

“The US is in the midst of a complex and worsening public health crisis, involving epidemics of obesity, opioid addiction, and major depressive disorder that are all remarkable by global standards,” the report said.

It added that the “sociopolitical system” in the United States produces more income inequality - a major contributing factor to unhappiness - than other countries with comparatively high incomes."

Finland has overtaken Norway to become the happiest nation on earth, according to a UN report.

The 2018 World Happiness Report also charts the steady decline of the US as the world’s largest economy grapples with a crisis of obesity, substance abuse and depression.

The study reveals the US has slipped to 18th place, five places down on 2016. The top four places are taken by Nordic nations, with Finland followed by Norway, Denmark and Iceland.

Safe, happy and free: does Finland have all the answers? Read more

Burundi in east Africa, scarred by bouts of ethnic cleansing, civil wars and coup attempts, is the unhappiest place in the world. Strikingly, there are five other nations – Rwanda, Yemen, Tanzania, South Sudan and the Central African Republic – which report happiness levels below that of even Syria.

For the first time the UN also examined the happiness levels of immigrants in each country, and found Finland also scored highest.

“Finland has vaulted from fifth place to the top of the rankings this year,” said the report’s authors, although they noted that the other three Nordic countries (plus Switzerland) have almost interchangeable scores.

The report, an annual publication from the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, said all the Nordic countries scored highly on income, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity. The rankings are based on Gallup polls of self-reported wellbeing, as well as perceptions of corruption, generosity and freedom.

The UN placing is the latest accolade for Finland, a country of 5.5 million people that only 150 years ago suffered Europe’s last naturally caused famine. The country has been ranked the most stable, the safest and best governed country in the world. It is also among the least corrupt and the most socially progressive. Its police are the world’s most trusted and its banks the soundest.

“That Finland is the top scorer is remarkable,” said Meik Wiking of the Happiness Research Institute in Denmark. “GDP per capita in Finland is lower than its neighbouring Nordic countries and is much lower than that of the US. The Finns are good at converting wealth into wellbeing.



“In the Nordic countries in general, we pay some of the highest taxes in the world, but there is wide public support for that because people see them as investments in quality of life for all. Free healthcare and university education goes a long way when it comes to happiness. In the Nordic countries, Bernie Sanders is not viewed as progressive – he is just common sense,” added Wiking, referring to the leftwing US politician who galvanised the Democrat primaries in the 2016 presidential election.



In Britain, figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest people have become happier in recent years. But the UN ranking places the UK in a lowly 19th place, the same as last year but behind Germany, Canada and Australia, although ahead of France and Spain.

The UN report devotes a special chapter to why the US, once towards the top of happiness table, has slipped down the league despite having among the highest income per capita.

“America’s subjective wellbeing is being systematically undermined by three interrelated epidemic diseases, notably obesity, substance abuse (especially opioid addiction) and depression,” said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in New York, and one of the report’s authors.

Despite African countries getting the worst happiness scores, one west African nation has bucked the trend. Togo came bottom in 2015 but was the biggest improver in the 2018 report, rising 18 places. Latvians and Bulgarians are also reporting higher levels of happiness.



Venezuela recorded the biggest fall in happiness, outstripping even Syria, although in absolute terms it remains a mid-ranking country. The report notes that Latin American countries generally scored more highly than their GDP per capita suggests, especially in contrast to fast-growing east Asian countries.

Latin America is renowned for corruption, high violence and crime rates, unequal distribution of income and widespread poverty, yet has consistently scored relatively highly in the happiness report. The authors attributed this to “the abundance of family warmth and other supportive social relationships frequently sidelined in favour of an emphasis on income measures in the development discourse”.

Meanwhile, the greatest human migration in history – the hundreds of millions of people who have moved from the Chinese countryside into cities – has not advanced happiness at all, the report found.

“Even seven-and-a-half years after migrating to urban areas, migrants from rural areas are on average less happy than they might have been had they stayed at home,” according to John Knight of the Oxford Chinese Economy Programme at the University of Oxford and one of the contributors to the UN report.

Students to walk out nationwide protesting gun violence,"https://apnews.com/c183323b5e6546419ae08b8c469b065a/Students-to-put-pencils-down,-walk-out-in-gun-protests","FILE - Students at Roosevelt High School take part in a protest against gun violence Wednesday, March 14, 2018, in Seattle.

They bowed their heads in honor of the dead. They carried signs with messages like “Never again” and “Am I next?” They railed against the National Rifle Association and the politicians who support it.

And over and over, they repeated the message: Enough is enough.

In a wave of protests one historian called the largest of its kind in American history, tens of thousands of students walked out of their classrooms Wednesday to demand action on gun violence and school safety.

The demonstrations extended from Maine to Hawaii as students joined the youth-led surge of activism set off by the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“We’re sick of it,” said Maxwell Nardi, a senior at Douglas S. Freeman High School in Henrico, Virginia, just outside Richmond. “We’re going to keep fighting, and we’re not going to stop until Congress finally makes resolute changes.”

Students around the nation left class at 10 a.m. local time for at least 17 minutes — one minute for each of the dead in the Florida shooting. Some led marches or rallied on football fields, while others gathered in school gyms or took a knee in the hallway.

At some schools, hundreds of students poured out. At others, just one or two walked out in defiance of administrators.

They lamented that too many young people have died and that they’re tired of going to school afraid they will be killed.

“Enough is enough. People are done with being shot,” said Iris Fosse-Ober, 18, a senior at Washburn High School in Minneapolis.

Some issued specific demands for lawmakers, including mandatory background checks for all gun sales and a ban on assault weapons like the one used in the Florida bloodbath.

While administrators and teachers at some schools applauded students for taking a stand — and some joined them — others threatened punishment for missing class.

As the demonstrations unfolded, the NRA responded by posting a photo on Twitter of a black rifle emblazoned with an American flag. The caption: “I’ll control my own guns, thank you.”

The protests took place at schools from the elementary level through college, including some that have witnessed their own mass shootings: About 300 students gathered on a soccer field at Colorado’s Columbine High, while students who survived the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack in 2012 marched out of Newtown High School in Connecticut.

In the nation’s capital, more than 2,000 high-school age protesters observed 17 minutes of silence while sitting on the ground with their backs turned to the White House. President Donald Trump was out of town.

The students carried signs with messages such as “Our Blood/Your Hands” and “Never Again” and chanted slogans against the NRA.

In New York City, they chanted, “Enough is enough!” In Salt Lake City, the signs read, “Protect kids not guns,” ″Fear has no place in school” and “Am I next?”

At Eagle Rock High in Los Angeles, teenagers took a moment of silence as they gathered around a circle of 17 chairs labeled with the names of the Florida victims.

Stoneman Douglas High senior David Hogg, who has emerged as one of the leading student activists, livestreamed the walkout at the tragedy-stricken school on his YouTube channel. He said students couldn’t be expected to stay in class while there was work to do to prevent gun violence.

“Every one of these individuals could have died that day. I could have died that day,” he said.

In joining the protests, the students followed the example set by many of the survivors of the Florida shooting, who have become gun-control activists, leading rallies, lobbying legislators and giving TV interviews. Their efforts helped spur passage last week of a Florida law curbing access to assault rifles by young people.

Another protest against gun violence is scheduled in Washington on March 24, with organizers saying it is expected to draw hundreds of thousands.

But whether the students can make a difference on Capitol Hill remains to be seen.

Congress has shown little inclination to defy the powerful NRA and tighten gun laws, and Trump backed away from his initial support for raising the minimum age for buying an assault rifle to 21.

A spokeswoman for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, newly appointed head of a federal panel on school safety, said DeVos “gives a lot credit to the students who are raising their voices and demanding change,” and “their input will be valuable.”

David Farber, a history professor at the University of Kansas who has studied social change movements, said it is too soon to know what effect the protests will have. But he said Wednesday’s walkouts were without a doubt the largest protest led by high school students in the history of the U.S.

“Young people are that social media generation, and it’s easy to mobilize them in a way that it probably hadn’t been even 10 years ago,” Farber said.

Wednesday’s coordinated protests were organized by Empower, the youth wing of the Women’s March, which brought thousands to Washington last year.

At Aztec High School in a rural, gun-friendly part of New Mexico where many enjoy hunting and shooting, students avoided gun politics and opted for a ceremony honoring students killed in shootings — including two who died in a December attack at Aztec.

“Our kids sit on both ends of the spectrum, and we have a diverse community when it comes to gun rights and gun control,” Principal Warman Hall said.

In Brimfield, Ohio, 12-year-old Olivia Shane, an avid competitive trap shooter who has owned her own guns since she was about 7, skipped the gun protest and memorial held at her school.

“People want to take away our guns and it’s a Second Amendment right of ours,” she said. “If they want to take away our Second Amendment right, why can’t we take away their amendment of freedom of speech?”

About 10 students left Ohio’s West Liberty-Salem High School — which witnessed a shooting last year — despite a warning they could face detention or more serious discipline.

Police in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta patrolled Kell High, where students were threatened with unspecified consequences if they participated. Three students walked out anyway.

The walkouts drew support from companies such as media conglomerate Viacom, which paused programming on MTV, BET, Nickelodeon and its other networks for 17 minutes during the walkouts.

National School Walkout: Thousands of students rallying in solidarity to end gun violence,http://abcnews.go.com/US/students-country-world-part-national-school-walkout-today/story?id=53712013,"Energized high schoolers rally across US in school walkouts: 'You don't want your brother, sister ... to be the next victims' The event began at 10 a.m. today across every time zone and last 17 minutes.

Thousands of high school students, many still far from voting age, are streaming out of schools across the country today to protest against gun violence in the wake of last month’s mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 people.

“I’m just mad there’s no action by our government representatives,” Daniel Rogov, a junior in Brooklyn, New York, said today.

“It’s all thoughts and prayers; it’s all talk,” he told ABC News. “After a gun violence tragedy there’s a speech talking about how we need change but there never is change.”

The event, which began at 10 a.m. across every time zone, was officially scheduled to last 17 minutes -- one minute for each of the victims gunned down in the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But many students are rallying for much longer.

To the students at Stoneman Douglas, Daniel's message is, “Keep making your voices heard. While the politicians might stop talking about this, we’re not done.”

Over 3,000 walkout events were registered to take part in today's call on Congress to pass tighter gun control laws, according to ENOUGH National School Walkout, the event organizers.

The walkouts are across the nation, from Michigan to Maryland, from Colorado to California, and from the White House to Washington state.

""Remember why we are walking out,"" Stoneman Douglas survivor Lauren Hogg wrote on Twitter today. ""We are walking out for my friends that passed, all children that have been taken because of gun violence. We are walking out for the empty desks in my classes, and the unsaid goodbyes. This epidemic of School shootings must stop.""

In Washington, D.C., a huge crowd of chanting students gathered in front of the White House. Once the clock struck 10 a.m., the students silently sat down with their backs to the White House.

Even though most teenagers can’t vote, “we just want the White House to hear us,” Abby Silverman of Bethesda, Maryland, told ABC News outside the White House.

Kevin Butler told ABC News he came to the White House to “make sure there are stricter gun laws,” and even though the president wasn’t there during the sit-in, Kevin thinks their voices will be heard.

From the White House, the students marched to a rally at Capitol Hill.

At one Evanston, Illinois, school, about 3,000 of the 3,500 students walked out, the school said.

“We should come to school and be protected, not where we have to come to school and fear for our lives,” Evanston student Alexis Harris Dyer told ABC News ""We are all gathered together to show that we care, to show that we have voices. We are young people and we are passionate about what we have to say.”

At the massive walkout was a massive call-in, as students flooded lawmaker's offices all at once with calls for gun reform.

“I’m a high school constituent of [Gov.] Bruce Rauner,"" one teen said on the phone. ""I’m calling to request that you take action to reform our nations gun laws.”

“Often our words are ignored,"" Dyer said, ""So I think this is a way where we can actually be taken seriously.”

Student Emma Stein added, “I hope to inspire the next generation of voters and get young people engaged in the political process and to hold their representatives accountable. ... As long as there’s a threat of mass shootings in schools, I think students will remain very dedicated to the issue.”

At a rally in Denver, high schooler Jlynn Terroade said, ""It's really important for students to exercise their rights and be activists for what they believe in. That's what today was all about.""

""Our Second Amendment seems to seem to care about guns more than students,"" Terroade told ABC News. ""We have to empower ourselves.""

Another Colorado student, Adriana Strode, added, ""You don't want your brother, sister, your daughter to be the next victims of a mass shooting. ... We're here to open people's eyes so they can see this is a big issue.""

Women’s March Youth Coordinator Tabitha St. Bernard Jacobs, one of the few adult allies guiding the students in the youth-led movement, told ABC News before the event that while the walkout was sparked by the Florida school shooting, the event is about pressuring Congress to act against gun violence overall.

She said the walkout was a way to shed light on the kind of gun violence that exists not just in schools but every day, like shootings that affect communities of color or devastate cities like Chicago.

How participants spent those 17 minutes of the walkout was up to them, St. Bernard Jacobs said. Some people were doing a lie-in, while others held rallies, she said.

Thousands of miles away from Parkland, Florida, at a Southern California school, students placed 17 empty desks in the quad, each with a flower and a picture for the 17 shooting victims.

At one Michigan high school, the names of all school-shooting victims were read as students walked out in silence, according to the school.

Students from around the world were also eager to participate.

Students at the Zurich International School in Switzerland took part, gathering outside in the shape of a peace sign. Students snapped this photo via a drone.

""I'm really proud of our two students who organized the event and took the photos,"" Upper School Principal John Switzer said via email.

Izzy Harris, a student at the American School in London, said students at her school, including herself, walked out ""to demonstrate that the U.S. government needs to make changes to their gun laws.""

""Although we are not directly affected in the U.K., a number of us are American and have many connections to the U.S.,"" she told ABC News via video.

While many school districts were supportive of the protests, some schools had threatened to discipline students participating in walkouts.

At the high school on a South Korean base where U.S. military forces are stationed, officials warned students not to walk out, saying policy prohibits protests on U.S. military installations.

""Seoul American High School will maintain a roster of any students who walks out of class and will provide that list to the Yongsan Garrison Command Team to determine if any further steps are warranted,"" Principal Donald Toy Williams Jr. wrote in a memo to parents and sponsors posted on the school's Facebook page today. ""We would also like to note that any student who leaves campus during the walkout time will be dealt with by the military police who will take their name, information, and then escort them back into school control immediately.""

In Plainfield, Illinois, where some students had planned to walk out, doing so came with a guideline.

Students who wanted to participate in the walkout also had to attend an after-school discussion with state legislators to discuss issues that relate to school violence, like the political process, school safety, gun control and what influences politicians, Plainfield School District Superintendent Lane Abrell told ABC News.

A student who walked out but did not attend the discussion with state legislators would get a one-hour detention, Abrell said.

Abrell said the walkout ""in my opinion ... doesn't really solve the issue,"" and the meeting with local legislators is a way for students who genuinely are passionate about the cause to learn how school violence issues can be solved.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said schools could punish students for missing class for walkouts, but the punishment should only be because students missed school and not as a harsher punishment because the students participated in a protest.

Dozens of colleges and universities had said they won't penalize applicants who are peaceful student protesters.

"Facebook Posts 'Substantively Contributed' to Myanmar Genocide, UN Investigators Say",https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x7gmx/facebook-un-genocide-rohingya-myanmar-hate-speech,"United Nations investigators have blamed Facebook for its role in what the agency believes may have been genocide in Myanmar. Investigators with the UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar told reporters on Monday that posts on Facebook “substantively contributed” to the racial tensions in the region.

“Everything is done through Facebook in Myanmar,” investigator Yanghee Lee said at a meeting of the U.N.’s human rights council. “It was used to convey public messages but we know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities. I’m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended.”

Facebook has publicly stated a commitment to cracking down on hate speech, including in Myanmar, and a spokesperson told me the company takes the UN’s criticisms “very seriously.”

“We have invested significantly in technology and local language expertise to help us swiftly remove hate content and people who repeatedly violate our hate speech policies,” a spokesperson told me via email. “We take this incredibly seriously and have worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to develop safety resources and counter-speech campaigns.”"
Researchers discover 13 major security flaws specific to AMD's Zen CPUs,https://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-discover-13-major-security-flaws-specific-to-amds-zen-cpus/,"Update: Are these vulnerabilities real or imagined, and how severe are they really? Following our initial report, some of the claims have been called into question. The flaws may be real, but taking advantage of the flaws in many cases appears to require root/admin access, which typically means a system is already severely compromised.

Original story:

Hot on the heels of Spectre and Meltdown, researchers say they have discovered more than a dozen (or exactly a baker's dozen) new critical security flaws affecting AMD's Ryzen and Epyc processor lines, CNET reports. The vulnerabilities purportedly lie in what is supposed to be a secure part of the processors where sensitive information is contained.

The alleged flaws were discovered by CTS-Labs, a security outfit in Israel. Unlike Google's Project Zero team, which alerted chipmakers months in advance to Spectre and Meltdown before disclosing them to the public, CTS-Labs gave AMD less than 24 hours to look at its findings and respond before publishing the details. AMD is in the process of investigating the matter.

""At AMD, security is a top priority and we are continually working to ensure the safety of our users as new risks arise. We are investigating this report, which we just received, to understand the methodology and merit of the findings,"" an AMD spokesman said.

It's not yet clear how serious these newly discovered flaws are. As presented, the 13 flaws fall into four categories called MasterKey, Ryzenfall, Fallout, and Chimera. Between the four main vulnerabilities, an attacker could supposedly bypass a Ryzen or Epyc CPU's secure boot and install malware into the BIOS, and then onto the processor itself. They could also potentially leverage a pair of manufacturer backdoors to compromise a system's firmware and chipset.

If the vulnerabilities are as widespread and critical as CTS-Labs presents them to be, there are all kinds of implications and potential scenarios. Collectively, the vulnerabilities could open customers up to covert and long-term industrial espionage, sophisticated malware attacks that expose passwords and other personal information, hardware-based ransomware, and more.

The industry at large is still reeling from Spectre and Meltdown. Some of the early patches have caused a few headaches, such as random reboots and performance degradation. It remains to be seen what the fallout might be like for the flaws CTS-Labs claims to have found."

"Denmark charges Turkish informants as spies - A broad ranging investigation by the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) has resulted in trials being opened against three people who informed on Turkish citizens living in Denmark to the Turkish government, Turkish news portal reported.",https://ahvalnews.com/denmark-turkey/denmark-charges-turkish-informants-spies,"A broad ranging investigation by the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) has resulted in trials being opened against three people who informed on Turkish citizens living in Denmark to the Turkish government, Turkish news portal Gazete Duvar reported on Monday.

Turkish citizens living in Denmark who hold political views opposed to the Turkish ruling Justice and Development Party voiced concerns in March 2017 that they were being denounced to the Turkish government for treason. This prompted the Danish government to summon Turkish diplomats and condemn the informants.

A Danish-Turkish politician and activist, Özlem Cekic, was among the citizens who voiced concerns after receiving a Facebook message telling her she had been denounced.

Danish laws forbid gathering information on immigrants or asylum seekers living in the country; sharing this information with foreign countries is also prohibited.

Thus, the presence of informants denouncing Turks in Denmark was treated as a serious issue by PET, which conducted a comprehensive investigation that has led to the trial of three individuals on spying charges."

Trump's protectionist policies shake India's IT industry,http://www.dw.com/en/trumps-protectionist-policies-shake-indias-it-industry/a-42945608,"Raghu Srinivasan has promised to buy his wife the latest model of iPad and his daughter some chocolates when he visits the US next time. But, the mother-daughter duo needs to wait for their gifts little longer because Srinivasan's visa has been rejected more than once.

Located not too distant in the same southern Indian city of Chennai is Abirami Sundar, who recently got married. She wedded her husband hoping to obtain a ""dependent visa"" to travel to the US but her journey to her dreamland is also on hold as her husband did not manage to secure the coveted H1B visa.

These are not isolated cases but stories of hundreds, if not thousands, of Indians, feeling the heat of US President Donald Trump's protectionist policies stemming from ""buy American, hire American"" outlook.

IT workforce in India, world's largest outsourcing hub for the software industry, chiefly relies on the H1B visa program, meant for workers with specialized skillsets, to reach the US. But this has now come under close scrutiny of the Trump administration as a lion's share of H1B visas issued by the US — up to 70 percent — go to Indian nationals.

Entangled H1B program

The process through which individuals acquire H1B visa has been significantly tightened making it more cumbersome and tedious. For example, an IT industry insider told DW that nearly seven out of 10 applications are now being sent through the dreaded request for evidence (RFEs), while in the past nearly 90 percent of the applications were approved straight away.

Though the RFE does not necessarily lead to a rejection in many cases, what it does is to extend the timeframe, create more opportunities for denials and delay the entry to the US.

In late February, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services Agency (USCIS) issued a policy memo cracking down heavily on companies trying to abuse the H1B program. In total, 85,000 H1B visas, valid for three years and extendable for another three, are doled out by the USCIS every year with about 20,000 reserved for advanced degree holders. As the demand is always higher than the allocated numbers, it triggers a lottery system and the next season is set to begin in April this year.

Problems beset India's startup landscape

Srinivasan, a senior consultant professional with an IT services giant, said: ""Clearly, aspirations of going to the US have come down across our company and industry. Now, more organizations openly proclaim they are ready to seek other global talent and destinations if the Trump regime turns harder.""

The senior employee said six of his team members were recently rejected L1 visa — another non-immigrant category with stricter regulations — when they were expecting at least a 50 percent success ratio. ""All of them are fully qualified professionals,"" said Srinivasan.

He added that top-tier companies in India are now rethinking their business models by exploring possibilities of indirect agreements with American companies and investing in near-shore centers. Each company has what is known as ""core-flex ratio"" which is usually about 30-70 percent when it comes to recruiting local talent. And this is likely to take a big blow, added Srinivasan.

IT services and its related business models employ about 10 million workers in India and make one of the country's booming industries since the turn of the century. More than 50 percent of IT exports from India are to the US, making it heavily reliant on Washington for its operations.

Despite the situation and a threat issued by Trump over a looming trade war, the Indian government has repeatedly underscored the importance of Indian talent in American firms and highlighted their contributions toward the US' economy.

Some industry experts are optimistic the clampdown will not impact the Indian companies much but the small firms which often misuse the H1B program will be weeded out.

Skilled migrant mobility

Shivendra Singh, president for global trade development at the Nasscom, an industry body representing Indian IT service companies, told DW: ""We have seen the pressure increasing both from the administration side as well as the legislative side. We have seen many executive orders including the 'Buy American, Hire American' which came way back in March 2017.""

Singh partially blamed the absence of a clear distinction in separating skilled and unskilled migrant mobility for some of the unrewarding anti-immigration policies.

A series of burdensome measures such as ""the proposed changes to the H1B's lottery system, which talks about being granted on wage levels or education or changes to the spouse visa, or third-party placements looking at employer-employee relationships and asking for more documentation is quite negative and increases paperwork,"" underlined Singh.

""This is not to say that our companies don’t follow the right process of law. But this only increases bureaucracy without really making any difference to the value. Think of it that all these come at a time when Indian companies are hiring more than 100,000 local employees and making a substantial investment in the US,"" he added.

""Our only concern, or we can even say request, is that anything which is done should be done keeping in mind that the ease of doing business does not get impacted negatively.""

This cheap 3D-printed home is a start for the 1 billion who lack shelter,https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17101856/3d-printed-housing-icon-shelter-housing-crisis,"Food, water, and shelter are basic human needs, but 1.2 billion people in the world live without adequate housing, according to a report by the World Resources Institute’s Ross Center for Sustainable Cities. Today at SXSW, an Austin-based startup will unveil its approach to combat that deficiency by using low-cost 3D printing as a potential solution.

ICON has developed a method for printing a single-story 650-square-foot house out of cement in only 12 to 24 hours, a fraction of the time it takes for new construction. If all goes according to plan, a community made up of about 100 homes will be constructed for residents in El Salvador next year. The company has partnered with New Story, a nonprofit that is vested in international housing solutions. “We have been building homes for communities in Haiti, El Salvador, and Bolivia,” Alexandria Lafci, co-founder of New Story, tells The Verge.

The first model, scheduled to be unveiled in Austin today, is a step toward providing shelter to those in underserved communities. Jason Ballard, one of ICON’s three founders, says he is going to trial the model as an office to test out their practical use. “We are going to install air quality monitors. How does it look, and how does it smell?” Ballard also runs Treehouse, a company that focuses on sustainable home upgrades.

Using the Vulcan printer, ICON can print an entire home for $10,000 and plans to bring costs down to $4,000 per house. “It’s much cheaper than the typical American home,” Ballard says. It’s capable of printing a home that’s 800 square feet, a significantly bigger structure than properties pushed by the tiny home movement, which top out at about 400 square feet. In contrast, the average New York apartment is about 866 square feet.

The model has a living room, bedroom, bathroom, and a curved porch. “There are a few other companies that have printed homes and structures,” Ballard says. “But they are printed in a warehouse, or they look like Yoda huts. For this venture to succeed, they have to be the best houses.” The use of cement as a common material will help normalize the process for potential tenants that question the sturdiness of the structure. “I think if we were printing in plastic we would encounter some issues.”

Once ICON completes material testing and tweaking of the design, the company will move the Vulcan printer to El Salvador to begin construction. ICON says its 3D-printed houses will create minimal waste and labor costs are significantly reduced. The company also intends to build homes in the US eventually. It’s a compelling solution to solving housing shortages but one that could be contentious among labor unions that represent workers.

It’s almost cliché that tech innovations happen in the high-end, for-profit segment long before they filter down to the masses, where innovation could serve the greatest social good. ICON and New Story are challenging that premise. Lafci uses the example of latency in cellphone availability to reach the African continent as the reason she believes in the endeavor. “(ICON) believes, as do I, that 3D printing is going to be a method for all kinds of housing,” she says.

But the company is already looking past the global housing crises to think about communities that will one day live off-planet. “One of the big challenges is how are we going to create habitats in space,” Ballard says. “You’re not going to open a two by four and open screws. It’s one of the more promising potential habitat technologies.”"

Saudi expulsion of thousands of Yemeni workers fuels Civil war,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-civil-war-saudi-arabia-houthi-yemeni-workers-expel-deport-fighters-recruitment-al-qaeda-a8248506.html,"“Welcome home to the labourers returning from Saudi Arabia. You still have a job: defending the nation on our military bases.”

So declared Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthi rebels’ de facto government, in a recent al Thawra newspaper article published in Sanaa.

It barely seems possible, but Yemen – a country that has come apart at the seams since the outbreak of civil war three years ago – is facing a new crisis.

Devastation on the ground in Yemen displayed by International Rescue Committee in shocking video

As a result of reforms to Saudi labour laws designed to tackle the country’s high levels of unemployment, hundreds of thousands of illegal migrant workers have been deported from the Kingdom since November last year.

Saudi Arabia’s economic overhaul is desperately needed, but could be having a dangerous unforeseen effect.

Forced back to a country in the grip of a humanitarian crisis and with no economic prospects, it is feared thousands of deported Yemenis could be picking up guns to join the Houthis or al-Qaeda, who see the influx of jobless young men as a prime recruitment opportunity.

Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who is spearheading the Vision 2030 reforms designed to modernise the country and wean it off its reliance on oil, has previously described the jobs of foreign workers as “reserves” he could give to Saudi nationals “at any time of my choosing”.

According to statistics from the Saudi interior ministry, 65 per cent of those deported recently are Yemeni – which means a total of 100,000 have already been sent home, and 130,000 more await a similar fate.

Accurate figures are impossible to come by, but estimates given by several sources for this story were usually that around 10 per cent of the 100,000 returnees so far could have joined a fighting force.

One million Yemenis are currently thought to live in Saudi Arabia and remittances sent home by workers abroad are a lifeline for their families. Three-quarters of the 22 million-strong population has become reliant on aid to survive since the conflict began and eight million people now live on the brink of famine in the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.

That money drying up “could destroy Yemen”, said Farea al-Muslimi, a Yemeni non-resident fellow at London’s Chatham House. “It will be worse than the war.”

In a country where GDP reached a record low of £515 in 2016 and has only decreased since, the prospect of steady wages has already led thousands of men with little desire or understanding of the reasons for the violence to join a fighting side.

“The declaration from Mohammed Ali al-Houthi was really scary,” said Faizah al-Sulimani, who left Yemen for Saudi Arabia in 2015 and works on aid projects remotely.

“We haven’t had salaries paid in Yemen for two years. It’s already caused a crisis where people feel like they have no choice but to fight to put bread on the table,” she said.

“I personally know five young men who were students in other countries and got deported and joined the Houthis and other militias like the Southern Transitional Council. It’s very frustrating.”

Houthi fighters are paid $100 (£72) a month to defend the front lines against a coalition of Yemeni soldiers, tribal forces local to the exiled Yemeni government and Saudi and UAE troops. Al-Qaeda and Isis’s Yemeni branches offer similar remuneration.

A 20-year-old injured Houthi prisoner of war The Independent met in government-loyal Marib province last year said he thought when he signed up he’d be fighting Americans and Israelis.

“They said I’d be protecting Yemenis, not fighting them. They said the Americans were coming and they were going to try and change things,” he said, wincing through the pain of his bandaged arm and leg.

A prominent Yemeni businessman resident in Saudi Arabia said that over the last two years he has been forced to let 4,000 Yemeni construction workers go thanks to the economic squeeze facing the Kingdom and changes to the permit system making it harder to retain foreign workers.

He was troubled by his decision to fire compatriots, knowing that their prospects were bleak: due to the conflict Yemenis should arguably be able to claim asylum as refugees, but Saudi Arabia is not a signatory of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.

Conversations with departing employees did not improve matters, he told The Independent in a recent interview in the Red Sea city of Jeddah.

“Migrant workers here are deeply suspicious of the Saudis. They live in the broken kafala [employment sponsorship] system, they are treated like they are second-class.

“Poorly educated people also widely believe the Saudis are secretly in line with the US and Israel and the Trump administration is not helping that image either. After living here for a while they start to think the Houthis have a point.”

The move to deport workers without valid papers and hike the cost of residency permits for those who remain has precedent: in 2013 a similar crackdown on foreign labourers led to an exodus of 655,000 people back to Yemen.

Jeremy Corbyn accuses UK of 'directing' war in Yemen

The decision is widely believed to have exacerbated the already fragile Yemeni economy’s woes and impacted the failed attempts at a national dialogue to stabilise the country after President Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down during the Arab Spring.

Most analysts agree that another Saudi purge of one million Yemeni workers in 1990, motivated by the Sanaa government’s support for Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait, also helped cause economic chaos that was a contributing factor to Yemen’s last civil war in 1994.

Riyadh has been repeatedly condemned by humanitarian groups over its involvement in Yemen’s current conflict.

The Saudi-led military coalition of Arab countries propping up the exiled Yemeni government against the Iranian-backed Houthis in control of the capital is accused of failing to take adequate precautions to avoid unnecessary loss of civilian life in bombing campaigns.

Much of the devastation has been caused by arms sold to Saudi Arabia by allies such as the UK and US – a move that officials within Barack Obama’s administration worried could amount to complicity in war crimes.

The official UN death toll in the conflict so far is 10,000. It is widely acknowledged, however, that malnutrition and the world’s worst cholera epidemic caused by the Saudi blockades of Houthi air and seaports have probably claimed many more lives.

He received a warm welcome from the British Government: it emerged on Friday, the last day of the prince’s three-day visit, that the Kingdom had signed a preliminary deal to buy 48 new Typhoon fighter jets from the UK’s BAE Systems for an estimated £8.4bn.

“On the one hand they are over here striking military deals as well as announcing new development and humanitarian efforts. On the other, they are condemning Yemenis to death with these new measures at a very critical time for the Yemeni population,” said Sherine El Taraboulsi-McCarthy, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute.

“Kicking Yemenis out shows how all the aid and reform promises are just a image-polishing exercise so they can carry on as normal on the ground.”"

In a world-first, an ESA-led team has built and fired an electric thruster to ingest scarce air molecules from the top of the atmosphere for propellant, opening the way to satellites flying in very low orbits for years on end.

ESA’s GOCE gravity-mapper flew as low as 250 km for more than four years thanks to an electric thruster that continuously compensated for air drag. However, its working life was limited by the 40 kg of xenon it carried as propellant – once that was exhausted, the mission was over. Replacing onboard propellant with atmospheric molecules would create a new class of satellites able to operate in very low orbits for long periods.

Air-breathing space mission Air-breathing electric thrusters could also be used at the outer fringes of atmospheres of other planets, drawing on the carbon dioxide of Mars, for instance. “This project began with a novel design to scoop up air molecules as propellant from the top of Earth’s atmosphere at around 200 km altitude with a typical speed of 7.8 km/s,” explains ESA’s Louis Walpot.

Test set-up A complete thruster was developed for testing the concept by Sitael in Italy, which was performed in a vacuum chamber in their test facilities, simulating the environment at 200 km altitude. A ‘particle flow generator’ provided the oncoming high-speed molecules for collection by the Ram-Electric Propulsion novel intake and thruster. There are no valves or complex parts – everything works on a simple, passive basis. All that is needed is power to the coils and electrodes, creating an extremely robust drag-compensation system.

Air-breathing electric propulsion The challenge was to design a new type of intake to collect the air molecules so that instead of simply bouncing away they are collected and compressed. The molecules collected by the intake designed by QuinteScience in Poland are given electric charges so that they can be accelerated and ejected to provide thrust.

Thruster inside vacuum chamber Sitael designed a dual-stage thruster to ensure better charging and acceleration of the incoming air, which is harder to achieve than in traditional electric propulsion designs. “The team ran computer simulations on particle behaviour to model all the different intake options,” adds Louis, “but it all came down to this practical test to know if the combined intake and thruster would work together or not. “Instead of simply measuring the resulting density at the collector to check the intake design, we decided to attach an electric thruster. In this way, we proved that we could indeed collect and compress the air molecules to a level where thruster ignition could take place, and measure the actual thrust.

Thruster with xenon propellant “At first we checked our thruster could be ignited repeatedly with xenon gathered from the particle beam generator.” As a next step, Louis explains, the xenon was partially replaced by a nitrogen–oxygen air mixture: “When the xenon-based blue colour of the engine plume changed to purple, we knew we’d succeeded. “The system was finally ignited repeatedly solely with atmospheric propellant to prove the concept’s feasibility.

Thruster with air “This result means air-breathing electric propulsion is no longer simply a theory but a tangible, working concept, ready to be developed, to serve one day as the basis of a new class of missions.” This project was backed through ESA’s Technology Research Programme for developing promising new ideas for space, with the support of the Agency's Earth Observation Programme."
"Burning coal may have caused Earth's worst mass extinction. New geological research suggests the end-Permian extinction, coined ?the Great Dying,? - over 90% of marine and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct, was mainly caused by burning coal, ignited by magma.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/12/burning-coal-may-have-caused-earths-worst-mass-extinction,"Earth has so far gone through five mass extinction events – scientists are worried we’re on course to trigger a sixth – and the deadliest one happened 252 million years ago at the end of the Permian geologic period. In this event, coined “the Great Dying,” over 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct. It took about 10 million years for life on Earth to recover from this catastrophic event.



Scientists have proposed a number of possible culprits responsible for this mass extinction, including an asteroid impact, mercury poisoning, a collapse of the ozone layer, and acid rain. Heavy volcanic activity in Siberia was suspected to play a key role in the end-Permian event.

Recently, geologist Dr Benjamin Burger identified a rock layer in Utah that he believed might have formed during the Permian and subsequent Triassic period that could shed light on the cause of the Great Dying.

During the Permian, Earth’s continents were still combined as one Pangea, and modern day Utah was on the supercontinent’s west coast. Samples from the end-Permian have been collected from rock layers in Asia, near the volcanic eruptions, but Utah was on the other side of Pangaea. Burger’s samples could thus provide a unique perspective of what was happening on the other side of the world from the eruptions. Burger collected and analyzed samples from the rock layer, and documented the whole process in a fascinating video:

Dr Burger’s ‘Rocks of Utah’ episode documenting his investigation of the Permian-Triassic Boundary geologic samples.

Earth turned into a toxic hellscape

Burger’s samples painted a grim picture of Earth’s environment at the end of the Permian period. A sharp drop in calcium carbonate levels indicated that the oceans had become acidic. A similar decline in organic content matched up with the immense loss of life in the oceans during this period. The presence of pyrite pointed to an anoxic ocean (without oxygen), meaning the oceans were effectively one massive dead zone.

Bacteria ate the oversupply of dead bodies, producing hydrogen sulfide gas, creating a toxic atmosphere. The hydrogen sulfide oxidized in the atmosphere to form sulfur dioxide, creating acid rain, which killed much of the plant life on Earth. Elevated barium levels in the samples had likely been carried up from the ocean depths by a massive release of methane.

The culprit: burning coal

Levels of various metals in the rock samples were critical in identifying the culprit of this mass extinction event. As in end-Permian samples collected from other locations around the world, Burger didn’t find the kinds of rare metals that are associated with asteroid impacts. There simply isn’t evidence that an asteroid struck at the right time to cause the Great Dying.

However, Burger did find high levels of mercury and lead in his samples, coinciding with the end of the Permian period. Mercury has also been identified in end-Permian samples from other sites. Lead and mercury aren’t associated with volcanic ash, but they are a byproduct of burning coal. Burger also identified a shift from heavier carbon-13 to lighter carbon-12; the latter results from burning fossil fuels.

The Permian was the end of the Carboniferous period, which means “coal-bearing.” Many large coal deposits were created in the Carboniferous, including in Asia. Previous research has shown that the Permian mass extinction event didn’t coincide with the start of the Siberian volcanic eruptions and lava flows, but rather 300,000 years later. That’s when the lava began to inject as sheets of magma underground, where Burger’s data suggests it ignited coal deposits.

The coal ignition triggered the series of events that led to Earth’s worst mass extinction. Its sulfur emissions created the acid rain that killed forests. Its carbon emissions acidified the oceans and warmed the planet, killing most marine life. The dead bodies fed bacteria that produced toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which in turn killed off more species. The warming of the oceans produced a large methane release, which accelerated global warming faster yet. As Burger put it,

Things went from bad to worse, and you can now begin to understand how life nearly died out. Global warming, acid oceans, anoxia, not to mention a toxic atmosphere. We are lucky to be alive at all!

Eerie similarities to today

Scientists are observing many of the same signs of dangerously rapid climate change today. There’s more lighter carbon-12 in the atmosphere because the increase in atmospheric carbon levels is due entirely to humans burning fossil fuels. There are an increasing number of dead zones in the oceans. Burning coal was causing acid rain, although we largely solved that problem through Clean Air Acts, and in the US, a sulfur dioxide cap and trade system implemented by a Republican administration.

We’ve had less success in tackling carbon dioxide pollution, which continues to rise. As a result, the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic, and temperatures increasingly hot. Scientists today also worry about potentially large releases of methane from the ocean floor and Arctic.

These are some of the similarities between the climate change that nearly wiped out life on Earth 252 million years ago and the climate change today. Both appear to have largely been caused by burning coal. A 2011 study found that over the past 500 years, species are now going extinct at least as fast as they did during the five previous mass extinction events.

It’s enough to make you think; maybe coal isn’t so beautiful and clean after all."

"Found in South Philadelphia, an Underground Railroad station",https://whyy.org/segments/found-south-philadelphia-underground-railroad-station/,"From the outside, 625 South Delhi Street looks like an average Philadelphia rowhouse.

But in the 1850s, it was home to Underground Railroad leaders William and Letitia Still. Within the house’s narrow confines, they hid hundreds of escapees and gave well-known figures like Harriet Tubman shelter.

Looking at this almost 180-year-old rowhouse just off South Street, preservation activist Oscar Beisert says that its stoop appears to be the original marble from the 19th century.

“We don’t even have basic African-American landmarks protected in Philadelphia…[so] finding that stoop where she [Tubman] potentially arrived with people from Maryland, that’s what I think is really incredible about what we have here,” said Beisert.

On Friday, Beisert and preservationist James Duffin successfully argued that the house deserves a place on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. The designation — unanimously supported by the Philadelphia Historical Commission — means that the structure can’t be demolished or significantly altered unless the commission grants an exemption to the property owner.

The house is owned by an entity called F&J Homes LLC, which acquired it last year. They did not contest the nomination.

The campaign to protect the house featured an unusual amount of backing from experts outside of Philadelphia, including Columbia University Professor of History Eric Foner and Lonnie G. Bunch III, the director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History.

“In the current cultural moment, Americans are reassessing which historical figures and events are worthy of public remembrance and commemoration,” wrote Bunch in a letter supporting Duffin and Beisert. “In this context, the extraordinary movements in which Still was engaged are becoming increasingly visible and essential elements of a renewed national story.”

The story that the advocates use to bolster their case focuses on William Still, who moved to Philadelphia in 1844 and later began working for the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society.

As the chairman of the organization’s Vigilance Committee, he orchestrated Underground Railroad activities in Philadelphia and across the country. One historian described him as “second only to Harriet Tubman in Underground Railroad operations.” Between 1850 and 1855, in the wake of the Fugitive Slave Act — which required that Northern states assist in capturing escaped slaves — Still and his wife Letitia sheltered hundreds of escapees in their home.

In one case cited in the preservationists’ brief, Still rescued a woman and her two sons from enslavement within sight of the white Southerner claiming ownership. The encounter happened as the party was about to cross from Philadelphia to Camden on the ferry. African-American dock workers barred the white Southerner from making contact with the family while Still and an accomplice spirited them back into the city. The case made national news when Still and his allies were arrested. The story was eventually novelized as The Price of a Child.

In a rendering contained in the brief, Still is shown lifting the lid of a three-foot-long, two-and-a-half foot deep, and two-foot-wide box. The box held a man: Henry “Box” Brown, who mailed himself from Richmond, Virginia, to Philadelphia to escape slavery.

“Some images have Frederick Douglass lifting the lid of the box,” said Duffin. “But that’s just because everyone knew who he was. Douglass actually wasn’t in Philadelphia at that time. It was Still.”

Still is also renowned for writing one of the only firsthand African-American penned accounts of the movement, titled simply, The Underground Railroad. It is 800 pages long and includes dozens of individual tales of escape. (“It was, in essence, the first African-American encyclopedia,” writes Joe Lockard, professor of English at Arizona State University and founder of the Anti-Slavery Literature Project.)

Many prominent historians like Foner and Lockard wrote letters to the Historical Commission in support of the nomination. They uniformly praised the advocates’ scholarship, noting that many properties supposedly connected to the railroad do not hold up to scrutiny. But they found Duffin’s scholarship impeccable.

Duffin discovered the house by poring over city records, cross-referencing the address with maps, and advertisements for Letitia’s business in abolitionist newspapers from the 1850s.

Many of the historians emphasized the house’s importance in the context of the national debate about Confederate monuments, and which aspects of United States history to commemorate.

Foner, for one, said he wants to see more symbols of emancipation and black history elevated rather than simply having the Confederate statues torn down.

“Personally, I prefer to add new historic sites to make the representation of history more accurately reflect our diverse past and present,” writes Foner, author of Gateway to Freedom, “and to honor those who fought against slavery as well as those who went to war to defend it. Thus, designating the Still home as a historic property would be a statement… about what in our past we choose to honor and why.”"
Tim Berners-Lee: we must regulate tech firms to prevent 'weaponised' web - The inventor of the world wide web warns over concentration of power among a few companies 'controlling which ideas are shared',https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-tech-companies-regulations,"Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, has called for large technology firms to be regulated to prevent the web from being “weaponised at scale”.

Berners-Lee, in an open letter to mark the 29th anniversary of his invention, said: “In recent years, we’ve seen conspiracy theories trend on social media platforms, fake Twitter and Facebook accounts stoke social tensions, external actors interfere in elections, and criminals steal troves of personal data.”

These problems have proliferated because of the concentration of power in the hands of a few platforms – including Facebook, Google, and Twitter – which “control which ideas and opinions are seen and shared”.

“What was once a rich selection of blogs and websites has been compressed under the powerful weight of a few dominant platforms,” said the 62-year-old British computer scientist.

These online gatekeepers can lock in their power by acquiring smaller rivals, buying up new innovations and hiring the industry’s top talent, making it harder for others to compete, he said.

Google now accounts for about 87% of online searches worldwide. Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly active users – more than 20 times more than MySpace at its peak. Together, the two companies (including their subsidiaries Instagram and YouTube) slurp up more than 60% of digital advertising spend worldwide.

Although the companies are aware of the problems and have made efforts to fix them – developing systems to tackle fake news, bots and influence operations – they have been built to “maximise profit more than maximise social good”.

“A legal or regulatory framework that accounts for social objectives may help ease those tensions,” he said.

Aligning the incentives of the technology sector with those of users and society at large, he argued, will require consulting a diverse group of people from business, government, civil society, academia and the arts.

Berners-Lee warned of “two myths” that “limit our collective imagination” when looking for solutions to the problems facing the web: “The myth that advertising is the only possible business model for online companies, and the myth that it’s too late to change the way platforms operate. On both points we need to be a little more creative,” he said.

“I want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfil our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions,” he said.

The open letter coincides with a significant milestone: 2018 is the first year that more than half of the world’s population will be online.

This still leaves a gaping “digital divide” that exacerbates existing inequalities: you are more likely to be offline if you are female, poor, or live in a rural area or a low-income country.

“To be offline today is to be excluded from opportunities to learn and earn, to access valuable services, and to participate in democratic debate,” Berners-Lee said. “If we do not invest seriously in closing this gap, the last billion will not be connected until 2042. That’s an entire generation left behind.”

Two years ago, the UN declared internet access to be a basic human right on par with clean water, shelter, food and electricity. However, in many places, getting online is prohibitively expensive – the cost of 1GB of mobile broadband in Malawi is more than 20% of the average monthly income. In Zimbabwe, it is nearly 45%.

The open letter comes a year after Berners-Lee called for tighter regulation of online political advertising, which he said was being used in “unethical ways”.

Since then, representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google have been hauled in front of Congress to answer questions over the extent to which their platforms were used in a multi-pronged Russian operation to influence the 2016 presidential election.

All three admitted that Russian entities bought ads on their sites in an attempt to skew the vote. Russians posed as Americans to buy ads on Facebook pushing divisive messages focusing on swing states. They also spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads to spread disinformation across YouTube and Google. On Twitter, swarms of bots helped promote fake news stories.

All three companies have since announced measures to improve transparency over who is buying political ads on their platforms and what messages they are promoting.

Berners-Lee has always maintained that his creation was a reflection of humanity – the good, the bad and the ugly. However, his vision to create an “open platform that allows anyone to share information, access opportunities and collaborate across geographical boundaries” has been challenged as the web has become more centralised.

“I’m still an optimist, but an optimist standing at the top of the hill with a nasty storm blowing in my face, hanging on to a fence,” he told the Guardian in November. “We have to grit our teeth and hang on to the fence and not take it for granted that the web will lead us to wonderful things.”"
Exercise Is The Best Anti-Aging Therapy,http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/exercise-is-the-best-anti-aging-therapy-1.4569842,"A new study in England on older cyclists found that a lifetime of regular exercise gave them the physique of much younger people, providing evidence that physical activity can beat a medicine cabinet full of anti-aging products.

The multi-billion dollar anti-aging industry provides a cornucopia of products that promise to fight off the ravages of time with special food supplements, diets, creams, oxygenated water and a host of gadgets that supposedly remove toxins from the body. It makes it sound like all we need to do is pop a pill and our lives will be extended.

And when our bodies do begin to slow down and diseases creep in, another huge industry of pharmaceuticals and therapies take over to fight it off. Our aging society is spending a lot of money trying to fight off old age. But the cheapest and oldest therapy for an aging body is good old exercise. Sadly it's the one prescription many people are not taking.

The British study looked at 125 amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79, with 41 of them being female. These were serious cyclists who participate in non-competitive long distance events, and who could ride at least 100 km in under 6.5 hours, for the men, and 60 km in under 5.5 hours for women. This is well above the daily exercise recommended for the average person, but the scientists wanted to see how far the effects of high levels of exercise can reach into old age.

The cyclists were compared to a group of adults in the same age range who did not exercise regularly, as well as young adults aged 20 to 36. Smokers and heavy drinkers were not included.

A new study of older cyclists shows that intense exercise into senior years, can provide anti-aging benefits. (Bertrand Savard/CBC) In laboratory tests, the active seniors were found to have retained muscle mass, and had lower cholesterol levels, which is to be expected. Surprisingly, some parts of their immune systems were as robust as those of the younger people. In normal aging, the body's production of T-cells, which are the immune system's soldiers who patrol through the blood and fight off invaders, can slow down. That didn't happen in these active seniors. Of course a healthy immune system provides better protection against disease. The men in the group also showed a robust levels of testosterone, which also tends to decline with age.

This experiment was unusual, in that it looked at the positive effects of exercise on healthy individuals, rather than more common studies that look at the ill effects of sedentary life. And it underlined the benefits to older folks in fighting off some of the particular declines of old age. But really, it's just one more sign that exercise is a powerful path to better health.

The health benefits of regular exercise for the general population are well known.

With the recommended 150 minutes of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week, you can control weight, improve sleep, lighten your mood, boost your energy level and even improve your sex life. You'll also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and even some forms of cancer.

According to the Statistics Canada, only about one in five Canadian adults reaches that 150 minute recommended target, and the stats are much worse for older age groups than younger. The World Health Organization says inactivity a major cause of premature deaths. In fact, if you look at the instructions on many health products, there is often the phrase, ""when combined with regular exercise...""

That weekly exercise does not necessarily mean you need to join a gym or sign up for a marathon. It can be easily incorporated into everyday life by giving up elevators and escalators in favour of stairs. Choose your feet over wheels as much as possible and when you do walk, make it brisk rather than just ambling along. The benefits of getting off your butt are clear, and best of all, the cost can be mostly free.

Of course, here I am writing this blog sitting at a computer.

Looks like a nice day for a bike ride…"
"Drug-resistant HIV strain discovered in Philippines could trigger new epidemic, scientists warn",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hiv-drug-resistant-strain-philippines-asia-cure-treatment-infection-rate-rising-a8249621.html,"A strain of the HIV virus which has become predominant in the Philippines has the potential to spark a new epidemic, scientists have warned.

HIV prevalence among Filipinos has risen sharply in the past decade, at a time when infection rates across the world are beginning to decline.

The United Nations estimates the number of new cases identified in the Philippines each year has risen by 140 per cent since 2010.

Researchers are concerned that HIV subtype AE is proving harder to combat than versions of the virus more commonly seen elsewhere.

The strain is more aggressive, can be more resistant to antiretroviral drugs and progresses to Aids faster than the HIV subtype B generally found in western countries.

“The HIV virus has the potential to transform itself into a new and different virus each time it affects a cell,” Dr Edsel Salvana, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of the Philippines told DW.

“There are nearly 100 different subtypes of HIV, with new subtypes being discovered every day.

“Most HIV infections in the Western world are of subtype B. Most of the research that we have on HIV is also on subtype B, though it accounts for only about 12 per cent of all global HIV infections.

“We have discovered that the explosion of HIV in the Philippines is due to a shift from the Western subtype B to a more aggressive HIV subtype AE.”

Dr Salvana added: “Those infected by the HIV subtype AE are younger, sicker patients who are more resistant to antiretroviral drugs. We are also seeing a faster progression to Aids under subtype AE.”

Around 5,000 people in the Philippines were living with HIV in 2006, compared to around 56,000 in 2016, according to UN figures.

The number of new cases being diagnosed has also spiked in recent years, with some 10,000 new cases identified in 2016 alone, giving the country the fastest-growing HIV rate in the Asia-Pacific region.

Dr Salvana warned work done in recent decades to combat the HIV virus risked being undone if more research was not conducted into the new strain.

“HIV is not done yet. We cannot think of HIV as a single virus but as a collection of viruses that are evolving, with a new mutation that can possibly set off a new epidemic.

“The gains that we have made in decreasing HIV infection rates will be short-lived without research and treatment for HIV subtype AE,” he added.

“This is urgently needed. Specifically for the Philippines, we need more scientists willing to do research work on HIV.”

The World Health Organisation has concluded that ""insufficient access to prevention and treatment are the main drivers of the HIV epidemic in the Philippines"", rather than the predominance of the AE strain.

UNAIDS, the United Nations' programme on HIV and Aids, released a statement to reassure the public that there is ""no new strain of HIV"" in the Philippines.

""The variants of the virus found in the Philippines have not changed and are similar to the strains of the virus found in many parts of Asia and in other parts of the world.

""In addition, there is no conclusive evidence that the strains of the virus found in the country are more infectious than other virus variants, nor is there evidence that they are resistant to the current treatment regimens available."""
Around 100 military personnel deployed to Salisbury to aide Russian spy poison investigation,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/russian-spy-latest-updates-military-salisbury-nerve-agent-sergei-skripal-poisoning-porton-down-a8247191.html,"Specialist chemical and biological warfare units from the military are investigating the graves of Sergei Skripal’s wife and son after being deployed to Salisbury.

The investigation into the nerve agent attack on the former Russian double agent and his daughter Yulia intensified as up to 200 military personnel from the Army, Royal Marines and RAF moved in.

Counter-terror police, who are leading the probe, said they requested help to remove “a number of vehicles and objects from the scene in Salisbury town centre as they have the necessary capability and expertise”.

Targets included Mr Skripal’s car, an ambulance, air-ambulance helicopter and police vehicle, which were covered by people wearing protective gear and driven away on military lorries.

Officers wearing hazmat suits were seen placing a blue forensic tent over a memorial stone for the former spy’s son, Alexander, and nearby grave of his wife Liudmila.

They were both thought to have died of natural illnesses but the cause of their deaths – in 2017 and 2012 respectively – have come under renewed focus following the brazen attempt on Mr Skripal’s life.

Witnesses said investigators placed items from the graves in yellow barrels for hazardous materials, while taking others away in blue bags, potentially for further tests.

The potential lethality of the nerve agent used against the Skripals is so severe that decontamination operations are taking longer than initially expected and may go on into next week.

Those deployed include personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre and bomb disposal experts from the 29 Ordnance Group, as well as the Falcon Squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment, who use mobile laboratories for tests and decontamination.

Specialist operations continued as Mr Skripal and his daughter remained in a “very serious” condition in intensive care, while a police officer also exposed to the nerve agent is conscious and talking from his hospital bed.

Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey was among the first officers sent to the bench where the pair were found unconscious on Sunday afternoon, and then onwards to Mr Skripal’s suburban home.

Samples from the victims have already been tested by experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, a secretive military facility where nerve agents have been developed and tested over decades of controversial research.

Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, said Friday’s intervention built on the “vital expertise and information already provided” by military scientists.

“We have the right people with the right skills to assist with this crucial inquiry,” he added.

As the race to find out how Mr Skripal and his daughter were poisoned – and who by – the Home Secretary visited the scene where they were found on Friday morning and met DS Bailey in hospital.

“I understand people wanting to have answers [about the nerve agent and culprit], and there will be a time to have those answers”, Amber Rudd said.

“But the best way to get to them is to give the police the space they need to really go through the area carefully, to do their investigation and to make sure that they have all the support that they need.”

Ms Rudd is to chair an emergency meeting of the Government’s Cobra committee at 3pm on Saturday to receive updates on the police case, Downing Street said.

Officials have described the nerve agent used, which affected a total of 21 people, as “very rare” but investigators have not named the precise chemical used.

They are looking at the possibility that Mr Skripal was targeted at his home, where sources told The Independent a package containing the nerve agent may have been delivered and opened in the presence of his daughter.

Lord Blair, who was the Metropolitan Police Commissioner when Alexander Litvinenko was assassinated, said it was significant that DS Bailey had visited the property.

Mr Litvinenko, another former Russian spy who was an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin, was poisoned with polonium-210 ingested via a cup of tea at a London hotel.

Lord Blair said the radioactive trail was “dangerous but pretty clear”, letting investigators trace the Russian agents who allegedly administered the substance to the plane they boarded back to Moscow.

“That was a reasonably fast activity, whereas this is going to be slower because they need, first of all, to find out how this was delivered,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

“I’d hope [there is a trail in Salisbury] – clearly what they are trying to find out at the moment is how the nerve agent was delivered and there obviously are some indications.

“The officer, and I’m very sorry that he has been injured, has actually been to the house, whereas there was a doctor who looked after the patients in the open who hasn’t been affected at all.

“So there may be some clues floating around in here.”

Forensic tests have also been carried out at a branch of the Zizzi restaurant chain and The Mill pub in Salisbury, where witnesses say Mr Skripal began to behave in an agitated manner following lunch with his daughter.

They arrived in Salisbury for lunch at around 1.30pm on Sunday and were found unconscious on a bench at around 4.15pm – under three hours later.

A witness who saw the pair in The Mill said Mr Skripal was behaving “erratically” and shouting loudly at one point – behaviour that could be linked to the onset of his symptoms.

The pair were caught on CCTV walking down an alley near where they fell unconscious on a bench at 4.08pm on Sunday, minutes before emergency services were called.

Freya Church, a 27-year-old local resident who saw them on the bench, said: “She [Ms Skripal] was leaning on him, slumped. She looked passed out and he was looking up, doing these hand movements. His eyes were glazed.”

A passing doctor described Ms Skripal “vomiting and fitting” after losing control of her bodily functions.

The woman moved the 33-year-old into the recovery position and opened her airway, as others tended to her father.

All the symptoms are consistent with nerve agents, which vary in strength according to type, concentration and how they are administered.

Security officials say the specific chemical used would have been difficult to obtain and could only have come from a state run or state-licensed laboratory.

Chemical weapons experts told The Independent the nerve agent could have been administered in a variety of ways, including in food or drink, or in the form of a spray or liquid.

Dr Patricia Lewis, research director for International Security at Chatham House, said nerve agents act extremely rapidly if inhaled – possibly killing people within minutes – and more slowly if absorbed through the skin.

“You can impregnate them in liquid form into clothing and fabrics,” she told The Independent.

“It looks like they were both exposed at exactly the same time, otherwise one of them would have been more alert and able to call the emergency services.”

Suspicion has turned to the Russian government, which jailed Mr Skripal for “treason” in 2006, or former spies he betrayed while working for MI6 during his time as a colonel in the GRU military intelligence service.

Security officials say that 66-year-old Mr Skripal was no longer an active MI6 asset, but he may have become a target by attempting to “freelance” for private intelligence companies run by former spies.

Ministers have declined to say who is believed to be responsible in the wake of high-level Cobra and National Security Council meetings, but threatened further sanctions against Russia if state involvement is found.

The Russian government has vehemently denied involvement in the attack with foreign minister Sergey Lavrov saying: “We haven’t heard a single fact, we only watch reportages on TV where our colleagues [British politicians] say with pathos, with serious faces, that if this was done by Russia then the response will be such that Russia will remember forever."
"UN moves towards recognising human right to a healthy environment: Formal recognition would help protect those who increasingly risk their lives to defend the land, water, forests and wildlife, says the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/09/un-moves-towards-recognising-human-right-to-a-healthy-environment,"Formal recognition would help protect those who increasingly risk their lives to defend the land, water, forests and wildlife, says the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment

It is time for the United Nations to formally recognise the right to a healthy environment, according to the world body’s chief investigator of murders, beatings and intimidation of environmental defenders.

John Knox, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, said the momentum for such a move – which would significantly raise the global prominence of the issue – was growing along with an awareness of the heavy toll being paid by those fighting against deforestation, pollution, land grabs and poaching.



His appeal, the culmination of more than five years of investigations, comes amid a major push for the UN and member states to do more to protect those who defend the land, water, air, forests and wildlife.



The defenders: recording the deaths of environmental defenders around the world Read more

“If we can’t protect them, then how can we protect the environment we all depend on,” Knox told the Guardian in Geneva, where he has just submitted a final report to the UN human rights council.

For better and for worse, the issue of environmental rights has risen rapidly up the political agenda since Knox took his post. The number of murders of land and environmental defenders tracked by the monitoring group Global Witness increased to 197 last year, compared with 147 in in 2012.

But there is also increasing resistance from civil society, exposure in the media and support from the UN and some governments. Earlier this week, 24 Latin American and Caribbean nations signed a groundbreaking pact on environmental rights that – once ratified – will oblige governments to investigate and punish those accused of killings, many of whom currently evade justice due to impunity.

Even in Honduras – one of the worst offending nations – police have finally arrested the most senior suspect yet in the killing of the anti-dam and indigenous rights campaigner Berta Cáceres. Many activists believe this arrest would never have happened if not for the global outcry that followed that 2016 murder. More powerful suspects in the government, however, continue to evade justice.



On Tuesday, UN Environment launched an environmental rights initiative to scale up training of judges, prosecutors and police in environmental law and to work with companies to include human rights in investment planning.

Environmental protection and human rights were long considered separate issues, but they have been increasingly intermeshed, particularly over the past decade. More than 100 countries have laws that acknowledge the link, but dozens of countries – and the UN itself – have yet to formally recognise environmental rights.

How this might be done and what the effect would be remain to be seen. Knox suggested a UN resolution. Although this would not solve the problem by itself, it would increase pressure on governments to enact laws and policies to support, rather than criminalise, environmental defenders.

He proposes 14 “framework principles”, the first two of which interlock human wellbeing and ecological wellbeing:

States should ensure a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment in order to respect, protect and fulfil human rights States should respect, protect and fulfil human rights in order to ensure a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment

Patrick Alley, co-founder of NGO Global Witness, welcomed the UN’s growing commitment to activists, community leaders, rangers and others who are defending the land and environment.

“This issue has moved far higher up the political food chain than before,” he said. “But it will get worse before it gets better. This is a vastly underreported issue.”

Knox said the next step should be to move to implementation, support for the most vulnerable groups and an increased focus on the role of business as well as governments.

That will largely be the work of his successor in an unpaid but increasingly important and high-profile post. In discussions about his replacement at the UN, some proposed the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a prominent supporter of conservation issues.

Although the individual who takes the UN post is important, Knox said the bigger issue is the outside momentum that is pushing the institution to be more assertive on the environment. “I think this would have happened anyway. I’m just the stenographer describing what is happening,” the special rapporteur said.



“I was riding a wave as more and more states became interested in this issue. Unfortunately that’s because the problems are becoming more apparent,” he said.



The challenge is only likely to grow for his successor.

SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Trade ministers from 11 Pacific Rim countries signed a sweeping free trade agreement Thursday to streamline trade and slash tariffs just hours before President Donald Trump announced his plans to impose new tariffs on aluminum and steel to protect U.S. producers.

Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year, causing fears that it would not prosper without its most influential country. But the remaining 11 members pressed ahead, saying they were showing resolve against protectionism through global trade.

The ministers dropped key provisions that the Americans had required on protection of intellectual property, among others. The renegotiated pact signed in Chile’s capital was also renamed the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP.

“Despite the diverse and difficult challenges, the CPTPP is a historic achievement that creates free and fair 21st century rules in the Asia-Pacific region,” Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said at a news conference after the signing of the deal.

The pact that covers 500 million people includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam, which together account for 13 percent of the global economy. Its success highlights the isolation of the U.S. under Trump’s protectionist rhetoric on trade and his “America first” philosophy.

“It leaves the U.S. at a disadvantage from both a trade and a broader strategic perspective,” said Joshua Meltzer, senior fellow in the global economy and development program at the Brookings Institution. “It is now a trade bloc that discriminates against the U.S.”

Meltzer said the United States’ ability to shape the rules of trade in the Asia-Pacific region “is very much diminished.”

The U.S., originally the biggest TPP economy, was one of the trade deal’s strongest supporters before Trump took office. Trump has said he prefers country-to-country deals and is seeking to renegotiate several major trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement that includes the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

This is “a strong sign against the protectionist pressures, and in favor of a world open to free trade, without unilateral sanctions and the threat of trade wars,” Chilean Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz said.

The European Union said this week that it is ready to retaliate against Trump’s tariffs — of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports — with counter-measures against iconic U.S. products like Harley Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and bourbon.

The EU threat and Trump’s impending announcement on the tariffs were expected to escalate the risk of a trade war, in which nations try to punish each other by hiking taxes on traded goods. Experts say that tends to harm both exporting nations as well as importing countries’ consumers, who face higher costs.

The EU considers itself to be caught in the crossfire of a trade dispute, in which Trump has mainly singled out China for being unfair in its commercial deals.

The original TPP was conceived by the U.S. as a counterweight to China’s growing economic influence through a robust trading bloc that excluded the Asian giant. The thinking was that China would have an incentive to open its market and liberalize its policies in an effort to eventually qualify for TPP membership.

“Without the United States, it doesn’t serve that purpose,” said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It becomes a modest liberalization measure.”

China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, commented Thursday on the deal before it was signed.

“China did not participate in the CPTPP Agreement. However, China has always been a staunch supporter of trade liberalization and an important participant in Asia-Pacific regional cooperation and economic integration,” Wang Yi said at a news conference.

“Of course, we also hope that the various free trade arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region will be able to communicate and coordinate with each other and form a benign interaction, playing a constructive role in their respective fields in resisting trade protectionism and building an open world economy.”

"Home Depot pledges $50 million to train 20,000 skilled laborers, military veterans wanted",https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/home-depot-pledges-50-million-to-train-20000-skilled-laborers-military-veterans-wanted,"The Home Depot Foundation, a leadership arm for the company founded by Bernie Marcus, Arthur Blank and with the help of Ken Langone, hammered down on its pledge to closing the gap among skilled laborers in America.

It announced Thursday it would commit $50 million to train 20,000 tradespeople over the next 10 years, starting with separating military members and veterans, at-risk youth and members of the Atlanta Westside community, in an effort to reduce the number of unfilled construction sector jobs in the U.S. Currently, there are 158,000 unfilled jobs in the sector, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which projects the total employment number of construction laborers to increase 10.5% by 2026. As FOX Business reported, many six figure jobs in the sector are going unfilled.

""We want to bring shop class back, from coast-to-coast,"" Shannon Gerber, executive director of The Home Depot Foundation, said in a statement. ""We're thrilled to train 20,000 next-generation plumbers, electricians, carpenters and beyond. It's a true honor to welcome our first classes of separating soldiers as they transition to civilian life and into successful careers in the trades.""

The foundation launched a pilot trades training program last year for separating military members in partnership with the Home Builders Institute (HBI) – a nonprofit dedicated to providing education, career development, training and offers job placement services for the building industry – on Ft. Stewart in Georgia and Ft. Bragg in North Carolina. The first set of students will graduate this month.

A 12-week pre-apprenticeship certification program, which is free for students, uses an industry-based curriculum recognized by the Labor Department that integrates work-based learning with technical and academic skills. The program has a job placement rate of more than 90% and will roll out on more military bases nationwide, Home Depot said.

""HBI has a 50-year history of training individuals with the skills they need to succeed in the building industry. Our program prepares men and women for high-growth careers in the industry after leaving military service,"" HBI CEO John Courson said in a statement. ""With 200,000 service members separating from the military every year, our partnership with The Home Depot Foundation enables us to serve more veterans across the country.""

Home Depot also said the foundation is establishing an advanced level trades training program in partnership with the Construction Education Foundation of Georgia for residents of Atlanta’s Westside, which will expand training support to the broader veteran community and underserved high schools across America."

North Dakota is working towards transforming Prison,https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/08/us/prison-reform-north-dakota-norway/index.html,"(CNN) Heated floors, bike rides, and five-star cooking classes. Welcome to prison in Norway.

It looks nothing like most prisons in the US. That's because Norway's prison system is designed with three core values in mind: normality, humanity and rehabilitation. The point of incarceration in Norway, they say, is to make inmates ""better neighbors"" once they are released -- and they take that mission very seriously. Listen to this prison guard talk about his job:

In the US, prison is generally seen as punishment for crimes committed. But Norway might change that. As part of a CNNgo special, ""Welcome to Prison,"" we witnessed how one state has been trying to make dramatic reforms back home.

In 2015, prison directors and lawmakers from North Dakota traveled to see Norway's prisons for themselves. The trip was part of a program that takes state officials to visit the country, which has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world. When the leaders returned, North Dakota slowly began making changes to its prison system.

8 arraigned on felony charges in wake of Richard Spencer protest,http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/03/7_more_arraigned_following_ric.html,"Seven more people - five of whom are facing felony charges - were arraigned Wednesday in an East Lansing courtroom following violent protests that erupted at Michigan State University prior to a speech by white nationalist Richard Spencer.

That brings the number of people to 10 who were arraigned since Tuesday in 54-B District Court in East Lansing on charges ranging from resisting and obstructing police to carrying a concealed weapon following Spencer's appearance. Eight of those arraigned are facing felony charges.

Spencer gave a speech at about 5 p.m. Monday at the Pavilion for Agriculture and Livestock Education.

In addition to the arraignments, 10 people received tickets to appear in court at a later date for misdemeanor charges, such as disorderly conduct, urinating in public, or failing to obey a police officer, according to information provided by the Ingham County Prosecutor's Office.

The prosecutor's office also said four people arrested were released from custody pending further investigation by police. Prosecutors did not pursue charges against one person taken into custody.

All told, 25 people were arrested during Monday's protests, which took place in the area surrounding the pavilion, which is located at the southern tip of MSU's campus, near the intersection of Farm Lane and Mt. Hope Road.

MLive, along with other major news organizations, was denied credentialing and access to the event by its organizer, the National Policy Institute. But in a livestream, Spencer referred to the protesters as ""Antifa sick freaks"" and said their presence was a sign his movement was gaining traction.

Though the area in the pavilion where Spencer spoke could accommodate up to 364 people, just a few dozen people attended the event. Spencer blamed the small crowd on protesters limiting the entrance of his supporters who had tickets to attend.

Here's the list of people, provided by the prosecutor's office, who have been arraigned and ticketed in connection with the event:

Ameilia Earhart bones discovered,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/08/amelia-earhart-bones-discovered-pacific-island-belong-missing/amp/,"Earhart's fate has been the subject of many theories in the 81 years since her disappearance

Professor Jantz has argued that forensic techniques were not fully developed at the time and that the bone measurements closely match Earhart’s records.

He said: ""The only documented person to whom they may belong is Amelia Earhart.""

The final flight

A pioneering aviator, Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932 and in 1937 she was attempting to fly across the globe with her navigator Fred Noonan.

At the time of her disappearance the 39-year-old was trying to reach Hawaii before completing her journey onto California.

It had previously been accepted that the pair perished when their plane crashed close to Howland Island in the central Pacific Ocean, amid poor visibility and low fuel levels.

In her last radio transmission, Earhart said they could not find the island and their Lockheed Electra L-10E was running low on fuel.

For weeks the area was searched by the US Navy, but the plane was never found and Earhart was legally declared dead in 1939.

In 1940 an exploration party sent by the Phoenix Island Settlement Scheme, which aimed to colonise remote islands, stumbled across bones on Nikumaroro.

The officer in charge then ordered a wider search of the area which turned up more bones, part of a woman’s shoe and personal artifacts including a sextant box and a bottle of the herbal liqueur, Benedictine.

The remains were examined by the principal of the Central Medical School, Fiji of the Dr. D. W. Hoodless, who concluded they belonged to a “stocky male” around 5ft 5ins.

A fresh examination

As bones have since been lost, Professor Jantz, an expert in forensic anthropology at the University of Tennessee, used the bone measurements taken by Hoodless and compared them with what is known of Earhart's body type.

Professor Jantz used Earhart’s driver’s and pilot’s licence records and photos of the aviator to piece together her bone measurements.

Summing up the process, he said: “If the skeleton were available, it would presumably be a relatively straightforward task to make a positive identification, or a definitive exclusion.

“Unfortunately, all we have are the meager data in Hoodless’s report and a premortem record gleaned from photographs and clothing.

“From the information available, we can at least provide an assessment of how well the bones fit what we can reconstruct of Amelia Earhart.”

Professor Jantz argued that in 1940 “osteology was not yet a well-developed discipline” leading Hoodless to incorrectly assign the gender of the remains.

His own studies showed that the bones were closer to the measurements of Earhart than 99 per cent of a very large sample size.

Jantz concluded: “Until definitive evidence is presented that the remains are not those of Amelia Earhart, the most convincing argument is that they are hers.”

Previous conspiracy theories

In the decades since her disappearance numerous theories and conspiracies emerged as to the fate of Earhart.

Professor Jantz findings lend credence to the castaway theory, which posits that Earhart and Noonan landed safely on a reef in the ocean and then tried to radio for help before the plane was washed away by the tide.

The pair were then left alone on the uninhabited island where they perished. Another prevalent hypothesis is that they were captured and held by the Japanese.

Last year a photo was found in a ""top secret file"" in the US National Archive which fuelled speculation that Earhart and Noonan had been detained after crash-landing in the Japanese-held Marshall Islands.

A documentary on the findings also postulated that the US government knew of Earhart's whereabouts and did nothing to rescue her.

Japanese authorities told the documentary's maker, NBC, that there are no records indicating that Earhart was in Japanese custody.

An iteration of the Japanese capture theory was that Earhart survived the Second World War in captivity before returning to the USA where she lived under an assumed identity as Irene Bolam.

Another conspiracy theory holds that Earhart and Noonan were US spies on a secret mission approved by President Franklin Roosevelt to gather intel on the Marshall Islands when they were shot down."

"Australian scientists move closer to world-beating quantum computer that aims to replace the building blocks of traditional computing, known as bits, with quantum particles. Led by Australian of the year Michelle Simmons, team has built qubits from single phosphorus atoms in silicon.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/08/australian-scientists-move-closer-to-world-beating-quantum-computer-michelle-simmons,"Australian scientists, led by Australian of the year Michelle Simmons, have made a significant step in creating a world-beating, single-atom quantum computer.

Simmons and her Australian team announced on Wednesday they had built quantum bits, known as qubits, from single phosphorus atoms in silicon, that could communicate and correlate with each other.

Quantum computing is a field of science that aims to replace the building blocks of traditional computing, known as bits, with quantum particles.

While classic bits can have a value of only 0 or 1, quantum bits can exist in multiple states at once. This means they can be thousands of times more efficient and potentially revolutionise computing. A working quantum computer could solve, in minutes, a problem that would take a classic computer thousands of years.

Simmons said a process known as “entanglement” was crucial to this development.

Entanglement allows one quantum particle to communicate with and affect the state of another, which allows them to transfer information at any even more efficient rate.



Simmons’s research proved the qubits the team developed were correlating with each other, which was a promising sign of entanglement.

While other qubits have previously been entangled, it has never successfully been demonstrated in silicon with single atoms, both of which provide a much higher accuracy and reliability.

“In the silicon field, nobody has yet demonstrated that in those single atom systems,” Simmons told Guardian Australia. “The single atom systems are the ones showing the longest coherence times and very high accuracies.

“Other qubits are physically bigger and you can scale them to be bigger, but they are limited by their coherence. You get coherence times becoming really long the smaller you can make them – and single atoms are the smallest you can go.”

Silicon qubits, according to Simmons, are the best long term option for quantum computing. Qubits with low levels of coherence are prone to errors and are too unreliable for calculations.

The current entanglement record is 10 qubits, set in November last year with qubits made of aluminium. On Monday, Google announced they had created a 72 qubit computer – a record for total qubits, but not entangled.

Both developments come as physicists try and reach what is known as “quantum supremacy” – the point at which a current quantum computer can outperform a standard supercomputer.

Google’s team announced they were “cautiously optimistic” that quantum supremacy could be achieved on their device, with more development. According to Simmons, the goal the industry is striving for is 70 entangled qubits.

For their higher-quality silicon model, she is aiming to have one entangled quibit by the end of the year, and 10 entangled within the next five. She says the key to Wednesday’s discovery is that it broke expectations. The new data will improve their model, which will lead to better data – a recursive process that means the first entangled qubit is not far off.

“Our original theory was predicting we need to get our atoms 20 nanometres apart before they talk to each other. It’s actually 16. In the quantum world, that’s massive.

“There’s nothing to prohibit us getting them closer. The great thing is that the devices are small enough that we can make predictive models for the theory. Every time we get results we benchmark that with a theory and that helps us understand the system so much better.

“We’re using what we’re building to help us build it. It’s kind of funny for me.”"
'They are terrified': Italy election result deepens refugees' deportation fears,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/italy-election-result-deepens-refugees-deportation-fears,"The TV anchor was rattling off Italy’s general election results in the early hours of Monday morning and Zak could not fall asleep. He had been restless and sick with worry for weeks, ever since a neo-fascist had shot six Africans in the city of Macerata and the leaders of rightwing parties had vowed to kick 600,000 migrants out of the country if elected.

Zak, 17, comes from the Gambia and lives in a community for minors in Catenanuova, in the heart of Sicily. He made the perilous sea crossing from Libya in a wooden boat and has been waiting for months for a decision on his refugee status.

He bears the scars of torture from eight months of beatings in Libya. His father is Gambian, his mother Senegalese. In Senegal he had been forced to attend Islamic schools. Feeling deprived of his liberty, he had decided to flee.

As the hours went by on Monday, his worst nightmare became a reality: an anti-immigrant coalition of rightwing parties took 37% of the vote. It was not enough to govern, but it gives them a powerful hand in the coalition horse-trading that has already begun. Zak now fears he will never get his papers and that he will soon be deported.



“I followed the Italian election campaign very carefully, and almost all the parties, especially those on the right like the League, blame us for their economic problems and threaten to deport us,” Zak said. “In Sicily, youth unemployment is at 57% but nobody speaks about that. The politicians say the main problem is migrants and Italian people believe it.”

In recent months the number of people waiting outside police stations across Italy for renewal of their residence permits has multiplied. The officials who process renewals are booked up with appointments until the summer. Many applicants fear being returned to their home countries by the new government before they have a chance to get fresh permits.

Slah Msalem, from Zarzis in southern Tunisia, arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa in February 2011 as an unaccompanied minor. Tunisians in Italy are considered economic migrants and therefore vulnerable to expulsion.

“I know it will not happen right away, maybe months will pass, but it will happen,” said Msalem, 21. “The appointment at the police station was fixed on 18 June. I do not know what will happen in the meantime. If they stop me without documents they will surely take me to the police station and I’m afraid of being sent back to Tunisia.”

Agata Ronsivalle, a volunteer Italian teacher in a migrant reception centre, said: “The fear produced by the propaganda of the Italian right among migrants, especially minors, is unforgivable. It is not right. They’re just boys and they’re scaring them to death.”

An interpreter from Bangladesh who works in one of the police headquarters of Sicily and has lived in Italy for 18 years said there was a feeling of terror among refugees and migrants after the election result.

“When immigrants come to the police headquarters they ask anxiously for information and clarification, regarding the proclamations of the right,” said the man, who asked not to be identified. “They ask me if it is true that they will expel 600,000 migrants or if they will change the laws and further limit the current possibilities. They fear, for example, that medical care will be refused for those who do not have documents. I honestly cannot give them an answer.”



Migrants rely on their lawyers, asking them to find a solution that would allow them to stay. “They come to my office every day,” said Gaetano Pasqualino, a lawyer from Palermo. “They are literally terrified. The majority come from the Maghreb and are considered economic migrants and are therefore less certain of obtaining refugee status.”

With negotiations to form a government expected to last weeks or even months, the Italian right is not likely to be legislating any time soon. Some experts say there is another obstacle to a crackdown on migrants: a lack of money. Deportations have already cost Italian taxpayers millions of euros.

“In fact, neither Italy nor Europe have the economic and political force to send migrants home,” said Alberto Biondo, a member of Borderline Sicily, an association that works to defend the rights of migrants.

The legality of of deportations would also be questioned, he said, as “the necessary bilateral political agreements with the countries of origin of the migrants would be lacking”.

Last week Gabriella Nobile, the adoptive mother of two African children, wrote an open letter addressed to Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, saying her seven-year-old daughter had burst into tears when she heard of the rightwing party’s plans for deportations. The League, formerly the Northern League, took 18% of the vote on Sunday.

“I think it’s a clear demonstration of how this country, thanks to people like you, Salvini, is slowly slipping into the abyss,” she wrote.

Zak, the Gambian refugee, said: “I understand the suffering of this woman because I understand her children’s fears. Now, when they see migrants or black men, people seem scared. They do not know that I am the one who does not sleep at night. They do not understand that the only one to be terrified right now, in Italy, is me.”"

US will use around $300 million to train and equip an army in Syria.,https://www.rt.com/news/420724-syria-pentagon-payroll-army/,"Analysts have warned that US-supported groups in Syria often defect to extremists with their weapons. That's after it was revealed the Pentagon plans to spend around $300 million to train and equip a 60,000-strong army in Syria.

Commenting on the Pentagon’s plans to build, train and equip a massive ‘Vetted Syrian Opposition’ to fight Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Syria, a number of US-based experts told RT the move has nothing to do with combatting terrorism. Instead, US weapons and aid could easily land in the hands of Islamist extremists, as has often been seen in the past.

“In the past, some of the groups who were the recipient of US aid ended up either taking over or [being] defeated by some of the radical forces on the ground in Syria. Or some of them ended up joining the extremists and taking some of the weapons with them,” Edmund Ghareeb, a scholar at the American University in Washington, DC, told RT.

Another expert said an armed formation will help Washington tighten its grip over rebel-controlled parts of Syria, while stressing that the US’ “hostile military presence in Syria” has no legal basis. “They want to create… conditions in Syria where the country is still divided. The record of the US and the CIA’s operations in Syria is that the people they have supported all along have been extremists,” said Nicolas J.S. Davies, the author of ‘Blood On Our Hands: the American Invasion and Destruction of Iraq.’

He argued that the State Department and Pentagon “clearly want to push ahead with a plan to basically keep forces under their control in command of all Syrian territory east of the Euphrates river.”

While the US justifies its presence in Syria with claims it is fighting terrorists, the only area IS “has survived is the area that is under American and its allies' control,” Daoud Khairallah, a professor of international law at Georgetown University, believes.“One would wonder whether they are getting assistance from Americans for their survivability, ” Khairallah told RT.

Pentagon pays monthly allowance to rebels, seeks to establish large force in Syria

Following the virtual defeat of IS terrorists in Syria, the US appears to be trying to restructure its military presence in the war-torn country. In February, a fiscal year 2019 budget document mulled creating a new army out of elements of the so-called Vetted Syrian Opposition (VSO). The forces are “projected to total approximately 60,000 to 65,000” by October 2018, according to a report titled 'Justification for FY 2019 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)'.

The document explains that some 30,000 fighters will conduct “ongoing combat missions” against remaining pockets of IS in the Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV), while another 35,000-strong contingent will form Internal Security Forces in liberated areas.

Creating the massive new military structure of rather questionable legality, roughly equivalent to the size of the Canadian armed forces, is an expensive endeavor. Besides seeking $250 million for border security requirements for areas outside of Iraq and Syria, the Pentagon is seeking some $300 million from US lawmakers to implement the creation of the new opposition bulwark machine that will be funded through the Syrian Train and Equip Program. Launched under the Obama administration in 2014, the program identified and trained selected Syrian opposition forces to fight IS.

The Pentagon plans to spend the bulk of the new funds on arming the forces. Nearly $50 million is allocated for buying AK-47s, PKM machine guns, as well as RPG-7 anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Mortar launchers and sniper rifles are also on the menu next to hand grenades, different types of vehicles and tons of ammunition.

Washington plans to pay a monthly allowance to its force, in addition to providing the new force with uniforms, hygiene kits and medical equipment. “[The Department of Defense] will transition to a stabilization effort that will focus on support to local Internal Security Forces, who will receive stipends for their efforts to secure liberated territory and prevent the re-emergence of ISIS or its affiliates,” the document reads. “Currently, 10,000 established partner force personnel are being paid stipends. The individual stipend payments range from $200 to $400 per month.”

While Washington maintains that its goal is to defeat IS, Moscow has repeatedly questioned US intentions, especially as the American presence in Syria is viewed as a violation of sovereignty.

The Russian military last month asserted that the true US goal is to capture “economic assets” in Syria, warning that America’s presence constitutes a dangerous threat to the political process and territorial integrity of the country.

Canadian First Nation community now has clean drinking water after 14 years,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/slate-falls-water-plant-1.4564183,"A First Nation in northwestern Ontario that had been under a boil-water advisory for 14 years now has clean water with the opening of a new treatment plant.

Slate Falls, about 550 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, Ont., celebrated the opening of the plant on Tuesday.

""Very important,"" Slate Falls Chief Lorraine Crane said of the new facility, which will serve the community of about 300 residents. ""[It means] better care, better health, clean water for our children and also for the elders.""

The new plant means 'better care, better health, clean water for our children and also for the elders,' says Lorraine Crane, the chief of Slate Falls. (Brett Purdy / CBC) For the past 20 years, homes and other buildings got their water from a series of pump houses, according to the Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN), a territorial organization that represents 49 First Nations in Ontario, including Slate Falls. None of those facilities was able to provide clean water from 2004 onward, NAN officials said.

That system, which took water from a nearby lake, and ran it through a filter and briefly through a chlorination system, lacked the capacity to properly rid the water of E. coli and other contaminants. The new plant effectively brings the community's water system up to modern standards.

""It's hard. We had to boil water for drinking,"" Crane said of how the community has lived for nearly 15 years. ""Many people actually bought their water.""

Slate Falls First Nation has a population of about 300 and is about 550 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, Ont. (Google) She said relying on bottled water for everyday use was expensive.

The federal government pledged $11.6 million for the treatment plant project in 2016, after more than a decade of efforts by community leadership in Slate Falls to secure funding. The lack of clean water has hampered plans to build more homes to help with overcrowding.

""I feel incredibly happy to be able to see this absolutely beautiful facility and to be here, to see the pride the community has and realize how long it's been since they've been able to turn on the taps in this community and drink the water,"" Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott said at Tuesday's opening.

Jane Philpott, Canada's minister of Indigenous services, says the federal government remains committed to its promise to end long-term boil-water advisories in First Nation communities by 2021. (Brett Purdy / CBC)

There are still 81 long-term boil-water advisories in First Nations communities in Canada.

Philpott's office pointed out that doesn't mean 81 individual communities are affected, as some have multiple advisories in place. Prior to the new treatment plant opening, Slate Falls had 11.

The federal government has pledged to end all such advisories by March 2021, a commitment that Philpott said Ottawa continues to stand by.

""We are firm in our plan to make sure every long-term water advisory for public systems like this will be lifted,"" she said. ""We have a detailed plan in place for every remaining long-term advisory that's there.""

Philpott said the recently announced 2018 budget will ""speed some of them up a little bit and get the work done faster.""

The budget promises an additional $172.6 million over three years — beginning in 2018-19 — for projects to ensure First Nations have clean drinking water.

Saudi Crown Prince ups the ante by opening military to women,http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Saudi-Crown-Prince-ups-the-ante-by-opening-military-to-women-544440,"If you are a Saudi woman with a high school diploma, between the ages of 25 and 35, at least 155 centimeters (5’1”) tall and in good physical condition, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman may want you in the Saudi Arabia defense forces.Last week, the crown prince, known as MBS, took his ambitious reform program a step further by opening the ranks of non-combat positions in the military to women.According to two leading Israeli analysts of Saudi Arabia, Joshua Teitelbaum of Bar-Ilan University’s Besa Center and Brandon Friedman of Tel Aviv University’s Dayan Center, bringing about greater equality for women is an integral part of MBS’s drive to transform Saudi Arabia into a more open and modern 21st century society and to diversify its economy beyond oil exports.“In analyzing reform you have to compare declaration to implementation.But here even the declaration is important,” Friedman said.“It’s signaling a new direction and if you look back five to ten years, it’s almost an unthinkable direction.”In Teitelbaum’s view, this and other recent gains for women add up to “serious change for Saudi Arabia. Apparently Muhammad bin Salman has enough popularity and feels himself strong enough that he can do this. And he’s moving forward.”“He’s trying to ween Saudi Arabia from oil and paint it as a modern state, a more normal state with less influence of the religious establishment, a state with moderate Islam, not radical Islam,” Teitelbaum added. “It’s quite an agenda but he is still alive and hasn’t been dethroned and we’ll see how it goes.”The one major shadow hanging over MBS is the unsuccessful war in Yemen, which he launched but for which he lacks an exit strategy, Teitelbaum said.MBS’s first nod to women was to restrain the powers of the religious police, Friedman noted. The legal system has also been adjusted to provide for a more equitable treatment of women. In September, King Salman announced that as of June, women would be allowed to drive. In January, they were allowed to attend soccer matches for the first time.According to Gulf News, Saudi authorities opened 140 jobs in air traffic control at airports to female applicants in January. The newspaper said the government was overwhelmed with more than 100,000 applications.Despite the gains, Saudi Arabia’s system of male guardianship remains intact and even the female soldiers will continue to have male guardians. According to the system, women must obtain permission from men to travel and marry and in some instances to work or undergo health treatments.The women conscripts and their male guardians will have to live in the region where the army position is offered. But, Teitelbaum says he would not be surprised if MBS does away with guardianship at some point. “It’s a tough one but once you start liberalizing, it’s hard to stop,” he says.Gulf News quoted Iqbal Dandari, a female member of the Shura Advisory Council to the monarchy, as calling last month for mandatory conscription for all Saudi men and women. “Women must be trained to serve their country and defend themselves and their homeland in case of a crisis, war or attack in any region,” she said. Dandari added that Saudi women are naturally strong and valiant so all Saudis will feel more comfortable knowing that well-trained women are defending the country.In Friedman’s view, MBS is serious in his bid to transform women’s status. “My feeling is that as part of his broader program for the kingdom, he realizes the kingdom needs women. And the only way he can get women to buy into what he’s trying to do, to transform the Saudi social contract, is to provide them with a greater stake to take part in Saudi society.”According to the old social contract, individual Saudis ceded the right to participate in the political life of the kingdom in exchange for the kingdom providing for them with its vast oil wealth.Realizing that due to demographic change and limited oil wealth this model is no longer sustainable, MBS is “trying to create a more diverse political economy that incentivizes Saudis to participate in the workforce and to create economic opportunity,” Friedman says. “The only way you can do that is to maximize your human capital.You have to give women a chance.”"

Uber's self-driving trucks have been hired to deliver freight in Arizona - Recode,https://www.recode.net/2018/3/6/17082774/uber-self-driving-truck-otto-freight-embark-waymo-alphabet-arizona,"Uber’s self-driving trucks are now delivering commercial freight in Arizona, the company announced on Tuesday. This marks the beginning of the company realizing the ambitions it laid out when acquiring self-driving trucking startup, Otto, in August 2016.

Uber’s acquisition of Otto has not been without its roadblocks, however. Most notably, there was Alphabet’s lawsuit against the company over the acquisition, something Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, when he agreed to settle the suit, could have been handled better.

But, as Recode first reported, there was also tension within the self-driving department over which of Uber’s two autonomous efforts took priority — was it the cars or trucks? Staffers who joined Uber as part of the Otto acquisition worried trucks would take a back seat to Uber’s original driverless ambitions of building cars to be used in its ride-hail network.

While former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said he wanted to acquire Otto as a means to hire one of its co-founders, Anthony Levandowski, Levandowski’s partner Lior Ron testified during the Alphabet lawsuit that being able to develop driverless trucks was non-negotiable. In fact, he decided to sell the company to Uber, instead of staying at Alphabet or selling to Lyft, because it was one of the few places that was open to creating a driverless trucking service.

Though Uber has spent the better part of its driverless PR efforts on promoting its semi-autonomous Volvos, it appears its driverless trucking efforts are a bit further along. It’s not because the trucks are more technically capable of driving autonomously than the cars — in fact, driving autonomously on the highway as these trucks are doing is much easier than driving on city streets — it’s because Uber has actually managed to commercialize the trucks.

The company wouldn’t specify how many self-driving trucks were operating in Arizona nor how many companies it was working with or the number of shipments that have been delivered. Uber simply said its self-driving trucks had performed “thousands” of rides since the beginning of the year, a “significant portion” of which have been in autonomous mode.

So it’s impossible to tell how much money the company has made from the shipments they’ve delivered with these trucks, and it’s likely it’d be a drop in the bucket compared to how much Uber has spent and will continue to spend on developing, retrofitting and owning the trucks.

But, it is one of the first few examples of a company actually commercializing autonomous vehicles as a service. Uber isn’t alone in the space, however. In fact, trucking startup Embark beat the company to the punch and started shipping Frigidaire refrigerators between Texas and California late last year.

Uber is beginning to operate — in however small a scale — what could be an interesting new revenue stream for the company. Creating the foundation for that is not exactly an inexpensive endeavor, however.

Uber has been building out the logistics end of its trucking service, called Uber Freight, and officially launched the platform in May 2017. It essentially operates like an Uber for freight wherein the company matches commercial shippers with truck drivers looking for a job.

So, as there is for its autonomous cars with the existing ride-hail network, there is a built-in path to market for Uber’s autonomous trucks. As many industry experts have predicted, autonomous trucks may hit the road in a meaningful way much faster than passenger vehicles, largely because teaching software how to drive on the highway is much easier than teaching software how to drive on local streets where there are many more variables.

That’s why the trucks will hand control back to the driver when exiting the highway or freeway. In fact, the vehicle operator will have full discretion over when to engage and disengage the autonomous technology on the highways — just like in Teslas.

That means there’ll still be drivers in the mix.

“We are not even looking at what it would take to operate a self-driving truck on busier city streets,” Uber spokesperson Sarah Abboud told Recode. “The highly skilled truck drivers out there today are going to facilitate these short-haul routes now and in the future.”

Each of these drivers have commercial licenses but must receive extra training to be able to operate the autonomous truck. Today, the company needs three drivers for a single long haul.

The way it works is after a shipper posts a job on the Uber Freight marketplace, an assigned driver will pick up the freight from the shipper in a conventional truck. That driver then goes to a dedicated location, called a transfer hub, that Uber has set up where the shipment is transferred to a self-driving truck.

Then a trained autonomous vehicle operator drives the long haul portion of the trip to another transfer hub close to the destination. Here, a third driver picks up the trailer in a conventional truck and delivers the shipment to the final destination.

Uber currently owns the trucks but may partner with another company to bring the trucks to market in the future. While it’s a potentially significant move for Uber, the ride-hail company will have to compete with a number of major players operating in the space like Tesla and Alphabet’s self-driving arm Waymo, as well as newer players like Embark.

North Korea says it could give up nuclear weapons as historic border summit with South announced,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-give-up-south-summit-kim-jong-un-latest-a8241921.html,"North and South Korea have agreed to hold summit talks at the border between the two countries next month, according to officials in Seoul.

South Korea's presidential office said the nations had agreed to set up a telephone hotline between their leaders, who will meet for the first time at the summit in a tense border village in late April.

Chung Eui-yong, the South's presidential national security director, said Pyongyang had also made it clear it would not need to keep its nuclear weapons if military threats against the country were resolved and it received a credible security guarantee.

And in another significant development, Kim Jong-un has agreed to a freeze on all nuclear and missile tests in the event of any talks with the US, South Korea said. Donald Trump has previously said he is willing to talk with the North Korean leader, describing him in an upbeat speech at the end of last week as a ""fine man"". But the two sides have previously reached an impasse on whether denuclearisation would be a prerequisite for diplomatic progress.

Donald Trump hailed ""possible progress being made in talks with North Korea"", and welcomed the ""serious effort"" from both sides. He nonetheless added a note of caution, saying: ""May be false hope, but the US is ready to go hard in either direction!""

The announcement came hours after a 10-person strong South Korean delegation led by Mr Chung returned from a visit to the North, where they met North Korean leaders including Mr Kim.

The reports from the South were corroborated by articles in the official North Korean news agency KCNA. It reported that ""after being told about President Moon Jae-in's intention for a summit... the Supreme Leader (Mr Kim) exchanged views and reached a satisfactory agreement"".

​KCNA said Mr Kim held ""openhearted talks with the South side's special envoy delegation over... actively improving the North-South relations and ensuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula"".

The summit in late April will be only the third-ever since a war between the two Koreas ended in stalemate and without a formal peace treaty in 1953.

The two past summits, in 2000 and 2007, were held between Mr Kim's father - Kim Jong-il - and two different liberal South Korean presidents.

Those talks resulted in a number of cooperative projects that were eventually scrapped after conservative administrations took over in the South.

The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, won that country's election in May last year after campaigning on a message of new talks with the North. Earlier this year, he said he wanted to be remembered as the leader ""who built a peaceful relationship between the North and South"".

Mr Chung's visit to the North was the most senior in more than a decade. During those talks, Mr Kim seemed to relish a role he rarely gets to take - that of a magnanimous statesman welcoming an important international delegation.

Kim's rite of passage

He has been in power for six years, but Kim Jong-un has yet to complete one of the defining rituals of a world leader - hosting another head of state, or being welcomed by one abroad.

The progress in inter-Korean diplomacy in recent weeks, sparked by the North's presence at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, raises the prospect of that changing.

North Korea's state-run media made a point of portraying him on Monday as a confident statesman, holding court over a lavish dinner, beaming with satisfaction during group photos and congratulating South Korea for successfully staging the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

That's quite a dramatic departure from the predominant images of 2017 — Kim surrounded by his generals celebrating their latest missile launch.

Make no mistake — Kim is sticking to his nuclear weapons and arsenal of missiles capable of reaching the US mainland. He has said repeatedly that he has no intention of giving them up or of using them as a bargaining chip to improve ties with Seoul, Washington or anybody else.

But both of Kim's predecessors travelled outside North Korea's borders during their tenures — Kim Il Sung famously visited the Soviet Union and most of eastern Europe by train in 1984. Kim Jong Un himself has been abroad, having attended school as a boy in Switzerland, and rumours have come up from time to time that he would visit either Beijing or Moscow.

If nothing else, it appears Kim does have an aircraft ready for the task.

Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, flew to the South for the Olympics on an aircraft believed to be Kim Jong Un's personal jet, which was decked out to resemble the kind of plane other national leaders use for state trips. The optics seemed designed to suggest Kim, like any other political leader, could be ready to hop on a flight if the opportunity arose."

Dreamers

Demonstrations have taken place in major cities across the US in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportations.

Fletcher, who also came to the US as a child from Columbia, said he shared the experience of the Dreamers, people who came into the US illegally as children.

“We don’t want to live based on fear. We want to live according to the principles of freedom of speech, of religion,” he said.

Trump has long desired to end renewal applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme. Its recipients, known as the Dreamers, were thrown into legal uncertainty after Trump moved last year to end the programme, which protects hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.

Trump gave legislators until yesterday, March 5 to come up with a replacement, before a Supreme Court ruling delayed that deadline for as much as a year.

He has been locked in bitter negotiations with Democrats about replacing the programme in exchange for a raft of immigration overhauls that would end other avenues of legal immigration.

Quoting Malcolm X, Talib Shareef of the Muslim Alliance of North America said: “Almighty Allah has told us to stand for justice. We are not weak in faith and we are here for a mobilization.

“We stand here in the spirit of Malcolm X with the people who are affected by these policies.”

“This is creating real fear,” Suleiman said, adding that the imams are fighting white supremacy because Islamophobia, racism and hostility against immigrants all stem from the same roots."
"China unhappy over US carrier visit to Vietnam, newspaper says",https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-navy/2018/03/07/china-unhappy-over-us-carrier-visit-to-vietnam-newspaper-says/,"BEIJING — Beijing is unhappy with the first visit by a U.S. aircraft carrier to a Vietnamese port since the Vietnam War and is monitoring developments, a Communist Party newspaper said Wednesday.

However, the Global Times said the USS Carl Vinson’s visit was unlikely to alter the balance of power in the South China Sea , which China claims virtually in its entirety and has been fortifying with military structures on man-made islands .

“China’s vigilance and unhappiness are inevitable, but we don’t think that the USS Carl Vinson’s Vietnam trip can stir up troubles in the South China Sea,” the paper known for its hard-line nationalist views said in an editorial.

The visit “will not generate any special tools to pressure China,” while the U.S. sending warships to the South China Sea will “only waste money,” the paper said.

Vietnam and China have extensive overlapping claims to islands and resources in the sea, and U.S. officials say the port call is a sign of the U.S. commitment to the region and U.S.-Vietnam ties.

“Carl Vinson being here, me being here, this is about Vietnam. This is about our relationship with Vietnam, both from a military relationship and from a comprehensive partnership relationship,” Vice Adm. Phillip Sawyer, commander of the U.S. 7th Fleet, told reporters in a conference call Tuesday from the Vietnamese port of Da Nang, where the ship docked Monday.

Sawyer and other officials have not linked the ship’s visit to China’s activities in the South China Sea, but he did note Washington’s concerns over China’s moves to put teeth behind its territorial claims and unanswered questions about China’s purpose in its rapid military expansion and upgrading.

“My view on that is both those, land reclamation and the militarization, cause angst within the region. And the angst that it causes is really because of lack of transparency,” Sawyer said.

“It’s not quite clear what’s going to happen down there. And I think that angst and that lack of transparency is potentially disruptive to the security and stability of the region. And that, that causes concern,” he said.

China to develop its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier A Chinese company's news release, which has since been modified, has revealed plans to speed up the development of China’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.

The visit by the USS Carl Vinson with more than 5,000 crewmembers marks the largest U.S. military presence in Vietnam since the Southeast Asian nation was unified under Communist leadership after the war ended in 1975.

Accompanied by a cruiser and a destroyer, the ship is visiting as China completes work on air bases, radar stations and other infrastructure that could prove key in a military conflict in the Paracel islands and seven artificial islands in the Spratlys in maritime territory also claimed by Vietnam.

The ship’s mission includes technical exchanges, sports matches and visits to an orphanage and a center for victims of Agent Orange, a toxic defoliant sprayed by U.S. forces to deny cover for Communist fighters during the war. It marks a fine-tuning, rather than a turning point, in relations. The U.S. Navy has staged activities in Vietnam for its Pacific Partnership humanitarian and civic missions in nine of the past 12 years."
Sergei Skripal 'poisoning' - live updates: Theresa May chairs National Security Council meeting on Russian spy incident,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sergei-skripal-poisoning-live-updates-latest-russia-spy-mi6-wiltshire-zizzi-police-investigation-a8241971.html,"Incident Response crew at the scene where Sergei Skripal was found unconscious alongside a woman.

Police are continuing to investigate the ""unknown substance"" that left a former Russian double agent and his daughter in a critical condition in hospital.

Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on Sunday.

Several members of emergency services personnel who responded to the call were themselves taken ill, with one remaining in hospital.

Investigators have seized CCTV footage from a nearby gym showing a man and woman, believed to be the victims, walking nearby just half an hour before police were called.

Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, confirmed the victims' identities while answering an urgent question on the incident in the House of Commons.

“It is too early to speculate as to the precise nature of the crime or attempted crime that has taken place in Salisbury, but I know members will have their suspicions and what I will say is that if those suspicions prove to be well-founded than this Government will take whatever measures we deem necessary to protect the lives of people in this country, our values and our freedoms,” he said.

“Though I am not now pointing fingers, I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go either unsanctioned or unpunished.”

An Italian chain restaurant has been closed as a precaution, with staff being interviewed as the probe continues.

Relatives told the BBC that Ms Skripal, 33, was in Britain to visit her father. His son is said to have died in non-suspicious circumstances while on holiday in Russia last year.

Mr Skripal is a former Russian double agent, who was convicted in his home country after spying for the UK.

Once a colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, he was given refuge in Britain after he was exchanged in 2010 for Russian spies caught in the West as part of a Cold War-style swap in Vienna.

The case has been compared to that of former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who died after being poisoned with radioactive polonium-210, which was believed to have been put in his tea.

The Independent understands that police are looking for similarities between the cases and the modus operandi used.

Counter-terror police are helping with the investigation, although the incident itself is not terror-related.

Wiltshire Police said that Public Health England “reiterated that, based on the evidence to date, there is no known risk to the public's health.

“However, as a precaution they have advised that if you feel ill contact NHS on 111. If you feel your own or another's health is significantly deteriorating, ring 999”.

A major incident was declared at Salisbury District Hospital after the patients arrived, with people told not to attend A&E unless it is “extremely urgent”."

Boris Johnson gives World Cup warning to Russia over spy 'poisoning',https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/03/06/kremlin-denies-involvement-poisoning-russian-spy-uk-anti-terror/,"England’s participation in the football World Cup in Moscow could be in doubt if Russia is linked to the suspected poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal, the Foreign Secretary has suggested.

Boris Johnson has warned Russia that it will face a “robust” response from the UK if it is implicated in the incident, in which the former spy's daughter was also targeted, with the England football team’s presence at this summer’s tournament now in jeopardy.

Answering an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson told MPs that, should their suspicions be confirmed, Russia would face tougher sanctions as he labelled the Kremlin a “malign and disruptive force”.

Asked whether the incident, which has sparked a major investigation involving counter-terror police, would lead to a breakdown in relations, Mr Johnson said: “We will have to have a serious conversation about our engagement with Russia.

“For my own part, I think it will be very difficult to see how we...thinking ahead to the World Cup in July, I think it will be very difficult to imagine that UK representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way, and will have to think on that.”"
Papers Catalan police tried to burn implicate latest nominee for premier,https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/03/06/inenglish/1520336532_245789.html,"In a further twist to Catalonia’s already complicated political scene, revelations about compromising documents saved from the flames in the nick of time could undermine the nomination of the latest candidate to the Catalan premiership.

The papers, which were seized by National Police officers on October 26 – a day before a unilateral independence declaration was passed by the regional parliament – reveal the existence of an illegal spying network.

Catalan police had tried to burn the incriminating documents at an incineration plant

The internal documents that the Mossos d’Esquadra Catalan police had been planning to burn at an incineration plant in Sant Adriá del Besós (Barcelona) contain damaging information about Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart, two civic leaders who are currently in pre-trial detention awaiting prosecution for sedition over the events of September 20 and 21, when thousands of protesters congregated in front of the Catalan department of economic affairs. The protest involved acts of vandalism against Civil Guard patrol cars, and hindered the work of officers in search of election material to confiscate.

Sànchez also happens to be the current candidate to become the next premier of Catalonia, after ousted premier Carles Puigdemont, who is living in self-imposed exile in Belgium, officially gave up on his reinstatement attempts and endorsed Sánchez’s nomination.

Despite Sánchez’s legal situation – it is unclear whether the Supreme Court judge in charge of the case will grant him leave to attend the investiture debate – the session has been scheduled for Monday, March 12 by Catalan parliament speaker Roger Torrent.

Catalan police

The information contained in the documents also represents a new legal setback for former Mossos d’Esquadra chief Josep Lluís Trapero, who is being investigated by the courts for allegedly directing the regional police force to aid the independence movement. The Catalan police stood by on October 1, the day of the illegal independence referendum, despite a court order to stop voting from taking place.

On October 26, National Police officers stopped three vehicles containing 36 boxes full of documents that the Catalan police force was attempting to take to the incineration plant in Sant Adrià del Besòs for destruction. The National Police’s information section in Barcelona spent six weeks poring through the information, and on December 15 it sent a report to High Court investigating Judge Carmen Lamela.

The 400-page dossier, which was reported on by the digital daily El Periódico, is now part of the evidence being used in the investigation against ex-Mossos chief Trapero.

The documents contain details about the September 20 protest in front of the Catalan economic department, and conversations between the Mossos and leaders of pro-independence associations who encouraged supporters to congregate in front of the building. Even though there were acts of vandalism and six Civil Guard patrol cars were damaged, the Mossos failed to step in and portrayed the demonstrators as peaceful.

In its analysis of the papers, the National Police point to specific documents detailing how Trapero’s aide, Teresa Laplana, gave Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart “sensitive information” on several occasions throughout the protest.

The Mossos actions as described in the papers represent “a manifest task of support for the execution of the secessionist road map, by controlling all the groups, individuals and activities that opposed it,” says the National Police’s report."
Former GameStop CEO Paul Raines dies at 53,https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/5/17081342/gamestop-ceo-paul-raines-death-obituary,"Former GameStop CEO J. Paul Raines, who left the company in late 2017 for medical reasons, has died. Raines was 53, according to his profile on Bloomberg.

“We are profoundly sad to learn of the passing of our friend and former chief executive officer, J. Paul Raines,” Mike Mauler, GameStop CEO, said in a statement. “His spirit is woven into the fabric of our company and the entire GameStop family mourns this loss. Paul was a brilliant man and remarkable visionary, as well as a compassionate, caring and inspirational community leader who was beloved by many. Paul cared deeply about his work and his GameStop family, but his greatest love was for his family. Our heartfelt sympathies go out to them and all those whose lives and hearts Paul touched during his journey.”

Raines left GameStop in November, according to a news release from the company that indicated a reoccurrence of a previously disclosed medical issue, for which he was seeking treatment. Raines had been treated for a cancerous brain tumor in 2014, GameStop announced at the time. GameStop executive chairman Daniel A. DeMatteo stepped in as interim CEO when Raines stepped down last year. In February, GameStop appointed Michael K. Mauler as its new CEO.

Postal Service Testing Plug-in Hybrid Mail Truck Prototype by Turkish Truck Maker Karsan Otomotive,https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/05/usps-karsan-hybrid-mail-truck/,"Postal Service Testing Karsan Plug-in Hybrid Mail Truck

The U.S. Postal Service is testing a prototype of a plug-in hybrid mail truck from Karsan Otomotive, a Turkish truck maker.

The truck, one of a series of prototypes from five different manufacturers competing to build the next mail truck, is undergoing tests on pavement and rural dirt roads in the Midwest.

Photos taken by Trucks.com last week show that the prototype that Karsan is building with team member Morgan Olson is a plug-in hybrid. There are ports on two sides of the truck. One on the right side of the vehicle over the front wheel looks to be for electricity. There’s a conventional gasoline port above the left rear wheel.

Karsan will provide the hybrid technology. Morgan Olson, a Sturgis, Mich.-based manufacturer of walk-in vans that has a longstanding relationship with USPS, will manufacture the body. Karsan has designed and built more than 277,000 gas and electric cars as well as specialty automobiles in Europe.

The USPS has said that half the prototypes “will feature hybrid and new technologies, including alternative fuel capabilities.”

It might be the oddest-looking of the five prototypes competing for the lucrative USPS truck order. Its low-slung boxy hood projects forward under the windshield. Bulky sideview mirrors — resembling monkey arms — are suspend from both sides of the upper cab.

There’s a sliding cargo door on the right side of the truck.

The vehicle carries the USPS eagle logo painted on each side and has the Karsan nameplate on top of the grille between the headlights.

The truck appears to have a high-mounted back-up camera or cargo deck monitor. It was spotted undergoing road tests in frigid winter conditions.

The USPS will choose models from the prototypes to replace up to 180,000 aging mail trucks. Of the 215,000 in operation, 140,000 are at least two decades old. The changeover — which may be incremental, replacing 12,000 trucks at a time — could take place over the course of seven years. The contract is worth an estimated $6.3 billion.

There are five contenders in the competition, which the USPS has named the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle, or NGDV, program.

In addition to the Karsan/Morgan Olson team entry, VT Hackney/Workhorse Group also are participating as a duo. The Hackney prototype is an electric vehicle that shares many components with the Workhorse W-15 electric pickup truck.

South Bend, Ind.-based AM General submitted an internal-combustion engine truck with start-stop technology for improved fuel efficiency. The manufacturer builds the military Humvee and once made the civilian Hummer H1 before the brand was shuttered by General Motors.

AM General also has an existing relationship with the USPS. It built the Dispatcher Jeep — the first civilian model of the military Jeep — which was used by the agency as a delivery vehicle into the early’90s.

The U.S. division of the Indian manufacturer Mahindra, known for building right-hand drive commercial vehicles, entered a truck with a mild hybrid system, according to a National Highway Transportation Safety Administration filing.

Another entry comes from Oshkosh Corp., headquartered in Oshkosh, Wis. It manufactures vehicles such as aircraft rescue and fire trucks, snow blowers and tactical vehicles and has a long history of contracts with the federal government. Oshkosh and the USPS have not provided details on its entry.

“Real-world” testing of the prototypes started last fall. The USPS has been running the trucks up against extreme weather conditions and varying landscapes in Flint, Mich.; Leesburg, Va.; and Tucson, Ariz. Other test locations include Tempe, Ariz.; Utica, Mich.; and Manassas, Va., according to the USPS.

Previously the USPS said it would choose the contract winner in early 2018. On Friday the agency declined to comment on the status of its decision.

Putin says he would bring back USSR if he could.,https://timesofislamabad.com/04-Mar-2018/i-would-reverse-the-collapse-of-soviet-union-putin-stuns-world-with-his-commitment,"MOSCOW - A day after unveiling dramatic new weapons - including a nuclear-powered cruise missile - that sparked talk of a return to Cold War tensions, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested he'd reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union if he could.

Putin's comments on the 1991 collapse of the USSR - which bound Russia and many of its neighbors, while exerting influence in Eastern Europe and abroad for almost seven decades - came at a question-and-answer forum held Friday in Kaliningrad. Taking questions from the audience, the Russian leader was asked what event in his nation's history he would have liked to change.

""The collapse of the Soviet Union,"" Putin responded, according to the Russian news agency Tass.

Though a fringe idea in the West, regret about the collapse of the Soviet Union is not unusual in Russia - in fact, it is widespread. And with Russian elections just a week away, its a factor still worth watching.

The polling agency Levada Center has been asking Russians about their views on the collapse of the Soviet Union since 1992. The most recent numbers, from a survey conducted in November 2017, show that 58 percent of Russians regret the USSR's collapse, while just over a quarter do not.

Despite all the changes in Russia over the past quarter century, this public regret has proved remarkably consistent. Only once since polling began has the number of Russians saying they had regrets fallen below a majority - in December 2012, when 49 percent said they had regrets, though only 35 percent said they did not.

The pro-Soviet sentiment peaked in 2000, just as Putin was just coming to power, with three-quarters of the country said they regretted the collapse of the USSR.

This sentiment is understandable when events are viewed from the perspective of the average Russian. Though the end of the Soviet Union heralded the end of the Cold War tensions with the United States and its allies, for many it was the start of years of political and economic uncertainty, as well as a diminished place for the Russian people on the world stage.

Part of the regret may be from the chaotic manner in which the Soviet Union came to an end. The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, said in 2016 that the end of the union was due to ""treachery."" Putin, formerly a KGB officer stationed in East Germany, called the breakdown of the USSR as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century"" in 2005, pointing to how many Russian citizens wound up outside of Russian territory due to the collapse.

But the sentiment appears broader than that: The Levada Center's polling found that a majority of Russians felt bitterness over the end of the unified economic system, while a smaller group said that they felt Russia was no longer a superpower.

Putin has been been leader of Russia in some form or another since 2000, making him the longest serving Kremlin leader since Joseph Stalin. This week, Putin used his annual address to announce a series of new weapon technologies that he dubbed ""invincible,"" including nuclear-powered missiles that would be difficult for conventional missile defense systems to combat.

Thursday's speech marked a new low in U.S.-Russia relations in the post-Cold War period, experts argue. Some analysts say that while Russia already had weapons that could overwhelm U.S. missile defenses if needed, the public announcement of these weapons was likely designed to rally a domestic base ahead of the March 18 election.

Putin is easily expected to win the election, with a poll conducted last week giving him almost 70 percent - almost ten times the share of the vote of his nearest rival, a candidate from the Communist Party.

Despite his regret about the collapse of the Soviet Union, Putin told the audience on Friday he wouldn't want to live in any other period than the current. Asked about his dreams for the future, the Russian president said: ""I want our country to be successful, powerful, stable, balanced and looking ahead."" - Washington Post"
Euro slips after Italian election fans political uncertainties,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-forex/euro-slips-after-italian-election-fans-political-uncertainties-idUSKBN1GG16H,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Monday after a short-lived sell-off tied to Italy’s inconclusive weekend election, helped by the creation of a coalition government in Germany that eased political uncertainty there.

The dollar rose versus the yen as traders reduced their safe-haven holdings of the Japanese currency on easing fears about a trade war stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum proposed last Thursday.

Italy’s election, which pointed to prolonged political jitters after right-wing and eurosceptic parties did better than expected, was somewhat balanced by Germany’s Social Democrats agreeing to join with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, ending a period of uncertainty in Europe’s biggest economy.

Taken together, the election outcomes did not to alter investors’ view on the strength of the euro zone economy, although the Italian results put political risks in the region back on the radar.

“All in all, they are neutral to slightly positive for the euro,” said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.

Bennenbroek and other analysts said traders will turn their focus to four major central bank meetings this week as well as the U.S. payrolls report due Friday.

The Reserve Bank of Australia will meet on Tuesday, while the Bank of Canada will hold a policy meeting on Wednesday. European Central Bank policymakers will convene on Thursday, while their counterparts at the Bank of Japan will meet on Friday.

The euro EUR= was last up 0.11 percent to $1.2330, erasing losses tied to the Italian election results.

The single currency rose to a two-week high at $1.2365 in Asian trading after the German results.

The euro was up 0.53 percent to 130.93 yen. It had fallen as much as 0.7 percent to 129.37 yen, its lowest since late August in early London trading.

LESS FEARS OVER U.S. TARIFFS

The dollar steadied after wobbling last week on Trump’s proposed 25-percent and 10-percent levies on imported steel and aluminum.

The surprise announcement touched off threats of countermeasures from the European Union, Canada and other U.S. trade partners. Senior lawmakers from Trump’s Republican Party urged Trump to reconsider imposing the tariffs.

The outcry against Trump’s plan raised speculation whether it will be implemented at all.

“People are waiting to see how things play out. There are still a lot of uncertainties,” said Chuck Tomes, senior trader at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.

The greenback JPY= strengthened 0.44 percent at 106.21 yen. It hit a 16-month low of 105.23 yen on Friday."
Japan venture aims to build 80 hydrogen fuelling stations by 2022,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-hydrogen/japan-venture-aims-to-build-80-hydrogen-fuelling-stations-by-2022-idUSKBN1GH072,"TOKYO (Reuters) - An alliance of 11 Japanese firms, including automakers and energy firms, has pledged to build 80 fuelling stations for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2022 to help accelerate take-up of the next-generation fuel technology.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

Japan H2 Mobility LLC, whose backers include Toyota Motor Corp and JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, said on Monday it would oversee the construction and operation of the new fuelling stations, nearly doubling the number at present.

As countries seek low emissions energy sources to power vehicles, homes and industry, Japan is betting heavily on becoming a “hydrogen society” despite the high costs and technical difficulties of a process that creates electricity from a chemical reaction of fuel and oxygen.

JXTG Nippon Oil Senior Vice President Yutaka Kuwahara said on Monday that a lack of users and high costs to build and operate fuelling stations had slowed construction in Japan, delaying a government target to build 100 stations by March 2016.

Japan currently has about 90 stations, with at least 40 operated by JXTG Nippon Oil, and another 10 are in the planning or construction stage.

“We must lower costs, which will remove many of the bottlenecks to developing more stations,” he told reporters at a briefing.

By about 2020, the Japanese government aims to roughly halve the cost of building a hydrogen fuelling station, which is currently about 400 million yen to 500 million yen ($3.8 million-$4.7 million), well above 100 million yen for a gasoline station.

The path to adopting hydrogen has been dogged by the difficulty in driving widespread take-up given high costs of fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), limited production capabilities and low numbers of fuelling stations.

Only a handful of automakers currently market FCVs, including Toyota, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co. Toyota has sold only 5,300 units of its Mirai FCV since its launch in 2015, while it has sold a total of around 11.5 million gasoline hybrids since launching the Prius 20 years ago.

Japan wants to have 160 hydrogen stations and 40,000 FCVs on the country’s roads by March 2021. By 2030, it aims to have 900 stations to service some 800,000 FCVs, buses and forklifts.

By then, it expects the price of hydrogen to fall to around 30 yen per normal cubic meter, from up to 100 yen now.

Other companies involved in Japan H2 Mobility include Honda, Nissan Motor, Idemitsu Kosan, Iwatani Corp, Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas, Air Liquide Japan Ltd, Toyota Tsusho."

"Conservationists who have uncovered a growing illegal trade in jaguar fangs in South America are linking it to Chinese construction projects that could be threatening wildlife globally...key stimulants of illicit trade in the skins, bones and horns of endangered animals.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/04/jaguars-killed-for--fangs-chinese-medicine-trade,"Conservationists who have uncovered a growing illegal trade in jaguar fangs in South America are linking it to Chinese construction projects that could be threatening wildlife globally.

Experts say major Chinese power plant, road and rail works in developing nations are key stimulants of illicit trade in the skins, bones and horns of endangered animals.

Local people find out that Chinese construction workers have an interest in buying animal bones, horns and body parts for their supposed medical properties and an illicit trade is established. “Essentially, these projects act like giant vacuum cleaners of wildlife that suck everything back to China,” a conservation researcher, Vincent Nijman, of Oxford Brookes University, said last week. “It is a real worry.”

Should we give up half of the Earth to wildlife? Read more

The problem in South America is of particular concern. More than 100 jaguars – a species whose numbers are dwindling – may have been killed in less than a year to supply a trade in their body parts with China. As tiger parts – which are prized by practitioners of Chinese traditional medicine – are becoming scarcer, so a market is opening up for organs from other big cats, including the jaguar.

Two examples of jaguar deaths are given in the current issue of Nature. It reports that on Boxing Day last year, the body of a jaguar was found floating in a drainage canal in Belize in central America.

“Its body was mostly intact, but the head was missing its fangs,” says the report. “Then, on 10 January, a second cat – this time an ocelot that may have been mistaken for a young jaguar – turned up headless in the same channel.”

The extent of the trade was also highlighted by Thaís Morcatty, a wildlife researcher based at Oxford Brookes University who has worked in South America. “Last year, there were more than 50 seizures of packages that contained jaguar parts in Brazil. Most of them appear to have been destined for Asia and China in particular. It is also worth noting there are major Chinese communities in Brazil,” she added.

Jaguars once roamed across much of the southern US, central America and South America. Today their numbers have been drastically reduced because of deforestation and by farmers shooting animals that attack their livestock. The prospect of them being used to supplement Chinese traditional medicine now threatens to reduce their numbers even further.

However, it is the global threat posed by this sort of trade that worries conservationists. For years, Chinese companies have been setting up vast construction project deals with more than 60 countries to construct ports, power stations, rail lines, roads, tunnels and bridges in the developing world. Examples include a $5.8bn power planet in Nigeria, an 835-mile-long railway in Angola and a six-lane, 680-metre-long bridge in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

“These projects are manned by Chinese workers and they go back and forth with local people and also send things back to their families in China,” said Nijman. “Among the things they send back are illicit bones, horns and skin valued by traditional medicine. There is not much sign of them using restraint. At the end of the day, almost anything that can be killed and traded will be.”"
A former Harris County prosecutor withheld a key email that helped establish a clear alibi for Alfred Dewayne Brown in the high-profile murder case that eventually sent him to death row,https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/DA-Former-prosecutor-lied-about-exculpatory-12724038.php,"A former Harris County prosecutor withheld a key email that helped establish a clear alibi for Alfred Dewayne Brown in the high-profile murder case that eventually sent him to death row, District Attorney Kim Ogg said late Friday.

Brown, now 36, spent nearly 10 years awaiting execution before his case was dismissed and he was freed in 2015. He later sued Harris County, the DA's office, the prosecutor and police officer who handled the murder case, among others.

The explosive revelation raises new questions about Brown's wrongful conviction and the conduct of Dan Rizzo, the prosecutor who put him on death row.

Brown's legal team exulted at the new information.

""Vindication,"" tweeted Brian Stolarz, who represented Brown in the appeal of his criminal case.

""Only now, after a civil lawsuit, does the whole truth finally come out,"" he added in a statement. ""I am sickened and disheartened, but encouraged that Dewayne is vindicated and his long journey to justice is near the end.""

FALKENBERG: Wheels of justice grind slowly on death row

Attorney Cate Edwards, who is representing Brown in the civil case, called the revelations proof of ""horrifying"" abuse of power.

Ogg said in a statement that the State Bar of Texas will be notified of the new evidence so officials there can investigate Rizzo, who has since retired.

In a series of columns for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2015, Houston Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg illuminated how the grand jury foreman — a Houston policeman — had intimidated Brown's girlfriend.

Brown was convicted in October 2005 in a brazen slaying of Houston Police Officer Charles L. Clark and store clerk Alfredia Jones — who had just returned from maternity leave — during a robbery at a check-cashing store in southeast Houston.

Two others were convicted in the case, and one of them - Elijah Dwayne Joubert - was sent to death row for Jones' slaying.

GRAND JURY QUESTIONS: A disturbing glimpse into the shrouded world of the Texas grand jury system

Brown, however, always said he was innocent, that he had been at his girlfriend's apartment at the time of the murders.

The proof, he said, was a phone call he'd made to his girlfriend at work that morning. For years, officials claimed they had no record of the call.

Brown's conviction was overturned by an appeals court in 2014 after investigator Breck McDaniel discovered phone records in his garage that corroborated Brown's alibi. At the time, the district attorney's office said the phone document must have been inadvertently misplaced.

The newly released communication, however, shows that McDaniel informed Rizzo about the phone records the day after Brown's girlfriend testified before a grand jury that he had called her from her apartment.

""I was hoping that it would clearly refute Erica's claim that she received a call at work,"" McDaniel wrote, later continuing: ""But, it looks like the call detail records from the apartment shows that the home phone dialed Erica's place of employment on Hartwick Street at about 8:30 a.m. and again at 10:08 a.m.""

COLUMN: Mother of 3 pressured into changing story, but jailed anyway

The previously undisclosed information came to light as part of evidence in Brown's lawsuit against the DA's office.

""At the time Brown's conviction was challenged, the prosecution and defense agreed the failure to disclose the phone records was 'inadvertent,'"" the DA's office wrote in a news release that included a copy of the email. ""The new evidence suggests, however, that well before Brown's trial, Rizzo was informed about the existence of the records, yet failed to disclose or provide them to the defense counsel or the jury.""

Failure to provide such information to the defense is a ""Brady violation,"" named for a law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court that stands for the principle that all suspects are entitled to know potentially exculpatory information.

Rizzo did not return two calls seeking comment. Attorneys from the Harris County Attorney's Office, the other defendant in the suit, declined to comment.

RELATED: Anthony Graves helps open a painful door to the past, and perhaps the truth

The new developments come even as Brown and his attorneys continue their courtroom fight for compensation for the years he spent in prison.

On June 8, 2015, then-District Attorney Devon Anderson dismissed the case, saying there is not enough evidence to convict Brown of the crime, and he was freed.

State officials, however, rejected Brown's request for nearly $2 million in compensation on the grounds that he did not meet the eligibility requirement under Texas law because was never found to be ""actually innocent.""

Anderson's statement that he wasn't innocent became the sticking point in his attempt to get compensation from the state.

Brown, who now lives out of state, sued prosecutors and police in federal court in June, accusing them of concealing and fabricating evidence and violating constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.

Falkenberg: Alfred Dewayne Brown still on long, slow road to justice

His lawyers said the lawsuit was aimed at setting the record straight. They have asked Ogg to formally declare Brown ""actually innocent"" so he is eligible for state compensation.

Neal Manne, the Houston attorney who represented Brown in his efforts to get statutory compensation, said the newly released email is a step in the right direction.

""Since the day she took office, we have been urging the district attorney to acknowledge that Mr. Brown is 'actually innocent,'"" he said. ""The latest evidence of the county's intentional violation of Mr. Brown's constitutional rights offers the district attorney yet another opportunity to do so. Justice demands it, and common decency demands it.""

Cases like this have long presented a challenge for prosecutors, according to Daniel Medwed, a Northeastern University professor of law and criminal justice.

""There's a general concept that prosecutors should serve as ministers of justice and that their guiding light should be a goal for justice instead of convictions,"" he said. ""The problem is a lot of the incentives in prosecutors' offices are aligned around securing convictions and maintaining convictions.""

But it's less clear what needs to happen after a conviction is reversed, he said.

""If you take a step back and you don't think about the machinations of the law and you don't think about the different roles, it would seem as though there's a strong moral responsibility to help this man achieve some compensation for what he's suffered,"" Medwed said.

Sandra Guerra Thompson, criminal law professor and director of the Criminal Justice Institute at the University of Houston Law Center, said the new revelations raised serious questions.

""The case has to be examined and (Rizzo) deserves a chance to defend himself,"" Thompson said. ""But if it was an intentional decision — knowing that someone had a clear alibi, and was not guilty — it's a disturbing kind of violation that has led to the most serious punishment for a lawyer, which is disbarment, and even ... a jail sentence.""

'This is all stolen': Canadian man offers to share his land with First Nations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/02/canada-first-nations-man-offers-land-rent-free-facebook,"Joel Holmberg was appalled by vitriol against indigenous people. So he invited them to live on his property, rent-free

'This is all stolen': Canadian man offers to share his land with First Nations

Joel Holmberg had been batting the idea around for years. But the final decision came last month, as he scrolled through the online vitriol that erupted after a white farmer was acquitted of killing a young Cree man in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.

Holmberg turned to social media, but instead of joining in the often-vicious debate surrounding that case, he offered to share his family’s five-acre property in northern Alberta with a First Nations family. There would be no bills, no rent, he explained.

Instead the family could join him, his wife and two children in living off the land; hunting, fishing and growing food.

“I wanted to offer some sort of hope,” said Holmberg. “It was really disgusting to see the way the racist people were speaking. I wanted to let them know that it’s not everyone in Canada that feels that way.”

The invitation to share his acreage near Barrhead, about 100km north-west of Edmonton, seemed like a fair one.

“We all know in our heart the truth, that this is all stolen land,” said the 45-year-old. “They’re our hosts and we’re their guests and they’ve been criminally abused for far too long and it has to stop.”

Holmberg said his appreciation for First Nations culture began as a child growing up in British Columbia, when members of the Sinixt First Nation began bringing him along as they hunted and fished. “I had the opportunity to do sweats with them and learn about their culture from them and learn about the real history of Canada,” he said.

He continued to delve into Canada’s rich tapestry of indigenous cultures as he moved around the country, from the Northwest Territories to Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

“They’re the kindest people I’ve ever met. They’ve been there for me in the worst times in my life when I needed help the most,” he said. “It is very clear to my family and I, that it is us that will be blessed by this thing happening most of all.”

Since posting the offer earlier this week, Holmberg said he had received hundreds of responses from across Canada and the US.

“I haven’t made it through all the messages yet … Somehow it turns out I’m the first white person to think about giving the land back since Marlon Brando,” he said, laughing as he referred to the late actor’s decision to hand over 40 acres of land in California to the Survival of American Indians Association in 1974.

He said he had yet to hear any negative reactions to his post. But communities across Canada – from Sikh and Muslim groups to Chinese-Canadians – have expressed interest in helping out.

Indigenous elders have contacted him about holding ceremonies on the land while others have inquired about buying the farmland surrounding his property so that his project could expand.

Holmberg said he had invited all of them to visit the property, although he said his wife – while still excited about the idea – was starting to feel a little overwhelmed. “It’s starting to look like it could be Woodstock around here this summer,” he laughed.

In the coming weeks, Holmberg is hoping to meet interested families and tour them around the property.

“It’s a really special place here where we are, there’s a lot of wildlife coming to visit here,” he said. “It’s just really beautiful and I think that a traditional family would really feel that kind of magic that’s in the land here.”"
Villagers in northeastern India are threatening to disrupt the inauguration of a mega dam that has uprooted them from their traditional lands. Resistance to the dam is seen as part of a growing movement across the country against large infrastructure projects.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-landrights-protests/protests-planned-against-opening-of-mega-dam-in-northeastern-india-idUSKCN1GE0X5,"BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Villagers in northeastern India are threatening to disrupt the inauguration of a mega dam that has uprooted them from their traditional lands, campaigners said on Friday.

Resistance to the dam is seen as part of a growing movement across the country against large infrastructure projects, which activists say do not benefit the very people forced to give up their land.

Officials said the Mapithel dam in Manipur State is due to be opened on March 15 - nearly 30 years since construction began - and that it will vastly increase access to drinking water, irrigation and electricity.

But those benefits “won’t even go to the affected communities who sacrificed their land, river, forest and resources,” said activist Jajo Themson.

More protests are planned, he said, adding that previous demonstrations were put down with violence in a state where armed forces have special privileges to tackle a long-running insurgency.

Pritam Singh, chief engineer of Manipur’s Irrigation and Flood Control Department, denied the use of force against lawful protests.

All necessary permissions for the dam were obtained, and adequate compensation was given to those affected, said Singh.

“Some people did not take the compensation, but that is a different matter. Rehabilitation of five of the six affected villages has been completed,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Almost 2,000 hectares of land, of which a third is forest, have been flooded, said Jiten Yumnam of the Center for Research and Advocacy Manipur, an indigenous rights organization.

About 8,000 people in half a dozen villages are directly affected, with buildings and fields inundated by rising waters, he said.

As the Thoubal River dried up, thousands more lost their livelihoods, including fishing and collecting and selling sandstone that used to be washed downstream, according to Yumnam.

The dam has an annual irrigation potential of about 33,000 hectares, and will increase the drinking water supply to the state capital Imphal and surrounding areas by more than 45 million litres a day, according to a government audit.

The project will generate 7.5 megawatts for rural electrification.

Yumnam said authorities did not assess the dam’s impact on the environment and residents, who he said were not consulted.

“We should not proceed with this until we can be sure of its impact,” he said.

He added that a petition against the dam is still pending before the National Green Tribunal, a government body that deals with conservation cases.

Of nearly 600 ongoing conflicts over land affecting nearly eight million people in India, more than a fifth relate to infrastructure projects, according to Land Conflict Watch, an Indian research organization.

At least a dozen conflicts relate to hydroelectric dam projects, its data showed."
"Deporting offending New Zealanders ???fair and just???, Turnbull says | Australia news",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/02/deporting-offending-new-zealanders-fair-and-just-turnbull-says,"The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has defended as “fair and just” and “moral” the policy of deporting New Zealanders who have committed crimes – even those who have never set foot in New Zealand or have Australian families.

Australia’s hardline policy of deporting non-citizens who have committed crimes that attract a jail sentence of one year or more has raised fierce political and public opposition in New Zealand, particularly around the deportation of people with no connection to that country.

Australia has forcibly deported 1,023 people to New Zealand in the last two years, and 44% of them have reoffended in that country, according to New Zealand’s police commissioner, Mike Bush.

The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has consistently argued that Australia should deport only those with genuine links to New Zealand.

Australian citizens wrongfully detained because of immigration failures, report finds Read more

Some of those who have been deported have had extensive criminal histories in Australia but no link to New Zealand beyond citizenship. Some have been issued with deportation orders despite having no family connections or friends in that country, or anywhere to go.

Alex Viane, 40, was born in American Samoa and became a New Zealand citizen as a child, but has never once entered the country, nor does he know anyone there. He has an Australian partner and children, and is being held in Villawood detention centre before an ordered deportation.

Jacob Symons, now in his 30s, left New Zealand as a one-year-old infant, but never gained Australian citizenship. He earned more than 200 criminal convictions in Australia and has been ordered for deportation. He has a brain injury and his abusive childhood was noted by the administrative appeals tribunal when it ordered his removal from Australia.

The issue of forcible deportations of New Zealand citizens was discussed by Turnbull and Ardern when they met in Sydney on Friday.

Turnbull said Australia’s policy would not change.

“The process is a fair and just one,” he said.

Asked specifically whether it was moral to deport people whose connections to Australia were far more significant than New Zealand, Turnbull said: “the answer to your question is yes”.

He said there was an appeals process open to those who were deported, and that 40% of the deportations appealed against had been successful so far. But he said the operation of the law would not change.

“It is our fundamental right and … we enforce our laws to assert our sovereignty and ensure that people were not Australian citizens, who commit serious offences, are deported. It does not just apply to New Zealanders. It applies to all non-citizens.”

Ardern told reporters she had raised the issue again with Turnbull, but that New Zealand was powerless to prevent the deportations.

Turnbull government scrambles after temporarily losing vote on New Zealand refugee offer Read more

“I’ve raised again, as we have on previous occasions, elements of the deportation policy that have in particular been brought to our attention. We … are wanting to make the Australian government clear in our perspective … but it is in the hands of the Australian government to determine how they manage that element of policy.”

The two prime ministers discussed trade links, in particular the Trans-Pacific Partnership 11 (minus the United States), as well as co-operation in Iraq, and shared intelligence on cybersecurity.

New Zealand’s offer to resettle 150 refugees each year from Australia’s offshore processing regime remains on the table, but Turnbull again said Australia would not consider it until the US resettlement deal was completed.

The two leaders sought to emphasise the close relationship between the countries although significant policy differences remain.

For generations, New Zealand has been an outspoken campaigner for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. It has signed the UN’s nuclear weapons ban treaty enacted last year, and Ardern said her country would campaign for others to join the treaty to expedite its ratification into law.

The Australian government refuses to countenance the treaty, saying Australia relies on the extended deterrence of the US nuclear umbrella.

“In terms of the ... prohibition treaty, the weakness of it from our perspective is that the nuclear powers are not a party to it. We work internationally to prevent proliferation,” it has said.

“Everyone would like to aspire to a world which is free of nuclear weapons but we have to focus in the here and now, that is our perspective, in a very clear-eyed and pragmatic way in preventing proliferation, whether it’s the Korean peninsular or elsewhere. And in doing so, we have to work very closely with the existing nuclear powers including the United States.”

Both Australia and New Zealand are US allies, enjoined by the Anzus treaty and members of the Five Eyes security alliance. However, New Zealand does not assist with the US’s global nuclear regime (as Australia does) and has denied US ships carrying, or refusing to declare whether they are carrying, nuclear weapons access to NZ ports or waters.

“It will be of no surprise to any Australian and New Zealand has long taken a very firm stance on both nuclear proliferation and the existence of nuclear weapons generally,” Ardern said.

“It’s become part of our identity as a nation. Almost to the point of it probably doesn’t require restatement when we are on Australian shores. They understand our long-standing position in that regard.”"

"Nurse faces 60 years in murder, dismemberment of college student",https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Nurse-faces-60-years-in-murder-dismemberment-of-12720774.php,"BRIDGEPORT — A local nurse faces up to 60 years in prison when he is sentenced Friday for killing a college student and dismembering her body.

Jermaine Richards was found guilty of murder after two previous Superior Court juries deadlocked on whether he killed 20-year-old Alyssiah Marie Wiley of West Haven some time after April 19, 2013.

Richards is scheduled to be sentenced before Judge Earl Richards.

Wiley, a sophomore at Eastern Connecticut State University, disappeared after leaving the Willimantic campus in Richards’ car. Twenty-seven days later — after a statewide search and appeals by her mother on television — Wiley’s partial remains were found in a wooded area at the end of Quarry Road in Trumbull, a mile and a half from Richards’ Bridgeport home.

Richards, a private-duty nurse from Bridgeport, had been dating Wiley since she had been in high school. But there was no physical evidence in the case — no blood residue or anything to show where or when Wiley was killed, no eyewitnesses and certainly no confession. Richards did not testify during the trial.

Instead, the state rested its case on the claim that Richards had the motive and the opportunity to kill Wiley.

“All the evidence points to Jermaine,” argued Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Ann Lawlor.

Wiley’s family and friends testified Richards was jealous and possessive.

Her sister, Chaharrez Landell, testified that a month before Wiley’s disappearance, Wiley had called her, panicked.

“He put me in a headlock and threw me on the bed and I couldn’t breathe,” Landell said her sister told her.

When Landell picked her sister up at the Norwalk home where Richards was working as a nurse, she said, Wiley was crying and said she wanted to break up with Richards but didn’t know how.

Prosecutors Lawlor and Joseph Corradino presented a newly acquired photograph of Wiley sitting in a domestic violence seminar.

Jevene Wright, a high school classmate of Richards’, testified that Richards told him he was upset because he believed Wiley was ‘messing around,’ with an old friend.

“She doesn’t know who she is messing with,” Wright recalled Richards telling him. “I’m a nurse and I know how to get rid of her.’’"
Samsung S9 Beats Apple iPhone X in Display,https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/01/samsung-galaxy-s9-best-smartphone-display/,"The OLED display on the Samsung Galaxy S9 is the best smartphone display on the market, according to lab analysis by DisplayMate. The screen on Samsung's latest handset showed consistent Top Tier display performance and became the first display to receive All Green ratings in all of DisplayMate's lab test and measurement categories.

Based on our extensive Lab Tests and Measurements, the Galaxy S9 has an Impressive Display that establishes many new Display Performance Records, earning DisplayMate’s Best Performing Smartphone Display Award, and receiving our highest ever A+ grade.

Last year, DisplayMate praised the iPhone X as having the ""best performing smartphone display"" on a smartphone. It also congratulated Samsung – Apple's iPhone X screen supplier – for developing and manufacturing the ""outstanding"" OLED panel, but said that it was actually the Apple-developed ""Precision Display Calibration"" that made the biggest difference, since it transformed the OLED hardware ""into a superbly accurate, high performance, and gorgeous display"".

However, the Galaxy S9 has now knocked iPhone X off the top spot in DisplayMate's rankings, matching or setting new smartphone display records in several categories including highest absolute color accuracy, highest peak display brightness, largest native color gamut, highest contrast ratio, and lowest screen reflectance. Yet despite all that, the 3K 2960x1440 panel in the S9 is said to have the same power efficiency as the one found on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8.

DisplayMate found that the color accuracy of the Galaxy S9's 5.8-inch display is ""visually indistinguishable from perfect"", thanks to a record-setting high absolute color accuracy of 0.7 JNCD, which is ""almost certainly better than your existing smartphone, living room 4K Ultra or HDTV, Tablet, Laptop, and computer monitor"". The 2,960 x 1,440 display, with 570 pixels per inch, also set a new reflectance score record with a 4.4 percent reflectance level, which measures display readability in bright conditions.

DisplayMate concluded by emphasizing the ""tremendous performance advantages"" that OLED displays now have over LCDs, which it said secured OLED as ""the definitive premier display technology for Top Tier Smartphones in the foreseeable future over the next 3-5 years"". Out of the three new iPhones Apple is rumored to be introducing later this year, two are said to be OLED models measuring in at 5.8 and 6.5 inches, and one is a 6.1-inch lower-cost LCD model. All three are expected to feature Face ID and edge-to-edge displays.

According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the 5.8-inch model will have a display with 458 pixels per inch, indicating the same 1,125 x 2,436 resolution of iPhone X, while the larger ""Plus size"" 6.5-inch model will offer 480 to 500 pixels per inch. Bloomberg has said the larger model will feature a screen resolution of 1,242 x 2,688, which would put it closer to the pixel density of the 5.8-inch display.

Apple is reportedly sourcing the majority of its OLED displays for the 2018 iPhone lineup from Samsung, but LG Display could provide displays for the 6.5-inch OLED iPhone, and Apple could also tap Sharp and Japan Display for extra supply."

"Blessing of AR-15-bearing, crowned couples expected to draw 600 to Pa.",http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/02/blessing_of_ar-15-bearing_crow.html,"A northeastern Pennsylvania church says it expects about 300 couples bearing semiautomatic rifles and wearing crowns to attend a blessing next week.

The weapon of choice is the AR-15 for followers of the World Peace and Unification Sanctuary in Newfoundland, Wayne County, just south of Lake Wallenpaupack.

That's the same firearm used in a series of mass shootings across the United States over the past few years, most recently the Feb. 14 massacre that left 17 dead at a high school in Florida.

To the sanctuary's followers, it is the ""rod of iron"" from the New Testament's Book of Revelation. The AR-15 ""will be used to protect God's sovereignty as a defensive means,"" Tim Elder, director of world missions, told lehighvalleylive.com.

""We believe that we are living in the last days, that is to say the last days of Satan's dominion, and the beginning of a new history of God's sovereignty and goodness in the world,"" he said Friday.

The Unification Sanctuary's leader, the Rev. Sean Moon, is the son of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, a self-proclaimed messiah who founded the Unification Church, which is often described as a cult.

The Pennsylvania offshoot is a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment. Unification Sanctuary operates a group called Rod of Iron Ministries, which is hosting a ""President Trump Thank You Dinner"" on Saturday -- a fundraiser for Gun Owners of America.

The Rev. Sean Moon's brother founded Kahr Arms, a gun manufacturer.

A first of its kind for the church's followers bearing the ""rod of iron,"" the blessing is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday. It will be broadcast live over the church's YouTube channel for followers who are unable to make the trip.

""We're expecting about 600 people here, about 300 couples,"" Elder said.

He's heard from a couple driving up from Florida, and the church expects more than 170 participants from South Korea, about 100 from Japan and others from Europe.

The rifles must be unloaded and will be secured with zip ties through the ejection port so they are inoperable, Elder said.

""Blessed couples are requested to bring the accouterments of the nation of Cheon Il Guk, crowns representing the sovereignty of Kings and Queens, and a 'rod of iron,' designated by the Second King as an AR15 semiautomatic rifle or equivalents such as an AK semiautomatic rifle, representing both the intent and the ability to defend one's family, community and nation of Cheon Il Guk,"" the church says on its website.

It continues to say those unable to purchase and legally transport a rifle to the blessing are asked to purchase and bring a $700 gift certificate from a gun store -- ""as evidence of their intent to purchase a 'rod of iron' in the future.""

""AR-15 is the recommended rifle,"" Elder said. ""In some countries where American rifles are difficult to obtain such as in Eastern Europe or Russia, it is acceptable to participate with an AK.""

The church is down the road from Wallenpaupack South Elementary School, and some parents expressed alarm at the planned ceremony.

""It's something I would consider keeping my child home. It's scary,"" parent Liz Zoccola told WNEP-TV.

""I wish they wouldn't have it at all. I don't think there's a good time to have it, especially this close,"" Kendra Hanor, another parent, told the station.

State police are aware of the event but do not plan to send any troopers to it, since the church is breaking no law, Trooper Mark Keyes said Tuesday.

Wednesday's blessing has been planned for four months, but following last week's school shooting and media coverage of the event, the church has gotten some backlash, Elder said.

""We're getting a number of emails, that's true,"" he said. ""I guess we have had a few phone calls, but we're very busy preparing this. And this is something that is very important to us. And we're making sure that everything is legal and safe.""

Here's a nugget that won't make the welcome pamphlet: California has the worst quality of life in America.

At least that's what U.S. News & World Report's most-recent Best States rankings say. The Golden State ranked 50th in quality of life by fairing poorly in the natural and social environment categories.

The report, released Tuesday, ranks states based on a healthy environment and a sense of community. It takes into account each state's urban air quality, pollution and voter participation, among other measures.

California ranked last in urban air quality and 45th in ""low pollution health risk,"" although it was 13th in drinking water quality. The state also found itself second-to-last in voter participation, 44th in community engagement and 38th in social support.

Despite its beaches, redwood trees and Hollywood glam, the state's blemishes are often highlighted. Los Angeles consistently leads as the world's most traffic-congested urban area and even its own citizens have tried to secede multiple times.

Studying such real-world evidence offers manufacturers a powerful tool to prove the value of their drugs - something Roche ROG.S aims to leverage, for example, with last month's $2 billion purchase of Flatiron Health.

Real-world evidence involves collecting data outside traditional randomized clinical trials, the current gold standard for judging medicines, and interest in the field is ballooning.

Half of the world’s 1,800 clinical studies involving real-world or real-life data since 2006 have been started in the last three years, with a record 300 last year, according to a Reuters analysis of the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s clinicaltrials.gov website.

Hot areas for such studies include cancer, heart disease and respiratory disorders.

Historically, it has been hard to get a handle on how drugs work in routine clinical practice but the rise of electronic medical records, databases of insurance claims, fitness wearables and even social media now offers a wealth of new data.

The ability to capture the experience of real-world patients, who represent a wider sample of society than the relatively narrow selection enrolled into traditional trials, is increasingly useful as medicine becomes more personalized.

However it also opens a new front in the debate about corporate access to personal data at a time when tech giants Apple AAPL.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL.O are seeking to carve out a healthcare niche.

Some campaigners and academics worry such data will be used primarily as a commercial tool by drugmakers and may intrude upon patients’ privacy.

DRUGMAKERS DELVE

Learning from the experience of millions of patients provides granularity and is especially important in a disease like cancer, where doctors want to know if there is a greater benefit from using a certain drug in patients with highly specific tumor characteristics.

In the case of the Flatiron deal, Roche is acquiring a firm working with 265 U.S. community cancer clinics and six major academic research centers, making it a leading curator of oncology evidence. Roche, which already owns 12.6 percent of Flatiron, will pay $1.9 billion for the rest.

But interest in such real-world data goes far beyond cancer.

All the world’s major drug companies now have departments focused on the use of real-world data across multiple diseases and several have completed scientific studies using the information to delve into key areas addressed by their drugs.

They include diabetes studies by AstraZeneca AZN.L and Sanofi SASY.PA, joint research by Pfizer PFE.N and Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY.N into stroke prevention, and a Takeda Pharmaceutical 4502.T project in bowel disease.

“It’s getting more expensive to do traditional clinical trial research, so industry is looking at ways it can achieve similar goals using routinely collected data,” said Paul Taylor, a health informatics expert at University College London.

“The thing that has made all this possible is the increasing digitization of health records.”

Significantly, the world’s regulators are taking notice.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb - the gatekeeper to the world’s biggest pharmaceutical market - believes more widespread use of real-world evidence (RWE) could cut drug development costs and help doctors make better medical choices.

Under the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has been directed to evaluate the expanded use of RWE. “As the breadth and reliability of RWE increases, so do opportunities for FDA to also make use of this information,” Gottlieb said in a speech last September.

The European Medicines Agency, too, is studying ways to use RWE in its decision making.

WHOSE DATA IS IT ANYWAY?

But the growth of real-world evidence also raises questions about data access and patient privacy, as Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) - a uniquely comprehensive source of healthcare data - has found to its cost.

An ambitious scheme to pool anonymized NHS patient data for both academic and commercial use had to be scrapped in 2016 after protests from both patients and doctors.

And last year a British hospital trust was rapped by the Information Commissioner’s Office for misusing data, after it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients to artificial-intelligence firm Google DeepMind.

Sam Smith, a campaigner for medical data privacy at Britain’s MedConfidential, is concerned drugmakers’ RWE studies are just a cover for marketing. “How much of this is really for scientific discovery and how much is it about boosting profits by getting one product used instead of another?”

Some academics also worry RWE studies could be susceptible to “data dredging”, where multiple analyses are conducted until one gives the hoped-for result.

AstraZeneca’s head of innovative medicines Mene Pangalos, whose company has struck several deals with tech start-ups and patient groups to gather real-world data, acknowledges ensuring privacy and scientific rigor is a challenge.

“It’s a real problem but I don’t think it’s insurmountable,” he told Reuters.

“As people get more comfortable with real-world evidence studies I think it will be much more widely used. I would like to see a world where real-world data can be used to help change drug labels and be used much more aggressively than it is today.”

NEXT FRONTIER

Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan believes data is the next frontier for drugmakers and he is betting that the Swiss group’s leadership in both cancer medicine and diagnostics will put it in pole position.

“There’s an opportunity for us to have a strategic advantage by bringing together diagnostics and pharma with data management. This triangle is almost impossible for anybody else to copy,” he said in a December interview.

Still, even Roche cannot work alone in this new world.

“You can have a big debate about whose data it is - the patient’s, the government’s, the insurer’s - but one thing for sure is the pharmaceutical company does not own it. So there’s no choice but to do partnerships,” Schwan said.

With Apple's latest iPhone update including a new feature allowing users to view their medical records, Amazon teaming with Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N and JPMorgan Chase JPM.N on a new healthcare company, and numerous start-ups flooding in, the partnering opportunities are plentiful.

“You are going to see more deals,” said Susan Garfield, a partner in EY’s life sciences advisory practice. “Data already has tremendous value and it is going to have increasing value in future. The question is who is going to own and capture it.”"
Star is confirmed single and ready to test Einstein's theory.,http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/02/star-is-confirmed-single-and-ready-to-test-einsteins-theory,"At the center of the Milky Way galaxy, some 26,000 light-years away, lies a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*. With a mass of roughly 4 million Suns, this colossal cosmic object is a gravitational heavyweight. When something, such as a star, passes by the black hole's outer rim, its enormous gravitational pull accelerates the star to speeds of up to 18.5 million miles (30 million kilometers) per hour – or about three percent the speed of light. The short list of high-velocity stars that make such close approaches to Sagittarius A* are known as S-stars One such S-star is named Source 2 (also known as S0-2 or S2). After nearly 16 years of anticipation, astronomers are making their final preparations to observe S0-2 as its orbit brings it exceptionally close to Sagittarius A* in a few short months. Astronomers are so eager for this close approach because it will serve as yet another stringent test of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity. But, until last week, there was a slight sense of unease in the air as astronomers suspected S0-2 was a binary star system like many other S-stars. This would have complicated the upcoming test.Fortunately, in a study published February 6 in The Astrophysical Journal, a team of astronomers found that S0-2 does not have a significant binary companion that will obscure the precise measurements required to test Einstein’s theory. Based on their results, the team found that even if S0-2 does have a companion, its mass is too small to affect any tests planned for the star's closest approach to the black hole.“This is the first study to investigate S0-2 as a spectroscopic binary,” said lead author Devin Chu, an astronomy graduate student with UCLA’s Galactic Center Group, in a press release . “It’s incredibly rewarding. This study gives us confidence that a S0-2 binary system will not significantly affect our ability to measure gravitational redshift.”

UCLA Galactic Center Group

The phenomenon of gravitational redshift is an offshoot of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, which predicts that the force of gravity is a result of massive objects distorting the fabric of space-time (like a bowling ball distorts a trampoline). According to the theory, extremely massive objects deform the fabric so much that distances shrink or stretch, and time itself slows down.



When a star gets too close to a very massive object, like Sagittarius A*, the light from the star has to climb out of a “gravity well” in space-time. This takes energy from the photons of starlight, which stretches the light toward longer wavelengths. This causes it to appear more red – or gravitationally redshifted.



S0-2 is an important star for testing gravitational redshift because it makes the closest known approach to Sagittarius A*, reaching a distance of just 17 light-hours, or three times the distance between the Sun and Pluto. This means that S0-2 should feel a noticeable nudge in its orbit due the extreme gravitational forces it will experience during its closest pass by Sagittarius A* since its last (16 years ago). Although astronomers knew about S0-2 when it made its last close pass, at the time, they did not have instruments precise enough to definitively observe a gravitational redshift in its starlight. Now they do.



“It will be the first measurement of its kind,” said Tuan Do, co-author of the study and deputy director of the Galactic Center Group. “Gravity is the least well-tested of the forces of nature. Einstein’s theory has passed all other tests with flying colors so far, so if there are deviations measured, it would certainly raise lots of questions about the nature of gravity!”



With the question of whether S0-2 has a significant binary partner finally settled, the Galactic Center Group plans to gather more spectroscopic measurements for other S-stars orbiting Sagittarius A*. This will give them a larger dataset to compare with competing theories that attempt to explain why S0-2 is without a weighty companion (or possibly any companion at all). In the meantime, they have plans in place to observe S0-2’s long-anticipated close pass by Sagittarius A* later this year.



“We have been waiting 16 years for this,” said Chu. “We are anxious to see how the star will behave under the black hole’s violent pull. Will S0-2 follow Einstein’s theory? Or will the star defy our current laws of physics? We will soon find out!”"
BestBuy is closing all 250 of its mobile stores in the US,https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/1/17066232/bestbuy-close-all-mobile-stores-may-us,"Best Buy has announced it will shut all 250 of its small mobile stores across the US by May 31st. The stores reportedly contributed only a little over 1 percent to the company’s overall revenue. The closures won’t affect Best Buy’s mobile stores in Canada, and the company will continue to sell mobile phones both online and in its “big-box” stores.

Best Buy began opening the dedicated mobile phone outlets about 10 years ago, before the first iPhone was released. The mobile stores are tiny, averaging 1,400 square feet — compared to full-size stores, which average 40,000 square feet. Best Buy’s mobile shops are also competing with wireless carriers who have their own high street stores as well as Apple and online retailers like Amazon.

“The cost of operations in our mobile standalone stores is higher than in our big box stores.”

In an internal memo seen by Reuters, chief executive Hubert Joly told employees that margins at the stores had “compressed” and that “the cost of operations in our mobile standalone stores is higher than in our big box stores.” About 85 percent of Best Buy’s mobile shops are located within three miles of big-box stores, the memo noted.

Best Buy will reportedly help redeploy employees to other parts of the company over the next three months, but did not say how many would be affected. Those who leave after May 31st will receive severance packages, and Best Buy will help them with external job searches. This isn’t the first time a shift in the retail market has sparked a change in Best Buy’s strategy. Last month, the company announced it would stop selling CDs in stores as digital music revenue continues to grow."

Moon to get its first 4G network next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/moon-to-get-its-first-4g-network-next-year/articleshow/63119643.cms,"The moon is to get its first 4G mobile network next year — exactly half a century after Nasa astronaut Neil Armstrong first made his “giant leap for mankind”. Vodafone Germany and Nokia are teaming up to create the network, which will support the operations of rovers collecting scientific data and reporting back from the astral body’s surface. Vodafone said it had appointed Nokia as its technology partner to develop a space-grade network which will be a small piece of hardware weighing less than a bag of sugar.In what will be the first-ever commercial lunar landing, Berlin-based space exploration company PTScientists will launch ultra-light mobile masts from Nokia Bell Labs using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, taking off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, USA. Vodafone engineers will then build the energy-efficient network using Nokia’s hardware to enable Audi-made lunar quattro rovers to transmit data and highdefinition (HD) footage back to its base station on earth for monitoring. Vodafone hopes the network will be able to broadcast on the 1800 MHz frequency band to deliver the universe’s first HD livestream direct from the moon.“This is a crucial first step for sustainable exploration of the solar system. In order for humanity to leave the cradle of earth, we need to develop infrastructures beyond our home planet,” said Robert Bohme, CEO and founder of PTScientists.“With Mission to the Moon, we will establish and test the first elements of a dedicated communications network on the moon. The great thing about this longterm evolution solution is that it saves so much power, and the less energy we use sending data, the more we have to do science,” he said.“This project involves a radically innovative approach to the development of the mobile network infrastructure,” Vodafone Germany’s CEO Hannes Ametsreiter said.

World's first plastic-free aisle opens in Netherlands supermarket,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/28/worlds-first-plastic-free-aisle-opens-in-netherlands-supermarket,"Campaigners hail progress as Amsterdam store offers dedicated aisle of more than 700 products, with plans for a national roll-out

Shoppers in the Netherlands will get the chance to visit Europe’s first plastic-free supermarket aisle on Wednesday in what campaigners claim is a turning point in the war on plastic pollution.

The store in Amsterdam will open its doors at 11am when shoppers will be able to choose from more than 700 plastic-free products, all available in one aisle.

The move comes amid growing global concern about the damage plastic waste is having on oceans, habitats and food chains. Scientists warn plastic pollution is now so widespread it risks permanent contamination of the natural world.

Earlier this year, a Guardian investigation revealed that UK supermarkets were a major source of plastic waste, producing 1m tonnes a year. And for the past 12 months, campaigners have been calling for all supermarkets to offer a plastic-free aisle.

Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet, the group behind the campaign, said the opening represented “a landmark moment for the global fight against plastic pollution”.

“For decades shoppers have been sold the lie that we can’t live without plastic in food and drink. A plastic-free aisle dispels all that. Finally we can see a future where the public have a choice about whether to buy plastic or plastic-free. Right now we have no choice.”

The aisle will open in the Amsterdam branch of the Dutch supermarket chain Ekoplaza. The company says it will roll out similar aisles in all of its 74 branches by the end of the year.

Ekoplaza chief executive, Erik Does, has been working with the campaign for the past month and said the initiative was “an important stepping stone to a brighter future for food and drink”.

“We know that our customers are sick to death of products laden in layer after layer of thick plastic packaging. Plastic-free aisles are a really innovative way of testing the compostable biomaterials that offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to plastic packaging.”

The aisle will have more than 700 plastic-free products including meat, rice, sauces, dairy, chocolate, cereals, yogurt, snacks, fresh fruit and vegetables.

Campaigners say the products will not be anymore expensive than plastic-wrapped goods and will be “scalable and convenient”, using alternative biodegradable packing where necessary rather than ditching packaging altogether.

They add the aisles will be a “testbed for innovative new compostable bio-materials as well as traditional materials such as glass, metal and cardboard.”

Sutherland said: “There is absolutely no logic in wrapping something as fleeting as food in something as indestructible as plastic. Plastic food and drink packaging remains useful for a matter of days yet remains a destructive presence on the Earth for centuries afterwards.”

Campaigners say the grocery retail sector accounts for more than 40% of all plastic packaging. A recent Populus poll revealed that 91% of Britons back the introduction of plastic-free aisles.

The Guardian’s investigation into supermarkets’ plastic footprint found that leading UK stores create more than 800,000 tonnes of plastic packaging waste every year. However Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Waitrose, Asda and Lidl all refused to divulge their plastic output, with most saying the information was “commercially sensitive”.

Last month Theresa May highlighted the challenge of plastic pollution while setting out the government’s environment policies. The prime minister singled out the role of supermarkets, calling on them to introduce plastic-free aisles. But she was criticised for failing to back up her call with any concrete measures.



Sutherland said campaigners were in ongoing talks with all the major UK supermarkets but, so far, none have committed to introducing a plastic-free aisle.

She added: “Europe’s biggest supermarkets must follow Ekoplaza’s lead and introduce a plastic-free aisle at the earliest opportunity to help turn off the plastic tap.”

National Hurricane Center experimenting with 7-day hurricane forecasts,https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/23/national-hurricane-center-experimenting-7-day-tropical-cyclone-forecasts/367434002/,"National Hurricane Center experimenting with 7-day tropical cyclone forecasts

Rick Neale | Florida Today

Show Caption Hide Caption Watch it: Hurricane forecast model explanation Dr. Ryan Truchelut at WeatherTiger explains hurricane forecast models.

MELBOURNE — National Hurricane Center officials are experimenting with extended forecasts that may someday predict the paths of hurricanes a full week in advance, compared with today’s five-day forecasts.

""In 2018, for the first time, we’re going to be doing in-house forecasts out to seven days because the techniques have gotten good enough,"" Mark DeMaria, NHC branch chief, told a classroom of Florida Institute of Technology students and faculty Friday afternoon.

""It’s allowing us to go further into the future,"" DeMaria said.

Federal meteorologists started issuing 24-hour hurricane forecasts in 1954, two-day forecasts in 1961, and three-day forecasts in 1964. DeMaria said the NHC experimented with five-day forecasts in 2001, then began publicly releasing them in 2003 after a two-year trial period.

The experimental forecasts will add Day 6 and 7 hurricane tracks and maximum wind estimates. Rather than distributing this information to the public, DeMaria said officials will probably test seven-day forecasts for the next two years, then analyze the data and decide their fate.

""It’s way beyond the normal watch time frame for the general public. There are certain activities for long-range planning where it would be an advantage. FEMA might be staging resources. Or, certain areas that are especially hard to get ready for hurricanes — like the Florida Keys, which take a long time to evacuate,"" DeMaria said.

He said NOAA’s first Joint Polar Satellite System environmental satellite, which launched last November, will improve forecast accuracy. This low-orbit satellite's microwave sounders can measure atmospheric temperature and moisture through cloudtops.

The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June 1 through Nov. 30.

Friday, DeMaria delivered a technical presentation on the evolution of hurricane forecast models to students and faculty in Florida Tech's Olin Physical Sciences building. That evening, he gave a wide-ranging hurricane lecture at the Olin Engineering Building auditorium.

After polling the auditorium audience whether they evacuated for Hurricane Irma last September, DeMaria elicited laughs by joking that “three-quarters of the audience just saw a hurricane.”

He said the NHC's average track errors for tropical storms and hurricanes were fewer last year than during any previous Atlantic hurricane season. In fact, he said the five-day forecasts are about as accurate as the two-day forecasts were during the 1990s.

“We actually had record-accurate forecasts at every single time period, out to five days, in 2017. Part of it was due to the fact that the hurricanes were at low latitudes. They were a little easier to forecast. It’s also due to the fact that the models have gotten better,"" DeMaria said.

""This is really kind of an amazing achievement,"" he said.

However, DeMaria noted that Irma's forecast track bounced across Florida days before the monstrous storm struck.

""If you live here, you probably remember the forecast was kind of on the East Coast, it went over to the West Coast, it was at the East Coast, it was back to the West Coast. It was driving us crazy,"" he said.

The moon is getting a reliable 4G connection possibly next year,https://www.readersfusion.com/news/moon-mobile-network-tower-2019/,"Seems like the future has a lot in store for us. This begins with moon getting its own mobile network by 2019. Vodafone Germany and Nokia have come together with the plan of installing a 4G mobile network on moon. They are all set to install the tower by the year 2019. The tower will act as a support for the private lunar rover mission of the Berlin based team, Part Time Scientists popularly known as PTScientists. This was one of those groups which competed for Google Lunar X Prize, race towards the moon ending in March. Significantly, this race won’t have any winners.

Despite, the end of Google Lunar X Prize competition, PTScientists have yet not ended their “Mission to the Moon”. The objective of the group is to launch a lander and two small rovers for the moon from Cape Canaveral, Florida with the help of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to mark the 50 anniversary of “NASA’s Apollo 11 moon landing”.

Moon Mobile Network: Announcement

The announcement regarding the launching of 4G network on the moon was done by Vodafone Germany on February 27th, Tuesday. They also announced that their plan would be supporting PTScientists’ twin Audi Quattro rover and lander ALINA (Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module). The rover will be used by the team to research about the lunar rovers which were used by the Apollo 17 astronauts, when they were on their historic mission of December 1942, towards the Taurus-Littrow Valley of moon.

Moon Mobile Network: Partnership

Vodafone and Nokia have joined hands for this plan. Nokia was selected by Vodafone in order to make the “space-worthy verson of its Ultra Compact network”. It will one of the lightest, weighing just 2.2 lbs (1 kilogram). It was announced by Vodafone in a statement.

Moon Mobile Network: Statements by the companies

CEO of Vodafone Germany, Hannes Ametsreiter said in a statement, “This project involves a radically innovative approach to the development of mobile network infrastructure”. He further added, “It is also a great example of an independent, multi-skilled team achieving an objective of immense significance through their courage, pioneering spirit and inventiveness.”

As per the plan, ALINA will be using the 4G network to broadcast the first live HD video feed from the surface of the moon. According to the statement, the signal will be operated in 1800 MHz frequency band and “will broadcast to a global audience via a deep space link that interconnects with the PTScientists server in the Mission Control Centre in Berlin.”

Marcus Weldon, the chied technology officer of Nokia and president of Bell Labs said, “This important mission is supporting, among other things, the development of new space-grade technologies for future data networking, processing and storage, and will help advance the communications infrastructure required for academics, industry and educational institutions in conducting lunar research. These aims have potentially wide-ranging implications for many stakeholders and humanity as a whole, and we look forward to working closely with Vodafone and the other partners in the coming months, prior to the launch in 2019.”

4G Network on Moon

The CEO and founder of PTScientists Robert Bohme defined 4G network as a “crucial first step for sustainable exploration of the solar system”. The team explained that by using this 4G network, all the data of Quattro rovers will successfully beamed to ALINA without any depletion in the reserves of energy. It won’t even require the rovers to be in a still position while the data is being transmitted.

Bohme further added in the statement, “With Mission to the Moon, we will establish and test the first elements of a dedicated communications network on the moon. The great thing about this LTE solution is that it saves so much power, and the less energy we use sending data, the more we have to do science!”

Instead of 5G networks, 4G networks are being installed on the moon because the 5G network is still under trial and may not work properly on the surface of the moon."
Ford is setting up for an autonomous ride-hail and delivery business in Miami,https://www.recode.net/2018/2/27/17055792/ford-autonomous-ride-hail-delivery-business-driverless-autonomous-driving-miami-florida,"Ford is laying the groundwork for its autonomous vehicle business in Miami, Fla. It’s a three-pronged approach that is still in its infancy, but includes a delivery pilot in partnership with Dominos and Postmates, testing self-driving cars around the city and setting up a fleet-management center.

Many other companies in the self-driving space have begun testing both delivery and ride-hail services, but few have established dedicated fleet-management centers that will facilitate the maintenance and operation of these driverless vehicles. Determining how best to manage a fleet of driverless vehicles will figure largely in any company’s ability to launch and expand its service.

Without drivers, the company has to determine who or what will take on both the responsibility and the costs of maintaining these vehicles. There’s no longer an Uber driver in the front seat to take the car to get detailed on their own dime.

Sherif Marakby, Ford’s VP of autonomous vehicles and electrification, said the company has yet to decide whether it will operate this network of fleet-management centers on its own or partner with another company.

“We can do it in many different ways,” Marakby told Recode. “We’re going to be open to that, but for us to learn how it works and what the issues are, we needed to do it on our own for the first time.”

Other companies have opted to work with car-rental companies with an existing network of locations.

Alphabet’s self-driving arm, Waymo, for instance partnered with Avis — a deal that gives Waymo access to places to store their cars when they’re not in use, as well as a nationwide web of maintenance and repair shops. Apple, long rumored to be working on self-driving cars, struck a deal with Hertz. General Motors, on the other hand, operates its own car-sharing service called Maven that could serve the same purpose for its self-driving arm, Cruise.

This self-driving terminal, as Marakby referred to it, helps build a foundation upon which Ford can launch both its driverless ride-hail and delivery services by 2021. Marakby contends that this announcement indicates that Ford has launched its business in the city.

“We’re not announcing going to our first city,” he said. “We’re announcing that we are in the first city. We have a depot, we’re mapping the city and we’re operating a business.”

However, the other two prongs of its launch are largely foundational.

Like most other companies in the self-driving space, Ford will begin testing its self-driving cars on public roads. In Miami, however, the cars — powered by self-driving startup Argo.AI, in which Ford bought a majority stake — are still mostly mapping out the city’s streets for now. The company said they are also operating in a closed loop in autonomous mode.

Those cars will eventually be available in a commercial ride-hail network. The company recently partnered with Lyft and is currently working on creating the interface for the system and the API into the company’s network, Marakby said. There’s no word just yet on when consumers will be able to hail a Ford vehicle on the Lyft app.

At the same time, Ford is beginning a test of its delivery partnerships with Dominos and Postmates, but it won’t be autonomous at first. Instead, the company is simply trying to learn more about the customer interactions with a delivery vehicle. The company is attempting to understand things like how far customers are willing to walk to a car to get their delivery.

In the pilot phase, there will be two separate fleets dedicated to either delivery or ride-hail, but Marakby said that could change once the company launches the businesses, depending on the volume of deliveries or goods that need to be delivered.

If a vehicle that Ford is building from the ground up to be autonomous has a high rate of utilization by a delivery partner, then it will likely only serve in that delivery partner’s fleet. If not, those vehicles could serve multiple purposes.

“By bringing all of our different development tracks together to test in unison, we’re putting ourselves in the best position to analyze our execution, determine what works well and improve what doesn’t,” Marakby wrote in a blog post. “This way, we can quickly expand our service and take it to other cities when the time comes.”

"Israel aims to eliminate use of coal, gasoline and diesel by 2030",https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-aims-to-eliminate-use-of-coal-gasoline-and-diesel-by-2030/,"The Energy Ministry forecast Tuesday that within 12 years Israel would be fully reliant on natural gas and alternative fuels for the production of electricity and for transportation.

“We intend to reach a situation in which Israel’s industry will be based on natural gas, and most importantly, transportation in Israel will be based on natural gas or electricity,” Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said at an energy conference in Tel Aviv. “From 2030 onwards, the State of Israel will create alternatives and will no longer allow the import of cars that run on gasoline and diesel fuel.”

Steinitz said he would be submitting a master plan with this vision to the government.

In 2014, electricity was produced through a fifty-fifty split between coal and natural gas. The aim for 2030 is to alter that to 83% natural gas and 17% renewable energy, with “zero pollutants,” Steinitz said.

Already this year, the balance of electricity production will be 71% natural gas, 25%-27% coal, and 2% renewable energy, with the economy transitioning to using coal only for emergency and backup purposes by 2030.

“We have abolished the strategy of diversification of fuels,” Steinitz said, noting that Israel had previously believed that this kind of diversification — using coal and natural gas — was essential for energy security. “We realized we can reach energy security even without this diversification.”

“There is a historic opportunity to transform Israel into one of the first Western countries in which energy is produced with zero pollution and harm to the environment,” he said.

Steinitz said that according to OECD data some 2,500 people die in Israel annually because of air pollution. He added that the controversial natural gas legislation passed two years ago has been a “huge success,” having enabled the development of Leviathan, Israel’s largest natural gas field, which is expected to come online next year. The one and a half-year holdup in the development of Leviathan caused by delays in passing the gas regulations cost Israel some $20 billion, he said.

The development of the field allowed Israel to sign its “most significant export deals” with neighboring Egypt and Jordan since the signing of peace accords with these nations, he said.

Earlier this month, the partners in the Tamar and Leviathan offshore natural gas fields said they signed deals to export 64 billion cubic meters of gas to the Egyptian firm Dolphinus over a 10-year period. In September 2016, Jordan struck a deal to buy 8.5 million cubic meters of Israeli gas per day over 15 years, a deal estimated to be worth $10 billion.

“This strengthens the peace axis,” Steinitz said. “It is a geopolitical success that has been made possible because of natural gas.”

Israel, a country with scarce natural resources, discovered offshore natural gas fields that may enable it to achieve energy independence and become an exporter of natural gas. The Tamar gas field was discovered in 2009 and started production in 2013, while the Leviathan field — the largest deep water natural gas field discovered in the world in the past decade — was discovered in 2010 and is expected to start production in 2019.

Steinitz was speaking at a conference organized by the Israel Institute for Energy and Environment that dealt with the potential of and challenges to Israel’s natural gas industry.

Steinitz and other speakers were heckled by a group protesting against the planned Leviathan rig, which they say will be set up just 10 kilometers off the northern shore and will cause pollution and billions of dollars’ worth of environmental damage.

“Instead of a proposed rig, the companies should be setting up a floating production storage and offloading facility above the rig, not close to the shore of Dor Beach,” said protest head Yoni Sapir.

In addition, a gas-processing to be set up on land could pollute local water sources, said Eli Budman, a toxicologist who was protesting outside the hotel.

Steinitz dismissed them as “not in my backyard” protesters who were ignorant of the issues. “We will not submit to pressure by anyone. We are convinced we are doing the right things for the future of Israel,” he declared.

Responding to the demonstrators, Environment Minister Ze’ev Elkin said Israel cannot both cut its consumption of coal and stall development of the natural gas industry. “We can’t go in both directions,” he said.

The ministry was prioritizing the reduction of pollution, he said, and natural gas had to play its part as soon as possible. “Pollution is the number one environmental challenge of Israel,” he said. “The progress of Leviathan is of environmental interest to Israel.”

At the conference Yona Fogel, the CEO of Paz Oil Company Ltd. an oil refiner, said the price of natural gas in Israel as set by the agreement reached by government and the producers of the gas was too high. “There is a market failure here,” he said. Paz’s two plants, in Haifa and Alon Tavor, were ready to receive natural gas but “the gap between implementation and desire” was very high, he said.

Mathios Rigas, CEO of Energean Oil & Gas, a Greek oil and gas explorer that won the license to develop and operate the smaller Karish and Tanin offshore natural gas fields — which are estimated to have reserves of 2 trillion cubic feet (TCF) and are earmarked to supply fuel to Israel and compete with Tamar and Leviathan — said he expects drilling at the fields to start in 2019 and supply of gas to start in the first quarter of 2021. Energean will be investing some $1.6 billion in the development of the fields, he said, and has already raised the funds to manage the project, he said.

Yossi Abu, the CEO of Delek Drilling LP, a unit of Delek Group Ltd., which together with Noble Energy Inc. is a partner in the Tamar and Leviathan fields, said that he expects more deals with Egypt following the one with Dolphinus signed earlier this month. Egypt is estimated to need some 20 to 40 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year for the next decade, he said, and this presents an opportunity for Israel.

The pipeline infrastructure already in place will allow Leviathan to supply gas to Egypt and Jordan when production starts in the fourth quarter of 2019, he said, and will allow Israel to be part of a regional grid connected to the two Arab countries, as opposed to the energy island it has been until now."
"Malibu Poised To Ban Plastic Utensils, Straws",http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/02/26/malibu-straw-plastic-utensils-ban/,"MALIBU (CBSLA) — Finger foods will be a must-have for beach days in Malibu this summer after the seaside city’s council approved a ban on plastic utensils – including cutlery and straws – within city limits.

The council tentatively passed the ordinance on Feb. 12, and voted to approve it Monday night. The ordinance will take effect on June 1.

The move is another part of Malibu’s long-term campaign to eliminate the use of single-use plastic items that have a negative effect on the environment, Malibu Mayor Rick Mullen said.

The city has already banned plastic bags, plastic sandbags and polystyrene foam.

“We are now adding plastic straws, plastic stirrers and plastic cutlery to the list of plastic … that we will (ban) at the source so it doesn’t reach our beaches and the open ocean,” he said. “The ocean, beaches and natural surroundings are a central part of life in Malibu. We are absolutely committed to keeping them clean for ourselves, our children and their children in the future.”

Restaurateurs are approaching the new rules in different ways.

Manager at The Country Kitchen Joel Ruiz told CBS2 News it’ll be more expensive to stock the restaurant with eco-friendly cutlery. He said they’ll likely have to pass on the additional costs to customers. “We don’t wanna do that, but we have to,” said Ruiz.

As for restaurateur Bob Morris, he said he’s fine with the changes.

“I’m an old surfer; yes, let’s get rid of them,” the owner of Paradise Cove Beach Cafe said.

In fact, Morris has come up with an ingenious, cheap solution: using pasta as straws.

“I woke up, and I said, ‘Spaghetti, man!’ We put it in a drink and let it just sit there for four hours,” Morris said. He even has a gluten-free alternative for those who need it.

“I applaud the owner for, you know, making an attempt to solve the problem,” said one customer.

To raise awareness among the business community, city officials plan to provide a box of environmentally safe paper straws to each Malibu food service business. The straws will carry the city’s “Keep it Clean Malibu” slogan, and the city will promote the fact that sustainable, reusable straws and cutlery are available in metal, wood, glass, bamboo and other materials."
Top U.S. court curbs rights of immigrants awaiting deportation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-immigration/top-u-s-court-curbs-rights-of-immigrants-awaiting-deportation-idUSKCN1GB22Q?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=Social,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday curbed the ability of immigrants held in long-term detention during deportation proceedings to argue for their release in a ruling in sync with President Donald Trump’s get-tough approach toward immigration.

The court’s conservative justices carried the day in the 5-3 decision that overturned a lower court’s ruling that required that immigrants held by the U.S. government awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings get a bond hearing after six months of detention to seek their release.

The ruling could lead to indefinite detentions of certain classes of immigrants, including some with legal status who the government wants to deport.

The court’s five conservatives were in the majority in the ruling written by Justice Samuel Alito. Three liberals dissented, including Justice Stephen Breyer, who sharply criticized the decision. Another liberal, Justice Elena Kagan, did not participate.

Class action litigation brought by the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the government’s practice of placing immigrants facing deportation proceedings in detention for months or years without being able to argue for release.

Breyer said that forbidding bail would likely violate the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of due process under the law. Breyer said he doubted the U.S. Congress, in crafting the immigration provisions at issue, would have wanted to put thousands of people at risk of lengthy confinement without any hope of bail.

“We need only recall the words of the Declaration of Independence, in particular its insistence that all men and women have ‘certain unalienable Rights,’ and that among them is the right to ‘Liberty,’” Breyer wrote.

But Alito said that these immigration law provisions cannot be interpreted to limit the length of detention. He called Breyer’s view of the statutes “utterly implausible.”

The case assumed added importance in light of the Trump administration’s decision to ramp up immigration enforcement, with growing numbers of people likely to end up in detention awaiting deportation.

The court threw out a 2015 decision by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the government must provide bond hearings to gauge danger and flight risk when detention exceeds six months, and every six months after that. Former President Barack Obama’s Justice Department had challenged that ruling. The Trump administration took up the appeal.

Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley said the 9th Circuit’s ruling had resulted in unnecessary bond hearings, adding to a backlog in the immigration court system.

“We are aggressively working to implement common sense reforms to reduce that backlog, and today’s Supreme Court decision ensures that immigration judges in the Ninth Circuit can focus their valuable docket time on matters actually required by law,” O’Malley said.

The justices sent the case back to the 9th Circuit to consider the question of whether the Constitution requires bond hearings for detained immigrants.

‘RECORD-BREAKING LEVELS’

The ACLU said it looks forward to arguing the constitutional questions in lower courts. “The Trump administration is trying to expand immigration detention to record-breaking levels as part of its crackdown on immigrant communities,” ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham said.

There are roughly 36,000 immigrants held in detention in the United States on any given day, and the ACLU estimates that about 10 to 20 percent have been detained at least six months.

Those suing included immigrants who were held at the border when seeking illegal entry as well as others, including lawful permanent residents who hold so-called green cards, who have been convicted of crimes.

The lead plaintiff was Alejandro Rodriguez, a legal immigrant from Mexico living in California who was brought to the United States as a baby. He was working as a dental assistant when he was detained for three years without a hearing after being placed in deportation proceedings based on two non-violent convictions, joyriding and misdemeanor drug possession.

Although Rodriguez was released eventually, the case brought on his behalf continued.

In dissent, Breyer said that asylum seekers or non-citizens who arrive at the U.S. border still have due process rights.

“We cannot here engage in this legal fiction,” Breyer wrote.

“Whatever the fiction, would the Constitution leave the Government free to starve, beat, or lash those held within our boundaries? If not, then, whatever the fiction, how can the Constitution authorize the Government to imprison arbitrarily those who, whatever we might pretend, are in reality right here in the United States?”

Breyer added, “No one can claim, nor since the time of slavery has anyone to my knowledge successfully claimed, that persons held within the United States are totally without constitutional protection.”

This marked the second time the high court considered the case. It ordered a new round of arguments after Trump’s conservative appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the bench last year."
Free clinic opens for Yemenis impoverished by war,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-health/free-clinic-opens-for-yemenis-impoverished-by-war-idUSKCN1GB1VS?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Reuters%2FworldNews+%28Reuters+World+News%29,"SANAA (Reuters) - Volunteer doctors are offering free medical services for a week at a clinic in the Yemeni capital Sanaa to treat people impoverished by a war which has killed thousands and wrecked the economy.

Slideshow ( 7 images )

The initiative, dubbed “Breeze of Hope,” is the first by a group of nurses and doctors to conduct electrocardiograms, x-rays and other procedures that Sanaa residents cannot afford.

Yemen has been hit by three years of civil war between the internationally recognized government backed by a Saudi-led military coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement which controls the capital.

Key infrastructure has been bombed by Saudi-led air strikes while imports have been constricted by a near-blockade aimed at cutting off weapons supplies to the Houthis.

Amid a dispute between the government and the Houthis over who should receive public sector salaries and as the local currency has shed much of its value, many employees -- including some medical staff -- have not received wages in over a year.

For them, a chance at free healthcare is a rare boon.

“I came here because I don’t have the means or ability to go to a hospital,” said one patient, Mohammed Fuad.

“Our financial situation is difficult, and there are no salaries because of the war. That’s why we’re obliged to come to this charitable medical center.”

Mohammed al-Aqabi, the head of the initiative, said the help provided rare hope amid the gloom of war.

“The main purpose of running this center is to address the country’s catastrophic circumstances of war and destruction,” he said.

The organizers say they hope to repeat the initiative elsewhere in the capital and in other areas of the country soon."
Germany: Pharmaceutical Lobbyist Jens Spahn to become new Health Minister,http://m.dw.com/en/angela-merkels-new-coalition-wont-address-lobbying-in-germany/a-42745088,"The lack of transparency in Germany's political lobbying system was highlighted once again on Sunday, when Angela Merkel named a former lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry, Jens Spahn, as her new health minister. Spahn, an internal party critic of Merkel elevated to the Cabinet for the first time, founded an association in 2006 that owned an agency named Politas, which provided consultancy to pharmaceutical companies. He kept the extent of his financial interests just below the threshold necessary to disclose them.

As a 2012 report by news magazine Focus pointed out, Politas advertised its services by noting that it had good contacts in the German parliament. ""Whether it's a hearing, an off-the-record discussion, or a plenary debate. We're there for you,"" the Politas website said at the time. In 2006, Spahn was a young Bundestag member representing Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) who specialized in formulating health policy. He sold his interests in Politas in 2010.

""He never really answered the questions that were thrown up,"" LobbyControl campaigner Timo Lange told DW. ""And that's something that we would expect before he becomes minister. What was this work about and were there any connections to his parliamentary work?""

Merkel has appointed Spahn, a former pharmeceutical lobbyist, as her new health minister

No lobby register — again

Spahn's appointment did not exactly inspire German transparency campaigners with confidence. Earlier this month, organizations like Abgeordnetenwatch (""Parliamentarian Watch"") and LobbyControl were annoyed to discover that one of their central demands had been ignored once again.

Transparency nongovernmental organizations have long demanded that the German government introduce a ""lobby register,"" which would oblige private interests to disclose how and why they contact lawmakers — and how much money that lobbying costs.

Both the United States and the European Union have such a register in place, and campaigners' hopes had been raised when the Green party had managed to get the measure into the draft ""Jamaica"" coalition contract, before the talks were scuppered last November by the business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP).

But though the Social Democrats (SPD) had taken a similar demand into their grand coalition talks with the conservatives, the center-left party ultimately sacrificed it in favor of other policies.

That capitulation apparently happened in the very last round of talks, because a week before the draft contract was finalized, SPD Bundestag member and coalition negotiator Ulrich Kelber said that the CDU was still ""ready to negotiate"" on the issue.

The SPD ultimately gave up their demand for a lobbyist register in favor of other policies during coalition talks

""That was very disappointing for us,"" said Lange of LobbyControl. ""For us it's fundamentally important that when representatives of business interests want to have an influence that it is clear to the public who is commissioning who and what money is being spent.""

Kelber himself put the blame squarely on the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). ""The CSU intervened, and made clear they would neither accept a lobby register or whistleblower protection,"" he told DW. ""They would only have done it with extreme concessions in other areas.""

Not giving up

But the issue has not been dropped. Polls show that 75 percent of the German population are in favor of a lobby register, a figure that might have inspired opposition parties to draw up a draft bill. The Greens and the socialist Left party initiated a reading of their lobby register bill in the Bundestag last Thursday, though it has little prospect of success.

In a speech in the parliamentary debate, the CDU's Patrick Schnieder (who was not available for an interview on Monday) attacked the idea as too bureaucratic, and argued that a lobby register would threaten the freedom of MPs to speak to who they choose. ""We are elected to weigh up different interests for citizens, and we decide ourselves who we talk to,"" he told the chamber. ""Are we supposed to check, before we speak to someone, whether they are on such a list? What if we want to talk to someone ourselves? Am I only allowed to speak to those on such a list? And where do we draw the line? Who is a lobbyist and who isn't?""

Kelber has vowed to push on for a lobbyist register, and has started his own list on his website

But the other parties say they are determined not to let the point go. ""We will continue to bring up this issue during this legislative period — the last word hasn't been spoken,"" the SPD's Kelber said, before adding that he himself had started his own ""lobbying diary"" on his website, where users can read who he speaks to as part of his parliamentary work.

Germany — a special case

Not that the left-wing parties are above using Germany's notorious ""revolving door"" between politics and business: Last week it emerged that the Green party's former chairwoman Simone Peter will soon be the new president of the German Renewable Energy Federation (BEE), the umbrella organization that represents the interests of the country's renewable energy sector.

Germany's vulnerability to political corruption was also underlined on Monday when the Council of Europe warned the country to do more to make party campaign financing transparent.

""Almost every month there are bigger or smaller lobby scandals in Germany — and they can't keep explaining for much longer why there are no solutions to that,"" said Roman Ebener, spokesman for Abgeordnetenwatch. ""The biggest scandal at the moment is the emissions scandal — where the well-networked auto industry makes sure that the pollution regulations aren't tightened."""
"Powell says outlook strong, signaling gradual rate hikes",https://apnews.com/1925d91b379146babf637f2f3ed21b5f?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gestures while he testifies to the House Financial Services Committee, Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2018, in Washington.

WASHINGTON (AP) — New Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a message Tuesday that wasn’t quite what Wall Street had expected: The U.S. economy is doing well, maybe even better than he thought late last year.

Powell emphasized in his first Congressional testimony that the central bank plans to raise rates gradually. Nonetheless, his growing optimism about the economy rattled investors. Treasury yields climbed and stocks fell amid fresh speculation that the Fed would accelerate the pace of hikes in its benchmark policy rate this year. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 299 points.

The Fed raised rates three times in 2017 and had projected in December that it would raise rates another three times this year. However, many private economists said they now expected the Fed will boost rates four times this year rather than three.

“My personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December,” Powell said when asked whether the Fed might boost its projection for rate hikes from three to four when it updates its outlook next month.

Powell would not say whether the Fed’s projection for rate hikes would change. But he noted a number of ways that the economic outlook has improved since December, including stronger data on growth and inflation, the passage of a $1.5 trillion tax cut in late December and an increase in government spending in a January budget deal.

Powell said that he would not speculate on whether the number of hikes would be boosted since any change will depend on the individual forecasts of each of the 15 members of the Fed’s policy committee.

But private economists said they saw Powell’s comments as a strong signal that the Fed will be raising its rate forecast at its next meeting in March.

Powell’s comments came as he delivered the Fed’s semi-annual monetary report to the House Financial Committee. He will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.

His reception before the House panel stood in marked contrast to how the committee interacted with Janet Yellen. Republicans often challenged Yellen, a Democrat, during exchanges in which she was often interrupted by male lawmakers who dismissed her answers on a wide variety of topics.

A frequent flash-point was Yellen’s objection to GOP-sponsored legislation to limit the Fed’s independence by requiring the Fed to follow a specific monetary rule in setting interest-rate policies.

Powell, a Republican tapped by President Donald Trump in November when the president decided against giving Yellen a second term, expressed support in his opening statement for using various monetary formulas to help guide setting interest rates.

During a hearing that lasted more than three hours, Powell enjoyed a far more placid exchange with the GOP-controlled committee. A number of Democrats, however, sought to force Powell to criticize a range of Trump economic policies, from tax cuts the Democrats claimed would worsen income inequality, to huge budget deficits that are expected to make deficits climb toward $1 trillion annually.

Powell, however, was adept at staying out of political controversies, frequently saying that the subjects he was being asked about were in the realm of policies controlled by Congress and the administration and not the Federal Reserve.

In his statement, Powell praised Yellen for the important contributions she made during her four years as the first woman to lead the Fed. He said the two had worked together to ensure “a smooth leadership transition and provide for continuity in monetary policy.”

Referring to the wild swings in the stock market that occurred earlier this month, Powell said the Fed does “not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market and inflation.”

Powell, who took office on Feb. 5, had been an investment banker before joining the Fed board in 2012.

Even with three hikes last year, the Fed’s policy rate remains at a still-low 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent. But various market rates, including home mortgage rates, have begun rising in anticipation of further Fed rate increases.

In his comments, Powell did not express worries that the economy was starting to overheat, stressing instead a number of developments showing economic strength.

“The robust job market should continue to support growth in household incomes and consumer spending,” Powell said.

Some economists have raised concerns that recent moves by the Trump administration and Congress to boost economic growth through tax cuts and spending increases could raise the risks of overheating and inflation.

But Powell said that the government’s fiscal policy was now “more stimulative,” which he said would help to boost chronically low inflation in recent years. He said that the Fed expected inflation to move up this year and then stabilize around the Fed’s 2 percent target."
'Freak warming' in the Arctic stuns scientists,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5439325/Freak-warming-Arctic-stuns-scientists.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490,"Europe has been buffeted by freezing temperatures in recent days and experts say this is the result of freak warming in the Arctic.

The Arctic is experiencing one of its hottest winters on record, with temperatures at the North Pole surging above freezing.

These unusual conditions, which scientists say have 'never been this extreme', are causing a disruption to the Arctic polar jet stream.

The jet stream carries winds east to west across the planet, at speeds of up to 200mph (320kph), in the upper atmosphere.

Warmer air in the Arctic has sent them off their usual course, blasting cold air over Europe - something likely to happen more often thanks to man-made global warming, researchers say.

The North Pole has surged above freezing despite it being the dead of winter, stunning scientists. This graphic shows global forecast system data of temperature difference from normal (in °C) on Sunday over the Arctic

On the northern tip of Greenland, the Cape Morris Jesup meteorological site has had a record-smashing 61 hours of temperatures above freezing so far in 2018.

This is linked to a rare retreat of sea ice in the Arctic winter darkness.

'It's never been this extreme,' said Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).

Warmth was coming into the Arctic both up from the Atlantic and through the Bering Strait, driving cold air south.

Around the entire Arctic region, temperatures are now about 20°C (36°F) above normal, at -8°C (17.6°F), according to DMI calculations.

HOW DO RISING TEMPERATURES IN THE ARCTIC CREATE COLD WEATHER IN EUROPE? As long ago as 1973, a study suggested that an ice-free Arctic Ocean could make regions further south colder. That 'warm Arctic, cold continent' (WACC) pattern is sometimes dubbed 'wacc-y' or 'wacky' among climate scientists. When unusually warm air enters the region, it melts ice covering the waters of the Arctic Ocean. This ice normally serves as an insulator, stopping the flow of thermal energy from the water’s surface into the atmosphere. Without the ice in place, the oceans can transfer a huge amount of this energy into the air above. This in turn increases air temperatures and this warm air rises up into the upper atmosphere, where it reaches the jet stream. Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow currents of air that carry warm and cold air across the planet, much like the currents of a river. They cover thousands of miles as they meander near the tropopause layer of our atmosphere. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets, found 30,000 to 39,000 ft (5.7 to 7.4 miles/ 9 to 12 km) above sea level at the north and south pole. In the case of the Arctic polar jet this fast moving band of air sits between the cold Arctic air to the north and the warm, tropical air to the south. When uneven masses of hot and cold meet, the resulting pressure difference causes winds to form. During winter, the jet stream tends to be at its strongest because of the marked temperature contrast between the warm and cold air. The bigger the temperature difference between the Arctic and tropical air mass, the stronger the winds of the jet stream become. The Arctic polar jet, which can reach speeds of up 200mph (320kph), flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans. It moves from East to West, although its exact route varies and can be affected by various factors. With the ice melt in the Arctic and the introduction of warmer air, the route of the jet stream becomes wavier and more erratic. That means that the colder air it carries from the Arctic can penetrate further south and warmer airs from the tropics is carried further north. If the jet stream’s meander buckles south of the UK, it attracts cold air from the Arctic. Conversely when it swings north, it sucks warm air from the tropics. Advertisement

To the south, a rare snow storm hit Rome on Monday and some Brussels mayors planned to detain homeless overnight if they refused shelter with temperatures set to fall as low as -10°C (14°F) in the coming week.

Hit by easterly winds from Siberia, cities from Warsaw to Oslo were colder than -8°C.

As long ago as 1973, a study suggested that an ice-free Arctic Ocean could make regions further south colder.

That 'warm Arctic, cold continent' (WACC) pattern is sometimes dubbed 'wacc-y' or 'wacky' among climate scientists.

'Wacky weather continues with scary strength and persistence,' tweeted Professor Lars Kaleschke, a professor at the University of Hamburg.

Scientists say a long-term shrinking of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean, linked to global warming, exposes warmer water below that releases more heat into the atmosphere. This graphic shows sinking levels of ice since the 1980s

'The question is whether this weather will happen more often. This is just one event so it's hard to make a causal relationship,' he told Reuters.

Scientists say a long-term shrinking of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean, linked to global warming, exposes warmer water below that releases more heat into the atmosphere.

That in turn may be disrupting the high altitude jet stream.

'The jet stream becomes wavier, meaning that colder air can penetrate further south and warmer air further north,' said Nalan Koc, research director of the Norwegian Polar Institute.

Arctic Ocean sea ice is at a record low for late February at 14.1 million square kilometres (5.4 million miles), according to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center.

That is about a million less than normal, or roughly the size of Egypt.

Erik Solheim, head of the U.N. Environment, said the rare weather fits a wider pattern driven by a build-up of greenhouse gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels from cars, factories and power plants.

'What we once considered to be anomalies are becoming the new normal.

'Our climate is changing right in front of our eyes, and we've only got a short amount of time to stop this from getting significantly worse,' he told Reuters.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, almost 200 nations agreed to limit a rise in temperatures to 'well below' 2°C (3.5°F) above preindustrial times, while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C (2.7°F).

'The risk of an ice-free Arctic in summer is about 50 per cent or higher' with warming of between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees, according to a leaked draft of a scientific report by a United Nations panel of scientists, obtained by Reuters.

The World Meteorological Organization said the chill in Europe was caused by a 'Sudden Stratospheric Warming' above the North Pole that led to a split in the polar vortex, a cold area of air above the Arctic that spilled cold south.

A big problem in figuring out whether the Arctic warmth is driven by human activities or natural variations is a lack of measuring stations.

There are no thermometers at the North Pole and satellite measurements go back only to the late 1970s.

On the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, temperatures were just above freezing, with rain, and about 13.4°C (24°F) above the long-term average on Sunday.

'There have also been recent winters with similar deviations,' said Rasmus Benestad, senior scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who plans to quit the Paris Agreement, has often expressed doubts about mainstream global warming science during cold spells, such as at New Year in the eastern United States.

And Mottram at DMI said Europe's winters had become less severe. 'It's not actually that cold. Its just our perceptions have shifted from a normal winter.'"

Bernstein's U.S. semiconductor team estimates Nvidia's operation profit was $3 billion during the same period.

A secretive Chinese start-up called Bitmain that dominates the bitcoin ""mining"" industry likely made as much as chipmaker Nvidia did last year, Bernstein analysts estimate.

Beijing-based Bitmain was founded by Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan in 2013. The company has since grown into one of the primary firms involved with bitcoin mining, the process of using computing power to generate bitcoins. Wu is also a widely followed figure in the bitcoin world.

Bitmain declined to comment for this story.

In the early days of bitcoin, enthusiasts could use ordinary video graphics cards to profitably process computations needed to mine the cryptocurrency. But a Chinese-based company turned bitcoin mining into a specialized process in 2013 by selling application-specific integrated circuits, or asic, computer chip cards that could mine bitcoin 50 times faster than traditional video graphics cards.

Today, Bitmain sells Antminer bitcoin mining rigs that can cost several hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars each. The company also operates ""mining pools"" in which participants collaborate on bitcoin mining in order to cut costs. As a result, Bernstein estimates Bitmain has 70 to 80 percent of market share in bitcoin miners and asics.

The analysts estimate that most of Bitmain's revenue was generated by selling miners powered by the company's chips. ""The rest was largely generated by mining itself and, to a much lesser extent, by collecting management fees from the mining pools it operates and renting out the mining power of its mining farms through cloud services.""

Much of the growth in mining revenue came from the exponential rise in bitcoin prices, the Bernstein report said. Its analysis also indicated that ""Bitmain shrewdly adjusts the prices of miners according to bitcoin prices.""

So as bitcoin skyrocketed toward $20,000 late last year, the price of Bitmain's AntMiner S9 climbed near $5,000 while production costs remained the same, according to Bernstein's estimates.

To come to the final $3 billion to $4 billion operating profit figure, the Bernstein analysts also looked at Bitmain's purchases from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and estimated the start-up contributed 2 to 3 percent of the chipmaker's total revenue last year.

""In the year 2018, Bitmain will likely lead the cryptocurrency asic industry and migrate some of its chips to 10nm and the most advanced 7nm,"" the report said. ""That will make the company one of the top five users of TSMC's 7nm in 2018, with demand comparable with Qualcomm's, HiSilicon's, or AMD's.""

But longer-term growth is not guaranteed, especially in the fickle cryptocurrency world. Bitcoin has lost half its value in about two months amid worries about a regulatory crackdown.

Chinese authorities have taken some of the strongest actions so far by banning initial coin offerings and causing local bitcoin exchanges to close.

Bitmain has taken strategic steps to stay ahead of the game.

The company launched a mining pool subsidiary last April in Israel, and is opening mining farms in Canada and Switzerland, and regional headquarters in Singapore, the Bernstein report pointed out. Bitmain is also expanding its business to other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and monero.

The Bernstein analysts say the Chinese company also has a ""massive cash position"" that should help it through sluggish periods in the industry. And in its main bitcoin mining business, Bitmain protects itself from losing too much to investor speculation by selling chips to miners, rather than doing all the bitcoin mining itself.

""Some money is left with customers, but so are a lot of risks,"" the report said. ""The results, in our view, have been remarkable."""
In-Space Manufacturing Is About to Get a Big Test,https://www.space.com/39039-made-in-space-off-earth-manufacturing-test.html,"Made In Space has partnered with the New Jersey company Thorlabs on a project to produce ZBLAN optical fiber in orbit. This machine, which is a bit bigger than a microwave, is scheduled to launch toward the International Space Station abroad a SpaceX Dragon capsule on Dec. 12, 2017.

A bold plan to rev up off-Earth manufacturing is about to get a big test.

A small, privately built machine designed to make optical fiber is launching toward the International Space Station (ISS) aboard SpaceX's Dragon cargo capsule tomorrow (Dec. 12).

If all goes according to plan, this little factory — which is owned by California-based startup Made In Space — will churn out stuff that's good enough to sell here on Earth, opening up space to greater commercial use. [3D Printing: 10 Ways It Could Transform Space Travel]

""We believe that we're really on the verge of something truly amazing here, with kind of using space for industrial purposes for some of the very first times,"" Made In Space CEO Andrew Rush said during a news conference in late November.

Made In Space is no stranger to the ISS. In 2014, a 3D printer built by the company made it to the orbiting lab, as part of a pilot project with NASA that aimed prove out the technology's use in space. That machine performed well, so the company launched a commercial version, known as the Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF), to the station in 2016. The AMF continues to produce stuff for a variety of customers today. (NASA owns the 3D printer that launched in 2014.)

The machine that will launch tomorrow, which Rush said is a bit bigger than a microwave, is more specialized. It will produce a type of exotic optical fiber known as ZBLAN, which Made In Space representatives said is difficult to make on Earth: The high-gravity environment here causes tiny crystalline flaws to emerge in the fiber.

""In space, ZBLAN optical fiber can be produced without these crystals, providing superior data-transmission capabilities compared to both Earth-produced ZBLAN and traditional silica-fiber optic lines,"" Made In Space representatives wrote in a description of the project. ""This microgravity-produced fiber has numerous applications, including trans-Atlantic telecommunications, high-speed internet [and] lasers, as well as enhancing technologies in space.""

The Made In Space machine will produce at least 330 feet (100 meters) of ZBLAN on this trial run, pulling the material like taffy from heated feedstock material. The fiber will then come back to Earth (aboard the same Dragon that took the feedstock up) for study and characterization, with the aid of project partner Thorlabs, a New Jersey-based company.

If the space-made ZBLAN looks good, Made In Space will aim to sell it, Rush said. And that will be just the beginning.

""We do intend to develop this into a commercial product that we sell in large quantities,"" he said. ""The progression of that will be kind of a step-by-step approach.""

Launching raw materials to space is expensive, but ZBLAN is the sort of high-value product that makes on-orbit manufacturing economically feasible, Rush has said. And the company can make a lot of the material from a relatively small launch mass — about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of fiber per 2.2 lbs. (4 kilograms) of ZBLAN ""preform,"" Rush said during the news conference.

There's a lot of other cool stuff going up on the Dragon tomorrow as well: for example, a super-sensitive space-junk sensor, an experimental new bone adhesive, and an instrument that will measure the amount of energy going into and out of the Earth system with incredible precision.

And the launch itself will be a milestone in SpaceX's quest to develop reusable spaceflight systems, a key priority of the company's founder and CEO, Elon Musk. The Dragon flying tomorrow already has one space mission under its belt, as does the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket that will carry the capsule aloft.

"Florida Senate committee approves proposal to arm teachers, rejects assault gun ban",https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/375593002?__twitter_impression=true,"When Sen. Benacquisto moved to take a vote after just two speakers the room erupted in protest

TALLAHASSEE — More than two hundred orange-T-Shirt clad Rally in Tally Floridians filled a Senate committee room a half hour before a hearing on a package of gun control measures. They were a remnant of an estimated 1,200 demonstrators who marched on the state Capitol Monday where lawmakers began considering the first set of restrictions on gun ownership in 20 years.

Lawmakers have until March 9 to respond to the Valentine Day massacre at a Parkland high school. The proposals expected to move this week in House and Senate committees would arm teachers with weapons, make it easier to take into custody people suspected of mental illness, impose a three-day cooling off period and a minimum age for weapons purchase, and spend more money on mental health programs in schools.

A ban on assault weapons is not included in the package. But that is the number one demand of the Parkland survivors and their supporters. And was the demand repeatedly mentioned by protesters at a Monday morning rally, at a mid-afternoon news conference and of the hundred people who filled a Knott Building hallway. All seats inside were filled with their friends, neighbors and fellow protesters wanting a chance to demand that assault weapons no longer be legally allowed in Florida.

“They can’t run and hide from the Parkland kids,” said Sen. Kevin Radar, D-Broward, talking about the Republican majority that won’t act on an assault weapons ban that has been waiting for a hearing since the Pulse shooting.

Since 2016, three mass shootings, including at the Fort Lauderdale Airport, have taken the lives of 71 Floridians.

“The big difference between what happened at Pulse, what happened at Fort Lauderdale, is here with Stoneman Douglas High School we’re in session.” Said Radar. “The governor, The Speaker of the House and the Senate President cannot ignore 17 lives taken away when we have two weeks to do something.”

The Senate Rules Committee had the opening round in what appears will be a two-day fight. Senate Democrats held a joint news conference with House Democrats before the opening hearing to denounce the Republican package as delusional if the goal is to end gun violence and keep schools safe. They took particular aim at the Republican proposal to arm teachers.

“If we weaponize our teachers then the gun lobby who wants to sell more guns and want more people armed are the clear winners here,” said House Democratic Leader Janet Cruz.

The Democrats' plan is to file amendments at every opportunity to ban semi-automatic weapons such as those used at Pulse, Fort Lauderdale and Parkland.

“We will not bow down to the gun lobby,” said Cruz as the protesters cheered. “You hear me senators? You hear me representatives? We will not bow down.”

From that rally the protesters followed Senate Democrats across the Capital campus to the Knott Building where the first hearing on the gun control package was scheduled. Sen. Javier Rodriguez-Miami, proposed an amendment to the first bill to ban the sale, transfer and possession of a series of about 80 different assault weapons.

“The problem with this amendment is I can’t find any guns that would be legal,” said NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer.

Pastor Andy Oliver of Allendale United Methodist Church followed Hammer to the lectern.

After Oliver urged lawmakers to pass a ban, Committee Chair Sen. Lizbeth Benacquisto, R-Fort Myers, called for a vote, and the crowd erupted in protest. Scores of people howled they were denied an opportunity to speak.

Benacquisto moved to quell the confusion with an explanation about procedure. That provoked more protests. She relented and 41 people, nearly all in support of a ban, spoke for the next two hours and 20 minutes about why they support Rodriguez’s amendment.

“All countries have mentally ill people but we are the only country that lets them get weapons for mass killings,” Sam Sharf, a 17-year old from Plant City, told Senators.

“Some of us will be coming for your seats in the future,” Sharf said. After speaking to the panel, he asked a Sargent of Arms to fill out his speaker’s card for him because his hand was shaking from the experience.

Shannon Kalmbach of St. Petersburg was the last citizen to speak to the Senate Rules Committee before it voted on the ban.

“It is the right thing to do,” said Kalmbach a mother of two. “You know those weapons are used only to kill people.”

The panel voted down the ban and three other amendments filed by Democrats. However, the proposal to allow districts to authorize teachers to carry weapons passed by a 9-4 vote. It must get pass the Appropriations Committee to make it to the full Senate.

A similar House bill will be considered in committee Tuesday.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer

RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco’s King Mohammed VI underwent successful heart surgery in France on Monday, state news agency MAP said.

The 54-year old king was treated at a Paris clinic after suffering from a “heart rhythm disorder” on Jan. 20, the agency said, adding he had been diagnosed with an “atrial flutter”.

The surgery normalized the heart rhythm, and the king would be able to resume his duties without any restrictions, MAP said.

The king, who heads the Muslim world’s longest-serving dynasty, took office in 1999 after his father, Hassan II, died of a heart attack.

The political and social stability of Morocco is closely watched by Western governments as it is the only country in North Africa where jihadist groups have failed to gain a foothold, and is an important partner against Islamist militancy in terms of intelligence-sharing.

The kingdom has escaped mass uprisings such as in Egypt, Libya or other Arab countries, but protests have erupted since 2016 in some rural areas against poverty and unemployment.

Morocco has averted previous protests with a combination of limited constitutional reforms, heavy policing and hefty public spending."
Israeli team says new test takes uncertainty out of prostate cancer screening,https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-team-says-new-test-takes-uncertainty-out-of-prostate-cancer-screening/,"Scientists at the Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot say they are a step closer to developing a better method to screen for prostate cancer, marking a significant leap forward in removing guesswork from the process.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men around the world, but the main method of testing, screening for increased levels of prostate-specific antigens (PSA) in the blood, remains controversial.

Studies have shown that elevated PSA levels can sometimes show up years before a cancer develops or in benign conditions, leading to unnecessary biopsies and anxiety.

“There are still questions about whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks for most men,” the American Cancer Society says on its website.

However, Micromedic Technologies says its an initial test of its Celldetect technology managed to detect or rule out cancer in urine samples more accurately than the PSA test.

Relying on a clinical study with 59 urine samples at Kaplan, which has been working with CellDetect for the last two years in developing the screening product, the company arrived at a high sensitivity rate of 91.3 percent, meaning it could rule out cancer accurately in most patients.

The company also reported a 75% specificity rate, meaning it could detect cancer in three-quarters of people who had it.

“The currently available diagnostic testing is known to be unreliable,” said Micromedic CEO, Guy Lerner. “With these clinical study results, we have the potential to transform prostate cancer diagnostics, offering patients a non-invasive, accurate and reliable test, and one that could improve the healthcare system through considerable cost savings.”

Tests of CellDetect have previously proven similarly high efficacy rates for detecting cervical and bladder cancer, though the product has yet to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration."
Georgia woman loses necklace with daughter's ashes at Disney during Princess Half Marathon,https://www.wptv.com/news/national/georgia-woman-loses-necklace-with-daughters-ashes-at-disney-during-princess-half-marathon,"ORLANDO, Fla. — A Georgia woman who ran in the 10th Anniversary Disney Princess Half Marathon over the weekend says she lost a cross pendant necklace filled with her daughter's ashes on Sunday.

Chasity Foster, a teacher from Augusta, Georgia, lost her 17-year-old daughter, Shaylin, in a car crash on her way to school last month. Shaylin was a high school senior who had been accepted into college to become a biomechanical engineer with the dream of creating prosthetics for children.

Before the tragic accident, Foster said the two used to run several marathons together; including the Disney marathon.

""She was a very fast runner. She was involved in soccer, cross country and track,"" Foster told Digital Producer Veronica Beltran over the phone.

Foster said this year they had signed up for the Disney Fairy Tale Challenge, previously known as the Glass Slipper challenge, — which involves a 19.3 mile magical adventure in two days including the Disney Princess Enchanted 10K and the 10th Anniversary Disney Princess Half Marathon.

She said after last month's accident she was unsure about participating in the race. After Wesley Baker, Shaylin's best friend, asked his mom, ""what if Shaylin would have wanted us to?"" she knew they would in fact be heading to Florida for the race to run in her honor.

Foster said her husband, Chris, ran in Shaylin's place and even wore her Princess Anna costume.

During Sunday's marathon, Foster says she was hesitant to wear the cross pendant necklace with Shaylin's ashes because it means so much to her but she wanted her daughter to be there with her as she ran even if she wasn't there physically.

""I had my husband double check to make sure the necklace was on properly because I didn't want it to fall off,"" Foster said. ""During mile three, I realized the necklace was missing. It's devastating to lose any child and then to lose the necklace I started freaking out.""

She said she was still wearing the necklace when they were in front of the Magic Kingdom parking lot entrance. A short distance later, near the princesses, is when she realized it was gone.

She went to look for it with her family and friends, but wasn't able to find it before heading back to Georgia.

""To lose this necklace is just devastating and priceless. No amount of money in the world could replace this necklace,"" she said.

Foster said the necklace matches her daughter's promise ring — which her father gave her at her 16th birthday — and has her name engraved in the back.

""If anyone finds the necklace they can contact me in any way possible that they can,"" Foster said. ""I will even drive to their house because this [the necklace] is part of my baby.""

If you find the priceless necklace, you can contact Foster at ChasFoster7@gmail.com or her Facebook page or even turn it in to Disney's lost and found."
"US Power Will Decline Under Trump, Says Futurist Who Predicted Soviet Collapse",https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d7ykxx/us-power-will-decline-under-trump-says-futurist-who-predicted-soviet-collapse,"Johan Galtung, a Nobel Peace Prize-nominated sociologist who predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union, warned that US global power will collapse under the Donald Trump administration.

The Norwegian professor at the University of Hawaii and Transcend Peace University is recognized as the 'founding father' of peace and conflict studies as a scientific discipline. He has made numerous accurate predictions of major world events, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Empire.

Back in 2000, Galtung first set out his prediction that the ""US empire"" would collapse within 25 years.

Galtung has also accurately predicted the 1978 Iranian revolution; the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989 in China; the economic crises of 1987, 2008 and 2011; and even the 9/11 attacks—among other events, according to the late Dietrich Fischer, academic director of the European University Center for Peace Studies.

Back in 2000, Galtung first set out his prediction that the ""US empire"" would collapse within 25 years. After the election of President Bush, though, he revised that forecast five years forward because, he argued, Bush's policies of extreme militarism would be an accelerant.

After the election of Trump, I thought it might be prudent to check in with Galtung to see how he was feeling about the status of his US forecast. Galtung told Motherboard that Trump would probably continue this trajectory of accelerated decline—and may even make it happen quicker. Of course, with typical scientific caution, he said he would prefer to see what Trump's actual policies are before voicing a clear verdict.

The model

Galtung has doctoral degrees in both sociology and mathematics, and some decades ago developed a theory of ""synchronizing and mutually reinforcing contradictions"", which he used to make his forecasts. The model was based on comparing the rise and fall of 10 historical empires.

In 1980, Galtung used his theoretical model to map the interaction of various social contradictions inside the Soviet empire, leading him to predict its demise within 10 years.

""Very few believed him at the time"", writes Dietrich Fischer in the main biography and anthology of Galtung's works, Pioneer for Peace, ""but it occurred on November 9, 1989, two months before his time limit, 1990.""

For the USSR, Galtung's model identified five key structural contradictions in Soviet society which, he said, would inevitably lead to its fragmentation—unless the USSR underwent a complete transformation.

The model works like this: the more those contradictions deepen, the greater the likelihood they will result in a social crisis that could upend the existing order.

In the case of the USSR, the main structural contradictions were as follows: the working class was increasingly repressed and unable to self-organise through trade unions (ironic given the country's Communist pretensions); the wealthier 'bourgeoisie' or elite had money to spend, but nothing to buy from domestic production, leading to economic stagnation; Russian intellectuals wanted more freedom of expression; minorities wanted more autonomy; and peasants wanted more freedom of movement

The model works like this: the more those contradictions deepen, the greater the likelihood they will result in a social crisis that could upend the existing order.

Eventually, as the highly centralised structures of the Soviet empire were unable to accommodate these intensifying pressures, the top-down structures would have to collapse.

Galtung later began to apply his model to the United States. In 1996, he wrote a scientific paper published by George Mason University's Institute for Conflict Analysis & Resolution warning that ""the USA will soon go the same way as [previous] imperial constructions… decline and fall.""

Fascism?

But the main book setting out Galtung's fascinating forecast for the US is his 2009 book, The Fall of the American Empire—and then What?

The book sets out a whopping 15 ""synchronizing and mutually reinforcing contradictions"" afflicting the US, which he says will lead to US global power ending by 2020—within just four years. Galtung warned that during this phase of decline, the US was likely to go through a phase of reactionary ""fascism"".

He argued that American fascism would come from a capacity for tremendous global violence; a vision of American exceptionalism as the ""fittest nation""; a belief in a coming final war between good and evil; a cult of the strong state leading the fight of good against evil; and a cult of the ""strong leader"".

Galtung warned that during this phase of decline, the US was likely to go through a phase of reactionary ""fascism"".

All of which, Galtung said, surfaced during the Bush era, and which now appear to have come to fruition through Trump. Such fascism, he told Motherboard, is a symptom of the decline—lashing out in disbelief at the loss of power.

Among the 15 structural contradictions his model identifies as driving the decline, are:

economic contradictions such as 'overproduction relative to demand', unemployment and the increasing costs of climate change;

military contradictions including rising tensions between the US, NATO, and its military allies, along with the increasing economic unsustainability of war;

political contradictions including the conflicting roles of the US, UN and EU;

cultural contradictions including tensions between US Judeo-Christianity, Islam, and other minorities;

and social contradictions encompassing the increasing gulf between the so-called 'American Dream', the belief that everyone can prosper in America through hard work, and the reality of American life (the fact that more and more people can't).

Galtung's book explores how the structural inability to resolve such contradictions will lead to the unravelling of US political power, both globally, and potentially even domestically.

Global collapse

Trump has made clear that he thinks US troops are still needed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even proposed sending more troops to Iraq. He also said that we should have 'grabbed' the country's oil. But he has also heavily (and incoherently) criticized US military policies.

Domestically, Trump has promised to deport 11 million illegal migrants, build a wall between the US and Mexico, compel all American Muslims to sign up to a government register, and ban all Muslim immigration to the US.

On the one hand, Trump might well offer an opportunity to avoid potential conflicts with great power rivals like Russia and China—on the other, he may still, stupidly, fight more unilateral wars and worsen domestic contradictions relating to minorities.

For Galtung, Trump's incoherent policy proposals are evidence of the deeper structural decline of US power: ""He [Trump] blunts contradictions with Russia, possibly with China, and seems to do also with North Korea. But he sharpens contradictions inside the USA"", such as in relation to minority rights.

On the one hand, Galtung said, Trump might well offer an opportunity to avoid potential conflicts with great power rivals like Russia and China—on the other, he may still, stupidly, fight more unilateral wars and worsen domestic contradictions relating to minorities.

Motherboard asked Galtung whether he thinks Trump would speed up his forecast of ""collapse"", or slow it down.

Even if we give Trump the benefit of the doubt, he said, and assume that he ""prefers solving underlying conflicts, particularly with Russia, to war—in other words for the US not be imperial—then yes, that still speeds up the decline from above, and from the center… Of course, what he does as a President remains to be seen.""

But what exactly is collapsing?

""An empire is more than violence around the world,"" said Galtung. ""It is a cross-border structure with a center, the imperial country, and a periphery, the client countries. The point about imperialism is to make the elites in the periphery do the jobs for the center.""

The center country may be a dictatorship or a democracy. So for Galtung, the collapse of the US empire comes ""when the periphery elites no longer want to fight US wars, no longer want to exploit for the center.""

For Galtung, a key sign of collapse would be Trump's attitude to NATO. The President-elect has said he would be happy to see NATO break-up if US allies aren't willing to pay their dues. Trump's 'go it alone' approach would, Galtung said, accelerate and undermine US global empire at the same time.

""The collapse has two faces,"" said Galtung. ""Other countries refuse to be 'good allies: and the USA has to do the killing themselves, by bombing from high altitudes, drones steered by computer from an office, Special Forces killing all over the place. Both are happening today, except for Northern Europe, which supports these wars, for now. That will probably not continue beyond 2020, so I stand by that deadline.""

US break-up?

But this global collapse, also has potential domestic implications. Galtung warned that the decline of American power on the world stage would probably have a domestic impact that would undermine the internal cohesion of the United States:

""As a trans-border structure the collapse I am thinking of is global, not domestic. But it may have domestic repercussion, like white supremacists or even minorities like Hawaiians, Inuits, indigenous Americans, and black Americans doing the same, maybe arguing for the United States as community, confederation rather than a 'union'.""

Galtung warned that the decline of American power on the world stage would probably have a domestic impact that would undermine the internal cohesion of the United States.

Galtung is not pessimistic about his forecasts, though. Having always seen the collapse of the ""US empire"" as inevitable—much like the collapse of the Soviet empire—he argues that there is real opportunity for a revitalization of the ""American republic.""

The American republic is characterised by its dynamism, its support for the ideals of freedom and liberty, its productivity and creativity, and its cosmopolitanism toward the 'other.'

Might Trump help revitalize the American republic?

Galtung's answer is, perhaps, revealing: ""If he manages to apologize deeply to all the groups he has insulted. And turn foreign policy from US interventions—soon 250 after Jefferson in Libya 1801—and not use wars (killing more than 20 million in 37 countries after 1945): A major revitalization! Certainly making 'America Great Again'. We'll see.""

That's a big if."
Saudi Arabia allows women to join military,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43197048,"The women and their male guardians - usually a husband, father, brother or son - must also have a place of residence in the same province as the job's location."
Angela Merkel's CDU approves grand coalition deal,http://www.dw.com/en/angela-merkels-cdu-approves-grand-coalition-deal/a-42742684,"As expected, delegates at the CDU party conference in Berlin on Monday approved by a wide margin the grand coalition agreement with the Social Democrats (SPD), with only 27 of the 975 delegates voting against it. Beforehand, Chancellor Angela Merkel urged her fellow party members to support the deal.

Merkel acknowledged that although the conservatives won last September's national election, their share of the vote declined by around 7 percent in what she ""called the difficult, unprecedented situation"" of a far-right populist party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), entering to the Bundestag.

Delegates at the CDU conference also voted by a large majority to elect former Saarland State Premier Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as the party's secretary general. The 55-year-old is a close Merkel ally, who some observers say could be the next chancellor.

Best deal available

With many in the rank-and-file unhappy about the concessions Merkel has agreed to make to the SPD, she argued that the coalition deal was the best she could get.

""We're not going to throw a mandate to govern before the voters' feet just because we're disappointed,"" Merkel said. ""People have always been able to count on the CDU to take responsibility for the country. That's the CDU brand.""

Read more: Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU conservatives debate a rightward shift

She also defended her decision to give the SPD control over the powerful Finance Ministry.

""Should we have allowed the deal to fail just because of this one position?"" she asked. ""My answer is no.""

Merkel argued that the economy ministry, which the CDU would control, was a worthy replacement, but the applause from delegates was noticeably lukewarm.

There has been speculation that Merkel may not serve out a full fourth term if the coalition is approved

Addressing perceived shortcomings

Merkel blamed the CDU's loss of support on public insecurity about Germany taking in large numbers of refugees, technological changes to society and conflicts in the EU and the world. Merkel said the coalition agreement addressed these misgivings and reflected the policies the CDU had advocated in last year's election, particularly with regard to families.

She was also at pains to assure the rank-and-file that the agreement would require integration from the over 1 million migrants Germany has accepted in recent years – the issue that has been Merkel's biggest Achilles' heel.

The chancellor also promised that her next government would not go any further into debt while making ""record investments"" for the future. She stressed that the coalition agreement, entitled ""New Impetus for Europe,"" would strengthen Germany by strengthening the EU.

""The destiny of Germany and Europe lies in our hands,"" she told delegates. ""We want to shape that destiny before others do. That's why we need a new impetus for Europe.""

The need for 'tact and courage'

The conference was called to greenlight the coalition agreement, but it was also an occasion to smooth some of the friction over the present and future direction of Germany's main conservative party. Traditionalists within the CDU haven't been particularly enamored with Merkel's centrist and pragmatist policies. Indeed there has been some internal debate as to whether the CDU is even still a conservative party.

In a nod to that faction, the conference began with an ecumenical religious service, as if to remind everyone in attendance of what the C in CDU stands for.

""What's unique about the CDU is our Christian view of humankind,"" Merkel said toward the end of her keynote speech.

Merkel still has the support of her party but is weaker than in the past

At the same time, there is broad consensus that the party needs to modernize itself. That was reflected not only in the relative youth of Merkel's nominees, made on Sunday, for her potential next government.

""We have a very good team and have found excellent people for the tasks that await us in the Cabinet,"" CDU parliamentary leader Volker Kauder told DW. ""With a lot of tact and courage, Angela Merkel has presented us with something very good.""

One phrase sums up Merkel's dilemma. The chancellor needs to show enough tact to avoid putting off older party members while displaying sufficient courage for innovation to pacify the CDU's often disgruntled youth ranks.

For now, the CDU is still very much Merkel's party, but her position now is weaker than it has been at any time since she first assumed the chancellorship in 2005, as the comparatively tepid response to Merkel's speech made clear. The third grand coalition government Merkel is attempting to form remains less popular among conservatives than either of its predecessors.

Not enough CDU in the coalition deal?

Resistance to a continuation of the grand coalition may be far stronger within the SPD than among CDU members. But a handful of critics did brave the frigid temperatures in Berlin to try to persuade their fellow party members to vote against the coalition deal.

""There isn't enough CDU in this agreement,"" one critical member, who didn't want to be identified by name, told DW. She said she was afraid that there would be rampant spending under a renewed conservative-SPD alliance. She also didn't neglect to point out her belief that refugees should integrate into mainstream German society or leave the country.

But nowhere near enough delegates followed that argumentation to trip up Merkel's plans for her next government. Although many of the speakers had critical words for Merkel, very few of them directly challenged the coalition agreement.

The irony is that despite winning September's election and once again demonstrating her ability to get conservatives, however grudgingly, to follow her lead, Merkel's political future depends on the rank-and-file of the rival SPD.

Social Democratic Party members are currently voting on the coalition deal by mail. Results are expected on or around March 4. Merkel now needs their help to ensure another term in Germany's most powerful political office."
Norway will spend $13 million to upgrade its doomsday seed vault -,https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/26/17052690/doomsday-seed-vault-upgrade-13-million,"Norway will spend 100 million Norwegian Crowns ($12.7 million) to upgrade the doomsday seed vault it built 10 years ago. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault was constructed in an abandoned Arctic coal mine to store and safeguard the world’s crops and plants from global natural or man-made disaster. If nuclear war or global warming kills certain crops, governments will be able to request seeds from the vault to restart their agricultural industries.

The Norwegian government says the upgrades will include the construction of a new concrete access tunnel and a service building that will house “emergency power and refrigerating units and other electrical equipment that emits heat through the tunnel.” Norway’s minister of agriculture and food, Jon Georg Dale, said the building work will begin soon. “It is a great and important task to safeguard all the genetic material that is crucial to global food security,” Dale said in a statement.

The vault is located on a remote island in the Svalbard archipelago between Norway and the North Pole and has the capacity to store 4.5 million crop varieties. It currently holds more than 890,000 samples from nearly every country in the world, including varieties of staple crops like maize, rice, wheat, cowpea, barley, and potato.

Researchers previously withdrew seeds for the first time from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2015. These were used to create seed banks in Morocco and Lebanon after the region’s central seed bank in Aleppo in Syria was damaged during the country’s civil war. The seeds have since been regrown and were redeposited at the Norwegian vault in 2017.

Last year, melting permafrost caused by unusually warm temperatures seeped into the seed vault, but fortunately, water didn’t flood into the vault itself. The island the seed vault is built on is also home to the World Data Archive, a place where instead of seeds, data is stored on reels of specially made film and kept safe."
Mining for asteroids will be the next gold rush,https://nypost.com/2018/02/24/mining-for-asteroids-will-be-the-next-gold-rush/,"Forget cryptocurrency — the next big “gold rush” isn’t even on Earth.

Physicist Michio Kaku, writing in his new book “The Future of Humanity” (Doubleday), believes a bonanza is coming from mining asteroids, which he calls “flying gold mine[s] in outer space.”

NASA defines asteroids as “cosmic ‘leftovers’ from the solar system’s formation about 4.5 billion years ago,” with some containing iron, nickel, carbon, cobalt and other precious metals such as platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium. These substances are all found on Earth but are rare and running out — making the search to replace them increasingly urgent.

Humanity stands to benefit massively from harnessing these rocks. One example — 3,000 feet across — was recently estimated to contain 90 million tons of platinum, worth around $5.4 trillion. A smaller asteroid — about 100 feet across — could contain materials worth between $25 billion and $50 billion on Earth.

There are about 16,000 asteroids labeled “near-Earth objects,” which means that their orbits cross Earth’s path, and astronomers have identified 12 nearby asteroids with the highest potential for mining.

Kaku predicts that asteroid mining will resemble a 19th century cattle supply chain, in which cattle was herded from the Wild West and sent to Chicago, where meat was processed and then sent off to other urban areas. “The moon would be like the Chicago of the future,” he writes, “processing valuable minerals from the asteroid belt for shipment back to Earth.”

There are three types of asteroids: “C-type,” “S-type” and “M-Type.” S-types contain high concentrations of metal, iron, nickel and cobalt but little water, while M-types are the most lucrative, boasting 10 times the amount of metal. (Asteroids usually remain in stable orbit in the asteroid belt, but when one breaks off into space and hits the Earth’s atmosphere, it burns up as a meteor — and often we can see them in the night sky as shooting stars.)

C-type asteroids — the most common type, making up 75 percent of asteroids — contain hydrated clay materials that can be mined for water in space. This water could then be turned into rocket propellant via a process called electrolysis, which might one day allow astronauts to refuel their crafts in space and explore even deeper into the cosmos.

With this much “gold” floating around the solar system, it’s no wonder Planetary Resources, a company backed by Google co-founder Larry Page and “Avatar” director James Cameron, promises it will send out exploratory spacecraft to collect data and asteroid samples by 2020.

NASA also jumped on the bandwagon by launching a $1 billion probe called OSIRIS-REx in 2016 to explore the 1,600-foot wide Bennu asteroid that will pass Earth in 2132. The probe will land, retrieve some rocks and return to Earth to help us figure out how much we stand to gain from space debris.

So how much of this “gold” is out there? If you put together all the masses of the solar system’s known asteroids, they would add up to just 4 percent of the mass of the moon. “However, the majority of these objects have not yet been detected by us, and there are potentially billions of them,” Kaku writes.

And while “small asteroids are much more numerous than large ones,” according to NASA, “even a little, house-sized asteroid should contain metals possibly worth millions of dollars” — enough to tempt any 21st century prospector into staking a claim.

Michio Kaku also writes about what aliens probably look like."
Russians Rally For Slain Kremlin Critic Nemtsov,https://www.rferl.org/a/russians-commemorate-slain-nemtsov-demonstrations/29061377.html,"Demonstrators marched in Russian cities on February 25 to commemorate slain Kremlin critic and former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov.

Rallies were held in numerous cities across Russia ahead of the third anniversary of Nemtsov's murder, which drew international condemnation and highlighted the dangers faced by Russians who oppose the Kremlin.

Nemtsov, a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin, was shot dead on a Moscow bridge overlooking the Kremlin on February 27, 2015.

Thousands marched in central Moscow in a demonstration featuring placards with slogans such as ""Democracy is the right to kick out authorities"" and ""I'm against the annexation of Crimea,"" a reference to Russia's 2014 seizure of the Ukrainian peninsula on the Black Sea.

One group of protesters carried a banner that read ""Retribution is inevitable: We won't forget, we won't forgive.""

Some demonstrators chanted ""Putin is a thief"" and ""We are Boris Nemtsov.""

One Russian group that monitors crowd sizes at public demonstrations estimated that as many as 7,600 participated in the Russian capital, while Moscow police put the figure at 4,500.

Kremlin critics frequently accuse authorities of underestimating crowd sizes at protests in order to portray them as marginal events.

Prominent liberal opposition politicians attended the Moscow demonstration as well. They included Grigory Yavlinsky and Ksenia Sobchak, who are running for president in a March 18 election that is all but guaranteed to hand Putin a new six-year term.

One demonstrator in Moscow, who gave his name only as Vadim, said he was ""protesting against a dictatorship.""

""You have to do something, take at least one step to make things better,"" Vadim, who said he is a pensioner, told RFE/RL.

Organizers in St. Petersburg, meanwhile, said nearly 2,000 people turned out to commemorate Nemtsov. Authorities said 350 people participated.

In the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, activists said police attempted to detain a protester who was waving a Ukrainian flag but that his fellow demonstrators prevented them from doing so.

Earlier on February 25, dozens of Nemtsov's supporters marched in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk and the capital of Russia's Tatarstan region, Kazan, on February 25. In Novosibirsk, demonstrators staged a rally at a monument to victims of political repression.

Two liberal activists were reportedly detained by police in St. Petersburg as the made their way to the demonstration, while two members of a nationalist group were reportedly detained by Moscow police as they approached the site of the march in the capital.

In July, a Moscow court found five men from Russia's North Caucasus region of Chechnya guilty of the murder and sentenced them to lengthy prison terms.

But relatives and associates charge that his assassination was ordered at a higher level. They say justice will not be served until the person or people who ordered the killing are identified and prosecuted.

As with previous high-profile killings -- including the murder of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 -- government critics have voiced suspicion that the culprits will never face justice because an honest investigation could lead to figures who are close to Moscow-backed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov or to Putin's inner circle.

The February 25 demonstrations come just days after Moscow's mayor said a plaque honoring Nemtsov will be mounted on the apartment building where he lived in the Russian capital.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote on Twitter on February 22 that the decision to mount the plaque was made following a request from a presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak.

Moscow authorities had previously prevented activists from installing a similar plaque on the bridge where Nemtsov was shot dead, where supporters have established a makeshift memorial to the slain politician.

That memorial has been repeatedly ransacked or removed by police or unidentified individuals.

Russian hockey players sing banned national anthem after beating Germany to win gold,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/russians-sing-banned-anthem-beating-germany-win-gold-082737367--nhl.html,"By Dan Burns and Steve Keating

GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Kirill Kaprizov scored in overtime to lead the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) past a feisty Germany 4-3 on Sunday to win the men's ice hockey gold before joining his team mates to defy a ban by singing the Russian national anthem during the medal ceremony.

The Russians, competing as neutral athletes at Pyeongchang as punishment for a years-long Russian doping scandal, came back from one-goal down on a goal by Nikita Gusev with less than a minute left in regulation time to force overtime in one of the most pulsating finals in the history of Olympic hockey.

At their medal ceremony, the players team sang the Russian anthem over the sound of the Olympic anthem at the Gangneung Hockey Centre despite being barred from having their flag raised or anthem played.

The game was played hours after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided not to restore their delegation's Olympic status, which would have enabled them to march under their flag at the closing ceremony later on Sunday.

The team's assistant captain Ilya Kovalchuk said the players had discussed beforehand whether to sing the anthem if they were to win, and they agreed they would.

""We knew that we will do it if we win,"" said Kovalchuk, the all-time leading Russian goal-scorer in Olympic play.

Singing the Russian anthem on the field of play is a violation of the IOC's rules on neutrality, which were imposed on Russia as part of sanctions punishing the nation over systematic doping across many sports.

The victory marked the first time a team from Russia have won the gold medal in hockey since 1992, when the so-called Unified Team representing Russia and five other former Soviet republics beat Canada for the Olympic championship.

""It means a lot. We didn't win Olympics since '92,"" Kovalchuk said. ""It was a while ago. That was our dream. That was my dream for when I was five years old, when I started playing. It's great and it feels good.""

WILD GAME

The game was a thriller from the start and ended with flair, a perfect one-time slap shot from Kaprizov that ripped past German goaltender Danny aus den Birken with Germany's Patrick Reimer off for high sticking.

Kaprizov had been fed the puck by the other Russian hero of the game, Gusev, who netted two third period goals, including the one that tied it, sending the game to overtime with less than a minute to go and the Germans looking like they were about to pull off a huge upset. Gusev finished as the Olympic tournament's points leader with four goals and eight assists.

The Russians found themselves evenly matched by a German team who surprised the hockey world by making it to their first Olympic final. With the loss, the Germans won silver, their best finish ever in Olympic ice hockey and their first medal since a bronze at the Innsbruck games in 1976.

On paper the final shouldn't have been a fair fight, but the Germans, playing hockey for a country primarily obsessed with football, skated evenly with the OAR, a team loaded with top home-grown talent from Russia's Kontinental Hockey League, seen as the world's second-best league after the NHL, and led by ex-NHL all stars Pavel Datsyuk, their captain, and Kovalchuk.

The Germans had punched above their weight to get to the final, beating hockey powerhouses Sweden and Canada, and they were not about to quit with the gold medal on the line.

They came back twice from one-goal deficits and took the lead late on a goal by Jonas Muller, who beat Vasili Koshechkin between the legs, only to have their hearts broken by Gusev and Kaprizov.

""It's a little tough right now because we all felt we could have won that game, but that's hockey, that's just the way it is,"" German coach Marco Sturm said. ""We all thought we would sit at home and watch the final on the couch. But here we are. The boys are going to bring silver home and they should be proud.""

BRATISLAVA. Reportéra online spravodajského portálu Aktuality.sk Jána Kuciaka zavraždili. Pre Denník N to potvrdilo ministerstvo vnútra.

Kto bol Ján Kuciak Narodil sa v obci Štiavnik, mal 27 rokov. Vyštudoval žurnalistiku na Filozofickej fakulte Univerzity Konštantína Filozofa v Nitre, na katedre žurnalistiky pokračoval ako doktorand. V minulosti pracoval aj v denníku Hospodárske noviny, neskôr sa presunul na portál aktuality.sk, kde sa venoval investigatíve.

Policajný šéf Tibor Gašpar na tlačovej besede uviedol, že smrť novinára a jeho družky pravdepodobne súvisí s jeho prácou.

Ministerstvo financií už vyčlenilo odmenu milión eur pre každého, kto pomôže k odhaleniu a dolapeniu páchateľa. Premiér Robert Fico označil za najdôležitejšie to, aby sa to podarilo spraviť čo najskôr.

Ak sa potvrdí, že investigatívny novinár Ján Kuciak bol zavraždený pre svoju prácu, generálny prokurátor Jaromír Čižnár rozpúta peklo.

Oznámil to na mimoriadnom brífingu s tým, že ak bola motívom vraždy jeho práca, potom nie je možné, aby sme si hovorili, že sme právny a demokratický štát.

Vyšetruje aj NAKA

Kto bola Martina Kušnírová Vyštudovala archeológiu na Univerzite Konštantína Filozofa v Nitre, v odbore získala magisterský titul v roku 2014. Zamestnala sa v súkromnej spoločnosti Acantha Archeology, ktorá sídli v Lučenci. Vo firme pracovala štyri roky. S Jánom Kuciakom chystali svadbu, nedávno kúpili dom v obci Veľká Mača v galantskom okrese.

„Nasadíme maximálne počty síl a policajtov, aby sme sa pokúsili celú vec čo najskôr objasniť. Slovensko ešte nečelilo tak bezprecedentnému útoku na novinára,“ povedal Gašpar.

Dodal, že polícia robí preventívne opatrenia, aby neboli ohrození iní novinári. Zároveň oslovila redakciu aktuality.sk, aby zistili, na čom redaktor v posledných dňoch pracoval.

S ľuďmi z tohto portálu budú podľa Ficových slov vyšetrovatelia intenzívne komunikovať a budú ich aj nadštandardne informovať o priebehu vyšetrovania, keďže by mohli byť pri objasňovaní vraždy nápomocní.

Fico to ohlásil po pracovej porade s generálnym prokurátorom Jaromírom Čižnárom, na ktorej sa zúčastnil aj minister vnútra Robert Kaliňák.

Do domu vo Veľkej Mači prišla polícia v nedeľu. Matka Martiny, priateľky Jána Kuciaka, zavolala na políciu, pretože sa nevedela skontaktovať s dcérou. Keď policajti prišli na miesto, zistili, že novinár bol strelený do hrude, jeho priateľka do hlavy. Polícia tak predpokladá, že vražda sa mohla udiať niekedy medzi štvrtkom a nedeľou. Na prípade pracujú aj elitní policajti NAKA.

Ulica, kde sa udalosť odohrala, je zahradená policajnými páskami. Ľudia z okolitých domov hovoria, že si nič podozrivé nevšimli ani nepočuli. Dom si Kuciak mal kúpiť spolu s priateľkou len nedávno. Postupne si ho začali prerábať.

Nič viac o Kuciakovi a jeho partnerke nevedeli povedať ani na obecnom úrade vo Veľkej Mači. Vzhľadom na to, že si dom kúpili len v júli, miestni ich nestihli bližšie spoznať.

O streľbe sa miestni dozvedeli z médií, nič podozrivé si nevšimli. Policajti aj naďalej pokračujú v obhliadke miesta činu, páskami prehradili aj ďalšie ulice v okolí.

Venoval sa investigatíve

Kuciak sa v Aktualitách dlhodobo venoval investigatívnym témam. Písal napríklad o daňových podvodoch v súvislosti s bytovkou Five Star Residence, v ktorej mal byty podnikateľ Ladislav Bašternák.

Ján Kuciak podal vlani septembri trestné oznámenie na Mariána Kočnera, podnikateľa známeho z tzv. mafiánskych zoznamov, za vyhrážanie.

""Ubehlo 44 dní, odkedy som podal na MK trestné oznámenie za vyhrážanie. A prípad zrejme ešte ani nemá konkrétny policajt,“ napísal na jeseň facebooku.

Kočner telefón zložil, na následnú otázku v sms, či ho kontaktovala polícia so žiadosťou o spoluprácu odpovedal protiotázkou, či už polícia so žiadosťou o spoluprácu kontaktovala denník SME. Následne zopakoval, že s denníkom SME odmieta komunikovať.

Podľa Gašpara policajný vyšetrovateľ dospel k tomu, že Kočnerove vyhrážanie Kuciakovi nebolo ani priestupkom.

Vražda sa odohrala cez víkend v jeho byte v obci Veľká Mača neďaleko Trnavy. Druhou obeťou vraždy je Kuciakova priateľka.

Krutá poprava

Vydaveteľstvo Ringier, pod ktoré portál aktuality.sk patrí, zaslalo k udalosti písomné stanovisko. ""Sme šokovaní a zhrození správou, že Ján Kuciak a jeho partnerka sa pravdepodobne stali obeťami krutej popravy. Napriek tomu, že celkové pozadie ešte nie je úplne objasnené, existuje dôvod domnievať sa, že tento zločin súvisí so súčasnou investigatívou nášho kolegu,"" napísali z vydavateľstva.

""Ján Kuciak pracoval pre Ringier Axel Springer Slovakia tri roky. Smútime s jeho rodinou, priateľmi a kolegami. Budeme robiť všetko čo je v našich silách, aby sme podporili orgány činné v trestnom konaní pri identifikácii páchateľov. V prípade, že tento zločin bol pokusom odradiť nezávislého vydavateľa, akým je Ringier Axel Springer, od odhalenia porušení zákona, použijeme to ako príležitosť na ešte väčšie posilnenie našej novinárskej zodpovednosti. V mene všetkých kolegov by sme chceli touto cestou vyjadriť rodine aj blízkym úprimnú sústrasť.""

Slovensko nemá v modernej histórii skúsenosť s vraždou novinára. Pred desiatimi rokmi zmizol investigatívny reportér Pavol Rýpal, ktorý sa dlhodobo venoval témam spojených s mafiou. Spolupracoval s Reportérmi Slovenskej televízie, predtým s Paľbou televízie Markíza, neskôr s Reflexom, písal aj pre časopis Plus 7 dní.

Od roku 2015 je nezvestný aj reportér Hospodárskych novín Miroslav Pejko."
Thousands protest deadly drug war in the Philippines,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/thousands-protest-deadly-drug-war-philippines-180224084450606.html,"Catholic cardinal leads ‘walk for life’ and denounces ‘throwaway culture’, which he says has cost many Filipino lives.

Demonstrators have taken to the streets of Manila to protest Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte‘s drug war, which has left thousands of people dead, and to express their opposition to plans to change the Constitution.

Catholic groups held a predawn “walk for life” on Saturday against the drug killings, as well as the proposed restoration of the death penalty.

In his message, Luis Antonio Tagle, the cardinal of Manila, denounced the growing “throwaway culture”, which he said has left many “casualties” including human lives.

{articleGUID}

“We will not tire in walking for life even if the path ahead is winding and soaked in blood,” Tagle said in Filipino, without directly referring to Duterte’s drug war.

The church-led protest took place as the country celebrated the anniversary of the 1986 popular revolt, which deposed Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and ended his 20-year rule.

Since Duterte came into office in 2016, the Catholic church has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of his deadly anti-drug policy.

The death toll in the drug war already surpassed 20,000 in the first 20 months of the Duterte presidency, according to an opposition senator.

The government insists the death toll is much lower at 3,967 between July 1, 2016, to November 27, 2017.

In a video clip posted by online news site Rappler, Manila Bishop Broderick Pabillo said Filipinos should not be indifferent, whether the number of drug war deaths is big or small.

“It’s not about the numbers, because the policy continues,” Pabillo told reporters. “If we are not vigilant, it’s possible that the killings will escalate. So we should not ignore this.”

More than 80 percent of the 101 million Filipinos are Catholics. But Duterte has managed to fend off criticism from the church, calling church leaders “hypocrites”.

‘High approval rating’

The president also enjoys high approval rating, with 71 percent satisfaction rate in December, according to the local polling agency Social Weather Stations.

Elsewhere in Manila on Saturday afternoon, an assembly of left-wing groups, students, church workers and activists held a separate march calling for “resistance” against Duterte, whom they likened to the dictator, Marcos.

Demonstrators raised their fists as they carried banners denouncing the “dictatorship” and Duterte’s plan to change the Constitution.

“We are here to show that we are capable of fighting the dictator Duterte,” a leader of the march said in a video clip posted on social media.

The protesters partially blocked traffic along the route of the march.

On Friday, thousands of students across the country also joined a school walkout.

Harry Roque, spokesman of the president said, the anti-government protests are proof that “democracy and freedom are very much alive in the Philippines.”

Roque said Duterte is “open to constructive criticism”.

Meanwhile, thousands of uniformed police officers, their family members and supporters held a counter-march near the national police headquarters in Manila in support of the Duterte’s drug war.

“Fight and defeat drugs,” read one banner carried by the demonstrators."
700-Foot-Tall 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan to Become Largest Purposely-Demolished Building In World History,https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/02/270-park-avenue-to-become-largest-purposely-demolished-building-in-world-history.html,"The Park Avenue corridor north of Grand Central is about to sprout yet another major new addition. 432 Park Avenue opened as the tallest residential tower in the country earlier this decade. 425 Park Avenue is currently under construction, and will soon become an 892-foot tall office building. And now, 270 Park is set for demolition and rebirth as a supertall, stretching to an eventual pinnacle 1,200 feet above street level.

In a joint announcement with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and JPMorgan Chase, YIMBY learned yesterday that the bank is planning a new building to replace its headquarters at 270 Park Avenue, between East 47th and 48th Street. The project would make history as the largest intentionally demolished building in world history.

Natalie de Blois of SOM designed the existing 707-foot tall structure at 270 Park Avenue in 1957, and it was completed in 1961. Most recently, the structure achieved Platinum-LEED certification in 2012, after the largest renovation of its type. With JPMorgan Chase’s historical penchant for choosing designs by SOM, it isn’t difficult to imagine that the firm could be behind the site’s replacement.

The site is expected to rise at least five hundred feet higher than the existing 700-foot tower. If it were to rise up to be exactly 1,200 feet, it would be tied with the Bank of America Tower as the eighth tallest building in New York City once complete, at least with the current skyline.

2.5 million square feet of space will be dedicated to the headquarters, expanding the employees on-site from 3,500 to 15,000, roughly six percent of their entire worldwide employment. Its most similar neighbor would be found six blocks southward, at One Vanderbilt, a rising office building set to peak at 1,401 feet.

The bank is the first partner to work on a major project with the City’s Innovative Midtown East Rezoning program, which passed last year. This will allow them to collaborate closely with government officials, including the NYC Council and Governor’s Office, to hasten the process.

“With a new headquarters at 270 Park Avenue, we are recommitting ourselves to New York City while also ensuring that we operate in a highly efficient and world-class environment for the 21st century,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chase. “We look forward to working constructively and collaboratively with Mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen, the New York City Council, and other key City and State officials on this important project.”

“This is our plan for East Midtown in action. Good jobs, modern buildings and concrete improvements that will make East Midtown stronger for the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who work here,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The Deputy Mayor for Housing and Economic Development, Alicia Glen, touched on the key law that allowed for this development to happen in the first place, saying, “It was barely six months ago that we secured the East Midtown rezoning into law, and building owners are already responding in a major way. This is a true win-win-win. The City of New York retains a major company and its employment base, the surrounding community sees improvements in its public spaces, and JPMorgan Chase will have a new headquarters that helps the firm compete for decades to come.”

The zoning rules were passed to allow new office space in the 78-block area around Grand Central. As YIMBY reported in January, the average office building in the neighborhood is 75 years old, and the zoning rules were becoming too restrictive for the natural replacement process to continue.

Chase announced they plan to work with their Supplier Diversity team to seek out Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs) for the project.

Demolition is anticipated to begin early next year, with hopes for completion by 2022 or 2023.

CCTV to be mandatory in every UK slaughterhouse.,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cctv-in-slaughterhouses-legislation-laid-in-parliament,"Legislation to make CCTV cameras mandatory in slaughterhouses in England to safeguard animal welfare has been laid today (23 February) by Environment Secretary Michael Gove.

The legislation will come into effect from May 2018, once it passes through Parliament, at which point businesses will have six months to comply.

In August 2017, the Secretary of State launched a consultation on the plans to deliver a manifesto commitment for CCTV to be required in every slaughterhouse in England in all areas where live animals are present, with unrestricted access to footage for Official Veterinarians - reassuring consumers that high welfare standards are being effectively enforced.

A summary of responses published in November showed that of almost 4,000 respondents, more than 99% were supportive of the plans.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove said:

We have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and want to cement our status as a global leader by continuing to raise the bar. Introducing compulsory CCTV cameras in slaughterhouses is a further demonstration to consumers around the world that as we leave the EU, we continue to produce our food to the very highest standards. The previous reaction to the consultation highlighted the strength of feeling among the public that all animals should be treated with the utmost respect at all stages of life and be subject to the highest possible welfare standards.

The proposals will also give the Food Standards Agency’s (FSA) Official Veterinarians (OVs) unfettered access to the last 90 days of footage to help them monitor and enforce animal welfare standards.

The FSA has strict processes in place for the approval of slaughterhouses, and specially trained vets carry out checks to make sure the welfare of animals is protected throughout their time in the slaughterhouse. If breaches are found, a slaughterhouse can be given a welfare enforcement notice, have its staff’s licences suspended or revoked, or be referred for a criminal investigation.

Heather Hancock, Chairman of the Food Standards Agency, said:

I welcome this new legislation being introduced. It will help businesses to improve animal welfare and hygiene standards across the industry. We look forward to working with the industry as CCTV plans are implemented, and to seeing public confidence rise as a result.

Businesses will have six months to comply with this legislation once it has passed through Parliament. The penalty for failing to comply will be an enforcement notice to the business or prosecution.

Mogadishu (AFP)

At least 18 people were killed and 20 wounded on Friday when two car bombs exploded in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, the city's main ambulance service said.

Jihadist rebels claimed the attack.

""We have so far collected 18 bodies and 20 wounded persons from one of the blast scenes,"" Abdukadir Abdurahman Aden of the Aamin Ambulance told AFP.

The bombings targeted the presidential palace and a city hotel, police said.

The first blast, followed by gunfire, occurred at a checkpoint close to Villa Somalia, the name for the seat of government, while a second followed soon after at a hotel.

""I can confirm an attack in the vicinity of the presidential palace,"" said police officer Ibrahim Mohamed.

""Another car loaded with explosives went off close to a recently opened hotel,"" Mohamed added.

The Islamist militant group the Shabaab, claimed the attacks in a statement posted online, saying it was targeting the government and security services.

The blasts follow weeks of relative calm in Mogadishu.

The Shabaab is fighting to overthrow Somalia's internationally-backed government. In October it carried out its deadliest-ever bombing, killing over 500 people.

In the wake of that attack Somalia's government declared a fresh offensive against the group and US drone strikes have increased in tempo.

While the militant group was pushed out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force it continues to control large parts of the countryside and launch regular attacks on government, military and civilian targets.

Federal judges to hear Pennsylvania district map challenge,http://ottawacitizen.com/pmn/news-pmn/federal-judges-to-hear-pennsylvania-district-map-challenge/wcm/7ec56363-f1cc-48b2-b95f-2134cb4225b3,"Article content

HARRISBURG, Pa. — A new congressional map in Pennsylvania on Friday survived a request from eight of the state’s Republican congressmen that federal judges throw it out immediately, but the case remained far from settled days before candidates will start collecting signatures to get on the primary ballot.

Hours after they were appointed to the case, a three-judge panel declined to temporarily hold up implementation of the map put in place by the state Supreme Court on Monday. The new map substantially overhauls a GOP-drawn one that has helped produce a predominantly Republican delegation and was widely viewed as among the nation’s most gerrymandered.

Police foil cocaine ring at Russian embassy in Buenos Aires,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/23/russian-embassy-cocaine-buenos-aires-police-arrests,"A former Russian diplomatic official and an Argentinian police officer are among those arrested in connection with a large cocaine seizure at the Russian embassy in Buenos Aires that prompted a year-long investigation into an international drug ring, officials have said.

The Argentinian security minister, Patricia Bullrich, said the 389 kilos (860 pounds) of cocaine were hidden inside luggage seized in December 2016. The Russian-Argentines Alexander Chikalo, who is suspected of being in charge of the logistics, and Ivan Blizniouk, a police officer accused of providing contacts to jump through customs controls, were arrested on Wednesday.

The investigation began after Victor Koronelli, the Russian ambassador to Argentina, and three members of the Russian federal security service told Bullrich of their suspicions about the diplomatic luggage found at a school annexed to the embassy.

After authorities confirmed that there were drugs inside the 16 pieces of luggage, they devised a plan to catch the criminals, swapping the cocaine for flour and placing a GPS to track the luggage.

“This has been one of the most complex and extravagant drug-dealing operations that Argentina has faced,” Bullrich said.

“At 3 am we had to send people from the border police to buy the 389 kilograms of flour to the central market [in Buenos Aires] because no one had 389 kilograms in a warehouse,” she said. “The drugs never travelled to Russia. Only the flour travelled.”

The luggage was flown to Russia in 2017. Bullrich said three Argentine customs officials journeyed to Russia to monitor the delivery, and that two men, Ishtimir Khudzhmov and Vladimir Kalmykov, were arrested when they went to collect the cargo.

A suspect, whom Bullrich referred to only as K, was in charge of buying the drug and introducing it to the embassy in Argentina. He is still at large in Germany and is wanted under an international arrest warrant.

The logistics were also coordinated by a former embassy official, Ali Abyanov, who was arrested in his Moscow apartment.

Authorities said the drugs had a street value in Russia of about $61m (£44m)."
Oregon lawmakers pass gun-control bill; first since Florida shooting,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/02/23/oregon-lawmakers-pass-gun-control-bill-after-florida-shooting/366216002/,"Oregon lawmakers pass gun-control bill; first since Florida shooting

Associated Press

Show Caption Hide Caption Voices: How gun control advocates are creating change With every mass shooting, positions on gun control seem to harden more with no major breakthroughs. These advocates are accelerating efforts to bypass the system and create change at the community level.

Fueled by anguished voices in the aftermath of the Florida high school shooting, Oregon's Legislature on Thursday banned people convicted of stalking and domestic violence or under restraining orders from buying or owning firearms and ammunition.

The passage of the bill by the state Senate on a 16-13 vote appears to mark the first time a state legislature has passed a gun-control measure since the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Florida, said Anne S. Teigen, a criminal justice expert with the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown had lobbied for the bill, telling a Senate committee this week to hear the anguished voices rising in the aftermath of the Florida attack in which 17 people were killed. The Democratic governor said she intends to sign into law the measure that the House earlier approved to protect victims of domestic violence.

Passage of the bill comes as the nation heatedly debates gun control in the wake of the Florida shooting

A group led by former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a 2011 shooting that left her with a brain injury, applauded the Legislature's passing of the so-called boyfriend loophole bill.

""Oregon is taking the lead to protect communities from gun violence,"" said Robin Lloyd, government affairs director for Giffords' nonprofit organization that seeks to save lives from gun violence.

Brown praised lawmakers after the bill passed both chambers, observing that ""it took the voices and outrage of youth devastated by gun violence to hold decision makers' feet to the fire.""

The House had approved the bill in a 37-23 vote on Feb. 15, with two Republicans including gubernatorial candidate Knute Buehler joining Democrats in voting ""aye.""

""I think survivors of domestic violence shouldn't have to live in fear that their abusers can obtain a firearm,"" Buehler had said.

Before Thursday's vote, Sen. Floyd Prozanski, a Democrat from the university town of Eugene, stood and urged his colleagues to support the bill. His voice cracking, he recalled that his sister was shot dead by her boyfriend in 1973 after she said she was leaving him. He cited statistics saying a woman is five times more likely to die if a gun present in domestic violence situation and 54 percent of mass shootings involve domestic violence.

Opponents said the law would violate Second Amendment protections on the right to bear arms. Unlawful possession of guns and ammunition is punishable by a maximum of 364 days' imprisonment, a $6,250 fine, or both.

One Democrat split from the rest of her caucus and joined the Republican senators in voting against the measure. Republicans said the bill could have been better crafted and that it was too complicated an issue to consider in the short 2018 legislative session.

The bill expands those who could be banned from owning guns and ammunition after a conviction, adding stalking as a qualifying crime, and adding those who are under a restraining order. Supporters said the bill closed a loophole in a 2015 law that excluded some abusers, such as boyfriends who abuse partners they don't live with.

An amendment proposed by Sen. Herman Baertschiger, a Republican from Grants Pass, to appropriate $20 million to the state police for implementing and enforcing firearms laws was voted down on Thursday by the Senate.

""Senate Democrats rejected additional funding to the state police,"" said Senator Republican Leader Jackie Winters. ""With additional funding, the state police would be freed up to enforce drug laws, gun laws, and increase public safety.""

Gov. Kate Brown is proposing an end to the so-called boyfriend loophole, which would prohibit individuals convicted of misdemeanor stalking or domestic violence from buying a gun."

""The campaign against it was so incredible. But you know what, the campaign for it was also incredible.""Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the State Department, elaborated on the administration's plans in a statement on Friday afternoon and noted that US diplomats are ""excited about taking this historic step, and look forward with anticipation to the May opening.""""Those consular operations, including American citizen and visa services, will continue at the Arnona facility without interruption, as part of the Embassy,"" Nauert said. ""Consulate General Jerusalem will continue to operate as an independent mission with an unchanged mandate, from its historic Agron Road location. Initially, the interim Embassy in Arnona will contain office space for the Ambassador and a small staff.""By the end of next year, we intend to open a new Embassy Jerusalem annex on the Arnona compound that will provide the Ambassador and his team with expanded interim office space,"" she continued.

Astronomers discover the most distant supernova ever confirmed through spectroscopy.,http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/02/astronomers-discover-the-most-distant-supernova-ever-detected,"In a new study published February 8 in The Astrophysical Journal, an international team of astronomers announced the discovery of the most distant supernova ever confirmed by spectroscopic measurements. Located some 10.5 billion light-years from Earth, this massive star exploded when the universe was just a quarter of its current age of 13.8 billion years.The supernova, dubbed DES16C2nm, was first detected back in August 2016 by the Dark Energy Survey , which is currently mapping several hundred million galaxies in order to learn more about the mysterious force known as dark energy. The distance and overall brightness of DES16C2nm was later confirmed in October 2017 using three of the world’s most powerful telescopes: the Very Large Telescope in Chile, The Magellan telescope also in Chile, and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.A supernova explosion occurs when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses in on itself due to the pull of gravity. If the star is not massive enough to form a black hole (less than around 20 solar masses), then its collapsing core eventually rebounds off itself and bursts outward in what we see as a supernova.DES16C2nm is a member of a rare breed of supernovae known as superluminous supernovae (SLSN). These blindingly bright explosions make up the rarest and most luminous class of supernovae, and researchers first discovered them just 10 short years ago. Astronomers think that SLSN, which can outshine even the brightest galaxies, are formed when material falls onto the densest objects in the universe (besides black holes) — neutron stars.“What we think could be happening here is that the stellar explosion produces a magnetar at its core: a rapidly spinning neutron star with a magnetic field 100 trillion times stronger than that on Earth,” said Chris D’Andrea, co-author and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, in a press release . “If we look at how the light from the superluminous supernova evolves in time, it matches very well models of the amount of energy that magnetars emit as they spin. This energy is hitting the winds of the ejected material from the stellar explosion and dramatically brightening what we’re seeing.”"
SpaceX launches demo satellites for its high-speed internet project,http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/technology/future/spacex-satellite-launch-february/index.html,"Elon Musk's goal of delivering high-speed internet to the world just got a little closer to reality.

SpaceX on Thursday launched a rocket carrying two experimental satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The satellites will test out the technology the company plans to use for its internet service, according to public filings.

The company kept the test satellites largely under wraps and chose to focus on the primary payload for Thursday's launch -- a defense and security satellite for the Spanish government called PAZ.

But Musk confirmed in a tweet the small internet satellites, which hitched a ride along with PAZ, made it into orbit. He said the satellites, nicknamed ""Tintin A"" and ""Tintin B,"" will attempt to beam the words ""hello world"" when they pass over Los Angeles Friday morning.

Tintin A & B will attempt to beam ""hello world"" in about 22 hours when they pass near LA — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22, 2018

First two Starlink demo satellites, called Tintin A & B, deployed and communicating to Earth stations pic.twitter.com/TfI53wHEtz — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22, 2018

SpaceX's internet ambitions have the support of Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai. On February 14, Pai urged the FCC to approve SpaceX's broader proposal to deliver ""broadband services directly to [people] anywhere in the United States or around the world"" at speeds similar to the quickest ground-based internet connections.

SpaceX eventually wants to put more than 10,000 tiny satellites into Low-Earth Orbit. The satellites will whisk around the planet about 335 km (208 miles) to 1,325 km (823 miles) above the Earth's surface.

Billions of people around the globe still lack internet access, so companies have been racing to find a better way to beam internet down from the sky.

Related: FCC chairman backs SpaceX plan for internet satellites

They include OneWeb, a startup that's attracted backing from the likes of Richard Branson's Virgin Group, Coca-Cola (KO) and Qualcomm (QCOM). It has approval from the FCC to send internet satellites into orbit.

If SpaceX gets approval for its satellite project, it'll be a first for an American-based company to join the race to provide internet via Low-Earth Orbit satellites, FCC Chairman Pai said.

Some of SpaceX's internal financial documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal last year show the company has high expectations for this satellite network.

""SpaceX projected the satellite-internet business would have over 40 million subscribers and bring in more than $30 billion in revenue by 2025,"" the Journal reported.

The PAZ satellite that SpaceX delivered for the Spanish government will stay in orbit for about five and a half years, making full loops around Earth 15 times per day, according to Airbus, the primary contractor for Paz. And it will capture images of our home planet -- day or night and no matter what the weather looks like -- using radar technology.

Earlier this month, SpaceX drew public attention with the launch of its massive new rocket, Falcon Heavy, which is now the most powerful operational rocket in the world.

There are plans to fly a communications satellite and a payload for the U.S. Air Force on board a Falcon Heavy later this year. But Thursday's launch used a Falcon 9, the rocket SpaceX has flown since 2010.

SpaceX is famous for its gravity-defying attempts to land rocket boosters after launch. It's successfully completed the task after more than 20 launches. The boosters -- which account for about 60% of the cost of a rocket -- are guided home so they can be reused on future missions, which brings down the cost of a single launch.

The rocket flown on Thursday used one of those pre-flown boosters, but SpaceX did not attempt another landing.

It did, however, attempt to recover the rocket's fairing, which is the white nose cone at the tip of the rocket that protects the satellites during launch.

A large ship outfitted with an enormous net, nicknamed ""Mr. Steven,"" went out to sea in an attempt to catch the fairing.

Musk confirmed via social media that the fairing missed the boat, but landed in one piece nearby.

""Missed by a few hundred meters, but fairing landed intact in water,"" Musk posted on Twitter. ""Should be able catch it with slightly bigger chutes to slow down descent.""

Paul Manafort and Rick Gates indicted on 32-counts,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/paul-manafort-rick-gates-indicted-32-counts/story?id=53286392,"Special counsel files 32-count indictment against former Trump campaign officials They were indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on 32 counts.

 -- A federal grand jury in Virginia has handed up a new 32-count indictment against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former top aide, Rick Gates.

In all, the two men face 16 counts related to filing false individual income tax returns, seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts, five counts of bank fraud conspiracy, and four counts of bank fraud.

Manafort and Gates are accused of hiding tens of millions income from lobbying work for the former government of Ukraine and failing to pay taxes on it in the U.S.

All told, special counsel Robert Mueller said more than $75 million was funneled through offshore accounts in Cyprus, the Grenadines, the Seychelles and the United Kingdom, and that Manafort, with the assistance of Gates, laundered more than $30 million to pay for personal expenses.

Manafort, prosecutors allege, spent $12 million on his home in the Hamptons, plus another $655,000 for landscaping. There were also $600,000 in payments to a clothing store in Beverly Hills.

Gates used millions in undisclosed income to pay his mortgage, his children’s tuition and on renovations to his home in Virginia, according to the indictment.

These new charges are in addition to charges already filed against Manafort and Gates in federal court in Washington. The two men were indicted in October on money laundering charges, failing to properly register as foreign agents, and lying to federal officials about lobbying and other activities that took place before and are unrelated to Trump's presidential campaign.

They pleaded not guilty to the previous charges.

With regard to the new charges, Manafort spokesperson Jason Maloni issued a statement saying: ""Paul Manafort is innocent of the allegations set out in the newly filed indictments and he is confident that he will be acquitted of all charges. The new allegations against Mr. Manafort, once again, have nothing to do with Russia and 2016 election interference/collusion. Mr. Manafort is confident that he will be acquitted and violations of his constitutional rights will be remedied.""

The charges stem from the Feb. 27, 2014 death of 89-year-old James Dempsey, a World War II veteran and patient at Northeast Atlanta Rehabilitation Center. The indictment alleges the defendants failed to provide timely medical assistance resulting in Dempsey's death.

The Brookhaven Police Department launched a criminal investigation after television station WXIA uncovered hidden camera video that showed nurses ignoring Dempsey as he repeatedly calls for help and gasps for air. It also shows the nurses failing to take life-saving measures and laughing as they try to start an oxygen machine. The station's report also uncovered video depositions in which the nurses changed their stories.

Dempsey's family sued the Northeast Atlanta Health and Rehabilitation Center in 2014. A statement from the center at the time says care has improved since then, under different leadership."
"Researchers create a roadmap for reducing radiation exposure to future astronauts who colonize space. It involves gene therapy, tissue and organ engineering, extended hibernation, and the use of RadAway-style drugs.",http://www.astronomy.com/magazine/press-releases/2018/02/roadmap-to-radioresistance,"An international team of researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Environmental and Radiation Health Sciences Directorate at Health Canada, Oxford University, Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, Insilico Medicine, the Biogerontology Research Center, Boston University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Lethbridge, Ghent University, Center for Healthy Aging and many others have published a roadmap toward enhancing human radioresistance for space exploration and colonization in the peer-reviewed journal Oncotarget.

""Our recent manuscript provides a comprehensive review of radioresistance for space radiation. Currently there is minimal research being done for radioresistance against HZE irradiation. The importance of these types of studies will be to reduce the associated health risks for long-term space exploration and allow for the development of potential countermeasures against space radiation. In addition, the synergy between understanding aging with radioresistance will allow for further benefits for humans in long-term space missions and allow for reduced health risk. This review sets the stage for the potential research the scientific community can do to allow for safe long term space exploration"" said Afshin Beheshti, an author of the paper and a Bioinformatician at NASA Ames Research Center.

The roadmap outlines future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, the coordination of regenerative and ablative technologies, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. The paper concludes by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well.

""This paper explores the foreseeable means by which human radioresistance could be biomedically enhanced for the purposes of space exploration and colonization. It also aims to elucidate the links between aging, longevity and radioresistance, and the ways in which research into enhancing human radioresistance could synergistically enable human healthspan extension, ultimately highlighting how ongoing research into the very well-funded sphere of aerospace research could galvinate progress in biomedical gerontology, a massively under-funded area of research despite the grave economic burden posed by demographic aging"" said Franco Cortese, an author of the paper and Deputy Director of the Biogerontology Research Foundation.

The publication of the paper in Oncotarget this week is timely, given the test launch of the Falcon Heavy, SpaceX's largest rocket to date, just last week. Interest into space exploration and even colonisation has been mounting for a number of years. Less than one year ago Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, unveiled a roadmap toward colonizing Mars, outlining the ambitious goal of placing a million people on Mars within the next 40 to 100 years. If interest in space colonization continues apace, research into methods of enhancing radioresistance to protect against the various forms of space radiation that spacefarers would be subjected to needs to be accelerated accordingly.

""In linking ageing and radioresistance and tying together research into enhancing the radioresistance of astronauts with the extension of healthy longevity, we hope to have shown how aerospace research could be used to leapfrog the massive funding deficit surrounding the clinical translation of healthspan-extending interventions, in order to brave the storm of the oncoming Silver Tsunami and prevent the looming economic crisis posed by demographic aging"" said Dmitry Kaminskiy, an author of the paper and Managing Trustee of the Biogerontology Research Foundation.

The roadmap highlights the need to converge and accelerate research in radiobiology, biogerontology and AI to enable spacefarers to address both the healthcare challenges that we are already aware of, as well as those that we are not.

""Sooner or later we'll have to do it - leave Earth and wander into deep space. Such travel, taking one or more years outside the Earth's magnetosphere, would take a high toll on astronauts' health due to exposure to cosmic radiation. So it's better to start thinking now about how we are going to cope with that challenge. Luckily, current knowledge from such fields as radiobiology, aging research and biotechnology in general, with the wealth of recent advances in gene editing and regenerative medicine, allow for the drafting of conceptual roadmaps to enhance human resistance to cosmic radiation. This is exactly what this work is all about. It was fun and a pleasure to partake in this theoretical project with such a diverse international team. We were just throwing ideas on the table, some being quite ambitious and futuristic, and then examining them carefully for feasibility and assessing their potential. The work laid out several interesting directions and concepts that can eventually pay off. Last but not least, I think it is also very important to attract widespread attention and interest to this topic"" said Dmitry Klokov, an author of the paper and Section Head of the Radiobiology & Health section at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories.

Furthermore, given the massive amount of funding allocated to research into facilitating and optimizing space exploration and optimization, the researchers hope to have shown how research into enhancing radioresistance for space exploration could galvanize progress in human healthspan extension, an area of research that is still massively underfunded despite its potential to prevent the massive economic burden posed by the future healthcare costs associated with demographic aging.

""This roadmap sets the stage for enhancing human biology beyond our natural limits in ways that will confer not only longevity and disease resistance but will be essential for future space exploration"" said João Pedro de Magalhães, an author of the paper and a Trustee of the Biogerontology Research Foundation.

The Biogerontology Research Foundation is a UK non-profit research foundation and public policy center seeking to fill a gap within the research community, whereby the current scientific understanding of the ageing process is not yet being sufficiently exploited to produce effective medical interventions. The BGRF funds and conducts research which, building on the body of knowledge about how ageing happens, aims to develop biotechnological interventions to remediate the molecular and cellular deficits which accumulate with age and which underlie the ill-health of old age. Addressing ageing damage at this most fundamental level will provide an important opportunity to produce the effective, lasting treatments for the diseases and disabilities of ageing, required to improve quality of life in the elderly. The BGRF seeks to use the entire scope of modern biotechnology to attack the changes that take place in the course of ageing, and to address not just the symptoms of age-related diseases but also the mechanisms of those diseases.

Parents and students chanting “Please make our schools safe” in a protest at the Laurel County Board of Education, February 21, 2018

Corbin attorney Shane Romines helped raise money for the metal detectors. In a Facebook video, Romines says the district will not use the added security.

Parents planned a protest for 9 a.m. Wednesday in front of the district's board of education.

""I just find it unfair that our board of education was offered funding for metal detectors to keep our children safe. They didn't take advantage of that opportunity,"" said Ashley Boggs, a parent of a child at the school.

Some kids joined their parents on the sidewalk, staying away from the schools today where the rumor mill has run rampant.

""I'm terrified for my children for our future. For the fact that they may not have a future,"" said Boggs.

Superintendent Dr. Doug Bennett released a statement about the decision on Wednesday morning."

"One of Germany's top courts will rule on Thursday whether heavily polluting vehicles can be banned from the urban centres of Stuttgart and D?sseldorf, a landmark ruling which could cause traffic chaos and dramatically hit the value of diesel cars on the country's roads.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/german-court-to-rule-on-city-bans-for-heavily-polluting-diesel-cars,"One of Germany’s top courts will rule next week on whether heavily polluting vehicles can be banned from the urban centres of Stuttgart and Düsseldorf, a landmark ruling which could cause traffic chaos and dramatically hit the value of diesel cars on the country’s roads.

Some 70 German cities have over the last year suffered from annual levels of nitrogen dioxide emissions above EU thresholds, with officials holding diesel cars responsible for 72.5% of the harmful levels of pollution.

The environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) earlier this year sued nine German cities because it wants to allow municipalities to enforce clean air regulations by banning diesel cars from city centres.

The federal administrative court in Leipzig was expected to announce on Thursday whether Stuttgart and Düsseldorf are allowed to use vehicle bans to try to improve air quality. But Judge Andreas Korbmacher delayed the decision, and said the country’s highest federal administrative court would now rule on 27 February.

Local courts ordered them to bar diesel cars which did not conform to the latest standards on days when pollution is heavy, startling German carmakers because an outright ban could trigger a fall in vehicle resale prices, and a rise in the cost of leasing contracts, which are priced on assumed residual values.



The German states concerned, where the carmakers and their suppliers have a strong influence, appealed against the decisions.

Diesel emissions, which contain particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx) known to cause respiratory disease, have come under closer scrutiny in the wake of Volkswagen’s 2015 admission that it cheated diesel exhaust tests.

Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. France and Britain will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 in a shift to electric vehicles.

"Brazil environmental agency Ibama will decide on French oil firm Total's application to drill in the environmentally sensitive Amazon river basin before the end of May, and possibly as soon as the end of March.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-total-brazil/brazil-to-decide-in-first-half-on-totals-amazon-river-basin-drilling-idUSKCN1G52YR,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil environmental agency Ibama will decide on French oil firm Total’s application to drill in the environmentally sensitive Amazon river basin before the end of May, and possibly as soon as the end of March, an agency official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Ibama last August ordered Total to provide information missing from its application for an environmental license to explore for oil in the Foz do Amazonas basin, warning that it was the oil company’s last chance to provide necessary details before the application is scrapped.

The agency received Total’s response at the end of January and has four months to evaluate the new report and issue a ruling, said Antonio Celso Junqueira Borges, the general coordinator for oil and gas licensing.

But Ibama could rule more quickly, Borges said.

“Total filed its supplement to its studies at the end of January, it’s in analysis,” he said.

“(The timeline for finishing the analysis) is the end of March, but could be delayed a bit more than that.”

He declined to comment on the chances of the application to explore being approved.

“All of the blocks offered in the 11th round are in environmentally sensitive areas. In many regions the modeling indicates that if there was an oil spill, it would reach the coast,” Borges said.

“Beyond that it’s a sensitive region, there are lots of fisherman and a great biodiversity, so it demands greater control and care,” he said.

Officials at Ibama said pre-salt areas in recent auctions, thought to contain vast amounts of oil, were unlikely to face the same problem because of their greater distance from the coast.

The analysis of Total’s application in Foz do Amazonas, once complete, must then pass through a series of approvals with the ultimate decision to be issued by the president of Ibama.

Total did not respond to request for comment.

The firm, leading a group of partners including BP Plc and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, won five blocks in Brazil’s 11th auction of oil blocks held in 2013. As the operator, Total is responsible for applying for environmental licenses.

Total is the farthest along in the application process for Foz do Amazonas basin blocks awarded in 2013, with BP and Queiroz Galvão Exploration and Production (QGEP) in earlier stages of applying for licenses with Ibama for separate blocks they won in region, according to the agency."
"Cougar walks right up to this Wisconsin home, looks into window",https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/west/news/brookfield/2018/02/19/cougar-makes-its-way-right-up-brookfield-home/351479002/,"Cougar makes its way right up to Brookfield home

Karen Pilarski | Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

Brookfield residents Dan and Bridget Guerndt found some large paw prints in their yard near Capitol Drive and Pilgrim Road, but they did not know what had created them until they looked at video from a mounted camera, which had picked up shots near their house.

What they found was unexpected.

It was a cougar.

The camera shows a cougar putting its paw prints on the Guerndt's window sill.

Brookfield police said Sunday, Feb. 18, a different resident on the suburb's northeast side contacted them around 5:45 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 17, when she saw a cougar under a pine tree in her backyard in the 4600 block of Raven Court. Officers responded and confirmed it was a cougar.

Agents from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources were called, and they also confirmed it was a cougar. Police said after conferring with the DNR employees, they agreed the DNR would return Sunday morning and ""attempt to deal with it."" Neighbors in the immediate area were told about the situation, police said.

But Sunday morning, the cougar, which was estimated to be 1½ years old, was gone. The DNR tracked the cougar in a southeastern direction, but lost the trail in the area of N. 135th and Hope streets.

Scott Walter, large carnivore specialist for the DNR, said cougars coming into populated areas is uncommon.

Walter said the cougar is likely a young male cougar, dispersing from the Black Hills region of South Dakota, which is the nearest established cougar population. Genetic analysis of animals dispersing through Wisconsin have been linked to that population, according to the DNR.

""After young males enter their second year, they begin dispersing looking for their own territory and a mate,"" Walter said.

Male cougars tend to disperse much farther than females. Male cougars wander at random, which is what the DNR is seeing with the Brookfield cougar, according to Walter.

It was at least the second sighting of a cougar in less than two weeks in the metro Milwaukee area. A cougar was videotaped Feb. 7 walking outside a home in Colgate in Washington County, according to the DNR.

That cougar was likely the same animal verified in a Jan. 5 trail camera image from Rosendale in Fond du Lac County, according to the DNR. It was unknown Sunday whether the cougar that appeared in Brookfield was the same one.

In the Colgate sighting, the cougar probably was a dispersing male. There is no evidence of a breeding population of cougars in Wisconsin, the DNR has said.

Walter said it is impossible to tell for sure if the Brookfield cougar is the same one spotted in Colgate. There is no genetic material, but Walter said it appears highly likely it is the same animal.

Although some news outlets reported the animal appeared to be passive and may have been injured or hit by a car, the DNR officials said the video suggests the cougar in Brookfield is healthy.

Cougars are solitary animals and are rarely dangerous, according to Walter. The animals are likely to move continuously in attempts to find a quiet place and hunker down. Cougars are most active at night, as dispersing male cougars make long movements at night to find a place to settle down.

Walter said it is rare for a cougar to attack a human, but encourages people with small pets to keep on eye on them.

""Cougars are wild animals and predators looking for wild prey to eat,"" he said.

If a cougar is spotted, contact local police. That department will let the DNR know about the sighting. People can also go to the DNR website and report a large mammal sighting.

Walter said the DNR has a response protocol but it depends on the context of the sighting. The Brookfield cougar was found in a brushy area with residents in the immediate vicinity. Officers couldn't neutralize the cougar or use a dart gun because of its proximity to homes and thick brush surrounding it, police said.

Other circumstances predicate the response, according to Walter such as if the animal is behaving strangely or if there is a perceived risk to people in the area.

"Amazon to Adapt 'Consider Phlebas' the first book in the Culture series, for TV Series",http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/924719-amazon-to-adapt-consider-phlebas-for-tv-series,"Amazon to adapt Consider Phlebas for TV series

Amazon Studios has acquired the global rights to adapt Consider Phlebas for television to air exclusively on Amazon Prime Video.

Consider Phlebas is the first novel in the acclaimed sci-fi Culture book series by celebrated Scottish writer Iain M. Banks. The series spans 10 titles, telling an epic space opera set in the highly-advanced galactic utopia of “Culture.”

A kinetic, action-packed adventure on a huge canvas, Consider Phlebas draws upon the extraordinary world and mythology Banks created in the Culture, in which a highly advanced and progressive society ends up at war with the Idirans, a deeply religious, warlike race intent on dominating the entire galaxy.

The story centers on Horza, a rogue agent tasked by the Idirans with the impossible mission of recovering a missing Culture ‘Mind,’ an artificial intelligence many thousands of times smarter than any human—something that could hold the key to wiping out the Culture altogether. What unfolds, with Banks’ trademark irreverent humor, ultimately asks the poignant question of how we can use technology to preserve our humanity, not surrender it.

Dennis Kelly (Utopia) will be writing the TV adaptation with Plan B Entertainment (World War Z, Moonlight) taking on production duties. The Estate of Iain Banks will be credited as Executive Producer.

“The story of the Culture is so rich and captivating that for years Hollywood has been trying to bring this utopian society to life on the screen,” said Sharon Tal Yguado, Head of Scripted Series at Amazon Studios. “We are honored that we have been chosen, along with Dennis Kelly and Plan B Entertainment, to make Consider Phlebas into a television series we think will be loved by fans for years to come.”

“Iain Banks has long been a hero of mine, and his innate warmth, humor and humanism shines through these novels,” said Dennis Kelly. “Far from being the dystopian nightmares that we are used to, Banks creates a kind of flawed paradise, a society truly worth fighting for—rather than a warning from the future, his books are a beckoning.”

“We revere the work of Iain Banks and continue to be moved by his inimitable spirit and his commitment to imagining a better future even in the darkest of times,” said Plan B. “Consider Phlebas, simultaneously explores the deepest questions concerning humanity and our future. We are so grateful to the Estate of Iain Banks for the opportunity to bring his work to life, and to Amazon for the scope of their ambition to building Iain’s prescient world.”"
Preacher Billy Graham dies at 99,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-billy-graham/billy-graham-preacher-to-millions-adviser-to-presidents-dies-at-99-idUSKCN1G51O9,"(Reuters) - U.S. evangelist Billy Graham, who counseled presidents and preached to millions across the world from his native North Carolina to communist North Korea during his 70 years in the pulpit, died on Wednesday at the age of 99, a spokesman said.

Graham died at 8 a.m. EST (1300 GMT) at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, according to Jeremy Blume, a spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.

According to his ministry, he preached Christianity to more people than anyone else in history, reaching hundreds of millions of people either in person or via TV and satellite links.

Graham became the de facto White House chaplain to several U.S. presidents, most famously Richard Nixon. He also met with scores of world leaders and was the first noted evangelist to take his message behind the Iron Curtain.

“He was probably the dominant religious leader of his era,” said William Martin, author of “A Prophet With Honor: The Billy Graham Story.” “No more than one or two popes, perhaps one or two other people, came close to what he achieved.”

Graham found himself at times in controversy over his disapproving stand on gay rights, as well as over a secretly recorded conversation with Nixon in which the cleric complained that Jews had too much influence on the U.S. media. In the later years of his career he intentionally muted his political beliefs to focus on the Gospel.

Graham was no longer a close associate of presidents in recent years but many former U.S. leaders paid tribute on Wednesday. President Donald Trump said on Twitter: “The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.”

In a rare trip away from his home in his later years, Graham had celebrated his 95th birthday on Nov. 7, 2013, at a hotel in Asheville, North Carolina, where some 800 guests, including Trump, business magnate Rupert Murdoch and television hostess Kathie Lee Gifford paid tribute.

The event featured a video of a sermon that his son Franklin said was Graham’s last message to the nation. Graham had been working for a year on the video, which was aired on Fox News. In it, he said America was “in great need of a spiritual awakening.”

With his steely features and piercing blue eyes, Graham was a powerful figure when he preached in his prime, roaming the stage and hoisting a Bible as he declared Jesus Christ to be the only solution to humanity’s problems.

In his heyday Graham had a thunderous, quick-burst speaking style that earned him the nickname “God’s Machine Gun.” Through his “Crusades for Christ,” Graham sowed fields of devotion across the American heartland that would become fertile ground for the growth of the religious right’s conservative political movement.

MEDIA MASTERY

His influence was fueled by an organization that carefully planned his religious campaigns, putting on international conferences and training seminars for evangelical leaders, Martin said.

Graham’s mastery of the media was ground-breaking. In addition to radio and publishing, he used telephone lines, television and satellites to deliver his message to homes, churches and theaters around the world.

Some 77 million saw him preach in person while nearly 215 million more watched his crusades on television or through satellite link-ups, a Graham spokeswoman said.

Graham started meeting with presidents during the tenure of Harry Truman. He played golf with Gerald Ford, skinny-dipped in the White House pool with Lyndon Johnson, vacationed with George H.W. Bush and spent the night in the White House on Nixon’s first day in office.

George W. Bush gave Graham credit for helping him rediscover his faith and in 2010, when it was difficult for Graham to travel, Barack Obama made the trip to the preacher’s log cabin home in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains.

Graham’s ties to the White House were mutually beneficial. His reputation was enhanced as preacher to the presidents, while the politicians boosted their standing with religiously inclined voters.

“Their personal lives - some of them - were difficult,” Graham, a registered Democrat, told Time magazine in 2007 of his political acquaintances. “But I loved them all. I admired them all. I knew that they had burdens beyond anything I could ever know or understand.”

Graham’s reputation took a hit because of Nixon after the release of 1972 White House tapes in which the two were heard making anti-Semitic comments. Graham later said he did not remember the conversation and apologized.

In the early half of his career, Graham often spoke his mind on social and political issues of the day, including his strong anti-communist sentiments. He dismissed Vietnam War protesters as attention-seekers and, while he eventually refused to hold segregated revival meetings, he did not take an active role in the 1960s civil rights movement.

But Graham’s politics were not as overt as those of some religious leaders who came after him, such as Pat Robertson, who ran for president in 1988, and Jerry Falwell, co-founder of the Moral Majority, an organization whose purpose was to promote Christian-oriented politics.

As he grew older, Graham said he felt he had become too involved in some issues and shifted to a middle-of-the-road position in order to reach more people. He did, however, dive into the gay marriage issue in 2012 when he came out in support of a state amendment to ban same-sex marriages in North Carolina. He also met with Republican Mitt Romney in October 2012 and told him he supported Romney’s run for the presidency.

FROM FARM TO PULPIT

William Franklin Graham was born on Nov. 7, 1918, into a Presbyterian family and was known as Billy Frank while growing up on a farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. As a teenager, he said he was mostly preoccupied with baseball and girls until he was moved by God after hearing a fiery revivalist in Charlotte.

After attending Bob Jones College, Graham ended up at a Bible school in Florida, where he would preach at his first revival, and was ordained in 1939 by a church in the Southern Baptist Convention. He received a scholarship to Wheaton College near Chicago, where he met Ruth Bell, whose parents were missionaries in China. They married in 1943.

Rather than work from a home church, Graham went on the road, preaching in tents and building a following. His breakthrough came with a 1949 Los Angeles tent crusade that was scheduled for three weeks but extended to eight because of the overflow crowds he attracted.

The success of the Los Angeles campaign and the fame it brought Graham was attributed to media magnate William Randolph Hearst, who had liked Graham’s style and anti-communist stance so much that he ordered his newspapers to give Graham a boost.

Graham eventually outgrew tent revivals and would preach at some of the most famous venues in the world, such as Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden in New York and London’s Wembley Stadium. He delivered sermons around the globe, including in remote African villages, China, North Korea, the Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

Liberals accused him of giving credibility to abusive governments while fundamentalist Christians criticized him for going to godless countries and promoting peaceful relations with them. Graham said he simply saw the trips as apolitical opportunities to win souls for Christ.

Graham concluded his career of religious campaigns in June 2005 in New York with a three-day stand that attracted more than 230,000 people, his organization said. He turned over his evangelical association to his son Franklin, who did not shy away from politics and frequently praised Trump once he became president.

Graham’s other four children were also evangelists.

A funeral at a venue that holds about 2,300 people is planned for March 2 in front of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina, his organization said. It said he will be buried on library premises next to his wife, Ruth. She died on June 14, 2007. The couple had two sons and three daughters.

Graham’s body will lie in repose next Monday and Tuesday at the Graham family house which is now at the library site, having been moved from its original location, also in Charlotte, said family spokesman Mark DeMoss.

When Graham began his ministry in 1950, he would preach under a tent he called a “canvas cathedral,” DeMoss said. He said having Graham’s funeral service under a tent is a reminder of how his ministry began.

Graham himself “personally approved the planning and details of the service some years ago,” said DeMoss, speaking at a press conference in Charlotte on Wednesday night.

REPUTATION

Graham maintained his public integrity even as other TV star evangelists such as Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart were hit in the 1980s by financial and sex scandals. To keep his reputation pristine, Graham had a policy of never being alone with any woman other than Ruth.

Graham’s closest presidential relationship was with Nixon, who offered him any government job he wanted - including ambassador to Israel. It turned out to be a painful relationship for Graham, who said Nixon and his circle misled him on the Watergate scandal.

Nixon aide H.R. Haldeman first mentioned Graham’s anti-Semitic remarks in a 1994 book, which Graham strongly denied. But when audio tapes from the Nixon White House were released in 2002, Graham could be heard referring to Jews as pornographers and agreeing with Nixon that the U.S. media was dominated by liberal Jews and could send the United States “down the drain.”

Graham, who had a long history of supporting Israel, apologized again after the tapes’ release and said he had no recollection of the conversation.

“If it wasn’t on tape, I would not have believed it,” Graham told Newsweek. “I guess I was trying to please. I felt so badly about myself - I couldn’t believe it. I went to a meeting with Jewish leaders and I told them I would crawl to them to ask their forgiveness.”

The author of more than two dozen books with titles such as “How to Be Born Again,” Graham also ran the weekly “Hour of Decision” radio program broadcast around the world on Sundays for more than 50 years.

Graham helped bring religion into the television age. He first put together a television show, which was eventually syndicated, in 1951 and began live broadcasts of his revival meetings in 1957 from New York’s Madison Square Garden.

In a 2011 Fox News interview, Graham was asked what he would do differently in his career.

“I would study more. I would pray more, travel less, take less speaking engagements,” he said. “I took too many of them in too many places around the world. If I had it to do over again I’d spend more time in meditation and prayer and just telling the Lord how much I love him.”

In addition to suffering with Parkinson’s disease for many years, Graham’s health problems in his later years included a broken hip, a broken pelvis, prostate cancer and installation of a shunt in his brain to control excess fluid. He was hospitalized in 2011, 2012 and 2013 for respiratory problems.

China Has Bought Brunei's Silence in South China Sea Dispute,https://www.thetrumpet.com/16927-china-has-bought-bruneis-silence-in-south-china-sea-dispute,"New Chinese military hardware remarkably more advanced

China’s military is not on par with the United States military, but it is “catching up,” according to a report released this week by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (iiss).

In its annual report titled “The Military Balance,” the iiss details how China has made “remarkable” progress in its military advancement, particularly in avionics, missile technology and naval capability. According to Bastian Giegerich, director of defense and military analysis at iiss, “in some selected areas, our assessment is indeed that China is doing more than just catching up.”

China has invested billions of dollars in its military to bring it into the 21st century. No longer content to be a regional power, China has made huge strides in the past year to take its military to the global stage. In 2017, China opened its first overseas base in the African nation of Djibouti. This allows Chinese naval vessels to operate farther from home for longer periods of time.

At the same time, the Chinese Navy continues to expand. In 2017, it launched its first Type 055 guided missile destroyer, the largest post-World War ii warship to be produced in Asia. It has seven more of these vessels under construction. China is also constructing a second aircraft carrier. Regarding China’s expanding navy, Giegerich told Die Welt, “In the last four years, China has built vessels with a total tonnage that is greater than the total tonnage of the French Navy and is roughly equivalent to the total tonnage of the British Royal Navy.”

The Chinese Air Force is also quickly catching up with American air superiority. It recently entered its own fifth-generation aircraft, the J-20, into service. Fifth-generation fighters incorporate stealth technology and have supersonic cruising speeds. This makes the J-20 a rival to America’s F-35 fighter. The model challenges America’s “monopoly on operational stealthy combat aircraft,” according to Dr. John Chipman, director general and chief executive at iiss.

Still, this new fighter is a serious problem for the West. Since the end of the Cold War, air superiority has given Western nations an advantage over their enemies. Planes could operate with relative freedom in combat zones. But, according to Giegerich, “those days now are over.”

The third area of advancement the report drew attention to was China’s missile capability. Its PL-15 extended-range air-to-air missile could enter service this year. “This weapon appears to be equipped with an active electronically scanned array radar, indicating that China has joined the few nations able to integrate this capability on an air-to-air missile,” reported Chipman.

The bbc reported that a “very long-range air-to-air missile [is] intended specifically to strike at tanker and command and control aircraft that now orbit out of harm’s way; essential but vulnerable elements in any air operation.” Improving air-to-air missile technology pushes American support aircraft even further from Chinese forces.

The J-20 fits right in with that strategy. As Business Insider reported, this new jet isn’t meant to go head to head with American jets. Instead of direct confrontation, these fighters deter confrontation almost completely:

Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australia Strategic Policy Institute, told Business Insider that the J-20 is a “fundamentally different sort of aircraft than the F-35.” Davis characterized the J-20 as “high-speed, long-range, not quite as stealthy (as U.S. fifth-gen aircraft), but [the Chinese] clearly don’t see that as important.” According to Davis, the J-20 is “not a fighter, but an interceptor and a strike aircraft” that doesn’t seek to contend with U.S. jets in air-to-air battles. Instead, “the Chinese are recognizing they can attack critical airborne support systems like awacs (airborne early warning and control systems) and refueling planes so they can’t do their job,” Davis said. “If you can force the tankers back, then the F-35s and other platforms aren’t sufficient because they can’t reach their target.”

Analysts call this China’s “anti-access area denial” strategy. This strategy is a combination of missiles, sensors and weaponry that tries to keep an enemy further away from its shores. By developing weaponry that attacks support aircraft, China can limit the range of the enemy’s attack aircraft.

The same strategy can be seen in the artificial islands China is creating in the South China Sea. Despite its repeated denials, China is militarizing those islands. It has placed anti-ship cruise missiles on them. Like the air-to-air missiles, these cruise missiles force American naval vessels to operate farther away from China in the event of a conflict.

All these advances in avionics, missile technology and naval capability create an overlapping defense grid that keeps potential enemies further away from China. The iiss report points out that China still lags behind in its ground combat capabilities. But China is working to prevent any enemies with superior forces from even being able to initiate a land war.

The iiss report confirms the Trumpet’s warning on China’s strategy in the Pacific. Trumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry warned that China is “steering the world toward war.” In our July 2016 issue, he pointed out that the Chinese regime is now challenging “seven decades of American naval dominance in the Pacific Rim.” This aggressive behavior “should alarm the world!” he wrote.

“Since Japan’s defeat in World War ii, America has protected this vital trade route and brought peace to this part of the world,” Mr. Flurry wrote. But because of new military technology, China is pushing America out of the region. American forces can no longer safely operate there. “China is intimidating the nations of Southeast Asia into submission to its will,” he wrote. “It is forcing these countries to do what it wants. Everything is headed in the direction of war.”

These new technologies make it much harder for America to confront China. America now risks significant losses if it ever needs to step in to defend its allies in Asia.

The reality is that China’s grand strategy in Asia preys on America’s broken will.

This is exactly what the iiss report outlines. While Western powers still have some advantages over Chinese forces, they need to exert a strong will to stay ahead of their rival. Along with continuing to develop better weapons, Western nations need to be “resistant to attempts to erode their cohesion and will in peacetime as well as war.”

The problem is that America’s will is already broken, as Bible prophecy said it would be (Leviticus 26:19). So is its cohesion with its allies. It has been weak in its responses to Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and elsewhere. It is pulling back as the foremost leader in the world, isolating itself from its traditional allies, and, despite its enormous spending on its advanced military, already losing battles of strategy against China.

China’s military expansion is a harrowing sign of what is about to befall America. To understand more about what the Bible says about China’s military advancement, be sure to read “China Is Steering the World Toward War.”"

In the summer of 2005, Graham preached at what he called his ""Final Crusade.""

Graham said: ""Deep inside we need something else. And that something else can be brought about by Jesus.""

""When I touch the podium, I can feel a new strength and a new power come and it's a thrilling thing for me to preach the gospel at this age,"" Graham said.

The three-day event in New York City was the culmination of a lifetime of evangelism -- seven decades of spreading the gospel to more than 200 million people in 185 countries around the world.

Graham once said: ""Jesus Christ, the son of God, has an answer to every problem that you face!""

Raised in the fundamentalist faith of his native North Carolina, Graham dedicated his life to Christ when he was 16, and was ordained a Baptist minister in 1939. He created his own brand of populist evangelism. His ""crusades,"" as he called them, were soon attracting millions in person and later through television.

""We are united, and are ready to march under the banner of almighty God, taking as our slogan that which we have on our coins, 'In God We Trust,'"" Graham once said.

Before long, Graham set his sights on the rest of the world, and took his ""crusades"" to Europe, Africa, India, the Far East. A staunch anti-communist, one of his cherished ambitions was to bring the gospel message to the officially atheist countries behind the Iron Curtain.

""I would say 80 to 90 percent of the Russian people believe in God. And they've had communism now for all these many years, but it-- they still believe in God,"" Graham said.

Graham's wife, Ruth, the daughter of medical missionaries, was raised in China. In 1988, the Grahams traveled there to encourage its fledgling Christian community.

""You have a great modernization program in China, and it's my prayer that there will be a great moral modernization program -- program, also,"" Graham said.

Graham became a counselor and confidante to every American president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, but Graham himself denied he had a role in making policy. He said: ""I don't advise them, I pray with them.""

He blessed their inaugurations, dedicated their libraries and presided over their funerals.

""You know, few events touch the heart of every American as profoundly as the death of a president. For the president is our leader. And every American feels that he knows him in a very special way,"" Graham said.

Graham's friendship with Richard Nixon dated back to the early 1950s, but it was tested by the Watergate scandal and the release of secretly recorded White House tapes.

""I'd never heard him use any of those words. I didn't know he knew them, some of them that came out on the tapes,"" Graham said.

Despite his proximity to power, Graham was resolutely nonpartisan, fearing that political favoritism would damage his ministry -- a ministry that was never touched by the kind of scandal that destroyed those of televangelists like Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.

Graham's ethics and his emphasis on cooperation among different faiths earned him widespread respect.

In moments of national crisis, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, Graham was sought out for his ability to comfort and console with simplicity and eloquence.

""We've been reminded that a cruel event like this, which so vividly demonstrates the depths of human evil, also brings out the best of us,"" Graham said.

Former presidents honored Graham by attending the dedication of his library in North Carolina.

It is there that he will be laid to rest alongside his wife, Ruth. They were married 64 years. At her funeral he said, ""We were called by God as a team.""

Graham looked ahead to the end of his life with enormous faith.

Graham said: ""I've been asked so many times lately, do I fear death? No! I look forward to death, with great anticipation. I'm looking forward to seeing God face to face."""
"Billy Graham, 'America's pastor,' dead at age 99",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/billy-graham-america-s-pastor-dead-age-99-n701276,"Billy Graham, the charismatic North Carolina pastor who took his evangelizing crusades around the country and the globe, died on Wednesday morning, according to officials of his organization. He was 99.

Graham achieved a reach unlike any other evangelist, serving as a counselor or minister to a dozen U.S. presidents. He preached to an estimated 215 million people in 185 countries around the world during his life, and his message reached millions more as he maintained a near-constant presence on radio, television and the internet.

Graham also wrote more than two dozen books, including his 1997 memoir, ""Just as I Am,"" which was a New York Times best-seller.

Graham was a steady presence among top leaders in this country, providing prayer and personal advice to every president starting with Harry S. Truman. In recent years, he took on a reduced role, but still earned the praise of President Donald Trump, who in a tweet after Graham's death called him the ""GREAT Billy Graham"" and wrote: ""There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.""

Graham died at 7:46 a.m. at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, and his longtime physician arrived approximately 20 minutes later ""and said, quote, he just wore out,"" Graham spokesperson Mark DeMoss said Wednesday evening.

The death was earlier announced by a spokesman for Samaritan's Purse, the nondenominational evangelical Christian organization headed by Graham's son Franklin.

Graham was diagnosed with Parkinson’s-like symptoms in the 1990s, DeMoss said. He said Graham died in his sleep. ""It was described by the nurse and his doctor as a very peaceful passing; he was not in any pain,” DeMoss said.

Graham's following was undeniable: The longtime evangelist appeared on Gallup’s list of the most admired men and women 60 times since 1955 — every year the research company asked the question.

Born William Franklin Graham on Nov. 7, 1918, ""America’s pastor"" came from modest means and grew up on a dairy farm in Charlotte, North Carolina. He found his spiritual path at 16, charmed by the traveling minister and temperance movement leader Mordecai Ham. Graham later moved to Florida and was ordained there in 1939.

He met his future wife, Ruth McCue Bell, while they attended Wheaton College, and they married in 1943. Together they would raise five children, and she would become a trusted adviser.

""When it comes to spiritual things, my wife has had the greatest influence on my ministry,"" Graham said of Bell, who died in June 2007.

Graham's body will arrive at the Billy Graham Training Center in Asheville on Thursday. On Saturday, a private family prayer service will take place and a motorcade will transport the body to the Billy Graham headquarters in Charlotte, DeMoss said. The body will lie in repose at the Graham Family Homeplace with a closed casket from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on at least Monday and Tuesday, he said.

Graham's body will also be brought to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. next Wednesday, where the body will lie in honor until March 1, House Speaker Paul Ryan's office announced Thursday. The public will be able to pay their respects.

The private funeral service will be held on March 2 under a tent in front of the Billy Graham Library, in a tribute to a famous crusade Graham conducted in Los Angeles in 1949 that earned him national prominence, and which was held under a tent dubbed the ""canvas cathedral,"" DeMoss said.

Graham was known for his sense of humor and for maintaining a nonpartisan Christian view, which earned him some criticism. But his dedication to ministry and unity was most evident in his refusal to pay heed to segregation policies, forcing churches to integrate for his services.

Martin Luther King Jr. counted Graham as a close friend and ally, once remarking, “Had it not been for the ministry of my good friend Dr. Billy Graham, my work in the civil rights movement would not have been as successful as it has been.”

Still, Graham's reputation was not without controversy. It was rumored in the 1990s that he had been caught on tape agreeing with anti-Semitic comments made by then-President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Graham vehemently denied that he had, until the tapes were made public in 2002.

The Jewish ''stranglehold has got to be broken or the country's going down the drain,'' Graham said, according to a 2002 New York Times article.

Graham, 83 at the time, apologized for the remarks.

As Graham aged, his son Franklin took over his ministries, while Graham returned to a quiet life in North Carolina — not far from the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte.

""My home is in Heaven,"" Graham habitually said. ""I'm just traveling through this world.""

Condolences poured in in the hours after Graham's death, with Vice President Mike Pence calling him one of the greatest Americans of the 20th century.

""Billy Graham's ministry for the gospel of Jesus Christ and his matchless voice changed the lives of millions,"" the vice president said in a statement.

Former President Barack Obama tweeted that Graham was a ""humble servant who prayed for so many — and who, with wisdom and grace, gave hope and guidance to generations of Americans.""

Televangelist Joel Osteen remembered Graham as a ""hero"" and tweeted, ""Next to my own father, Reverend Graham was the most humble and gracious man I ever knew.""

And the archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, recalled the influence Graham had on his household in the 1950s and 1960s.

""There was no question that the Dolans were a Catholic family, firm in our faith, but in our household there was always respect and admiration for Billy Graham and the work he was doing to bring people to God,"" Dolan said in a statement.

""Whether it was one of his famous Crusades, radio programs, television specials, or meeting and counseling the presidents, Billy Graham seemed to be everywhere, always with the same message: Jesus is your Savior, and wants you to be happy with Him forever.""

Graham is survived by his sister, five children, 19 grandchildren and many great-grandchildren, DeMoss said.

The funeral message will be given by his son Franklin and other family members will make remarks. Graham will be buried beside his wife’s grave in a casket made by inmates at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola in 2006. Franklin Graham preached there in 2005, and after learning the inmates were making caskets for fellow inmates he asked if they could make one for his father and mother, DeMoss said.

Invitations to the funeral will be extended to President Trump, Vice President Pence and to former presidents among others, DeMoss said.

Trump ordered that on the day of Graham's burial flags will be flown at half-staff."

Billy graham dies at the age of 99,https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-43142263,"Image caption Billy Graham preached to more than 200 million people worldwide

US evangelist Billy Graham - one of the most influential preachers of the 20th Century - has died aged 99.

He died at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, a spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said.

In a 60-year career, he is estimated to have preached to hundreds of millions of people around the world.

Former presidents are among the many who have been paying tribute. President Trump called him ""great"" and a ""very special man"".

After becoming one of the best-known promoters of Christianity in the US, Graham embarked on his global mission with an event in London in 1954.

Graham reached millions of worshippers through TV - the first to use the medium to convey the Christian message on such a scale.

Young preacher to worldwide phenomenon

Born in 1918 and raised on his family's dairy farm in Charlotte, North Carolina, Billy Graham became a committed Christian at the age of 16 after hearing a travelling evangelist.

He was ordained a minister in 1939, aged 21.

Graham's public profile was raised in the United States when he held a two-month ministry in a giant tent in Los Angeles in 1949.

His global mission took him to all corners of the world including Nigeria and communist North Korea.

An early sermon outside the US took place before 12,000 worshippers in 1954 in Harringay Arena, London.

At first ambivalent about the civil rights movement in the US, he became more sympathetic in the 1950s, preaching to racially integrated congregations.

His fiery delivery became more measured with advancing years and controversy surrounding the techniques of mass evangelism.

Graham avoided the scandals - sexual and financial - which dogged some contemporary televangelists through the decades.

A social conservative, he opposed same-sex marriage and abortion.

Graham preached his final revival meeting in New York in 2005 at the age of 86.

As the end of his life approached, he said: ""I know that soon my life will be over. I thank God for it, and for all He has given me in this life. But I look forward to Heaven.""

'Plus side of history' - tributes

In a tweet, President Donald Trump called him a special man.

He wrote: ""The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.""

Former President Barack Obama said he was a guide to millions of Americans.

Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, tweeted that he was an example to generations of modern Christians.

Civil rights campaigner Rev Jesse Jackson was among others to pay tribute.

Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable.

UK singer Sir Cliff Richard, who announced he had become Christian at a Billy Graham event in London in 1966, said the world had lost someone special.

""Dr Billy Graham was the most honourable and honest of men. His faith was obvious and I found him inspiring to be with,"" the pop singer said.

""His rallies were always moving and enlightening and he presented a 'hope' to many who didn't know that one existed.""

Chaplain to presidents

Billy Graham was close to US presidents from Harry Truman, through Richard Nixon to Barack Obama.

He played golf with Gerald Ford and went on holiday with George H W Bush. The latter's son, George W Bush, credits him with restoring his faith in 2010.

Image caption Billy Graham was close to many US presidents over the decades

Graham endorsed Nixon for the presidency but went on to criticise him over the Watergate scandal.

Mr Obama became the 12th president to meet Graham when he visited the preacher at his hilltop home in North Carolina in 2010.

Graham later acknowledged that his closeness to power risked compromising his message.

""If I had to do it over again, I would also avoid any semblance of involvement in partisan politics.

""An evangelist is called to do one thing, and one thing only: to proclaim the Gospel."""

Flu season: All Hong Kong public hospital wards exceed capacity as patients queue for 8 hours or more,https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/02/20/flu-season-hong-kong-public-hospital-wards-exceed-capacity-patients-queue-8-hours/,"The wards of every public hospital in Hong Kong exceeded their capacity on Monday, as patients reported queuing for over eight hours to see a doctor.

Flu season statistics from the Hospital Authority show that almost 6,600 people sought accident and emergency department treatment on the fourth day of Lunar New Year, and some 1,100 people were admitted into care.

The in-patient bed occupancy rates of every hospital aside from North Lantau Hospital and the newly-opened Tin Shui Wai Hospital – which do not have accident and emergency wards – exceeded 100 per cent.

Pok Oi Hospital in Yuen Long, Yan Chai Hospital in Tsuen Wan and United Christian Hospital in Kwun Tong all reported occupancy rates of over 130 per cent.

Apple Daily reported that non-urgent patients seeking accident and emergency department treatment at the Prince of Wales Hospital, United Christian Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital all had to wait for over eight hours to see a doctor. Some queued for over 14 hours or had to wait overnight.

Francis Chan, dean of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s medical school, wrote on Facebook after a hospital visit that temporary beds were placed in every corner of the ward, including corridors, blocking off access to the sink and sterilisation facilities.

“The staff at the ward can’t get a breath. They must treat illnesses, allocate medicine and injections, care for patient needs (including removing faeces), talk to family members on patients’ situations, fill in hospital records… I feel very sad seeing the ward look like a wet market and a battlefield.”

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Marine veteran Jeff Harris was among the first to sign up when the Providence VA hospital started offering acupuncture for chronic pain.

“I don’t like taking pain medication. I don’t like the way it makes me feel,” he said.

Harris also didn’t want to risk getting addicted to heavy-duty prescription painkillers.

Although long derided as pseudoscience and still questioned by many medical experts, acupuncture is increasingly being embraced by patients and doctors, sometimes as an alternative to the powerful painkillers behind the nation’s opioid crisis.

The military and Veterans Affairs medical system has been offering acupuncture for pain for several years, some insurance companies cover it and now a small but growing number of Medicaid programs in states hit hard by opioid overdoses have started providing it for low-income patients.

Ohio’s Medicaid program recently expanded its coverage after an opioid task force urged state officials to explore alternative pain therapies.

“We have a really serious problem here,” said Dr. Mary Applegate, medical director for Ohio’s Medicaid department. “If it’s proven to be effective, we don’t want to have barriers in the way of what could work.”

The epidemic was triggered by an explosion in prescriptions of powerful painkiller pills, though many of the recent overdose opioid deaths are attributed to heroin and illicit fentanyl. Many opioid addictions begin with patients in pain seeking help, and acupuncture is increasingly seen as a way to help keep some patients from ever having to go on opioids in the first place.

For a long time in the U.S., acupuncture was considered unstudied and unproven — some skeptics called it “quack-u-puncture.” While there’s now been a lot of research on acupuncture for different types of pain, the quality of the studies has been mixed, and so have the results.

Federal research evaluators say there’s some good evidence acupuncture can help some patients manage some forms of pain. But they also have described the benefits of acupuncture as modest, and say more research is needed.

Among doctors, there remains lively debate over how much of any benefit can be attributed simply to patients’ belief that the treatment is working — the so-called “placebo effect.”

“There may be a certain amount of placebo effect. Having said that, it is still quite effective as compared to no treatment,” said Dr. Ankit Maheshwari, a pain medicine specialist at Case Western Reserve University, who sees it as valuable for neck pain, migraines and a few other types of pain problems.

Many doctors are ambivalent about acupuncture but still willing to let patients give it a try, said Dr. Steven Novella, a neurologist at Yale University and editor of an alternative medicine-bashing website. He considers acupuncture a form of patient-fooling theater.

Acupuncturists and their proponents are “exploiting the opioid crisis to try to promote acupuncture as an alternative treatment,” he said. “But promoting a treatment that doesn’t work is not going to help the crisis.”

Acupuncture has been practiced in China for thousands of years, and customarily involves inserting thin metal needles into specific points in the ears or other parts the body. Practitioners say needles applied at just the right spots can restore the flow of a mystical energy — called “qi” (pronounced CHEE) — through the body, and that can spur natural healing and pain relief.

In government surveys, 1 in 67 U.S. adults say they get acupuncture every year, up from 1 in 91 a decade earlier. That growth has taken place even though most patients pay for it themselves: 2012 figures show only a quarter of adults getting acupuncture had insurance covering the cost.

The largest federal government insurance program, Medicare, does not pay for acupuncture. Tricare, the insurance program for active duty and retired military personnel and their families, does not pay for it either. But VA facilities offer it, charging no more than a copay.

Jeff Harris signed up for acupuncture two years ago. The 50-year-old Marine Corp veteran said he injured his back while rappelling and had other hard falls during his military training in the 1980s. Today, he has shooting pain down his legs and deadness of feeling in his feet.

Acupuncture “helped settled my nerve pain down,” said Harris, of Foxboro, Massachusetts.

Another vet, Harry Garcia, 46, of Danielson, Connecticut, tried acupuncture for his chronic back pain after years of heavy pain medications.

Acupuncture is “just like an eraser. It just takes everything away” for a brief period, and keeps pain down for up to 10 days, said Garcia.

About a decade ago, the military and Veteran Affairs began promoting a range of alternative approaches to pain treatment, including acupuncture, yoga, and chiropractic care.

In 2009, former Army Surgeon General Dr. Eric Schoomaker chartered a task force to re-evaluate the Army’s approach to pain, which had centered on opioids. The focus was understandable — “nobody who has his leg blown off screams for acupuncture,” said Schoomaker, who is now a professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, a military medical school in Bethesda, Maryland.

But he added there was also openness to acupuncture and other approaches among soldiers and sailors who, while overseas, had tried non-drug approaches for chronic pain. Schoomaker said he was inspired to seriously consider alternative approaches by his wife, a yoga instructor.

Now two-thirds of military hospitals and other treatment centers offer acupuncture, according to a recent study.

The military’s openness to alternatives is “because the need is so great there,” said Emmeline Edwards of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, a federal scientific research agency. “Perhaps some of the approaches have been used without a strong evidence base. They’re more willing to try an approach and see if it works.”

Her agency is teaming up the Pentagon and the VA to spend $81 million on research projects to study the effectiveness of a variety of nondrug approaches to treating chronic pain.

While research continues, insurance coverage of acupuncture keeps expanding. California, Massachusetts, Oregon and Rhode Island pay for acupuncture for pain through their Medicaid insurance programs. Massachusetts and Oregon also cover acupuncture as a treatment for substance abuse, though scientists question how well it reduces the cravings caused by chemical dependency.

Dallas official asks NRA to consider another city for annual convention,http://abcnews.go.com/US/dallas-mayor-asks-nra-city-annual-convention/story?id=53211101,"Dallas official asks NRA to consider another city for annual convention Mayor Dwaine Caraway said the NRA would be met with strong opposition in Dallas.

 -- One of Dallas' top leaders has urged the National Rifle Association on Monday to find another city to host its annual convention, taking a stand against gun violence in the wake of last week's deadly mass shooting in Florida.

Dwaine Caraway, mayor pro tem of Dallas, said that the NRA, the nation's largest gun lobby, would be met with ""marches and demonstrations"" if it went ahead with plans to host the three-day meeting scheduled for May 4-6.

""It is a tough call when you ask the NRA to reconsider coming to Dallas, but it is putting all citizens first, and getting them to come to the table and elected officials to come to the table and to address this madness now,"" Caraway told reporters on Monday. ""At the end of the day, we need to connect the dots. The NRA needs to step up to the plate, and they need to show leadership.""

""I am saddened the fact that every time that we turn around is some type of gun violence,"" he added.

If the NRA moved its event, that could cost Dallas as much as $40 million, according to some estimates.

Caraway, a self-proclaimed strong ""believer"" in the second amendment, said the NRA has a national responsibility ""to address this madness now"" as he called on the group to help establish better gun laws.

""We should not allow people to possess assault rifles and weapons,"" he said. ""While we are worrying about terrorists, we're living in a terrorist society amongst us Americans today.""

""The NRA needs to step up to the plate and they need to show leadership,"" he added.

The 147th NRA Annual Meetings and Exhibits, slated to take place at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention center, is expected to attract more than 80,000 gun enthusiasts, according to the organization's website.

A representative for the NRA pushed back against Caraway's criticism in a statement to ABC affiliate WFAA.

""No politician anywhere can tell the NRA not to come to their city. We are already there,"" Andrew Arulanandam, the NRA's managing director of public affairs, told WFAA. ""Dallas, like every American city and community, is populated by NRA members.""

The NRA, which regularly backs Republican politicians, has come under intense pressure in the aftermath of the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, where a former student allegedly used an AR-15 rifle to kill 17 people."
U.S. Army Awards Medal of Heroism to Slain Parkland Students,https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-army-awards-medal-of-herosim-to-slain-parkland-students-peter-wang-alaina-petty-martin-duque,"PARKLAND, Florida — The U.S. Army has given medals to three Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets killed in the Parkland school shooting last week, a spokesperson told The Daily Beast on Tuesday.

The Medal of Heroism was presented to the family of Alaina Petty at a memorial service on Monday, the Army said, and will be given to the family of Peter Wang during his memorial service today. Martin Duque’s family will be given the medal on Saturday, the Army added. The medal recognizes cadets whose performance “involved the acceptance of danger and extraordinary responsibilities.”

All three students were allegedly killed by a fellow JROTC member, Nikolas Cruz, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday.

During the shooting, Wang, 15, held open a door to allow his fellow classmates to escape to safety. Students told the South Florida Sun Sentinel, “He is so funny, caring and selfless.’’ Wang’s older cousin added, “He is so brave.”

Petty, 14, was “excited to be part of the female color guard team and every day she would come home and tell me all the fun things she had learned,” Petty's mother told the Sun Sentinel. Duque, also 14, was remembered by family members as a football fan and a regular churchgoer, the Miami Herald reported. “He was sweet, affectionate and loved by his entire family. But above all else, he was my little brother,” Duque's brother Miguel wrote on a GoFundMe page to help cover additional funeral expenses.

Military veterans are expected to attend Wang’s funeral on Tuesday.

Mount Sinabung eruption 'completely annihilates' peak of Indonesian mountain,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/mount-sinabung-indonesia-eruption-volcano-sumatra-aviation-warning-ash-cloud-a8219236.html,"When Indonesia’s Mount Sinabung volcano erupted on Monday morning, it shot a towering plume of ash 4.3 miles into the sky, blowing away much of its summit.

Before-and-after images show an enormous chunk missing from the stratovolcano following its biggest eruption this year. Indonesia’s Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation said the peak was “completely annihilated”.

Devy Kamil Syahbana, a volcanologist, said the missing chunk, known as the “lava dome”, had a volume of at least 1.6 million cubic metres (56.5m cubic ft).

Indonesia raised flight warnings around the volcano on Sumatra island to red, its highest level, and said the ash cloud’s top had reached 23,872ft (7,276m) according to a ground observer.

Nur Isnin Istianto, head of the regional airport authority, said Kutacane airport in Aceh province had been closed, but the wind direction allowed the airports of Kualanamu, Meulaboh and Silangit to remain open.

Mount Sinabung had lain dormant for four centuries before it first erupted in 2010, in an explosion which killed two people.

When it erupted in 2014, more than a dozen people were killed and thousands were evacuated.

No one was injured in Monday’s eruption, which was accompanied by multiple earthquakes as surrounding villages were showered with small rocks.

“In five districts it became dark with a visibility of about five metres,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Agency, said in a statement.

Video showed screaming children fleeing a school outside the volcano’s exclusion zone as a billowing column of ash rose in the background.

The disaster agency urged the public to stay out of a four-mile exclusion zone around the crater.

It said they should watch for further warnings, which could cover floods.

New FAA Tapes From The Oregon UFO Incident That Sent F-15s Scrambling Released,http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/18473/faa-recordings-deepen-mystery-surrounding-ufo-over-oregon-that-sent-f-15s-scrambling,"For proper context, make sure to first read our original post linked here detailing the event, how our report came to be in the first place, as well as the rare confirmations as to its authenticity from both the FAA and the USAF. Below is also a short explainer video that will give you a basic overview of the incident.

Now, through the Freedom of Information Act, we present what could be one of the most insightful instances of official documentation surrounding such an encounter that had already been confirmed to have occurred by both the FAA and the USAF. These materials include fascinating audio recordings of radio transmissions and phone calls made as the incident was unfolding, as well as pilot interviews, and conversations between FAA officials made in the aftermath of the highly peculiar incident.

Last November, The War Zone posted an exclusive story detailing a bizarre incident involving an unidentified aircraft that transited the skies of the Pacific Northwest in the early evening of October 25th, 2017. What started as a radar target moving at very high speed over Northern California turned into a series of eyewitness accounts made by nearby airline pilots traveling northward over Oregon. Even F-15 fighters were launched to intercept the mysterious intruder that quickly became invisible to radar.

The first video includes audio from the initial spotting of the object as it ripped its way across Northern California at high speed, before it took a turn north and merged with nearby air traffic and disappeared from radar. Once again, beyond becoming invisible to radar, this aircraft had no transponder broadcasting nor did it ever communicate verbally with air traffic controllers. The audio in the video goes on to be sync'd in real-time with radar data obtained via our FOIA request.

Fast forward three months later, and now we have so much more evidence that adds incredible depth and color to our original report and the limited radio recordings we originally had to go off of. Via our Freedom of Information Act Request we received hours of audio, all with unique elements that add to this story. What we have done is packaged that audio, as well as the radar data provided, into four separate videos. We will highlight some of the big takeaways from each video in our piece, but we cannot stress enough how interesting and eye opening this audio is to listen to in full, so we highly recommend you do so by watching each video in its entirety.

This second video is just the radar data in its raw form. It starts before the sync'd recording begins above so we thought we would post it in full so our readers can take a closer look if they want.

The F-15s first appear on radar as they climb out of Portland to the south at time index 33:33 as ""Rock"" flight—a common callsign used for the alert F-15s stationed at PDX. Alaska 439 asks for an update on the unidentified aircraft and the controller notes they still have nothing on him, saying colloquially that it must be in a kind of ""stealth mode or something."" It's also interesting that the F-15s first went south when it seems as if the object would have been north of PDX by the time they finally launched.

At roughly 27:30 into the video we get our first indication that the F-15s out of PDX are about to scramble, with the air traffic controller noting this while talking to another FAA controller, during which the controller also reiterates that there has still been no radar contact with the aircraft. The controller also repeatedly asks aircrews nearby to check their Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) for the aircraft, which all come back negative.

The ""intruder"" quickly dropped off radar and that's when the visual sightings made by airline crews began. They continued for roughly half an hour and over hundreds of miles. The exchanges between nearby pilots and air traffic control regarding the unidentified aircraft were constant in the audio, with the same description coming back time and again—that of a white aircraft cruising at around 37,000 feet that is too far away to tell the type or if it has markings of any kind on it.

In the audio the Oakland Center controller notes that it is near his boundary, so it seems the aircraft's first appearance officially occurred near the border of Oakland Center Sector 31 and Seattle Center Sector 13 or 14. The target was moving ""very fast at 37,000"" feet when it was first detected.

Oakland Center Sector 31 first detected the target around 4:30pm PST. Below is a chart showing where Oakland Center's high altitude sectors are situated around Northern California. Sector 31 spans roughly from Sacramento up towards Redding, before its northern edge, which is near the border with Oregon, terminates and Seattle Center's airspace begins. To the east, the airspace sits along the California-Nevada border. This makes sense as the craft was eventually tracked by airline pilots as it made its way up over Crater Lake and towards the Willamette Valley.

Next we move into some very interesting recordings of FAA phone calls that occurred as all of this was taking place. We edited out dead space in the audio between phone calls and bleeped the names of those who named themselves. Aside from that, the audio is unedited by us, although we cannot be certain if parts were redacted by the FAA or not. There were a few strange areas where conversations went mute and it's not clear if this was edited or just an anomaly. The primary person talking in most of these calls is the Operations Manager In Charge for Seattle Center at the time that the incident took place.

Finally, we get to our last and most interesting of our evidence videos. It contains the calls made after the incident occurred. Seattle Center's Manager In Charge of Operations tries to figure out what happened exactly. In doing so he talks once again with Seattle Center and the trio of airline pilots that spotted the craft visually and has some very interesting conversations with the FAA's Air Traffic Organization Security office and the agency's Safety and Quality Assurance Group.

In the final set of calls in the video we hear controllers talking about how the Air Force wants to set up an air patrol over Battle Ground, Washington, which is a dozen miles directly north of PDX. We know the F-15s headed south initially, so it isn't clear if this call came after they initially headed in that direction or before they were even airborne and the plan changed later on for some reason. Once again ""Rock"" refers to the callsign of the alert fighters.

When the Manager In Charge is asked if he was asking for military assistance by another FAA controller, the tape goes blank. The same inquiry is heard moments later, and it goes silent again before another call begins. Although it really doesn't have much impact on the greater mystery, who asked for the F-15s to scramble and when, comes up in the next video in an exchange between the same manager and an FAA official.

You will notice that the term ""DEN"" is referred to repeatedly in these recordings. That is the Domestic Events Network, a sort of hotline system that is used to bridge the FAA with federal authorities, namely the military, during a number of circumstances which you can read about here . You will also hear the term ""WADS"" and the nickname/callsign ""Bigfoot."" This refers to the Western Air Defense sector of NORAD that monitors the airspace over a huge swath of territory in the United States and Canada. Based out of McChord AFB in Washington, WADS scrambles the fighters when needed and works to direct them to their targets of interest during domestic air sovereignty missions, among other responsibilities.

The first call is to Oakland Center, and it occurs early on after the initial radar detection and as pilots began spotting the craft visually. He also mentions that ""air defense"" is looking for the target now too (on radar), so it shows how early the military was involved in the encounter.

First we hear about the big question as to who ""requested"" the scramble, as according to the call, it has to come from FAA headquarters. The manager floats the idea, in retrospect, of having the airliners keep a visual on the craft instead of allowing them to descending into PDX, at least until the F-15s show up, but the FAA official swats that down as they didn't know what the aircraft was, ""if they are equipped with anything"" or its intentions. She reiterates that getting the military involved was a good idea but that it should have come from FAA headquarters over the DEN. The manager reminds her again that he doesn't know who requested military assistance and that Oakland Center told him to call WADS initially. Next we hear from Oakland Center again, at first discussing who ordered the scramble, but then the conversation goes into talking about what actually happened. Both agree that there was ""definitely something out there"" with the Oakland Center controller saying the aircraft first appeared going southbound at high speed before executing an abrupt maneuver and then ""took off northbound."" Even figuring out how to report the encounter seems totally foreign to both higher ranking controllers, with one stating ""I have a feeling someone is going to go through this with a fine-tooth comb.""

Tyler Rogoway/Author An F-15C from the 142nd Fighter Wing blasts out of PDX just after sunset.

Then we get into the pilot interviews over the phone, with the manager's intention being for each crew to write up a report detailing their individual perspective of the incident. During the call with United 612 there are some odd dropped moments, but the pilot describes the encounter, stating that he was too far away to make out the type. The next call, with Alaska Airlines 525, also doesn't reveal much as the crew says they never were able to see it, but the crew of Skywest 3478 did, although he didn't have much to add. The call with the pilot of Southwest 4712 was by far the most interesting. He immediately notes how strange the encounter was and how he has never seen an incident like it in nearly 30 years of flying jets. The pilot noted, ""if it was like a Lear (private jet) type airframe I probably would not have seen it this clear. This was a white airplane and it was big. And it was moving at a clip too, because we were keeping pace with it, it was probably moving faster than we were... It was a larger aircraft yeah."" He also said they watched the object from Northern California all the way to their descent into Portland.

The manager's final call, was with the FAA's Quality Assurance Group, who is taken by surprise by the details surrounding the event, and especially with the fact that nobody still knew what the aircraft was or where it ended up. ""Wow that's weird"" is the operative quote by the FAA official, which is insightful to say the least as these people deal with unique incidents that occur in American airspace on a daily basis. The manager agreed with the sentiment and noted that it wasn't some small aircraft and it was moving fast, outpacing a 737 cruising nearby. The official also says that the incident should be classified as ""potentially significant"" on reporting documents. She even said that this was ""a weird enough thing that there is not a set procedure... It's not often we hear about an unknown guy up at that altitude."" Collectively these materials give us incredible insight not only into this incident, but also into how such an event is actually handled in real-time by those who are responsible for the safety of those in the air and those on ground below. What they don't offer is any sort of an explanation for what happened on that fall evening. But really, the fact that all those involved, from air traffic controllers, to Air Force radar operators, to airline pilots, and even special FAA officials tasked with responding to all types of out of the ordinary incidents that occur in the sky on a daily basis seem just as puzzled with this event as we are makes the story all that much more intriguing. Above all else, this new evidence underscores just how rare these events actually are, especially ones that include multiple sightings, the use of multiple sensors, the involvement of various agencies including the military, and some of the most capable air-to-air fighters in the world. And after recent reports unmasking how the Pentagon remains highly interested in encounters just like this one, it holds even more weight than it did three months ago. We will continue to investigate this bizarre incident and we will keep you updated as to what else we discover. Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com"
A Massive U.S. Drone Base Could Destabilize Niger ??? and May Even Be Illegal Under Its Constitution,https://theintercept.com/2018/02/18/niger-air-base-201-africom-drones/,"Late in the morning of October 4 last year, a convoy of Nigerien and American special forces soldiers in eight vehicles left the village of Tongo Tongo. As they made their way between mud-brick houses with thatched roofs, they were attacked from one side by dozens of militants, if not hundreds. Outnumbered and outgunned, the Nigeriens and Americans fled, some on foot, running for cover behind trees and clusters of millet, their boots caked in the light brown earth. By the time the fighting was over, five Nigeriens and four Americans were killed, their bodies left naked in the bush after the militants took their uniforms. The news went straight to the front pages in the United States and sparked a conflict between the family of one of the soldiers and President Donald Trump, after the president made insensitive remarks during a condolence call to the soldier’s widow. But the story also spread like wildfire throughout Niger, where the big news wasn’t so much that American soldiers had been killed, but that Americans soldiers were fighting in the country in the first place. “I was surprised to learn that Americans had died in the Tongo Tongo attack,” Soumana Sanda, the leader of an opposition party in the Nigerien Parliament and taekwondo champion, told me in an interview in his pristine and sparsely decorated office in Niamey, the country’s quiet capital on the banks of the Niger River. “That was the moment I found out, as a Nigerien, as a member of parliament, as a representative of the people, that there is indeed (an American) base with ground operations.”

It was the same on the street. Moussa, a middle-aged man who sells children’s textbooks and novels on a busy corner in Niamey, captured the feelings of many I talked with. “We were surprised,” he said. “For us, this is another form of colonization.” Out of apprehension that he could get in trouble for voicing his views openly, he declined to give his last name. In fact, U.S. Special Operations forces have been in Niger since at least 2013 and are stationed around the country on forward operating bases with elite Nigerien soldiers. What happened in Tongo Tongo is just a taste of the potential friction and instability to come, because the pièce de resistance of American military engagement in Niger is a $110 million drone base the U.S. is building about 450 miles northeast of Niamey in Agadez, a city that for centuries has served as a trade hub on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, not far from Mali, Algeria, Libya and Chad. In January, I hopped aboard an aging plane that followed a roundabout route to one of America’s largest-ever military investments in Africa, its latest battleground in an opaque, expensive, and counterintuitive war on the continent.

Flying into Agadez requires a tour around Niger’s countryside. I boarded a 30-year-old Fokker 50 propeller plane that is owned by Palestinian Airlines and leased to state-owned Niger Airlines with a Palestinian crew. After stopping in the southern cities of Zinder and Maradi, we descended on Agadez, its rectangles and triangles of compounds and dirt roads forming a mosaic, with the surrounding reddish beige of the desert stretching out in all directions as far as the eye can see. On the southeast edge of the civilian airport, accessible by tracks in the sand used mainly to exit the town, is Nigerien Air Base 201, or in common parlance “the American base.” The base, scheduled for completion in late 2018, is technically the property of the Nigerien military, though it is paid for, built, and operated by Americans. It is being constructed on land formerly used by Tuareg cattle-herders. So far, there is one large hangar, ostensibly where the drones could be housed, a runway under construction, and dozens of smaller structures where soldiers live and work. The air strip will be large enough for both C-17 transport planes and MQ-9 Reaper armed drones, as The Intercept’s Nick Turse found out in 2016. A Nigerien military commander with direct knowledge of the base, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press, told me that it will be mainly used to surveil militants like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al Mourabitoun, Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, and local Islamic State affiliates including Boko Haram, which operate in border zones in neighboring countries. The U.S. currently flies drones out of an airport in Niamey, but those operations will be shifted to Agadez once the new base is completed. American Special Forces operate separately from the drone base, which is run by the Air Force. The Green Berets are on the ground “training” Niger’s special forces and carrying out capture missions with them from the outposts of Ouallam near the Malian border, Aguelal near the Algerian border, Dirkou along the main transport routes between Niger and Libya, and Diffa, along the southeastern border with Nigeria and Chad, according to the same Nigerien commander. I’ve actually seen them at the Diffa base, a prominent local journalist has seen them at Dirkou, and I spoke to a person who worked at the Aguelal base. When asked to confirm the American presence in those areas of Niger, U.S. Africa Command spokesperson Samantha Reho replied, “I cannot provide a detailed breakdown of the locations of our service members in Niger due to force protection and operational security limitations. With that said, I can confirm there are approximately 800 Department of Defense personnel (military, civilian, and contractor) currently working in Niger, making that country the second-highest concentration of DoD people across the continent, with the first being in Djibouti at Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa.” The U.S. is just one of several Western militaries that have established and strengthened military ties to Niger over the past few years. France has had soldiers in the country since 2013, when it launched Opération Serval in neighboring Mali. In 2015, France reopened a colonial fort in Madama, close to the border with Libya — unthinkable during the times of Moammar Gadhafi; the Libyan leader maintained a sphere of influence in the region that would have been at odds with a French military presence. Germany sent its own troops in Niger to support the United Nations peacekeeping mission across the border in Mali, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel even visited Niger in 2017. And Italy recently announced it would send 470 troops to a French base in the north of Niger to fight migrant transporters.

I tried to find out what people think of the base and the drones that will soon be hovering overhead. After all, this was the biggest foreign military base in the region, an unprecedented uptick in Western involvement, as well as a major economic investment. But after a few days in Agadez speaking to a host of different people, I got the impression that the issue was taboo, and that very few people wanted to openly voice their concerns lest they be tagged with criticizing the current Nigerien administration, which could come back to haunt them. out what people think of the base and the drones that will soon be hovering overhead.

But after a few days in Agadez speaking to a host of different people, I got the impression that the issue was taboo, and that very few people wanted to openly voice their concerns lest they be tagged with criticizing the current Nigerien administration, which could come back to haunt them. I visited a school in Agadez and the principal, extremely hesitant about my presence, called me into a back room and declined to give his name. He told me that he couldn’t have an opinion on the Americans because he couldn’t figure out why they were really here. In my two weeks in Niger, I heard theories that the Americans were fomenting the terrorists themselves, digging for gold, or they’re after uranium, or oil, or even possibly the natural water aquifer beneath the Sahara, one of the largest in the world. Other than government officials, no one believed the Americans were here for security. The base is a mystery for a reason. AFRICOM, which is the division of the Department of Defense that oversees U.S. military operations in Africa, has only allowed access to one news outlet so far that I know of, CNN, and denied me entry for this reporting trip. The public affairs office of the U.S. Embassy in Niger responded to repeated requests for an interview by saying they were processing the request and then eventually refused to answer my questions, explaining they were understaffed due to the three-day government shutdown in late January. AFRICOM is notoriously restrictive in its access to reporters. A journalist for The Intercept was not allowed to visit another drone base in Cameroon, and people there were also cautious about discussing or criticizing it. This underlines a transnational fact: It’s not clear that American drones in Africa have made things safer. They are often more a source of fear than anything else. The base in Agadez is about 6 square kilometers, though most of the land is yet to be developed. American troops patrol its perimeter, according to a neighboring village chief I talked with. The base is tucked away and hidden from Agadez first by the 8-to-10-foot wall that separates the city of 125,000 from the airport, and it is surrounded by a barbed wire fence with sandbags, so despite there being a few hundred Americans in Agadez, you would hardly know they were there unless you went looking. Both the Nigerien and the American governments prefer to keep it this way.

There is an unusual question floating around Niger: Is the American base even legal? Activists, lawyers, and opposition politicians say it is isn’t, arguing that it violates Articles 169 and 66 of the Nigerien Constitution. These state that defense treaties require parliamentary approval – which hasn’t happened with the base — and that the defense of Niger is carried out only by Nigerien armed forces, not foreign forces. In an interview, opposition Member of Parliament Soumana Sanda told me that while he and his party, Moden Lumana, support the American military presence in his country, “just because we don’t respect democracy or rule of law in Niger doesn’t mean we should drag the great democracies of the world into illegality.” The government’s defense of the base’s legality often fluctuates. The interior minister, Mohamed Bazoum, said in January during a speech for the 27th anniversary of the president’s political party that because the American and French parliaments never debated the bases, Niger shouldn’t have to either. “The protocols we signed are not defense agreements. If they were, they would be for our partners, too,” Bazoum told a cheering crowd of cadres clad in the ruling party’s signature pink sashes.

I showed the U.S.-Nigerien Status of Forces agreement, which is available to the public on the State Department website, to Soumana Sanda and Justice Minister Marou Amadou, as well as a leading constitutional lawyer, a member of Niger’s constitutional court, and a prominent NGO head. None of them had ever seen the document and were surprised that it was available online. When I read one sentence from the agreement to Sanda — that “the Parties waive any and all claims (other than contractual claims) against each other for damage to, loss, or destruction of the other’s property or injury or death to personnel of either Party’s armed forces or their civilian personnel arising out of the performance of their official duties in connection with activities under this Agreement” — he responded, “I wasn’t aware of all this.” He added, “Today I learned a little more” about the terms of American engagement. The base is rarely reported on by the Nigerien media, and most people who knew about it before Tongo Tongo got their information from foreign media reports. The divide over the base’s legality and its value for Niger tends to fall under sharp lines based on proximity to the power structure. For instance, in Niamey I interviewed Brig. Gen. Mahamadou Abou Tarka, whose brother-in-law, Ahmed Mohamed, was recently named armed forces chief of staff. Tarka heads a $600 million fund for peace in the north of the country set up by the presidency, and he batted away questions about American mission creep. Before being escorted by bodyguards from his air-conditioned office to his chauffeured black sedan, Tarka told me that the government didn’t need to go through parliament because “we have not declared war, so the executive power considers it in its purview to strengthen the capacity of our military by bringing in allies.” Any member of parliament can ask questions in parliament about the base, and one-tenth of parliament can call for an official inquiry into its legality. There are more than enough opposition MPs to do so, but so far they haven’t acted on their own questions about the base’s legality. Sahirou Youssoufou, journalist and editor-in-chief of L’événement newspaper, said it’s because at the end of the day, the opposition values good relations with the Americans over constitutional law. “These are political calculations. They don’t want to get in power and have all these partners at their back, their relations with them tainted,” Youssoufou told me. The irony is that while the American presence is supposed to help keep the country stable, the U.S. has participated with the Nigerien government in a constitution-bypassing maneuver that undermines the country’s already-fragile democratic process.

In the meantime , sightings of white soldiers in the desert animate residents’ imaginations and WhatsApp conversations. U.S. Special Forces seem to be involved in far-flung operations that go beyond the mandate of training Nigerien soldiers — Tongo Tongo is not the only example — and generate a lot of confusion, even among the government and its military. For example, on a recent afternoon, local journalist Ibrahim Manzo Diallo received a video of a Tuareg woman and her two small children in the bush. She recounted how Nigerien and white soldiers abducted her husband and her husband’s friends, who had been camping in a nomadic tent outside Arlit, north of Agadez. Curious about this incident, Diallo and I called the local prefect, Aghali Hamadil, who said that a mixed American and Nigerien patrol had indeed stormed a Tuareg camp, and while they released eight people, including the woman and her children, they detained four others and sent them to Niamey. When I asked Marou Amadou, the justice minister, whether this was true, he affirmed the account. “Yes, it’s the Americans. … They were looking for Goumour,” he said, referring to Goumour Bidika, who is “the main facilitator” for drug traffickers and terrorists in the Agadez region, according to a Nigerien commander with direct knowledge of the operation. But that commander said Americans didn’t participate in the operation itself — the woman in the video who said she saw white soldiers had probably seen them at the Americans’ Aguelal base where the Tuareg captives were detained. The commander, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press, said Bidika had been communicating with several terrorists they were looking for, and that he had escaped during the raid; four of his lieutenants were detained at Aguelal and sent to a Niamey prison instead. Aguelal, west of Arlit, is near the Algerian border, and the secret American base there is a recent one. Its existence was partially confirmed in February, inadvertently, when it was discovered that Strava, a fitness app used mostly by westerners, had released location data that showed the global movements of the users of workout trackers like Fitbit — and the data showed unusual activity in far-off Aguelal. Reached via email after the operation, Reho, the AFRICOM spokesperson, said “U.S. forces were not involved in any arrests in that region within the past week.”

After NATO’s bombing of Libya in 2011 and the subsequent fall of Gadhafi, Agadez emerged as a main hub of migration of Africans to Europe – a trend that brought much-needed economic activity to the impoverished Agadez region. However, the economic spurt that surrounded migration has been throttled in the past few years by Nigerien police and military activity in the area, and the addition of American forces in Agadez will not help the situation. Young men and women from all over West Africa ride buses to Agadez, and then pay hundreds of dollars to sit on top of yellow water jugs in the back of Toyota Hilux pickup trucks, holding onto pieces of wood to keep them aboard as they speed across the desert to enter Libya on their way to Europe. Up until 2015, the pickups were escorted north in convoys led by the Niger military for safety, and the migrants were made to pay bribes to Nigerien officials at checkpoints along the way. Agadez depended on this industry for vital income, and the authorities profited from bribes the migrants paid. Things began to change when the city attracted media attention for the migration activity. The European Union held a joint summit with African nations in Valletta, Malta, and resolved to “set up a joint investigation team in Niger against migrant smuggling and trafficking.” In 2015, the Nigerien government passed a law that targeted smugglers and human traffickers. With the legal backing and the political push from the European Union, by 2016 the government began arresting the drivers of migrants and impounding their vehicles. It also carried out patrols in the desert to turn back cars before they reached Libya. “By all accounts, the impetus behind passing this law was … European policymakers and European governments coming to Niger and saying, ‘You need to have a migrant smuggling law on the books,’” said journalist and researcher Peter Tinti, who has co-written a book on migration in the Sahel. Once again, Western governments were forcing the Nigerien government to engage in legally dubious activity. Under Nigerien law, all citizens of West Africa have freedom of movement within Niger up until the Libya border, and most migrants making the journey aren’t coerced into doing so. Therefore, because trafficking is against the law only if a person is being transported against their will, the only crime that can be prosecuted is crossing into Libya without a visa. But since 2011, the central Libyan government recognized by the U.N. does not control the border with Niger, and the militias that control the southern towns in Libya ask for money, not visas, according to migrant transporter Bachir Amma. So the EU is trying to stop a flow of migrants that does not appear to break any local laws.

With their cars impounded, Agadez’s migrant transporters are now without jobs. The government does not seem to care. During an interview on the leather sofas in his office in Niamey, Justice Minister Marou Amadou laughed about the travails of Mohamed Anacko, the president of the Agadez Regional Council. “Anacko calls me whining all the time,” Amadou said. “I tell him, ‘Anacko, you can cry all you want, but it will continue’” — referring to regular police sweeps against migrant smugglers.

The EU had promised money to people involved in migrant transportation to start small businesses, but the “people who formerly worked in the migration industry are growing increasingly frustrated,” according to a report by the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands. Migrant transporter Bachir Amma said that 6,550 people registered as ex-participants in the migrant industry, and he himself had been approved for a $2,800 grant to start a restaurant in Agadez six months ago, but he still hasn’t seen the money. The Niger government also shut down a popular gold-mining site in the north of the country for opaque reasons, compounding the economic hardship. The European response has been to ratchet up the number of soldiers in the country. The Italians opened an embassy in Niger in January 2018, shortly after they announced that they were sending troops to the north of the country to fight migration. It’s another sign that individual European governments decided they couldn’t depend on the EU as a bloc to protect their borders, and have been aggressively pursuing their own anti-migrant agendas in Africa. In 2017, for instance, Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti struck deals with southern Libyan tribal leaders in an attempt to stem migration before people get a chance to cross the Mediterranean, in effect pushing Europe’s southern border into the Sahara. The American base isn’t likely to bring reprieve to the region either. Despite the total cost of $110 million for construction and roughly $15 million in operating costs per year, very little of that money will go to the local economy. A young man who worked in the cafeteria of the base showed me the agreement he signed with the contractor that runs the cafeteria, Sakom. He was paid roughly $1.20 per hour, a low salary in Niger, and said he only got one day off every two weeks, working 12-hour days (the contract showed the hourly rate, but not the overtime or the number of days off). Most food, other than some fruits and vegetables, is shipped in from abroad. When I drove around the base’s perimeter with my colleague Diallo, a Sakom security vehicle began following us. Sakom’s representative in Agadez declined an interview request for this article.

The Americans have done very little to help people in Agadez, other than holding a handful of workshops that appeared to be ineffective. Zara Ibrahim, head of the Association of Women Against War in Agadez, facilitated a workshop in which U.S. soldiers demonstrated to a group of mothers how to brush their teeth. Despite the fact that no one in the room needed to be taught how to brush their teeth, over 60 women came, according to Ibrahim, who told me about the workshop while sitting on a plastic mat on the floor of her association’s office. A strong gust of wind kicked up sand outside the building we were sitting in, and passing residents leaned forward and shielded their faces with their elbows. “Some women thought they would get something out of it. … They told us they would prefer 50 kilo bags of rice instead of toothbrushes,” she admitted. Other workshops have included manuals on hand-washing and sexually transmitted infections, while soldiers donated some benches and notebooks to a local school. Some people appreciate the contact, but it hasn’t offered them much help. Ibrahim doesn’t understand why the local government never even explained what the Americans are doing in Agadez, arguing that the lack of communication lends itself to conspiracy theories, and that the political consequences can be dire. “It would be really easy to communicate to people in Agadez,” Ibrahim said, adding that “there’s a concrete example in Mali” of what happens if the local population is kept in the dark. In 2012, rebels and jihadi groups allied with Al Qaeda took over northern Mali following a Tuareg rebellion. As Ibrahim put it, northern Mali “woke up one morning under occupation.” The jihadi groups occupied the country’s three northern regions for nine months, until a French, Chadian, and Malian military intervention pushed them out of the towns and into the desert. By staying behind their barbed-wire fences and providing little economic support to Agadez, the Americans run the risk of destabilizing the region. As Ibrahim remarked, “anyone can understand that.”

The man in the middle is Mahamadou Issoufou, the president of Niger. In power for six years, he has adopted a clear strategy for trying to keep control of things – by aligning himself closely with Europe and the United States, while presiding over an electoral system that his opponents describe as rigged. This is not a recipe for stability in a country that has had little of it since its founding in 1960, at the end of French colonial rule. Issoufou is a trained engineer and a former secretary-general of Somaïr, a uranium mine that was run by the French company Areva. Until migration and terrorism, uranium was the focal point of outside, particularly French, interest in Niger. France’s electricity grid is powered by nuclear energy, and Areva’s uranium concessions in Niger provide up to one-fifth of the uranium necessary to power that grid. Issoufou’s predecessor, Mamadou Tandja, had sparred with the French over the concession, and in 2009, then-French President Nicholas Sarkozy visited Niger to negotiate a deal on opening a new mine called Imouraren. After a $1.2 billion deal was struck, Tandja tried to reverse the constitution to stay in power for a third term, and after street protests, a group of low-ranking army officers carried out a coup d’état. When the transition period ended with Issoufou’s election in 2011, the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan caused a sharp downturn in global uranium prices. Areva dropped its plans for Imouraren, and Issoufou acquiesced to the French firm’s plans for delaying the mine until prices rose, denting economic growth prospects for the country. But despite losing out on Imouraren, Issoufou quickly became a donor darling and found that the closer he was to France and the West, the better his image and the more firm his hold on political power. Issoufou was criticized heavily for going to Paris to attend the “Je Suis Charlie” march in January 2015, and some human rights organizations view him as a lackey of the West. He works with Image Sept, a French firm with close ties to the Parisian political elite, to manage his image. A couple of months before his re-election in 2016, Issoufou jailed his main political opponent and former close ally, Hama Amadou of the Moden Lumana party. Amadou was accused of trafficking babies from Nigeria — a charge that Amadou vehemently denies, but which few political observers in the country have cast serious doubt on. His party boycotted the election yet still managed to finish second, behind Issoufou’s 92 percent. The opposition coalition called the election “a sham,” while the EU didn’t send an observer mission, which is rare in West Africa. Amadou is now in exile in France, having been released from prison temporarily for medical treatment. Issoufou has taken unprecedentedly pro-Western stances on a number of key issues. He has allowed for the rapid expansion of the French and American troop presence, as well as opening up the country to German and Italian soldiers. He has shut down migration on Europe’s demand, against the economic interests of his own country. He has been rewarded for his efforts by French President Emmanuel Macron, who lauded Issoufou as “an example” of democracy on a recent state visit to Niger. And Issoufou has rewarded those in his administration who follow his vision: A couple of days after our interview, Issoufou had promoted Mahamadou Abou Tarka from colonel major to general.

Amadou, the justice minister, says the real reason the opposition complains about the foreign soldiers in Niger is because they are “interested in demoralizing our troops.” Amadou’s voice rose at this point in the interview. “They tell the soldiers, ‘They don’t have respect for you, they’re bringing bases in and the only way to restore our dignity is to get rid of them.’ These are calls for a coup d’état.” Amadou, the justice minister, says the real reason the opposition complains about the foreign soldiers in Niger is because they are “interested in demoralizing our troops.” Amadou’s voice rose at this point in the interview. “They tell the soldiers, ‘They don’t have respect for you, they’re bringing bases in and the only way to restore our dignity is to get rid of them.’ These are calls for a coup d’état.” His phone began buzzing, and he paused our conversation to take a call. It was son excellence, the new Italian ambassador, and Amadou’s mood lifted. “Happy new year. … For the judge? … I know him very well. … That will be in what domain? I’ll tell you what, we should meet early next week,” he told the ambassador. Amadou is right to worry about a coup d’état. In 2010, he was a leading member of the civil society opposition to Tandja, the president at the time, and supported the coup that overthrew him in February of that year. Amadou was named leader of the transitional legislative body by the junta, and when he helped usher elections that Issoufou won, he was rewarded with the post of justice minister. He has held the post ever since. During his eight years as garde des sceaux, he hasn’t prosecuted any participants in the 2010 coup nor the transitional government for any wrongdoing, despite blatant corruption detailed by Transparency International. This is because when Amadou was the head of the transitional legislative body in 2010, he helped pass a new constitution that included an entire article guaranteeing amnesty for those involved in the coup, as well as their accomplices. Meanwhile, a number of soldiers have been arrested and convicted for coup plots during Issoufou’s two terms. As a region, West Africa is no stranger to military power seizures. In neighboring Burkina Faso, the American-trained elite presidential guard carried out a coup that eventually failed in 2015, while an American-trained captain named Amadou Sanogo led a destabilizing coup in Mali in 2012. Niger has had four coups since 1960.

Many people I spoke to in Niger feel their country has had its autonomy usurped by Westerners. “The reality is that Niger is not at a level where it can say yes or no to the French or Americans. … We only have sovereignty on paper,” said Djibril Abarché, president of the Nigerien Human Rights Association. When I asked Amadou, the justice minister, if his country has effectively ceded its military command to Westerners, he balked and explained that the Americans “don’t give orders to our generals, they give orders to our soldiers.” Is the American presence helping security at all? It’s up for debate. “If I put guards in front of my house to stop criminals from entering and the criminals still come, are the guards worth anything?” asked the secretary-general of Niger’s Islamic University, Seydou Boubacar Touré. “We have the American base, the French base, but Boko Haram continues to kill us. … I don’t see their utility here.” Attacks along the border with Mali and in the southeast on the border with Nigeria have been frequent for years. During my time in Niger, a Boko Haram attack in Diffa killed seven Nigerien soldiers and injured 25. According to AFRICOM, based in Germany, “U.S. Forces are in Niger to work by, with, and through Nigerien partners to promote stability and security while enabling them to address their security threats.” The word “through” leaves the most question marks. Prior to the disastrous mission in Tongo Tongo, the U.S. had said that its troops were only in an advisory role in Niger. It’s a peculiar role. “It is a training mission,” Mahamadou Abou Tarka, the general, said about Tongo Tongo. The Americans were “training those (Nigerien) special forces in the area. It just so happens that those special forces received a mission to go and capture a terrorist,” he said. The Tongo Tongo ambush is instructive because, according to Nigerien soldiers interviewed for this article, the American soldiers were in charge of the mission and didn’t listen to Nigerien advice. The soldiers had spent the previous day looking for Doundoun Cheffou, who is connected to militant group leader Abu Walid, in a village called Akaba across the border in Mali. Instead of Cheffou, they found food and other goods indicating he and his men were in the area. Rather than going directly back to their Nigerien base in Ouallam, they continued looking for him and when night fell, they set up camp 5 kilometers from Tongo Tongo, where the village chief had been known to give false alerts, according to a top Nigerien military officer with direct knowledge of the operation. By spending the night along the border area, they heightened the risks that they faced. There is talk of a sort of competition between the French and U.S. militaries, with each willing to undertake risky missions to prove there is a reason for them to be on the ground. However, Andrew Lebovich, Sahel specialist and visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said, “It’s not really a competition, so much as they both have priorities and a desire to work with the government. Sometimes those priorities overlap, sometimes they don’t.” It is precisely this logic that is so dangerous: American troops are deployed in an advisory and training role. But once on the ground, there is a tendency to push for more activity and engagement, and the Nigeriens have to consistently push back against that. A Nigerien officer with direct knowledge of the Agadez base said on condition of anonymity that what the Americans can and can’t do is a point of discussion on a daily basis. “I say no to the Americans every day,” he said. The risks the Americans take result in mistakes, and the mistakes, rather than leading to a reconsideration of the risks, can lead to more escalation. After Tongo Tongo, for example, Niger authorized the U.S. to arm its drones in the country, though there are reports that ground missions by the U.S. may face greater scrutiny. Sitting in the living room of his house in Agadez with his young daughter, Abbas Yahaya, a prominent imam, told me that he is concerned the American drones won’t be able to tell the difference between militants and regular convoys in the desert, who are often armed for protection against criminality. “A drone is manned by people on a military base in America, and many times they make mistakes, killing people who aren’t extremists,” he said. “This won’t solve anything; it will only bring more insecurity.” Indeed, if a handful of Green Berets can conduct a botched mission that leads to a major escalation of the conflict, what happens when there are 2,000 to 3,000 U.S. troops operating on a base with armed drones and little to no accountability to the public? I got the feeling that Agadez was just one or two mistakes away from a radical change in which the American military becomes the focal point of hostility. Armed drones are a major issue anywhere the U.S. uses them, but in Niger, the American base is in a major city not far from potential drone targets. Judging from the secrecy and lack of trust thus far, it’s not hard to envision a future in which an errant drone strike causes the population of Agadez to turn against the base.

"Ireland's deputy prime minister has condemned the Labour MP Kate Hoey for ?reckless? and ?irresponsible? remarks after she declared that the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland 20 years ago, was ?unsustainable?.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/20/ireland-kate-hoey-good-friday-agreement-remarks,"This article is more than 2 years old

This article is more than 2 years old

Ireland’s deputy prime minister has condemned the Labour MP Kate Hoey for “reckless” and “irresponsible” remarks after she declared that the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland 20 years ago, was “unsustainable”.

Her comments, coming swiftly after similar comments made by the former Conservative Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson and pro-Brexit MEP Daniel Hannan, were also roundly condemned by the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, who questioned their timing.

Rees-Mogg to the DUP, Hoey to Ukip … we need a politicians’ hostage swap | Zoe Williams Read more

The row comes as British and EU negotiators start two days of talks in Brussels, concentrating on Ireland and the Irish border on Tuesday.

Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday morning that talking down the peace accord that led to the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries laying down their arms potentially undermined peace in the region.



Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney) Talking down Good Friday Agreement because it raises serious and genuine questions of those pursuing #Brexit is not only irresponsible but reckless and potentially undermines the foundations of a fragile peace process in Northern Ireland that should never be taken for granted

Her remarks came as an intense round of political and diplomatic activity begins in Dublin, Belfast and London in an effort to restart talks to restore the Northern Ireland assembly after the collapse of negotiations last week. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, will make a statement in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon.



“I think there is a need for a cold rational look at the Belfast agreement,” Hoey said in the Huffington Post on Monday. “Mandatory coalition is not sustainable in the long term … We need to face reality – Sinn Féin don’t particularly want a successful Northern Ireland. They want a united Ireland,” she continued.

Hoey, from Antrim, is a staunch supporter of Brexit and sits on the Commons Northern Ireland affairs select committee.

Smith questioned the timing of Hoey’s remarks.

Owen Smith (@OwenSmith_MP) .@KateHoeyMP @OwenPaterson & @DanielJHannan are reckless & utterly wrong to question the value and sustainability of the Good Friday Agreement. Their concerted, transparent effort to undermine the GFA is driven by their blind, misplaced faith in Brexit. They should know better.

Peter Hain, a former Northern Ireland secretary who was involved in the process in which the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries lay down their arms, said the remarks showed Brexiters were “willing to sacrifice almost anything on the altar of a hard Brexit” while Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, described them as “deplorable”.

The attack on the Good Friday agreement started at the weekend after an article by Hannan in the Telegraph. Tweeting the piece, Paterson remarked that the agreement had “outlived its use”.

“Their concerted, transparent effort to undermine the GFA is driven by their blind, misplaced faith in Brexit. They should know better,” said Smith.



On Monday evening, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, urged Bradley to set a budget and take key decisions about the region’s schools, hospitals and infrastructure.

Turkey will lay siege to Syria's Afrin in coming days ? Erdogan,https://www.rt.com/news/419296-turkey-afrin-siege-erdogan,"Turkish troops will encircle the Kurdish-held Syrian city of Afrin “in the coming days,” effectively starting its siege, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told ruling party MPs, local media reported.

Speaking to members of the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) on Tuesday, Erdogan said the city center of Afrin will soon be besieged by advancing Turkish troops and allied Syrian militias, according to Hurriyet.

“Preparations in the field take some time. In the coming days, we will lay siege to Afrin city; it’s very important that everywhere we go should remain secure,” Erdogan said, as cited by Hurriyet. He added: “Thanks to the siege, the YPG will have no room for bargaining with the Syrian regime.”

Erdogan’s statement comes as Turkish troops are advancing towards Afrin, “liberating” village after village. The offensive, codenamed Operation Olive Branch, was launched in January this year with the stated goal of driving the Kurdish YPG militia group – deemed a terrorist organization in Turkey – out of the area.

On Tuesday morning, the Turkish military said the troops had “neutralized” 74 Kurdish and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) fighters, increasing the number of slain militants to 1,715.

“The ground operation, supported by air- and ground-based fire support assets, continues successfully as planned,” it added.

Earlier this week, media reports emerged suggesting an agreement has been reached between the local Kurdish administration and Damascus, under which Syrian pro-government forces would be allowed to enter the area. On Monday, Syrian media reported that government troops would arrive in Afrin “within hours.”

However, no official confirmation of the news has been announced, with Kurdish officials denying that such an agreement exists. “There is no agreement; there is only a call from us for the Syrian army to come in and protect the borders,” YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud told Reuters by phone on Monday.

Ankara has threatened to confront Syrian forces if they come to the aid of the Kurds, and also dismissed reports on the Kurdish-Syrian deal.

“If the regime enters [Afrin] to clear out the YPG, then there is no problem,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday, as cited by state news agency Anadolu. However, he added: “If they are entering [Afrin] to provide protection to the YPG, then no one can stop Turkey or Turkish soldiers.”

Meanwhile, experts say Syrian leader Bashar Assad and his government are now playing a key role in stabilizing the situation in and around Afrin. “It is ironic because both the Kurds and the Turks at different times stated their absolute condemnation of the Syrian government and unwillingness to deal with President Assad or his government,” Danny Makki, Syria commentator, told RT.

Now both regional actors are looking at Assad as “some sort of peacemaker,” Makki said. While Turkey, which is losing soldiers and armor, is desperate to end the fighting, the Kurds would prefer to do a deal with Damascus rather than make one with the Turks “on very weak terms,” he suggested."
Discrete allure: Lindsay Lohan boosts 'trend-setting' London Modest Fashion Week,https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2018/2/19/lindsay-lohan-boosts-trend-setting-london-modest-fashion-week,"Organisers deemed it a sell-out success. This year, eager to continue its record for pioneering new trends, LMFW was again dominated by a series of firsts.

Roumana Bint-Abubaker is CEO and founder of Haute-Elan. Adijuma and HIJUP recently acquired a majority stake in the company, a modest fashion e-commerce site and organiser of LMFW. ""What is exciting"", she said, ""is the diversity of segments. We have everything from menswear, sportswear and leisure to bridal and couture.

""Secondly we're getting really interesting guests like Lindsay Lohan to openly support us.""

Lohan attended the opening ceremony this Saturday 17 February donning a silky black hijab and reportedly wearing halal make up.



Other notable guests included H&M and Select Model's first hijab-wearing model Mariah Idrissi who spoke about the ""commodification of religion and trends in modest fashion"" and ""the role of influencers in young women's lives"" in two panel discussions.

Bushra Shaikh - Apprentice 2017 candidate, joined Jewish designer of modest fashion Hannah Sufrin, Vivy Yusof - a Malaysian e-commerce entrepreneur - and Professor Reina Lewis over the two-day event.



Disucssing juggling business with family life, panelists provided advice and insight into the modest fashion business, saying that they catered to a gap that women of faith were keen to see filled.

However, noted Shaikh, despite the ""modesty industry"" being predominantly Islamic, there wasn't much support out there for those wanting to get involved.

Haute-Elan itself contributes £1 of every purchase to the WeAreOne Foundation. Bint-Abubaker says that it's this type of social entrepreneurial spirit that underpins what they're about.

""It's the foundation of what we do. Because we as Muslims believe there's no purpose in business for the sake of business itself. It's only of benefit if it is benefitting greater society, if it has a greater cause.""

While the show boasted a raft of contributors to fulfil women's demand, the entry of men's modest fashion at this year's LMFW reflects a growing market.

While it may not be as big as the women's market, Akil Desai of Jubbas, seen on the runway this year, says, ""I think it's a huge market... I don't see nearly enough being done in the way of male modest fashion in the UK for men who want to wear it.""

Jubbas started as a family business 17 years ago, but in the past five years has found itself adapting its brand and image, fitting the more contemporary market. Desai admits there may be apprehension around wearing long garments in certain places, so Jubbas has made its garments more ""urban"" and ""trendy"".

Desai also says that LMFW is the perfect place to try and ""break the trend"" as even though it's ""95 percent female, they have brothers, husbands, kids who are the perfect audience to show that there is male modest fashion as well"".

Other future developments could include more designers from Iran to join a diverse selection from the Gulf and South East Asia

He also says that Jubbas even has non-Muslim customers who like wearing the garments in the evening as they're comfortable.

Designers and attendees Nish Dax and Ali A of This is Dusk agree that the market is growing for men. But Dax says ""with male modest fashion, it is modest but it's 'simply' modest. That's the difference between women and men's modesty... There's no experimental design"".

Of the day he adds, ""what we've seen so far has been pretty inspiring. There's been a lot of good movements, the models are strong, and the vision is clear. It's looking at a bright future. London Modest Fashion Week will grow inevitably. As long as it's growing with the right movements and the right ethos behind it, then it will succeed.""

Ali A made a special mention of Ummah Models and its founder who he said was particularly inspiring, ""She's bringing more modest models who can work for modest brands... she's [cornered] a very nice gap in the market there"".

LMFW also showcased emerging talent such as Coverme, Shamila Bassir, The Elegance of Black and Sanzaa. But Bint-Abubaker says that in September 2018, there will be at least three mainstream brands seen at LMFW's second event, as it will be showcasing twice in one year.

""This year, we were this close to having international brands participate but the political issues that they face mean that they were nervous [about] participating.""

Bint-Abubaker explained that while at least one of the international brands she spoke to had already launched a collection specifically for the Muslim market, retailers were nervous about taking up their product for fear of political backlash from consumers.

""Actually it ended up being a product they didn't even put into production in many numbers despite the huge size of the population who need [it]. That's definitely still an issue. I think it's changing but it's taking a long time.""

However, she remains confident that the three brands she has in mind will be on board by September.

Other future developments could include more designers from Iran to join a diverse selection from the Gulf and South East Asia. A collaboration with London Fashion Week may also be on the cards.

""London Fashion Week would like us to work with them. They are looking for a way. I'm all up for collaboration so maybe the next step would be that we become a segment of London Fashion Week"", said Bint-Abubaker.

Germany's Bundeswehr 'lacks basic equipment' for NATO mission,http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-bundeswehr-lacks-basic-equipment-for-nato-mission/a-42638910,"German soldiers do not have enough protective vests, winter clothing and tents to head NATO's 'spearhead force,' the newspaper Rheinische Post reported on Monday, citing a paper presented to the Defense Ministry.

The news comes as Germany prepares to take over the leadership of the multinational Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) Army Command at the start of next year, with Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (top picture) under intense pressure to bring equipment up to scratch by then.

The Very High Readiness Joint Task Force is deployed on NATO's eastern flank

Commenting on the article on Monday, Germany's Defense Ministry said that combat readiness of German troops would be ensured.

""Currently, the selected troops are going through the phase of preparation and mobilization,"" spokesman Jens Flosdorff said in Berlin. During this phase, the ministry is checking which equipment is already available, and ""what is still needed,"" he said.

The authorities are set to complete the process by the end of 2018, at the latest.

Flosdorff also said that ""Bundeswehr is ready and able to fulfill its commitments,"" and that the missing items ""are being procured.""

Sleeping cold

The Monday report cites the internal paper by Germany's Army Command as stating that the army would lack sufficient tents until at least 2021.

According to the Army Command report, 10,282 mobile ""accommodation units"" are needed for the army's deployment in the VJTF for the period 2018 to 2020, but only 2,500 are currently available — and even these are not fit for purpose.

Germany's NATO missions Germany's role in NATO West Germany officially joined the trans-Atlantic alliance in 1955. However, it wasn't until after reunification in 1990 that the German government considered ""out of area"" missions led by NATO. From peacekeeping to deterrence, Germany's Bundeswehr has since been deployed in several countries across the globe in defense of its allies.

Germany's NATO missions Bosnia: Germany's first NATO mission In 1995, Germany participated in its first ""out of area"" NATO mission as part of a UN-mandated peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the deployment, German soldiers joined other NATO member forces to provide security in the wake of the Bosnian War. The peacekeeping mission included more than 60,000 troops from NATO's member states and partners.

Germany's NATO missions Keeping the peace in Kosovo Since the beginning of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, some 8,500 German soldiers have been deployed in the young country. In 1999, NATO launched an air assault against Serbian forces accused of carrying out a brutal crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists and their civilian supporters. Approximately 550 Bundeswehr troops are still stationed in Kosovo.

Germany's NATO missions Patrolling the Aegean Sea In 2016, Germany deployed its combat support ship ""Bonn"" to lead a NATO mission backed by the EU in the Aegean Sea. The mission included conducting ""reconnaissance, monitoring and surveillance of illegal crossings"" in Greek and Turkish territorial waters at the height of the migration crisis. Germany, Greece and Turkey had requested assistance from the trans-Atlantic alliance.

Germany's NATO missions More than a decade in Afghanistan In 2003, Germany's parliament voted to send Bundeswehr troops to Afghanistan in support of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Germany became the third-largest contributor of troops and led the Regional Command North. More than 50 German troops were killed during the mission. Nearly a thousand soldiers are still deployed in Afghanistan as part of Resolute Support.

Germany's NATO missions German tanks in Lithuania Forming part of NATO's ""enhanced forward presence"" in the Baltic states, 450 Bundeswehr soldiers have been deployed to Lithuania so far in 2017. The battalion-size battlegroups there are led by Germany, Canada, the UK and US to reinforce collective defense on the alliance's eastern flank. It forms the ""biggest reinforcement of Alliance collective defence in a generation,"" according to NATO.

Germany's NATO missions Taking over the leadership The Bundeswehr is due to take over leadership of NATO's multinational Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) at the start of 2019. The rapid reaction force has been set up to counter potential Russian aggression on the alliance's eastern flank. Author: Lewis Sanders IV



Protective vests and winter clothing were also in such short supply that it would be ""impossible"" to ensure that demands were met, it said.

Last week, German media reported that the Bundeswehr was also lacking sufficient tanks and operational aircraft to fulfill its duties as VJTF leader, along with other equipment shortfalls such as night-vision equipment and automatic grenade launchers.

Some 500 German soldiers are currently posted on NATO's eastern flank - but tanks are in short supply

'Scandalous situation'

The Rheinische Post said German parliamentarians reacted with outrage to news of the latest deficiencies.

""We cannot and will not accept"" such supply gaps, said defense expert Fritz Felgentreu from the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

The Free Democrat (FDP) politician Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann found even stronger words.

""The fact that even basic equipment such as protective vests and winter clothing is in short supply shows what a miserable state the Bundeswehr is in as a result of cutting costs,"" she said, adding that her party would set up a subcommittee to ""look into this scandalous situation"" at the next meeting of the Bundestag's Defense Committee.

The VJTF is a 5,000-strong force initiated by NATO in 2014 to counter the threat of Russian military aggression against Baltic member states. The force is supposed to be capable of going into action within 24 hours.

"The Rhodes scholarship, oldest and most prestigious international graduate award, is to be opened to applicants from Britain and rest of world for first time, Rhodes Trust is to announce. Trust founded by colonial tycoon aims to bring prestigious graduate scheme into 21st century.",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/19/rhodes-scholarships-opened-up-to-students-from-uk-and-rest-of-world,"The Rhodes scholarship – the oldest and most prestigious international graduate award – is to be opened to applicants from Britain and the rest of the world for the first time, the Rhodes Trust is to announce.

From their foundation more than 100 years ago, funded by a massive bequest from the imperialist tycoon Cecil Rhodes, eligibility for the scholarships has been confined largely to residents of a narrow group of countries, with most coming from the US, Canada, South Africa and Australia.

From next year, high-achieving graduates from the UK and other countries without dedicated Rhodes programmes will be able to follow in the footsteps of Bill Clinton, Rachel Maddow and a string of prime ministers, Nobel prize-winners and other political, academic and media leaders.

Charles Conn, the warden of Rhodes House in Oxford, which administers the programme, said initially two scholarships each year would be made available for international applicants as part of the trust’s drive to open the scholarship far beyond Cecil Rhodes’ original boundaries.

“In the last five years we’ve thought: how can we take this great old institution and bring it into the 21st century? And one of the most obvious things is, why is the scholarship only tenable if you’re in a former Commonwealth country, plus the US and Germany?” said Conn.

“We’re looking for people to fight the world’s fights, who we hope will change the world for the better. They might just as easily come from Indonesia or Brazil, or Birmingham.”

The man behind the scholarship remains a highly controversial figure. In recent years, Cecil Rhodes’ statue at his former Oxford college Oriel has attracted protests, inspired by the Rhodes Must Fall campaign in South Africa, where his legacy is as a colonial politician who oversaw proto-apartheid legislation and used military power to expand Britain’s empire.

The Guardian’s obituary of Rhodes in 1902 damned him as unscrupulous and “a wrecker instead of a constructor of South African development”.

Rhodes’ wealth derived from his success as a businessman in operating the diamond mines that grew to become the De Beers group. It was this fortune that he bequeathed to fund the scholarships at Oxford University that still bear his name. The Rhodes Trust holds about £300m in investments.



Conn said the purpose of the programme’s latest expansion was not to burnish Rhodes’ name. “We are a forward-looking organisation. Our purpose is to find and help develop these incredible young people to change the world. We don’t think it’s our business to make apologies for Cecil Rhodes as a person, it’s not required. Our job is to support the scholarships,” he said.

“We believe people should examine the legacies of all historic actors, Rhodes included. If you are a Rhodes scholar you might want to ask yourself, does your benefiting from this money put an extra duty on you to do good in the world? Each of us interprets that in a different way.”

While Rhodes’ bequest stipulated that only men could be Rhodes scholars, that bar was dropped in 1976. More recently, scholarships have been added to include residents of China, 18 countries in west Africa, Malaysia, Palestine and Israel.

“It’s a pretty slow process, to raise the money country by country. We realised that if we could offer scholarships that were open to anybody, then we might win a foothold in the rest of the world more quickly,” said Conn, who steps down next year to be succeeded by the trust’s first female warden, Elizabeth Kiss.

As well as the UK, the new scholarships will embrace candidates from Central and South America, north Africa, and Europe, where only Germany has a programme.

Global competition for the new scholarships is likely to be intense, but Conn warned that the programme’s standards mean that only a select few recent graduates were likely to be contenders.

“You have to have an incredibly high academic standard, so if you are starting out your undergraduate work then you’ll have to work your tail off because the competition is very high. You want to make sure that there’s something you care about, including caring for other people, and you definitely have to be doing something non-academic at a very high level. You don’t have to be a cricket captain, you could be an aspiring conductor.

“And then you want to demonstrate leadership. But it’s pretty hard to fake. We do get applications every year from people who tack some stuff on to their résumé. We’re pretty good at sniffing them out.”

Those who make it through the scholarship’s rigorous process will be awarded an initial two years of postgraduate funding and generous living allowances, with an option for a third year."
Spooky footage shows disc-shaped UFO soaring above Mount Everest,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5606703/spooky-footage-shows-bizarre-disc-shaped-ufo-soaring-above-mount-everest-leaving-experts-baffled/,"UFO hunters have spotted a strange disc-shaped object zooming over Mount Everest.

Spooky footage analysing a two-billion-pixel picture of the mountain identifies the black shape in the sky above the Himalayas.

3 A strange object has been spotted in a HD image of Mount Everest

Sky watchers say it can't be a drone because of it's height and the fact that it causes a silhouette.

Eagle eyed observers clocked the object after mountaineer and filmmaker David Breashears constructed an stunning two-billion pixel photo of the mountain range.

The image is one of 477 that have been stitched together to create a super high definition mosaic composition.

The completed picture captures incredible detail of the world's tallest mountain, stretching from the base camp, where 500 climbers prepare to make the climb, up to the sky above.

The work was created in 2012 but appears to have snapped more than the mountain range.

Alien watchdog group UFO Today, who have analysed the picture, said secret underground 'Area 51'- type bases are rumoured to exist around the photo's location.

There has also been significant speculation about such bases around the virtually inaccessible Ladakh border area between India and China.

Declassified CIA documents last year sent UFO enthusiasts into a frenzy.

"Students plan protests, Washington march, to demand gun control after mass shooting",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-students/students-plan-protests-washington-march-to-demand-gun-control-after-mass-shooting-idUSKCN1G20S8?il=0,"PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - Stunned by the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history, students mobilized across the country on Sunday to organize rallies and a national walkout in support of stronger gun laws, challenging politicians they say have failed to protect them.

Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a former student is accused of murdering 17 people on Wednesday using an assault-style rifle, joined others on social media to plan the events, including a Washington march.

“I felt like it was our time to take a stand,” said Lane Murdock, 15, of Connecticut. “We’re the ones in these schools, we’re the ones who are having shooters come into our classrooms and our spaces.”

Murdock, who lives 20 miles (32 km) from Sandy Hook Elementary School where 20 children and six adults were shot to death five years ago, drew more than 50,000 signatures on an online petition on Sunday calling on students to walk out of their high schools on April 20.

GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2nX8ECo

Instead of going to classes, she urged her fellow students to stage protests on the 19th anniversary of an earlier mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado.

Students from the Florida high school are planning a “March for Our Lives” in Washington on March 24 to call attention to school safety and ask lawmakers to enact gun control.

They also plan to rally for gun control, mental health issues and school safety on Wednesday in Tallahassee, the state capital. The students were expected to meet with a lawmaker who is seeking to ban the sale of assault-style weapons like the AR-15 allegedly used in the school shooting.

The demands for change by many still too young to vote has inflamed the country’s long-simmering debate between advocates for gun control and gun ownership.

Students from the Florida school have lashed out at political leaders, including Republican President Donald Trump, for inaction on the issue. Many criticized Trump for insensitivity after he said in a weekend Twitter post that the FBI may have been too distracted with a Russia probe to follow leads that could have prevented the massacre.

“You can’t blame the bureaucracy for this when it’s you, Mr. President, who’s overall responsible,” David Hogg, an 18-year-old Douglas senior, said in a phone interview.

‘LISTENING SESSION’

The White House said Trump planned to host “a listening session” with high school students and teachers on Wednesday, but did not specify which students or school would be involved.

Democratic leaders vowed to redouble efforts to fight the nation’s powerful gun lobby to reduce violence from firearms.

“We’re the adults. We’re the leaders in this country who are supposed to keep our children safe - and again and again, our country has let them down,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said on Twitter.

The suspect in the Parkland shooting, Nikolas Cruz, 19, faces multiple murder charges in the deaths of 14 students and three staff members, and the wounding of more than a dozen others in a rampage that eclipsed Columbine as the country’s worst mass shooting at a high school.

Cruz was reported to have been investigated by police and state officials as far back as 2016 after slashing his arm in a social media video, and saying he wanted to buy a gun. Authorities determined, however, he was receiving sufficient support, newspapers said on Saturday.

In addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation admitted on Friday that it failed to investigate a warning that Cruz possessed a gun and the desire to kill.

A couple who opened their home to Cruz after his mother’s recent death saw no signs he was planning a rampage, according to the Sun Sentinel in south Florida.

Kimberly and James Snead told the newspaper they knew Cruz had guns, and that they made him lock them in a safe. They thought they had the only key, they said.

Cruz faces charges that could bring the death penalty. Prosecutors have not yet said if they will seek capital punishment.

Four people still hospitalized with wounds from the shooting were in fair condition on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the Broward Health system said.

School officials in Broward County said on Sunday they were aiming to have staff return to the high school campus by the end of the week. They did not say when classes would resume."
