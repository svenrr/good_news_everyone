"Woman accuses Al Franken of kissing, groping her without consent | TheHill",http://thehill.com/homenews/news/360656-woman-accuses-al-franken-of-kissing-groping-her-without-consent,"A TV host and sports broadcaster on Thursday accused Sen. Al Franken Alan (Al) Stuart FrankenTina Smith and Jason Lewis tied in Minnesota Ted Cruz mocks Al Franken over 'I Hate Ted Cruz Pint Glass' GOP Senate candidate says Trump, Republicans will surprise in Minnesota MORE (D-Minn.) of kissing and groping her without her consent in 2006.

Leeann Tweeden accused Franken of groping her, without her consent, while she was asleep and provided a photo as evidence.

KABC anchor: Senator Al Franken Kissed and Groped Me Without My Consent, And There’s Nothing Funny About It https://t.co/lG4A1ZTUhC pic.twitter.com/EYIzr9ok2s — Meridith McGraw (@meridithmcgraw) November 16, 2017

The incident happened in December 2006, she said, when she and Franken, then a comedian, were on a USO tour to ""entertain our troops.""

Franken in a statement apologized for his actions.

""It wasn’t until I was back in the U.S. and looking through the CD of photos we were given by the photographer that I saw this one,"" Tweeden wrote about the photo on KABC.

""I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated,"" she wrote. ""How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?""

Tweeden wrote that Franken, who was the headliner on the tour, had written some skits and told her he had a part for her, adding that she ""agreed to play along.""

""When I saw the script, Franken had written a moment when his character comes at me for a ‘kiss’. I suspected what he was after, but I figured I could turn my head at the last minute, or put my hand over his mouth, to get more laughs from the crowd,"" she wrote.

""On the day of the show Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines one last time. He said to me, 'We need to rehearse the kiss.' I laughed and ignored him. Then he said it again. I said something like, ‘Relax Al, this isn’t SNL…we don’t need to rehearse the kiss.’""

She wrote Franken continued to insist and she got ""uncomfortable.""

""He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said ‘OK’ so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth,"" she wrote.

""I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn’t be so nice about it the next time.""

She said she felt disgusted and violated. She added that she didn't tell anyone what happened at the time, but she was ""angry.""

Tweeden also said she fell asleep while on the plane back to the U.S. She said is wasn't until she saw the photo of Franken groping her that she told her husband what had happened and showed him the photo.

""I wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster,"" she wrote.

""But that was then, this is now. I’m no longer afraid.""

She said she is sharing her story because there may be others.

""I want the days of silence to be over forever,"" she wrote.

Tweeden also issued a direct statement to Franken.

""Senator Franken, you wrote the script. But there’s nothing funny about sexual assault,"" she wrote.

""You knew exactly what you were doing. You forcibly kissed me without my consent, grabbed my breasts while I was sleeping and had someone take a photo of you doing it, knowing I would see it later, and be ashamed.""

Franken said he does not remember the incident the same way but acknowledged the photo ""wasn't"" funny.

“I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it,"" he said in a statement.

Tweeden's comments come amid increased reports of sexual harassment in the workplace, including on Capitol Hill. Multiple women in Congress have come forward to say they have been victims of sexual harassment, prompting lawmakers to call for reform.

Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said Tuesday the House has paid out $15 million in harassment settlements over more than a decade, though a spokesperson later clarified that figure does not only account for sexual harassment claims.

She said at a Tuesday hearing that two current members of Congress, one Republican and one Democrat, have been accused of sexual harassment.

Her comments come after multiple women have accused GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct. Moore is facing growing calls from top Republicans to step aside in the Alabama race, though he has indicated he plans to continue running.

False flag attack that would frame refugees foiled in Germany.,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-soldier-syria-refugee-false-flag-terror-attack-posing-arrested-frankfurt-france-bavaria-a7705231.html,"A German soldier found posing as a Syrian refugee has been arrested for allegedly planning a “false flag” shooting attack that would be blamed on asylum seekers.

The unidentified soldier was detained when he went to retrieve a loaded pistol he had hidden in a bathroom at Vienna International Airport.

The public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt said the 28-year-old is suspected of planning a serious “state-threatening act of violence”, fraud and violating firearms laws.

More than 90 German police officers have worked alongside Austrian and French security forces to search 16 locations across three countries on Wednesday, when a suspected accomplice was arrested in Bavaria.

Investigations have revealed that the Bundeswehr lieutenant was stationed at Illkirch-Graffenstaden in France before registering as a refugee back in Germany.

He gave false information to authorities in Giessen, Hesse, on 30 December 2015 – as Germany was overwhelmed by the arrival of almost a million asylum seekers.

Posing as a Syrian refugee but reportedly speaking in French, rather than Arabic, the man submitted an asylum application at Zirndorf in Bavaria in January last year.

“As a result, he was given shelter in a refugee home and has received monthly financial benefits under this false identity,” the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office said.

“These findings, as well as other evidence, point towards a xenophobic motive for the soldier’s suspected plan to commit an attack using a weapon deposited at Vienna airport.”

If his plan had succeeded, his fingerprints would have registered on the refugee records system and led investigators to his false identity as a Syrian asylum seeker, turning fresh scrutiny on migrants in Germany.

Isis has previously used a similar ploy, giving its militants fake Syrian passports that were found at the scene of the Paris attacks.

The man’s suspected accomplice, a 24-year-old student, was arrested in Hammelburg for alleged involvement in the plot.

Police have searched the homes of the two suspects as well as their friends and workplaces, with detectives seizing “extensive material” including mobile phones, laptops and documents.

Prosecutors said the soldier had no permission for the 7.65mm pistol stashed in Vienna, while illegal weapons were also found at his accomplice’s house.

Both men remain in custody in Frankfurt as the probe continues.

The soldier was arrested days after prosecutors revealed that the man who orchestrated the Dortmund bus bombings had attempted to frame Isis to make money on shares.

Police chief says Germany 'on high alert' after attack

Sergej W, a dual German-Russian national, detonated three bombs targeting a bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund football team, seriously injuring one player on 11 April.

He left misspelled letters at the scene claiming the attack was retaliation for German military intervention against Isis, but investigations found he was not an Islamist but a trader planning to profit from short-selling shares.

A series of Isis-inspired terror attacks and plots in Germany have raised tensions leading into September’s federal elections, where Angela Merkel is battling to win a fourth term as Chancellor.

Right-wing groups have blamed her decision to open borders to refugees in 2015, while extremists have launched hundreds of attacks on asylum seekers’ accommodation.

Amber Heard admits to abusing Johnny Depp on leaked recording.,http://globalnews.ca/news/6499297/amber-heard-johnny-depp-recording/amp/,"Amber Heard and Johnny Depp attend the 'Black Mass' Virgin Atlantic Gala screening during the BFI London Film Festival, at Odeon Leicester Square on Oct. 11, 2015 in London, England.

Actor Amber Heard admitted to hitting her ex-husband Johnny Depp in recently released audio recordings from 2015.

Story continues below advertisement

In the audio, shared by the Daily Mail, the pair discusses an incident in which things got physical.

USA Today spoke to Depp’s lawyer Adam Waldman, who confirmed the audio is a real recording from 2015.

In the recording, Depp and Heard debate an incident in which she allegedly punched and injured him.

“After you got f—ing physically violent with me… I texted Travis and I said: ‘Come up here,'” Depp says in the recording.

“I know! Come and save me,” Heard says, mocking Depp. “Continue… Travis to the rescue.”

“Come what? Save me? That was the last one,” Depp says. “You can go.”

At another point in the conversation, Depp says: “I told you to tell Travis that you punched me in the f—ing face, and you said, ‘No, I didn’t, what the f–k are you talking about?”

Story continues below advertisement

“I didn’t punch you, by the way,” Heard interjects. “I’m sorry that I didn’t hit you across the face in a proper slap but I was hitting you. It was not punching you.

“Babe, you’re not punched … I don’t know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you’re fine. I did not hurt you, I did not punch you; I was hitting you.”

“Don’t tell me what it feels like to be punched when you f—ing have a closed fist…” the Pirates of the Caribbean actor says.

Story continues below advertisement

“You didn’t get punched. You got hit. I’m sorry I hit you like this but I didn’t punch you. You didn’t get f—ing decked. I f—ing was hitting you,” Heard tells Depp.

“You’re a f—ing baby. You’re such a baby,” Heard says.

Depp asks: “Because you start physical fights?”

(Warning: The recording below contains explicit language.)

At another point in the recording, Depp says: “I do not want to leave you. I do not want a divorce, I do not want you out of my life. I just want peace. If things get physical, we have to separate.”

Heard says she can’t promise she will “be perfect. I can’t promise you I won’t get physical again.”

Story continues below advertisement

“God, I f—ing — sometimes, I get so mad I lose it. I can f—ing promise you I will do everything to change. I promise you. I’m not going to throw around divorce,” she says.

“I love you and I want you to be my wife. And I want to be your husband,” Depp responds. “And I wanna be a good husband. If I haven’t been, I’ll do everything I can to find out how to be a good husband.”

Story continues below advertisement

Depp’s lawyer told USA Today that Heard “recorded her conversations with Depp.”

“The first confessional tape she made reveals a conversation any real abuse victim will recognize all too well,” Waldman said. “It exposes that Ms. Heard perpetrated serial violence against Mr. Depp, and then concocted an elaborate abuse hoax to cover it up. Ms. Heard gives a motive for her violence: Mr. Depp was always trying to ‘split’ to escape her abuse.”

Heard’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, told USA Today that she was also a victim of abuse and did not address the audio recording.

“The fact that a woman fights or talks back does not mean that she has not been the subject of repeated domestic violence and abuse,” the statement read. “It’s a myth to say, as Mr. Depp apparently is implying, that if Ms. Heard slapped him, then she can’t also be a victim. That is just not true.”

Fans of Depp took to Twitter after the audio was released and called for #JusticeForJohnnyDepp.

Depp and Heard — who met while filming The Rum Diary in 2011 — were married on Feb. 3, 2015. On May 23, 2016, Heard filed for divorce, seeking spousal support. She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason. They were officially divorced on Jan. 13, 2017.

Story continues below advertisement

Four days after filing for divorce, Heard requested a temporary domestic violence restraining order against Depp, which the judge granted after she submitted multiple photos as evidence of alleged assault, one of which purportedly shows the actress with what appears to be a bruise on her right eye. She claims that incident took place on May 21, less than 48 hours before she filed.

TMZ reported Depp had allegedly “smashed” his iPhone into Heard’s face, resulting in the bruise. Heard claimed Depp offered her money to stay quiet after he allegedly hit her but that she instead chose to file for divorce.

In March 2019, Depp sued Heard in a $50-million defamation lawsuit, citing a piece she wrote for the Washington Post about domestic abuse.

Story continues below advertisement

The complaint said that while Depp was not named in the Post article, it was clear Heard was talking about him. The lawsuit called her ongoing allegations of domestic abuse “categorically and demonstrably false.”

“They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” the lawsuit said, claiming: “She is the perpetrator.”

The suit said Depp has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean films.

Story continues below advertisement

In her article, published in the Post in December 2018, Heard also said she lost an acting role and a contract with a major fashion brand because she went public with her claims of abuse.

“I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath,” the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as though she was “on trial in the court of public opinion.”

Heard asked a judge to dismiss the defamation lawsuit in April 2019.

Heard’s lawyers reiterated allegations that Depp had abused her and included exhibits such as photos of her with a bruised face and scarred arms.

In August 2018, Depp alleged Heard had assaulted him in April 2016 for being almost two hours late to her 30th birthday party.

Story continues below advertisement

According to the court documents, Depp claimed Heard “had been drinking” that evening and “began criticizing” him once her guests left.

Depp had a meeting with his business manager and accountants before the party but alleged he sent Heard multiple text messages to keep her updated.

He claimed he “defended himself by grabbing [her] arms to stop her punching him again and told her to stop.”

Story continues below advertisement

Depp then allegedly “pushed her away from him onto the bed” and left the room.

In response to the accusations, a lawyer for Heard said: “These allegations are totally false. One needs only read the recent Rolling Stone article about Mr. Depp and the lawsuit filed against him by a location manager, among many other recent news stories and lawsuits, to understand his state of mind. Mr. Depp is currently being sued in multiple venues, including for assaulting a location manager on the set of City of Lies. On many occasions, eyewitnesses observed the extent of the abuse Mr. Depp inflicted on Ms. Heard.”

In May 2019, Depp said that “while mixing prescription amphetamines and non-prescription drugs with alcohol,” Heard “hit, punched, and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body and head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me.”

Depp submitted a photo of his black, puffy eyes and scratches. He also detailed an alleged attack by his ex-wife one month after their marriage in Australia and described his efforts to get Heard to sign a post-nuptial agreement.

The 56-year-old actor said the conversation resulted in the severing of his fingertip from a shattered glass bottle thrown at him by Heard.

'An Utter Disgrace': GOP Stimulus Plan Would Cut Taxes for Corporations While Denying Benefits to Poorest,http://commondreams.org/news/2020/03/20/utter-disgrace-gop-stimulus-plan-would-cut-taxes-corporations-while-denying-benefits,"""Heartless,"" ""cruel,"" and ""appalling"" were just some of the adjectives progressive critics and analysts used late Thursday to describe the Senate GOP's newly unveiled trillion-dollar economic stimulus package which—by design—would completely deny direct cash payments to the poorest Americans while cutting taxes for corporations, dishing out tens of billions in bailout funds to major industries, and restricting paid leave benefits that were just signed into law this week.

""The Senate GOP package is an utter disgrace,"" tweeted Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. ""It gives free money to corporations, ignores the health crisis, and does nothing to keep people working or help the unemployed. The labor movement will oppose this Main St. bailout of Wall St. with everything we have.""

""I don't know how else to describe this but wantonly wicked. The poorest get zero; low-income households get half of what middle-income households get; and a kid counts for 40% of an adult.""

—Daniel Hemel, University of Chicago Law School

The Republican plan, released as the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak continues to worsen, would provide means-tested cash payments of up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, with the precise amount dependent upon 2018 tax filings.

""Taxpayers with little or no income tax liability, but at least $2,500 of qualifying income, would be eligible for a minimum rebate check of $600 ($1,200 married),"" the Republican proposal states. ""Qualifying income includes earned income, as well as Social Security retirement benefits and certain compensation and pension benefits paid to veterans.""

Observers were quick to point out a gaping hole in the Republican plan: Adults with no qualifying income would get nothing.

""I don't know how else to describe this but wantonly wicked,"" said Daniel Hemel, a tax expert at the University of Chicago Law School. ""The poorest get zero; low-income households get half of what middle-income households get; and a kid counts for 40% of an adult.""

Kyle Pomerleau, an economist and resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, estimated that ""roughly 64 million filers earning less than $50k would not receive the full rebate amount of $1,200/$2,400"" under the GOP proposal.

""For a single filer, income must be at least about $23k to get the full $1,200,"" Pomerleau noted. ""For married couple filing jointly, [adjusted gross income] must be about $47k to get the full $2,400.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pitched the GOP proposal as a starting point for stimulus negotiations with the Democratic Party, but Democratic leaders quickly dismissed the plan as a non-starter.

""We are beginning to review Senator McConnell's proposal, and on first reading, it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement Thursday night.

Even two Republican lawmakers—Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)—dismissed the plan as regressive.

Relief to families in this emergency shouldn’t be regressive. Lower-income families shouldn’t be penalized — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) March 19, 2020

While skimping on aid low-income Americans, the Republican proposal—formally known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act—contains generous gifts for big corporations and billions in relief for industries hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, including $50 billion for airlines.

The 247-page Republican legislation, according to the New York Times, ""includes a raft of temporary changes to the tax code that would reduce the tax liability of large corporations, many of them overriding provisions in the 2017 tax overhaul that were meant to raise revenue to offset corporate rate cuts.""

The bill would also ""place new limits on a paid-leave program that Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law this week,"" the Times reported, ""shielding small business owners from any costs of paid leave for workers affected by the virus—and limiting how much pay those workers could receive if they are forced to stay home.""

""Senate Republicans are using the COVID-19 pandemic to cut corporate taxes again and stop you from getting paid sick leave,"" tweeted advocacy group Swing Left. ""They called it the CARES Act because Mitch CARES about big businesses, not you.""",JustBadNews,0

"Trump threatens to terminate free trade deal with South Korea, says he wants Seoul to pay for THAAD",http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/27/trump-threatens-to-terminate-free-trade-deal-with-south-korea-says-he-wants-seoul-to-pay-for-thaad.html,"President Donald Trump said that he will either renegotiate or terminate a ""horrible"" trade deal with South Korea, Reuters reported late Thursday.

The president also said he wants South Korea to pay for the $1 billion THAAD missile defense system, Reuters said.

Responses to Trump's comments soon arose, with an official from South Korea's automakers association telling Reuters that the group is now concerned about ""the uncertainty"" of the free trade agreement.

Shares in Hyundai Motor fell as much as 2.4 percent following Trump's comments. South Korea's won turned weaker on the comments.

Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ, told CNBC such a reaction is expected given "" massive amounts of foreign inflows"" into Asia, particularly Korea and Taiwan, over the last month ""as trade tensions between the U.S. and China have eased off.""

""So investors are thinking that perhaps the worst on trade tensions with Asia is not going to happen,"" he said. ""And all of a sudden, this has come from a bit of a left field, so I think what we're going to see now is markets perhaps need to start pricing a little bit more potential of trade tensions between the U.S. and Korea.""

Still, he added that Trump's comments were likely ""just a negotiating tactic.""

An official from South Korea's Finance Ministry said that the U.S. administration had not yet requested anything on the free trade agreement.

And on the issue of THAAD payment, a foreign policy advisor to South Korea's presidential front-runner, Moon Jae-in, said that Seoul shelling out for the missile defense system is an ""impossible option,"" according to Reuters.",JustBadNews,0

How unethical groups minted millions from anti-HIV male circumcision,http://standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001348778/how-unethical-groups-minted-millions-from-anti-hiv-male-cut,"A vicious scramble for money within the US funded anti-HIV male circumcision project in Kenya has exposed the targeted boys to risks.

Data collected and published on Monday by the Kenya Medical Research Institute and US researchers blames ambitious money-based targets for the tragedy.

To get as much funding as possible, the report says, project implementers have thrown the rule book out of the window.

Vices being employed include recruiting underage children, bribing them, engaging unqualified circumcisers and even inadequate stitching of the boys.

The project, which has circumcised about 1.6 million males since 2007 works through community mobilisers who recruit clients; boys above 10 years and present them to project clinics.

These clinics largely run by NGOs and faith groups, get funding based on steep circumcision targets set by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief’s (PEPFAR).

Steep targets

In 2016 alone for example, the report says PEPFAR spent over Sh1.6 billion ($15 million) for Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision in Kenya.

To get as many boys as possible and meet targets, mobilisers recruited even under age boys, bribing, threatening, intimidating and cajoling others to join in the line.

In August, another study reported about 35,000 underage boys have been circumcised without parental knowledge or consent in the ongoing HIV prevention project.

To get the numbers the new report says anything goes. “We are calling it ‘broking (brokering) system,” says a mobiliser.

He said although they are not supposed to give children money they sometimes have to pay a boy about Sh50 for him to bring in his friends.

“For instance, if he brings four, I give 100–150 KES. At the end of the day, I will hit my target,” says the mobiliser.

But things get more interesting once the boys get to the clinic especially during the high seasons, usually during school holidays like now.

The rule book says a circumcision team should incorporate one surgeon, a surgical assistant, a counselor and infection prevention officer all working together in each case.

Such a team should on average do no more than 12 cuts a day. On average one case the report says should take 12 to 25 minutes.

However during the peak season, the Kemri team says it confirmed these guidelines are not observed with an operation sometimes taking just about six minutes.

To achieve maximum cuts, the study says the four-member teams, ignore the guidelines, split up with each person working individually on their own cases.

This way, the study says one person can do as many as 25 cases in a day which involves standing up for long hours, often from early morning into the night.

“So if you do 20 clients or 25 clients in a day, every day, say from Monday to Friday, it is a hell of a tiresome job,” says a clinical officer.

Because of resultant fatigue, the officer says there were many cases of adverse events such as bleeding, pain or swellings.

“If you look at timings of most of the adverse events, you realise they usually happen late in the evening or in the afternoon after lunch; so it has always been attributed to high volume in terms of targets, and then fatigue, and not following protocol,” says the clinician.

Rushed circumcisions

Other time-saving avenues include rushing circumcisions, inadequate stitching, splitting surgical utensils and bandage packs between patients.

This mess in the project, run by the National AIDS and STIs Control Programme (NASCOP) under the Ministry of Health is blamed on the rush to secure target based American dollars.

To get a client to the clinic, mobilisers say is a do or die event, “. . .we are paid upon reaching the target … so we are really competing, somebody may grab your clients before you know it,” says a 28-year-old, male community-level mobiliser.

“. . .targets. . . are about funding, and if you do not reach your target, you do not get funding,” said a 49-year-old male mobilisation supervisor.

This is the second time the voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) programme in Kenya has come under fire over unethical conduct.

In December (2018) a report by NASCOP and US agencies indicated the high success rates associated with the programme may have been based on falsified data.

The study reported suspected intentional inflation of data by some implementing partners to meet targets and justify continued funding.

The current study, which also involved the University of North Carolina, US, is advising the involved parties to relook at the high target numbers versus the quality of care and the rights of clients.",JustBadNews,0
"Girl, 17, 'suffers three separate sex attacks' on way home from night out",http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/13/girl-17-suffers-three-separate-sex-attacks-way-home-night/,"A 17-year-old girl was sexually assaulted three times by three separate men within an hour in an “unprecedented” and gravely traumatising ordeal.

The teenager was walking home from a nightclub in Tower Hamlets, east London, when she was targeted by the men in quick succession.

The local authority announced on Friday that it was investing £3million to put an additional 19 officers on the streets in the crime-ridden borough after losing almost 200 officers in seven years due to government cuts.

Police said there was absolutely no link between the “opportunistic” attacks on the teenager, two of which were described as very serious, possibly rape. The third suspect may have been part of a group.

The victim, who is a student, was so deeply traumatised that her memory was affected. Officers fear she may have been drugged.

It is hoped that the men will be identified by CCTV images, one of whom in particular - the second suspected attacker - is clearly pictured.

The girl’s ordeal began shortly before midnight on Friday September 29. She had spent the evening at a club with friends but became separated from them and was trying to make her way home.",JustBadNews,0
"Amazon rainforest fire: Forests in Brazil, Greenland, and Siberia are burning",http://vox.com/world/2019/8/20/20813786/wildfire-amazon-rainforest-brazil-siberia,"An alarming cluster of wildfires are now burning in the Amazon rainforest and are threatening to disrupt international negotiations. French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday laid the blame for the Amazon fires on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, calling the blazes an “international crisis” and promising to bring it up at the G7 summit this weekend.

Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest - the lungs which produces 20% of our planet’s oxygen - is on fire. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit, let's discuss this emergency first order in two days! #ActForTheAmazon pic.twitter.com/dogOJj9big — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) August 22, 2019

The Amazon rainforest is the world’s largest tropical forest. It’s an area with torrential rain that almost never burns on its own, yet the blazes have burned for more than two weeks, growing so intense that they sent smoke all the way to São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city.

Just a little alert to the world: the sky randomly turned dark today in São Paulo, and meteorologists believe it’s smoke from the fires burning *thousands* of kilometers away, in Rondônia or Paraguay. Imagine how much has to be burning to create that much smoke(!). SOS pic.twitter.com/P1DrCzQO6x — Shannon Sims (@shannongsims) August 20, 2019

The state of Amazonas has declared an emergency. The #PrayforAmazonia tag has surged on social media as users blamed darkened skies above São Paulo on the fires, though some meteorologists said the low clouds were a normal weather phenomenon.

But the Amazon is not the only region that’s burning. More than 21,000 square miles of forest have gone up in flames in Siberia this month, putting Russia on track for its worst year on record for wildfires. The smoke from these blazes shrouded large parts of the country, including major cities like Novosibirsk, and has crossed the Pacific Ocean into the United States.

On Monday, a wildfire in the Canary Islands forced more than 8,000 people to flee. Over the weekend, new fires ignited in Alaska, extending what’s already been an unusually long fire season for the state. Last week, Denmark dispatched firefighters to Greenland combat a wildfire approaching inhabited areas. If not extinguished, officials are worried the blaze would burn through the winter, further driving up the already massive ice melt Greenland has experienced this year amid record heat.

California, which suffered its most destructive wildfire season on record in 2018, is having a much calmer year by comparison, although the potential for a major fire remains.

Many of these wildfires stem from unprecedented warmth and dryness across many parts of the world this year. And in the case of the Amazon, they are an unmistakable sign of how humans are radically reshaping the planet.

Conditions were ripe for major fires this year

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last week that this past July was the hottest July on record. The next five hottest Julys were all in the past five years.

This is not just for the northern hemisphere, where it’s summer right now, but for the whole world. The average global temperature last month was 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average.

It may not seem like much, but remember that this is an average, which can obscure the extremes. And there were plenty of extremes last month.

The Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium set temperature records. Paris recorded its highest temperature ever, 108.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Parts of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Spain also experienced unprecedented high temperatures. Huge swaths of the United States also baked in a heat wave last month, with minimum temperatures approaching or breaking records.

So it’s not too surprising that many of the areas burning right now experienced extreme heat last month: Siberia, Alaska, the Canary Islands.

Alaska and the Canary Islands have also dealt with severe drought this year. In May, Alaska reported “extreme” drought conditions, the first time such a rating was recorded for the state, according to the US Drought Monitor.

These conditions have long been known to exacerbate wildfires. High heat and low moisture means vegetation dries out. But people play a critical role too.

Humans make wildfires worse. In the Amazon, humans are the underlying cause.

In many ecosystems, wildfires are a natural and essential phenomenon. They clear out decaying brush, restore nutrients to soil, and even help plants germinate. But in recent years, humans have made the destruction from wildfires worse at every step. Suppression of natural fires has allowed dry vegetation to accumulate. Human activity is changing the climate, which is forcing some forests to heat up and dry out. People are building ever closer to areas ready to ignite. And people end up igniting the majority of wildfires, whether through downed power lines, errant sparks, or arson.

But the Amazon rainforest, which remains drenched for much of the year, does not burn naturally. Instead, the fires are ignited by people. Farmers use slash-and-burn tactics to clear land for farming and pasture, though it’s illegal in Brazil this time of year due to fire risk.

Illegal logging operations in Brazil have also been known to start fires as a tactic to drive indigenous people off their land and to cover their tracks. The Amazon rainforest has experienced a major surge in the number of fires this year, with more than 74,000 reported so far. It’s an 84 percent increase over the number of wildfires at the same time last year.

“There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or the rainfall in the Amazon region, which is just a little below average,” Alberto Setzer, a researcher at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), told Reuters. “The dry season creates the favorable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident.”

The Amazon rainforest fires are becoming an international political concern

The source of the current wildfires in Brazil is not yet known, and the government in Brazil is not all that inclined to find out. INPE’s director, Ricardo Galvão, was ousted from his job earlier this month after his agency reported an 88 percent increase in the deforestation rate in the Amazon.

Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, called the deforestation data “lies.” On Wednesday, he accused non-governmental organizations of starting fires after the government withdrew funding for these groups. He provided no evidence for this claim.

When pressed further about the fires on Thursday, Bolsonaro said the government didn’t have the resources to respond. And he again reiterated his claim that NGOs started the fires, according to the BBC:

Asked on Thursday who was responsible for starting the fires, he responded: “The Indians, do you want me to blame the Indians? Do you want me to blame the Martians?... Everyone is a suspect, but the biggest suspects are NGOs.” Asked if there was any proof of this, he replied: “Did I accuse NGOs directly? I just said I suspect them.”

The French government meanwhile is laying the blame on the Brazilian government. France’s Macron accused Bolsonaro of failing to uphold earlier commitments to preserve the rainforest. “The president can only conclude President Bolsonaro lied to him at the Osaka summit,” a French official told Politico, referring to the June G20 meeting.

This deforestation stands to have major regional consequences. Without trees in place to anchor the soil and retain moisture, the underlying vegetation can dry out, making it easier to burn. Trees also evaporate a huge volume of water and emit chemicals that make it condense, helping the rainforest generate its own rainfall.

Right now, the Amazon has been deforested by 15 percent or more from its primeval state and scientists are worried that if it reaches 25 percent, there won’t be enough trees cycling water through the forest. The region will cross a tipping point and eventually degrade into savanna.

This has huge consequences for the rest of the world as well. The Amazon rainforest produces huge amounts of oxygen. Its vegetation holds on to billions of metric tons of carbon that could oxidize into heat-trapping gases.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change earlier this month reported that conserving areas like the Amazon rainforest will be integral to mitigating climate change. But with the current pace of wildfires and deforestation, the world is rapidly galloping in the wrong direction.",JustBadNews,0
"MESSAGE FOR: Every American Citizen - Some sneaky Georgia Congressman was just bribed to sell us all out with secret ""CLOUD ACT"" that gives cops & Big Brother the right to gather Any or ALL of our social media info without a warrant! (cross_post from message_center)",https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/eff-and-x-groups-tell-congress-oppose-cloud-act,"EFF and 23 other civil liberties organizations sent a letter to Congress urging Members and Senators to oppose the CLOUD Act and any efforts to attach it to other legislation.

The CLOUD Act (S. 2383 and H.R. 4943) is a dangerous bill that would tear away global privacy protections by allowing police in the United States and abroad to grab cross-border data without following the privacy rules of where the data is stored. Currently, law enforcement requests for cross-border data often use a legal system called the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties, or MLATs. This system ensures that, for example, should a foreign government wish to seize communications stored in the United States, that data is properly secured by the Fourth Amendment requirement for a search warrant.

The other groups signing the new coalition letter against the CLOUD Act are Access Now, Advocacy for Principled Action in Government, American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International USA, Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), Campaign for Liberty, Center for Democracy & Technology, CenterLink: The Community of LGBT Centers, Constitutional Alliance, Defending Rights & Dissent, Demand Progress Action, Equality California, Free Press Action Fund, Government Accountability Project, Government Information Watch, Human Rights Watch, Liberty Coalition, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National Black Justice Coalition, New America's Open Technology Institute, OpenMedia, People For the American Way, and Restore The Fourth.

The CLOUD Act allows police to bypass the MLAT system, removing vital U.S. and foreign country privacy protections. As we explained in our earlier letter to Congress, the CLOUD Act would:

Allow foreign governments to wiretap on U.S. soil under standards that do not comply with U.S. law;

Give the executive branch the power to enter into foreign agreements without Congressional approval or judicial review, including foreign nations with a well-known record of human rights abuses;

Possibly facilitate foreign government access to information that is used to commit human rights abuses, like torture; and

Allow foreign governments to obtain information that could pertain to individuals in the U.S. without meeting constitutional standards.

You can read more about EFF’s opposition to the CLOUD Act here.

The CLOUD Act creates a new channel for foreign governments seeking data about non-U.S. persons who are outside the United States. This new data channel is not governed by the laws of where the data is stored. Instead, the foreign police may demand the data directly from the company that handles it. Under the CLOUD Act, should a foreign government request data from a U.S. company, the U.S. Department of Justice would not need to be involved at any stage. Also, such requests for data would not need to receive individualized, prior judicial review before the data request is made.

The CLOUD Act’s new data delivery method lacks not just meaningful judicial oversight, but also meaningful Congressional oversight, too. Should the U.S. executive branch enter a data exchange agreement—known as an “executive agreement”—with foreign countries, Congress would have little time and power to stop them. As we wrote in our letter:

“[T]he CLOUD Act would allow the executive branch to enter into agreements with foreign governments—without congressional approval. The bill stipulates that any agreement negotiated would go into effect 90 days after Congress was notified of the certification, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval, which would require presidential approval or sufficient votes to overcome a presidential veto.”

And under the bill, the president could agree to enter executive agreements with countries that are known human rights abusers.

Troublingly, the bill also fails to protect U.S. persons from the predictable, non-targeted collection of their data. When foreign governments request data from U.S. companies about specific “targets” who are non-U.S. persons not living in the United States, these governments will also inevitably collect data belonging to U.S. persons who communicate with the targeted individuals. Much of that data can then be shared with U.S. authorities, who can then use the information to charge U.S. persons with crimes. That data sharing, and potential criminal prosecution, requires no probable cause warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment, violating our constitutional rights.

The CLOUD Act is a bad bill. We urge Congress to stop it, and any attempts to attach it to must-pass spending legislation.

Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada,https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/canada/scissors-attack-on-girl-in-hijab-did-not-happen-police-1.3759910#_gus&_gucid=&_gup=twitter&_gsc=65GdQmk,"Toronto police say an incident involving an 11-year-old girl who claimed to have her hijab cut by a stranger on the street, ""did not happen.""

On Friday, Toronto police said they were investigating a report that a young girl was attacked by a man with scissors, as she was walking to school in the east end of the city.

According to officers at the time, the 11-year-old girl was on her way to Pauline Johnson Public School in Scarborough, when she felt something and turned around to see a man trying to cut her hijab with a pair of scissors. She said she screamed and ran away, but the man returned less than 10 minutes later and tried to cut it once again.

In speaking with CTV News on Monday, Toronto Police Service spokesperson Mark Pugash said investigators reached the conclusion after sifting through the evidence.

“We had, as everyone knows, allegations of an extremely serious crime on Friday which we investigated -- we had a team of investigators who put together a significant amount of evidence and they came to the conclusion that the events that were alleged did not happen,” Pugash said.

“We have spoken with (the girl), we have spoken to all the people the public would expect us to speak to in the course of a thorough investigation, and when we put all of that together -- we looked at it very closely -- and that was the conclusion that we came to.”

Pugash said police wanted to make the update public as soon as possible.

“That’s why we put that information out as quickly as we could,” he said. “It… quite understandably reached an enormous amount of media and social media attention and we thought it was important that get our officers’ determination out as soon as we could so that people could have an accurate understanding of something that caused significant concern.”

Some of the social media attention Pugash refers to came from prominent Canadian politicians including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, Toronto Mayor John Tory and Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, all of whom condemned the alleged attack.

In a statement sent to CTVNews.ca Monday afternoon, Office of the Prime Minister spokesperson Eleanore Catenaro said, “We are thankful and relieved that this incident did not take place.”

“We have seen an unfortunate pattern of increased hate crimes in past months directed towards religious minorities, particularity towards women,” the PMO statement also said. “We need to take this issue extremely seriously as this pattern is a warning sign of increased intolerance.”

Wynne told The Canadian Press she is glad the alleged incident didn’t happen after all.

""I join all Ontarians in being thankful and relieved that this assault did not take place,"" she said.

In a statement released to CTV Toronto on Monday, the Toronto District School Board said, “We are very thankful that this assault did not in fact happen. We won’t be commenting further.""

Police say their investigation is concluded.

"First France, Now Brazil Unveils Plans to Empower the Government to Censor the Internet in the Name of Stopping ?Fake News?",https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/first-france-now-brazil-unveils-plans-to-empower-the-government-to-censure-the-internet-in-the-name-of-stopping-fake-news/,"Yesterday afternoon, the official Twitter account of Brazil’s Federal Police (its FBI equivalent) posted an extraordinary announcement. The bureaucratically nonchalant tone it used belied its significance. The tweet, at its core, purports to vest in the federal police and the federal government that oversees it the power to regulate, control, and outright censor political content on the internet that is assessed to be “false,” and to “punish” those who disseminate it. The new power would cover both social media posts and entire websites devoted to politics. “In the next few days, the Federal Police will begin activities in Brasília [the nation’s capital] by a specially formed group to combat false news during the [upcoming 2018 presidential] election process,” the official police tweet stated. It added: “The measures are intended to identify and punish the authors of ‘fake news’ for or against candidates.” Top police officials told media outlets that their working group would include representatives of the judiciary’s election branch and leading prosecutors, though one of the key judicial figures involved is the highly controversial right-wing Supreme Court judge, Gilmar Mendes, who has long blurred judicial authority with his political activism.

Among the most confounding aspects of the Twitter announcement is that it is very difficult to identify any existing law that actually authorizes the federal police to exercise the powers they just announced they intend to wield, particularly over the internet. At least as of now, they are claiming for themselves one of the most extremist powers imaginable — the right of the government to control and suppress political content on the internet during an election — with no legal framework to define its parameters or furnish safeguards against abuse. Proponents of this new internet censorship program have suggested they will seek congressional enactment of a new law to authorize the censorship program and define how it functions. But it is far from clear that Brazil’s dysfunctional Congress — in which a majority of members face corruption charges — will be able to enact a new statutory scheme before the election. Tellingly, these police officials vow that they will proceed to implement the censorship program even if no new law is enacted. They insist that no new laws are necessary by pointing to a pre-internet censorship law enacted in 1983 — during the time Brazil was ruled by a brutal military dictatorship that severely limited free expression and routinely imprisoned dissidents. A top police official just yesterday warned that, absent a new law, they will invoke the authorities of one of the dictatorship era’s most repressive laws: the so-called Law of National Security, which contain deliberately vague passages making it a felony to “spread rumors that caused panic.” Yet he complained that the old dictatorship-era law is inadequate in part because it is too lenient, providing “only” for “months” in prison for those who disseminate “fake news,” which he called a “very low punishment.” That 1983 legal framework was used by Brazil’s military dictatorship to arrest dissidents, critics, and democracy activists. That they are now eyeing a resurrection of this dictatorship-era censorship law to regulate and censor contemporary political expression on the internet — all in the name of stopping “fake news” — powerfully symbolizes how inherently tyrannical and dangerous are all government attempts to control political expression. The move to obtain new censorship authority over the internet by Brazilian police officials would be disturbing enough standing alone given Brazil’s status as the world’s fifth most populous country and second-largest in the hemisphere. But that Brazil’s announcement closely follows very similar efforts unveiled last week by French President Emmanuel Macron strongly suggests a trend in which governments are now exploiting concerns over “fake news” to justify state control over the internet. In his New Year’s speech to journalists at the Élysée palace, the French president vowed that his new law would contain some robust transparency obligations for websites — ones for which valid arguments may be assembled. But the crux of the law is censorship: During elections, “an emergency legal action could allow authorities to remove that content or even block the website.” As in Brazil, the new French power would cover social media platforms and traditional media outlets alike, allowing the government through an as-yet-unknown process to simply remove entire political websites from the internet. Beyond having one’s political content forcibly suppressed by the state, disseminators of “fake news” could face fines of many millions of dollars. Given Macron’s legislature majority, “there is little doubt about its ability to pass,” the Atlantic reports. Both Brazil and France cited the same purported justification for obtaining censorship powers over the internet: namely, the dangers posed by alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. But no matter how significant one views Russian involvement in the U.S. election, it is extremely difficult to see how — beyond rank fear-mongering — that could justify these types of draconian censorship powers by Brasília and Paris. There has never been any indication of any remote Russian interest in Brazilian’s domestic elections. The claims from Macron and France during the election that were uncritically believed by Western media outlets — that he was the victim of Russian hacking — turned out to lack any credible evidence, as France’s own cyber security agency concluded after an investigation. (That same pattern repeated itself in Germany, where vocal warnings about the inevitability of Russian interference in German elections were followed by post-election admissions that there was no evidence of any such thing.)

All censorship efforts rest on the same tactic: generating fear over exaggerated threats posed by villains, sometime domestic ones but more often foreign villains. The Brazilian and French tactic for inducing the public to acquiesce to this censorship faithfully follows that script. Though presented as modern necessities to combat new, contemporaneous problems, both countries’ proposals have all the defining attributes — and all the classic pitfalls and severe dangers — of standard state censorship efforts. To begin with, the fact that these censorship powers are confined to election time makes it more menacing, not less: Having a population choose its leaders is exactly when free expression is most vital, and when the dangers of abuse of censorship powers wielded by state officials are most acute and obvious. Worse, these new censorship proposals are centrally based on a newly concocted term that, from the start, never had any clear or consistent definition. In the wake of Donald Trump’s unexpected 2016 victory, U.S. media outlets produced a tidal wave of reports warning of the damage and pervasiveness of “fake news.” Seemingly overnight, every media outlet and commentator was casually using the term as though its meaning were clear and indisputable. Yet, as many have long been warning, few people, if any, ever bothered to define what the term actually means. As a result, it’s incredibly vague, shifting, and devoid of consistent meaning. Do any news articles that contain false, significant assertions qualify? Is there some intent requirement, and if so, what is it and how is determined (does recklessness qualify)? Can large mainstream outlets such as the Washington Post, Le Monde, and Globo be guilty of publishing “fake news” and thus subject to this censorship, or is it — as one expects — reserved only for small, independent blogs and outlets that lack a powerful corporate presence? Ill-defined terms that become popularized in political discourse are, by definition, terms of propaganda rather than reliable, meaningful indicators of problems. And invariably, they wreak all kinds of predictable havoc and inevitably give rise to abuses of power. More than anything else, such terms — which, by design, mean whatever the powerful groups wielding them want them to mean — so often produce arbitrary censorship in the name of combatting them. Just consider two similarly ill-defined but popular propagandistic terms — “terrorism” and “hate speech” — which have been appropriated by governments all over the world to justify the most extreme, repressive powers. The last decade has seen multiple countries on every continent — including the world’s most repressive regimes — obliterate basic civil liberties in the name of stopping “terrorism,” by which they mean little other than “those who oppose our regime.” And then there’s “hate speech,” which can sometimes be used to silence Nazis or overt racists, but also can be and often is used to silence a wide range of left-wing views, from war opposition to advocacy of Palestinian rights. State censorship is always dangerous, but the danger is exponentially magnified when the censorship targets (terrorism, hate speech, fake news) lack clear definition.",JustBadNews,0
Miss Israel: Iraqi contestant's family forced to flee country over joint selfie,https://www.timesofisrael.com/miss-israel-iraqi-contestants-family-forced-to-flee-country-over-joint-selfie/,"Relatives of the Iraqi contestant in the Miss Universe Pageant were forced to flee the Middle Eastern country over photos with her Israeli counterpart and Miss Iraq’s modeling in a bikini, Miss Israel told Hadashot news Wednesday.

“The two of those things together caused a mess for her back home where people made threats against her and her family that if she didn’t return home and take down the photos, they would remove her (Miss Iraq) title, that they would kill her,” Adar Gandelsman told Israeli TV.

“Out of fear, they left Iraq at least until the situation calms down,” the Miss Universe Israel contestant added, referring to the family of Miss Iraq, Sarah Idan, who now lives in the US.

Gandelsman, who said she has been in contact with Idan since the competition, relayed that her friend does not regret the decision to post the photos.

“She did it to so that people can understand that it’s possible to live together,” she said.

Last month, Idan defended her decision to pose with Gandelsman following criticism she received back home, saying it was an expression of a desire for peace and not a show of support for the government of Israel.

“I want to stress that the purpose of the picture was only to express hope and desire for peace between the two countries,” wrote Miss Iraq (in Arabic) in an Instagram post.

She added that the photo of the two Miss Universe contestants, which she did not remove from her Instagram account, “does not signal support for the government of Israel and does not mean I agree or accept its policies in the Arab homeland.”

Idan went on to apologize “to all those who consider [the picture] harmful to the Palestinian cause.”

With Miss Iraq, Practicing bringing world peace 😉 Posted by Adar Gandelsman on Tuesday, 14 November 2017

Idan explained that Gandelsman initiated the photo, saying she hoped there would be peace between Jews and Muslims and that neither side would have to send their children to the military.

Some on Arab social media raged against her decision to be photographed with an Israeli, and the comments on her Instagram post were filled with curses at her for ostensibly hurting the Palestinian cause.

Both Gandelsman and Idan published the joint selfie photos on their Instagram pages while participating in the Miss Universe International Beauty Pageant, in an unusual display of coexistence emanating from a divided Middle East.

Iraq and Israel do not have diplomatic relations and the two countries are considered enemies.

“Get to know, this is Miss Iraq and she’s amazing,” enthused Gandelsman in her original Instagram post. “Practicing bringing world peace,” she wrote on Facebook, in time-honored beauty queen style.

“Peace and Love from Miss Iraq and Miss Israel,” wrote Idan on her instagram post, followed by heart emojis.

"Chinese 'rooftopper' Wu Yongning plunges to his death from 62-storey tower as $20,000 stunt goes wrong",http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-12/chinese-rooftopper-dies-in-stunt-gone-wrong/9250198,"A Chinese rooftop climber has died after plunging from a 62-storey building when one of his high-rise stunts went awry.

Wu Yongning, 26, had more than 60,000 followers on Chinese social media network Weibo, where he regularly posted videos and photos of himself 'rooftopping'.

Mr Wu fell from the top of the Huayuan Hua Centre in Changsha, in the Hunan province in China's south-east, the South China Morning Post reported, citing police.

Chinese media reported Mr Wu had been offered prizemoney of 100,000 yuan ($20,000) for his latest stunt, but there were no details about who the sponsor was.

Rooftopping is a dangerous trend involving scaling high-rise buildings and other structures, many of which are not accessible to the public, and performing risky stunts.

Participants regularly post videos online, showing themselves hanging from building ledges, cranes and windows.

Although Mr Wu died on November 8, his death was only picked up by Chinese media in December after a Weibo user identifying themselves as Mr Wu's girlfriend posted about the incident.

Chinese media reported the 26-year-old's online fans had been worried Mr Wu had not posted on Weibo since November 8.

Purported video of the incident circulating online shows Mr Wu lowering himself down the side of the building before attempting to get back up, and losing his grip.

Some media outlets reported Mr Wu fell several storeys and on to a landing.

Dangerous activity widely condemned

Weibo users left about 16,000 comments on Mr Wu's last social media post. While many berated the 26-year-old, others were sympathetic.

""Everyone has something they are passionate about. For this high-risk activity, we can choose not to support him or not to abuse him,"" one user wrote.

""Although his behaviour was a bad influence on kids and teenagers, he should not be condemned after his death.""

Another user wished Mr Wu would ""be safe in heaven"".

Rooftopping has been widely condemned by law enforcement agencies around the world.

In 2015, Russian police launched a campaign urging young people to take safer selfies after a rise in deaths of people who were striking high-risk poses.

Last year, two teens were arrested in Adelaide after breaking into building sites and taking photos of themselves hanging from cranes, walls and ledges.

The teens were both charged with trespass offences, and were spared convictions and placed on good behaviour bonds.

Two other teens, who were under 18 at the time, were cautioned over the incident.",JustBadNews,0
"British Jack Hadfield, men's-rights activist and frequent contributor to alt-right Breitbart, is revealed as administrator of secret, racist Facebook group.",http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2017/11/23/exposed-breitbart-writers-vile-racist-group/,"As we can exclusively reveal, frequent Breitbart contributor Jack Hadfield acts as an administrator of the right-wing “free speech” Facebook group the Young Right Society (YRS), which is frequently awash with appalling racist and ‘alt-right’ content.

Hadfield has authored over 200 articles for the far-right news outlet Breitbart, itself accused of pandering to the white nationalist alt-right.

Membership of the secret group has included open fascists and nazis, well-known alt-right figures such as Scottish vlogger Colin Robertson (aka Millennial Woes), alongside Conservative Party activists and UKIP youth leader Jamie Ross McKenzie.

The group’s moderator, Michael Brooks – who wrote that he was “14 and 88” (an infamous white supremacist slogan) – has been pictured posing with several politicians, including Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and a grinning Nigel Farage.

Alarmingly Brooks was even snapped alongside Prime Minister Theresa May at the Conservative Party conference last month.

Just three weeks later a YRS contingent – including Brooks – attended the October conference of the far-right Traditional Britain Group (TBG), at which Martin Sellner, Austrian leader of the racist Identitarian movement, announced the launch of its UK branch.

YRS has also held other social events in London, Belfast and Manchester.

Fascism on display

YRS is billed as “a place for those who are on the Right (basically anything right of centre) to discuss politics, philosophy, and general Right-wing stuff with as little censorship or government intervention as possible”.

Whilst the group’s membership (of around 200 people) includes those with more moderate views, there is a large and vocal contingent of open racists active in YRS, including several who have been appointed to managing roles (as admins or moderators) in the group alongside Hadfield.

Posts include jokes about the Holocaust, antisemitic conspiracy theories, celebrations of British wartime fascist leader Oswald Mosley, and jokes about Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s practice of murdering political dissidents by dropping them from helicopters (a common gag among alt-right adherents).

One poster described Jo Cox, the Labour MP murdered by nazi extremist Thomas Mair, as “a virtue-signalling, more-progressive-than-thou cunt”, with commenter Lorcan Maneely – who has been photographed with Hadfield – writing below “I don’t care if traitors die”.

Some members even wrote supportively of Scottish Dawn, a group that has been outlawed as a faction of the banned neo-nazi group National Action (NA). Chris Ram, a London-based alt-right organiser, shared an article from Noose, a National Action-linked webzine.

Meanwhile, Cian Jones, who provides security for the racial-nationalist London Forum, posted the prison letter of Lawrence Burns, a National Action member currently behind bars for inciting racial hatred, which was described by Jones as “inspiring”.

Michael Brooks

Group moderator Michael Brooks was snapped at the Conservative Party conference in October in close proximity to PM May and her husband Philip. He has also been photographed posing with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.

This is worrying in light of his activity on the group. For example, Brooks posted a graph showing a supposed increase in the population of sub-Saharan Africa with the caption “Planet of the Apes isn’t science fiction, it’s a warning“.

In another post he wrote “There is a riot happening in Dalston in North East London. In this thread we discuss the ethnicities and theories as to why they are biologically destined to engage in this behaviour :^)”.

The group’s moderator Michael Brooks wrote that he was “14 and 88”, an infamous white supremacist slogan

He also wrote that the idea of a “white identitarian, paramilitary organisation known as the “white shirts” sounds kinda cool, even if it is larpy“, and posted supportively of the first of Richard Spencer’s torchlight marches in Charlottesville Virginia, USA in May.

Brooks also suggested changing the YRS group banner to Nazi iconography in order to “weed out the weak and keep normies away” (to which Hadfield replied “Swastikas are unbritish m8. You’ve got the right aesthetic but it’s too autistic”).

Conversely, elsewhere on the group he wrote “you fucking right wing faggots need to knock off the nazi/ethnonat stuff. It drives off Civics who I keep adding and are open to nationalistm [sic]”, going on to claim that “I am 14 and 88, but even I know optics and recruiting normies”.

Brooks also claimed that he attended a Loyalist bonfire in Belfast in July along with far-right content creators Lauren Southern and Brittany Pettibone. YRS admin Philip Donaghy is featured in a video of the event, filmed by web journalist Tim Pool.

HOPE not hate was unable to contact Michael Brooks for comment.

Other members have included Tom Cormack, a leader of the tiny but hardline racist group British Imperative (BI). Hadfield himself claimed that he finds “NatSocs” (National Socialists) “autistic”.

Group admin Donaghy, who at one point posted an article from the nazi website Daily Stormer, suggested members use the code words “Knigr” or “Fgit” to in place of traditional slurs in order to avoid detection by Facebook.

Jack Hadfield

Hadfield began writing for Breitbart after he refused to attend “consent classes” as a student at Warwick University in October 2015. He now contributes primarily to the Tech section of the website.

As one of four group admins – alongside James Hart, Philip Donaghy and Phillip Campbell – Hadfield is able to moderate the group’s content and ban people from the page.

However, while largely refraining from posting gutter racism himself, he appears highly concerned with maintaining the group’s secrecy rather than any real effort to clamp down on the foul hatred prevalent within YRS.

Hadfield wrote that “group security is paramount to allow discussion of all ideas, even if you find those ideas abhorrent or even disgusting. Please challenge those who disagree with you, instead of posting their opinions for all and sunder to see“.

However, elsewhere Hadfield described YRS as “a Fascist-Juggalo group with traditionalism interest”, claiming that “we tolerate other ideologies but make no mistake if you don’t like it, you know where the door is”.

Hadfield also posted the work of Italian “traditionalist” philosopher Julius Evola, who idolised Hitler’s murderous SS and was admired by Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, with the caption “Got me some good new summer reading”. The book was published by Arktos, the central publisher of the racist alt-right.

Jack Hadfield did not respond to a request for comment.

Dressed up racism

While Hadfield has rejected ethno-nationalism (a belief that nations should be ethnically homogenous, a favoured ideology of the alt-right), group members regularly discussed the merits of racial or ethno-nationalism versus civic nationalism, often posting polls to gauge the opinion of members.

In one poll, 47% of respondents claimed they considered themselves “ethnic nationalists”, more than any other category. In another, 90% of respondents voted in favour of ethno-nationalism being accepted as “part and parcel” of YRS.

Posts include jokes about the Holocaust, antisemitic conspiracy theories, celebrations of British wartime fascist leader Oswald Mosley, and jokes about Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s practice of murdering political dissidents by dropping them from helicopters (a common gag among the alt-right)

Another poll revealed 72% agreeing with the claim that the “disparity between the average IQs of different races” was caused primarily by genetic factors. An additional poll showed 72% agreeing that a “racially diverse society is undesirable“.

Over half (53%) of YRS poll respondents claimed that giving women the right to vote was “a mistake” and 78% voted positively when Michael Brooks posed the question “would you unironically support the immediate liquidation of all communists, communists organisations and enablers of communist subversives”.

UKIP

Jamie Ross McKenzie, Chairman of UKIP’s Young Independence (YI) youth group, has also been active in the YRS group, using it to promote UKIP leadership candidate John Rees-Evans and to respond to enquiries about the state of UKIP’s youth movement.

McKenzie also chipped in on debate about the merits of civic nationalism versus ethnic nationalism, writing that he considered himself a “patriot” rather than a nationalist. Alt-right vlogger Colin Robertson (aka Millennial Woes) pointed out that the two shared five mutual Facebook friends.

McKenzie has previously come under fire for failing to manage the racist and sexist trolling prevalent on UKIP’s YI Facebook group.

Meetings

The group has also organised a number of offline meetings in London, Manchester and Belfast.

Meetings have been attended by Brooks, Chris Ram and Paul Griffin, a Canadian-born far-right activist.

Under the pseudonym “Francis Soulie” Griffin helped organise Legion MAC, a far-right “survival camp” including street-fighting training, in March. Griffin’s partner Sorcha Ní Bhuaigh, who has attended meetings of the extreme right London Forum with Griffin, has also attended the YRS socials.

YRS members Brooks, Ram, Bhuaigh, Donaghy and Griffin attended the October 2017 conference of the TBG alongside popular far-right commentator Brittany Pettibone.

Outpouring of hate

Below are just a few examples of the hatred expressed on YRS.

"Blind recruitment trial to boost gender equality making things worse, study reveals",http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-30/bilnd-recruitment-trial-to-improve-gender-equality-failing-study/8664888,"A measure aimed at boosting female employment in the workforce may actually be making it worse, a major study has found.

Key points: Public service leaders are being told to ""hit pause"" on blind recruitment trials

Public service leaders are being told to ""hit pause"" on blind recruitment trials The measure was aimed at boosting female employment by removing indications of gender from job applications

The measure was aimed at boosting female employment by removing indications of gender from job applications Professor Michael Hiscox, the academic who oversaw the trial, says results have shown ""the opposite"" and is urging caution

Leaders of the Australian public service will today be told to ""hit pause"" on blind recruitment trials, which many believed would increase the number of women in senior positions.

Blind recruitment means recruiters cannot tell the gender of candidates because those details are removed from applications.

It is seen as an alternative to gender quotas and has also been embraced by Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Victoria Police and Westpac Bank.

In a bid to eliminate sexism, thousands of public servants have been told to pick recruits who have had all mention of their gender and ethnic background stripped from their CVs.

The assumption behind the trial is that management will hire more women when they can only consider the professional merits of candidates.

Their choices have been monitored by behavioural economists in the Prime Minister's department — colloquially known as ""the nudge unit"".

Professor Michael Hiscox, a Harvard academic who oversaw the trial, said he was shocked by the results and has urged caution.

""We anticipated this would have a positive impact on diversity — making it more likely that female candidates and those from ethnic minorities are selected for the shortlist,"" he said.

""We found the opposite, that de-identifying candidates reduced the likelihood of women being selected for the shortlist.""

The trial found assigning a male name to a candidate made them 3.2 per cent less likely to get a job interview.

Adding a woman's name to a CV made the candidate 2.9 per cent more likely to get a foot in the door.

""We should hit pause and be very cautious about introducing this as a way of improving diversity, as it can have the opposite effect,"" Professor Hiscox said.

New findings throw other trials into doubt

The landmark study throws doubt on several trials launched by state Government's and individual departments.

Last year, the Australia Bureau of Statistics doubled its proportion of female bosses by using blind recruitment.

Professor Hiscox said he discussed the trial with the ABS and did not consider it a rigorous or randomised control trial, warning against any ""magic pill"" solution.

He was also keen to point out the public service has a long way to go on gender equality, saying attention should now turn to creating more flexible working conditions and training.

Men continue to outnumber women at senior ranks of the public service, despite vastly outnumbering men at the rank-and-file level.

""There has been a lot of effort made to improving diversity in the public servants and the subjects of our trial were fairly senior,"" Professor Hiscox said.

""This project shows the status quo at the moment is to be supportive of hiring more women in the public service.""",JustBadNews,0
Sexual Harassment and Bullying: Booking Titan John Finberg's Accusers Speak Out,http://metalsucks.net/2020/09/28/sexual-harassment-and-bullying-booking-titan-john-finbergs-accusers-speak-out/,"In order to protect their privacy, some people in the following story will be identified by an alias. No other details of their stories have been changed.

When Rachel was in her early twenties, she got a Facebook friend request from John Finberg. As the owner of First Row Talent, Finberg has served as the booking agent for bands such as Nightwish, Epica, Amorphis, Warbringer, Suffocation, Immolation, Sonata Arctica, Overkill, and The Agonist, to name but a few. Rachel was in a band she was trying to get off the ground. Naturally, she accepted Finberg’s request.

Their paths had crossed once before, at a Nightwish concert two years prior, when he’d put his hand on the small of her back and told her she was beautiful. He recalled the incident – in his initial Facebook message, “He said he remembered me from the show and had been watching me from afar since then” – and wanted her band to open the local stop on one of his big tours. So she agreed to meet him at an upcoming concert he had booked to “discuss the show.”

At the venue, he gave her the royal treatment: hanging out with the band on their tour bus, free drinks, and plenty of merch. He made her accompany him to the bank to watch him deposit $28,000 in cash, and then to an expensive dinner at a fancy steak house, where he put his hand on her knee and told her, “My dear, it doesn’t matter how talented you are unless you find the right people, and I promise you just found the right people.”

Then, back at the concert, Finberg became aggressive. “He kept pouring me shots,” Rachel says. “At one point he starts putting his hand down my pants and starts trying to feel me up, and I tell him ‘No.’ He says that I owe him this, that I’ve been asking for this ever since I got there… since I met him and had dinner with him that I’m asking for this from him.”

Rachel says Finberg then tried to kiss her. “Crying and upset,” she pushed him away and ran into the crowd, where she found a friend to take her home.

Finberg began to retaliate immediately. “The next day, John emailed me,” according to Rachel, “and started saying ‘How dare you run away? I showed you so much hospitality! What games are you playing here?’

“I said ‘Look, I’m not trying to play games. I thought you were interested in helping my band. I didn’t realize you felt like this was something more.’ And he said, ‘I still want to help your band but I want more things in return.’”

After once again rejecting his advances, Rachel alleges that Finberg lost his cool and threatened to meddle in her personal affairs, saying he’d blacklist her from the industry and make sure that her band would never be signed and would never tour the United States.

“When he didn’t get a response from that he started sending apologetic messages like, ‘I’m really fucked up, I’m sorry. I need help, I know I need help. I just thought you were this really pure kind of person who could help me.’ It was really crazy, actually,” Rachel relays. “He started going into details about how his mother tried to kill him with an axe when he was a teenager. He was trying to use some fucked up past to explain his behavior. And at the end I told him ‘Thank you, John, I hope you get better at some point. I wish you the best, but I don’t think it’s in our best interest to continue our contact.’

“Since then, he’s had this weird vendetta against me,” Rachel continues. “For a while he was threatening to kick me out of shows with any of his bands.”

On Christmas Day of 2017, after not speaking for years, Rachel says Finberg called her under the guise of wanting to “clear the air and make things right.” But he lost his temper again when she implied that he was offering an apology. “He suddenly said ‘Wait, never mind, fuck you, I hate you, I hope you burn in hell, you fucking bitch. I hope your baby is ripped from you while you’re raped by your ex repeatedly.’ And then he hung up on me.”

“John is not just scary,” Rachel says somberly. “John has this unhinged element to him that makes him twice as scary. Because there’s this irrational part of him that would set you on fire if he could.”

*

Rachel’s story is not a unique one. Finberg, who will turn 50 this year, has been in the industry since the ‘90s, working as an agent for several other companies before First Row, and his malfeasances are some of the worst-kept secrets in the business. Yet he remains a feared figure, considered by many to be untouchable.

Over the course of the past year, MetalSucks spoke to both victims of, and witnesses to, Finberg’s alleged wrongdoing.

But many more refused to go on record, or agreed to do so only under the protection of an alias, for risk of incurring the booking agent’s wrath. “People don’t wanna talk about it, don’t wanna be involved, don’t want to know,” says one woman who alleges mistreatment by Finberg. “They don’t want to point the finger at him because they’re scared.”

*

Indeed, even beyond Finberg’s sexual improprieties, many industry professionals characterize him as a bully with a toxic personality.

“He’ll threaten you, he will threaten to sue your family,” says Shea, who manages a band that was once one of Finberg’s biggest clients. “I have seen promoters have a burnout because of his intimidation… He’s a dirty man…. He’s threatened so many people, so many bands.”

Shea speaks from experience: when his band fired Finberg, the booking agent threatened them with a lawsuit, complete with a full draft of charges written by a lawyer. “He sent me a fake draft of charges. A lawyer took his time to outline charges against me and [the band],” he laughs incredulously. “Nothing ever came of it. Then he threatened that we couldn’t set foot in the U.S. or he would sue us, he would make sure that the box office gets raided.” Shea and the band continued to ignore Finberg’s threats, which resurfaced years later with terse, one-line emails inquiring about where to “serve papers” when the band landed on American soil.

Shawn Carrano, a prominent artist manager who has worked with acts like Polyphia, Whitechapel, and Revocation, outright refuses to work with any band Finberg books. “Whenever I [began to work] with any metal act,” Carrano tells us, “I would ask them right away, ‘Are you booked by Finberg or have you ever been booked by Finberg?’” Carrano explains the reason he avoided Finberg’s clients, from past experience, was that “If you didn’t do it his way, he would freak out and scream at you, talk all kinds of shit,” adding that Finberg threatened his life “numerous times” over small disputes. “I will drive up to Sacramento and I will fucking kill you. I will kill you, you fat fuck. I will find you when you’re in L.A., I will see you at a show, I will fuckin’ slit your throat.” Carrano ended up blocking Finberg from contacting him via phone, email and social media, which he claims he has never done with any of the 1,600 other industry contacts in his phone.

Continental Touring’s Steph Mellul first met Finberg when he was a young promoter in the ’90s. In the earliest days of their relationship, he says, Finberg would call him “at three, four or five o’clock in the morning, any time of night, harassing me on the phone,” in addition to sending him lengthy faxes specifically designed to empty the machine of its entire paper supply. Finberg would demand return phone calls regardless of the hour, threaten to pull his bands from shows if substantial payments weren’t delivered on unrealistic timelines, and make fun of Mellul’s height, calling him “little fucker” and suggesting that Mellul needed to stand on a stool to reach his telephone.

Worse still, Mellul claims that Finberg has called him “a ‘sand n****er’” multiple times since learning that Mellul’s parents are Moroccan (Mellul was born in Canada). He says this is not the only example he’s seen of Finberg’s bigotry. When drummer Mike Smith re-joined Suffocation in 2003, becoming the second Black member of the band, Mellul alleges that Finberg told him, “Yeah, we have two of them in the band now.” Two years later, Mellul accompanied Suffo and Finberg on a Canadian tour, during which time, he asserts, he heard Finberg “Popping the n-word left and right,” in addition to making fun of the accents of French Canadians. Mellul suggests that Finberg seems incapable of not making race an issue at every given turn. “If we’re talking about Hispanic promoters he would make a comment on that. If we’re talking about African American people he would make a comment on that.”

When Mellul started Continental (previously Rock the Nation America) with Kataklysm frontman Maurizio Iacono in 2011, a number of bands, including Deicide, Hypocrisy, Scar Symmetry, and Destruction, ditched Finberg and went with the upstarts. “He hated me. He was livid. He said, ‘Why are you doing this to me? You cannot do this to me.’ He was emailing me, the managers [for those bands], all the [band members]. Krisiun left him, Jungle Rot left him, The Agonist.” Mellul also claims that when Finberg “got fired by the manager of Epica [he] said something like ‘I’m gonna piss on your grave.’”

According to Mellul, this is standard behavior for Finberg, who he says often goes so far as to be disrespectful to other veteran booking agents with whom he often works. “Before I became an agent myself,” Mellul tells us, “[Finberg] was talking about Dan Rozenblum (Napalm Death, Municipal Waste) and Nick Storch (King Diamond, Baroness) and everybody else, and just being totally condescending. ‘You can go back to this guy [Rozenblum] with a crying baby in the back, or back to [Storch], who doesn’t have a clue about metal,’ and he just kept going and going. I’m like, ‘Dude, are you serious right now? These are the guys that make you the most money [by including your bands on their tours].’”

Bobbie is one of the founders of Flight of the Valkyries, a now-defunct annual metal festival devoted to bands with women lead vocalists. When trying to book Doro Pesch for the event, a friend, Nathan, referred her to Finberg, Pesch’s North American booking agent at the time. Bobbie contacted Finberg and dropped Nathan’s name; when Finberg, in turn, reached out to Nathan to verify Bobbie’s claim, the exchange was far from a customary reference check.

“‘First he asked me if you were hot,’” Bobbie says Nathan told her of Finberg. “And I was like, ‘Well what did you say?’ Not realizing at the time what kind of person Finberg was. So Nathan jokingly said that he said ‘Yes.’ So I said, ‘Well, what else?’ And Nathan said, ‘He asked if you would fuck him.’” (Nathan did not respond to requests for comment on this story.)

Danny Marino, founding member and guitarist of The Agonist, says that Finberg takes standard business inquiries about tour offers as personal affronts. “If you’re not just like ‘yes’ right away, it turns into a huge problem. As if we’re ungrateful because I asked a question. [I could say to him] ‘The routing is insane, I don’t know how we’re gonna do this, you have like 1000km between a ton of shows, are you sure this is it? And we’re driving a van ourselves in the winter through the Rocky Mountains.’ And if I question this because I’m worried about our safety [Finberg is] like, ‘Fuck you, maybe I’ll just give all my tours to someone else. How about this? How about I never book you a show ever again.’”

Finberg followed through on his promise to attempt to blacklist The Agonist in the industry. “He wrote emails to everyone at Century Media, and other contacts, saying, ‘If you continue to work with The Agonist I will not book any more of your bands’ and all this shit,” Marino tell us. “Steve Joh was our A&R person at the time, and he’s super cool. He just told me on the side, ‘Don’t listen to Finberg, Century Media is not gonna drop you. Unfortunately, you got on his bad side. He is what he is. We’ll figure something else out.’”

Still, Marino believes Finberg’s efforts may have hurt The Agonist’s career. “It seemed like all of a sudden… nothing changed in our profile. When we first came out we kinda had a thing; there weren’t as many female-fronted bands with growling and all that, it was relatively more hot and new and we were getting a lot of big magazines and publications and stuff. And in time with [Finberg’s threats] it just kind of seemed to fizzle out.” Even working with other reputable, longtime agents like Rozenblum didn’t help. “I don’t know [if Finberg’s blackballing The Agonist hurt their ability to get tours]. All I know is he made the threats, and he acted on them.”

Finberg drifted back into the band’s sphere several years later with a tour offer, and they resumed working together for a second stint. But when Marino says many of the same issues resurfaced – the intimidation, talking down and difficulties getting paid – they again parted ways after what he describes as “a massive fight, falling out” between Finberg and the band’s singer at the time, Alissa White-Gluz, who is now in Arch Enemy. (White-Gluz declined to comment for this story).

Finberg was the booking agent for Bonded by Blood when vocalist Mauro Gonzalez, who was 20 years old at the time, first joined the band. On one occasion, after Gonzalez declined to introduce Finberg to a pair of young female friends, Finberg “threatened to ruin my career and drop us off every tour and black list us. I [still] refused, and he stormed off angry.”

Stacey H. was briefly a tour manager for a popular Finnish band who work with Finberg. She says Finberg began verbally berating her when she made simple requests related to advancing shows, an important role of tour managing that involves making contact with venues ahead of time to arrange day-of-show logistics.

“I would send him an e-mail asking, ‘Hey can I get the riders and contracts please?’,” she tells us. “Mind you, I was raised to be polite and say ‘Yes sir’ and ‘Yes ma’am.’ When I called him ‘sir’ one too many times, he said, and I quote, ‘If you call me ‘sir’ one more time, I’m going to slap you across the face.’” Stacey audibly breaks into tears while recounting this exchange. “That’s very inappropriate, very unprofessional, and I kind of felt unsafe for my life a little bit. A slap across the face isn’t the end of the line, but you shouldn’t be threatened with violence.”

Lawrence is a member of a nationally-known band signed to a major metal label. He alleges that Finberg has not only threatened him, his bandmates, and his manager, but their families as well. He also believes that Finberg once sent a man to physically intimidate them over a financial dispute.

“We are at merch, the direct support band is playing, the venue is relatively packed,” Lawrence says. “A very tall, very muscular man in a suit and tie with slicked back hair — he looked like a Grant Theft Auto bouncer or something — approaches my merch table. I am behind the table with my bassist. The man shouts over the music ‘Are you Lawrence? Step outside. I’m here to talk with you on behalf of Mr. Finberg.’ I holler back ‘Hey man, I can’t right now, I am selling merch, we are the only people watching it right now, I can talk to you after the show or you can just tell John to call me later if it’s important.’ The guy gets visibly frustrated, and then spits a huge loogie on our merch table. Then he swipes his hands across our display and knocks our shirts, CDs, and tip jar all across the floor, and then power-walks away before we have a chance to jump over the table or even process what happened. Then he shouts as he’s standing in the exit, half in the venue, half out, ‘If you ever fuck with John again, I will come to your next show and rip you the fuck in half.’” The band’s bassist, who was with Lawrence at the time, confirms Lawrence’s account of the incident.

Then there’s the case of Nature Ganganbaigal, frontman for the Mongolian folk metal band Tengger Cavalry. Nature, described by friends as a kind soul who greatly struggled with depression and mental illness, got into an e-mail spat with Finberg in July of 2018, after accidentally sending him a crowdfunding pitch intended for a different John (it’s not clear why this mistake so offended Finberg). Screenshots of this exchange acquired by MetalSucks show Finberg resorting to aggressive, belittling name-calling, taunting Nature over his mental illness.

“You are an idiot. I already deleted your irratic [sic] email address. We both know it was meant for me, but you are too much of a cocky half psycho who is in need of meds.” A few hours later, Finberg emailed again: “Take your manic depressed self and your self loathing misery and go away.” After Nature defended himself, telling Finberg to “Take your bad reputation and aggressive mouth with drugs and whore piss and fuck off,” Finberg went for the jugular: “Only if you promise to kill yourself, which it sounds like you are happy enough to do it.”

Nature took his own life in June of 2019. He was 29 years old.

Although it might be unfair to blame Finberg entirely for Nature’s tragic end, the musician’s friends, such as Patrick M., believe the booking agent is at least partially responsible.

“I wish that people like John would not send messages telling people to kill themselves who are not mentally fit or sound,” says Patrick. “We’re all dealing with our own struggles. Depression is something I have fought most of my life. So I understand. And I understand how destructive an e-mail like that from someone would affect you, especially [someone] who is seen as a big time professional in the industry and potentially could sink your career.”

Still, these are not the most unsettling allegations against Finberg.

Jennifer, who works in the music industry, has only met John Finberg once. It was at a concert where one of his bands, a major European touring act, were performing a large theater show.

She ended that night in the hospital.

She’d been invited up to the V.I.P. balcony by an acquaintance; she happily obliged. She was at the show with a handful of women and her brother, Anthony, all big fans of the band. Prior to that night, she’d heard Finberg’s name floated around in the industry, but says she “didn’t really know who he was; I knew of him. I knew he was working with the band, but I had never met him personally.”

Meeting Finberg is one of the few things Jennifer recalls from that night. She says she had “half-a-glass” of one drink served to her by Finberg before she blacked out. “I don’t remember anything that happened that night. I was there, one moment I was fine, and soon after I just have no idea whatsoever of anything that happened that night.”

“My sister was drinking very slowly because she told me it was very strong,” says Anthony. He claims that every time Jennifer took a sip of her drink, Finberg “would keep pouring so [her cup was always] completely full.” When she stopped drinking, according to Anthony, Finberg “was forcing the bottle on the girls and my sister.” He says he became aware that, rather abruptly, several of the women in the V.I.P. section had become “violently drunk.”

Jennifer was so far gone in such a short amount of time that she began taking Finberg’s prompts to chug vodka straight from the bottle, which she says was very out of character for her as someone that doesn’t often drink much. “I was told that John was shoving the bottle directly down my throat. I was not aware at the time, I didn’t know this happened. But he was shoving pure vodka into my throat.”

Anthony recalls Finberg being “very touchy” with the women. “He was touching [them] around the waist and possibly going [farther] down. He was hugging them. I remember him licking a girl’s face.” At one point, Anthony grabbed a bottle out of Finberg’s hand and placed it down to prevent Finberg from forcing more alcohol on his sister. “He looked at me like ‘Why are you being a party pooper?’ It didn’t matter for him. He continued, especially with the other girls.”

Anthony estimates that it was roughly half an hour between the time of Jennifer’s first sip of alcohol and the time she passed out on the floor, unresponsive and vomiting. “I saw that she was not responding to me. I was calling her [name] at some point because everything happened so fast, I was trying to talk to her but she wouldn’t listen or wouldn’t make eye contact. Then I started to tell her, ‘Hey I’m talking to you,’ and I saw in her eyes that something was wrong.” He decided it was time to get out, but found his sister was unable to walk on her own.

“I put her onto my shoulder and tried to carry her out, [but] she was throwing up and was just dead weight, she couldn’t walk,” he says. “So at that point I realized it was more serious than I thought.” With the help of a couple of security staff, Anthony — who had declined one of Finberg’s drinks on account of being the designated driver for the night — got Jennifer into the car and made the decision to take her to the emergency room.

“I spent the night in the hospital [with] two IVs,” Jennifer remembers. “I had ten times the alcohol concentration my body could handle because he was pouring the bottle straight into my mouth.” She further claims that a female acquaintance at the show with her also blacked out. “Another girl that was with me as well, she was also very sick. It felt like it was the girls that were targeted because the guys were drinking as well but for some reason the girls were really out of their mind.” Jennifer’s friend declined to be interviewed for this story.

“I almost got liver damage, and I could’ve died that night,” Jennifer goes on. “It’s not something I can just forget about as a bad experience. I should have been more careful. I take that part of the blame, but I really felt like in the moment I was in control: ‘I’m here with family, and I’m gonna be fine.’ But I wasn’t fine. My own brother was there; what would have happened if I was alone?”

Finberg attempted to add Jennifer as a friend on Facebook several times in the days following the incident. She declined each time, and eventually blocked him. They have not interacted since.

Amy G., who does not work in the music industry, says she was creeped out by Finberg almost immediately after meeting him at a Ministry show in Chicago seven years ago. “He did say right off the bat something about me sleeping with him, and I’m just like, ‘Uh, nope, that’s not what I’m here for. I don’t know what Paul told you. But I’m not like that.’ And he’s like ‘Well, we’ll see what happens at the end of the night.’”

Still, Amy gave Finberg the benefit of the doubt, because they’d been connected by a mutual friend who told her John needed someone to hang out with while in town. But then “The show ended and he expected me to go back to his hotel room with him.”

She told Finberg she wasn’t interested, and then the verbal onslaught began. “He threw a tantrum because I wouldn’t sleep with him. He got pretty pissed off. At which point it made me feel extremely uncomfortable. He was trying very hard to get me to go back to the hotel with him.”

Finberg continued attempting to buy Amy drinks in an effort to loosen her up; she declined. But he persisted in his efforts to get laid. “And that’s when he said the whole Nightwish thing,” she says. “If I would have sex with him he would bring me on the tour, I could do merch, and he could take care of everything, everything would be covered, I wouldn’t have to pay for anything.” Amy isn’t even a fan of Nightwish, who are widely regarded as Finberg’s key client and main cash cow. She also has no experience, and no interest in, selling merch on the road. On top of all that, accepting such a gig would have required a remarkable amount of flexibility; the tour was approaching in just a month or two’s time. Finberg (second from right) with Nightwish in 2018.

This being the case, the offer pushed Amy over the edge. She decided to leave the venue. According to Amy, the incessant texting began about twenty minutes later: “He was still trying to talk me into sleeping with him.” Amy ignored the texts, but Finberg continued on undeterred in the following days, weeks and months. “When this first happened, he would text probably fifteen times a day, at least, and I just ignored him. [Then] it kind of slowed down, but the whole thing lasted two or three months. Just him [texting], no responses [from me]. Three months talking to himself.

“One of the things he said is he would find out where I worked and he would call them and let them know that I was a terrible person. I take pride in my job so I wasn’t really worried about that, but to make these threats, that’s pretty fucked up. He’s nuts… I could only assume he probably would’ve made some shit up.” She ended up taking drastic measures to stop the harassment, calling the phone company to have his number blocked (a capability her phone did not have).

Meanwhile, her friendship with Paul, the man who connected her and Finberg in the first place, was forever ruined. “I don’t know why [Paul] would be friends with someone like this in the first place, and then put me into this situation.”

*

The bands, managers, and labels with whom Finberg commonly works are aware of the agent’s behavior.

“Meetings with him were always weird as fuck,” says Bradley, a former member of a well-known-but-smaller metal band. “He talked about business stuff for five to fifteen minutes, then started to talk about sex.”

While in New York City opening for Epica – one of Finberg’s premiere bands at the time – Bradley alleges he saw a woman start crying and run for the exit at the mere sight of Finberg.

“Another time,” Bradley continues, “just after the load out, during the setup prior to stage time, Finberg is chatting with [another member of the band]. I came into the conversation and Finberg started showing pictures on his phone of some girls he had done stuff with. He showed us a picture of a woman he had brought to his place who was so drunk she had urinated herself. I walked off, disgusted. Finberg deemed it alright to take her home, take pictures of her while she was passed out and had wet herself, then brag about the whole thing.”

The first time Lawrence met Finberg, he says Finberg told him “I like your band, you guys are pretty good. If you can find me a girl in the crowd who will suck my dick in the next three hours, I will get you on a big tour.” When Lawrence’s band later added a woman to their line-up, Finberg sent her a friend request “weirdly promptly, like he had been stalking her page or something.” Lawrence claims Finberg “then asked my manager if [the singer] would be willing to ‘take a private vacation’ with him to discuss ‘business opportunities.’” The band’s bassist recalls Lawrence arriving at band practice one day and informing him of Finberg’s unsolicited invitation to the band’s new singer, adding that Finberg pitched it as a “business vacation” to discuss “where they wanted to move further with the band, like that was going to get us a prestigious slot on some festival.” He adds, “I don’t know, with the way he operates, maybe it would’ve.”

On the very last tour Bonded by Blood did under Finberg’s representation, Finberg overheard Gonzalez making fun of him with another member of the touring party. Finberg’s retaliation was instant and vulgar: “He flashed his gross genitals at us in the middle of the bar attached to El Corazon in Seattle. I told him, ‘That’s sexual harassment,’ to which he replied, ‘If you tell anyone you’re fucking done, your band will never tour again.’”

*

And yet, the industry continues to protect John Finberg.

“I was told not to make any [social media] posts about him because it would get the promoters in trouble,” says Jennifer, the woman who ended up in the hospital after drinking in the V.I.P. section with Finberg. “Basically, I was told to shut up about it.” She adds that she spoke to other women in the industry after the incident, and that “they all said he’s known for acting this way, he’s done this to other girls, and I started hearing all the stories about him.” Jennifer conjectures that Finberg specifically targets women who work in the industry because of the power he can hold over them to remain quiet, threatening to ruin their careers. “That’s one of the reasons why people are afraid and they don’t talk.”

Stacey, the tour manager, quit working with Finberg’s band only a few days into the tour. She attempted to discuss her mistreatment with the band’s management via email, which she has shared with MetalSucks:

Stacey ended up having a voice conversation over WhatsApp with the manager following the email. “All he said to me was, ‘Oh, that’s [Finberg’s] personality,’ same as the band. ‘That’s his humor.’” Even the person who had recommended Stacey to Finberg for the job, who had previously worked as a tour manager for one of his bands, did not offer a sympathetic ear. Stacey texted her the night she quit the tour and asked to talk, but the acquaintance declined: “She said, ‘I can’t because I’m helping a band find a new tour manager.’ And that was her scolding me.”

“Everybody, I mean EVERYBODY” at the U.S. office of Century Media “knew about John,” Lawrence says. “[They] had all told me he was crazy, unpredictable, not the kind of guy you want to work with… but that if he likes you, to go with him. Because he will get you results and you will tour with his roster.” When the band passed on a chance to schmooze with Finberg after a show, Lawrence tells us, a Century employee “shamed” them.

Lawrence has e-mails from Century staff to verify his claim that the label was anxious for his band to let Finberg represent them. One such e-mail reads:

“I’m going to get [two other CM employees’] take on Finberg. He actually wouldn’t be that bad for you guys. He’s insane and crazy, but he does get stuff done. The only issue is because he’s insane and crazy, he doesn’t play well with others so you’re a bit limited… but if you look at his roster, you can pretty much guarantee you’ll tour with all of his bands.”

*

So why do people keep working with Finberg?

“He’s the best paying agent around for European bands,” says Shea. “He gets them the biggest guarantees.”

Ironically, Finberg secures these larger guarantees by use of dubious business practices which increase his own earnings at the expense of the band, according to Shea.

Finberg allegedly does this by selling meet-and-greet and V.I.P. packages for his own tours via a ticketing website he owns, EnterTheVault.com. For this service, Finberg takes a fee, which is not uncommon in the world of V.I.P. ticketing… but Shea claims that he also adds the V.I.P. packages sold to the same pot as regular ticket sales, thereby inflating the figures for those non-V.I.P. sales. This allows promoters — who get a 20% kick-back on sales through EnterTheVault.com – to offer the bands larger guarantees… which, in turn, increases Finberg’s own commission as their booking agent, all while allowing the promoter to use V.I.P. income to subsidize a potential loss on the show. According to Shea, “Some bands don’t understand that he’s taking a percentage from the V.I.P. tickets and from the guarantee,” effectively lowering their overall income despite the higher guarantees (booking agents typically do not touch a band’s V.I.P. income). Other large ticketing companies, Shea adds, have recently tried to employ a similar model, which “everyone is really shocked about.” But Finberg has been doing it for a decade already, he says.

Another tactic Finberg employs through his ticketing site is even more suspect, according to Shea. For Canadian shows, the manager claims, Finberg “does a one-to-one conversion from CAD to USD.” Examples of this are easy to find online: an upcoming concert by the band Powerglove at Mavericks in Ottawa, ON lists a base price of $17 CAD (before fees); a Swallow the Sun show in Montreal carries a ticket price of $23 CAD through the venue, Foufounes Electriques. But The Vault lists the same numeric prices for these shows, only in USD (see screenshots below). The exchange rate – roughly $0.75 CAD to $1.00 USD at the time of publication – suggests that Finberg is keeping approximately 25% of every ticket he sells to these shows through The Vault.

“Does the band know anything about this?” Shea asks rhetorically. “No, they don’t run through all the ticket prices. [Finberg] just pockets [the difference].” What’s more, Shea tells us, Canadian venues have been left answering to angry fans who discover cheaper ticket prices at the door than what they paid through The Vault.

At least two of Finberg’s former clients allege that Finberg’s attempts at obscuring business transactions in his favor are even less subtle than what he reportedly does with V.I.P. ticketing and EnterTheVault.com. Lawrence and Marino, the Agonist guitarist, both allege that the booking agent has outright withheld or refused to pay money owed to them. And while Marino says that Finberg did eventually pay the band what they were owed, Lawrence had no such luck.

During one of Finberg’s tours, Lawrence says, “We noticed that all of our nightly guarantees were not being paid to us. The individual promoters would tell us ‘Oh, John called and we just wired it all to him, you can square up with him later.’ Now, he attended some of these shows. One night my bassist and I approach him to ask what the hell is going on and when we are going to get our money, and all he says is, ‘You’re not going to see any of it’ and then walks away and refuses to answer our questions, refuses to look at us, pretending we aren’t even there. Like a five year old just ignoring other classmates.” So the band decided to be proactive and started calling the remaining venues on the tour in advance to make sure they could collect their nightly performance fees in person instead of having them wired to Finberg. That’s when Finberg allegedly sent the man in a suit and tie to intimidate them. Lawrence alleges that Finberg “wound up not paying us back in full after this tour.”

And none of that is taking into account at least one instance where Finberg’s behavior actively hurt his clients.

In 2015, Shea reminds us, Finberg’s taunts against the Greek people “literally made front page news” in that country. Finberg was quite upset the country’s economic downturn messed up Nightwish’s touring plans, so he took to social media to vent:

Nightwish attempted to distance themselves from Finberg after the incident, releasing a statement that said, “John Finberg is not the manager of Nightwish, he just [books] our concerts in America and apparently his ideas have nothing to do with the band.” But the damage was done: Shea tells us the band’s ability to pull fans in that country has since gone down significantly.

There is a light at the end of the tunnel, though, as more and more of the people Finberg has mistreated step forward and speak up. “Women, especially, are finally getting fed up with it,” says Bobbie. “We don’t want to have to choose between supporting the bands we like and supporting someone who [behaves that way]. It should be pretty easy in this day and age for bands to choose to work with somebody who is not abusive towards the people that work with him.”

“I do see his name fairly often because I have friends who are musicians” Amy adds, “and it pisses me off when I see it.”

Jennifer, who says her experience with Finberg has “been eating me up ever since it happened,” believes that the bands don’t want to work with Finberg anymore. “They’re just waiting for someone to do something about [him],” she says. She adds, “I think a lot of people are afraid for their music career. A lot of us work in the industry. The bands are terrified of speaking up about it. The fact that they know it’s not an isolated case and that there are more people that have had to endure this, I think now is a good time.”

Patrick wishes more musicians were willing to take a stand against Finberg, the way he says Nature was. According to Patrick, while speaking about Finberg, the musician told him, “I’m willing to let go of my band to [reveal] any fucked up shit to the public. It’s only a band. But our morality… without that, the world is dark.”",JustBadNews,0
"'We want to get rid of the ballots': Trump won't commit to peaceful transfer of power, pushing voter fraud claims instead",http://independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/trump-2020-election-transfer-power-ballots-mail-b561158.html,"Donald Trump would not commit to peacefully transferring power to Joe Biden if he loses the election in November, instead saying election officials must “get rid” of any illegal ballots.

“We’re going to have to see what happens. You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster,” Mr Trump said at a press conference on Wednesday, a continuation of his repeated attacks on the integrity of expanded mail-in voting programmes states have rolled out amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The reporter who asked the initial question pressed Mr Trump.

“Do you commit to making sure that there’s a peaceful transferral of power?” the reporter asked.

“We want to get rid of the ballots, and you’ll have a very peaceful — there won’t be a transfer, frankly, there’ll be a continuation,” Mr Trump replied.

“The ballots are out of control. You know it,” he said, to which the reporter objected, “No, I don’t know it.”

Mr Trump continued: “And you know who knows it better than anybody else? The Democrats know it better than everybody else.”

The president indicated earlier in the day that he expects to contest the presidential election results if he is losing, a move that could send the case to the Supreme Court.

That potential outcome is one of the many reasons he believes Senate Republicans ought to ram through his nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before 3 November.

“I think it's better if you go before the election, because I think this scam that the Democrats are pulling — it's a scam — the scam will be before the United States Supreme Court,” the president told reporters at the White House, referring to mail-in votes.

“I think having a 4-4 situation is not a good situation, if you get that,” Mr Trump said of a Supreme Court that could be stalemated on the election results without its ninth justice.

Study upon study has shown virtually no large-scale voter fraud in the US in recent elections.

Democrats have been warning for months that Mr Trump could try to “steal” the election by challenging results in key swing states based on bogus voter fraud claims related to mail-in ballots.

Republicans have already sought to curb mail-in voting through litigation at the state level, including in Pennsylvania.

That state’s supreme court ruled in favour of Democrats last week that election officials could count mail-in ballots that arrive as late as three days after Election Day as long they are post-marked on or before Election Day.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not officially announced a timeline for the confirmation process, but he has said there is plenty of time to hold a confirmation vote by the elections on 3 November.

Female rape victim charged after stalking attacker and stripping the skin off his genitals with potato peeler,http://the-dailystar.com/bloomington-female-victim-charged-after-stalking-attacker-and-stripping-the-skin-off-his-genitals-with-potato-peeler/,"A 37-year old woman in Bloomington, Illinois who was the victim of a rape earlier this year has been charged for a revenge attack, in which she stalked her rapist and then assaulted him with a potato peeler, stripping the skin off his genitals.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was raped by a 56-year old local man earlier this year at her home. However, the man was never charged with the rape after the woman refused to testify against him.

“We begged her to change her mind but she said she didn’t want him to get locked up in prison where he would have a comfortable life,” said prosecutors. Unable to bring the man before court without the victim’s testimony, they reluctantly let her go.

As it turns out, the woman had a good reason for not wanting her rapist to be sent to jail. With him still out in the open, she had a much better chance of getting her revenge on him. Investigators believe she began stalking the man and following him around on a daily basis.

Early yesterday morning, it is alleged the woman broke into the man’s property and knocked him out before restraining him to his bed with cable ties. She is then said to have taken a potato peeler and used it to remove the skin from his penis & testicles.

The woman then reported her crime to authorities and called paramedics to treat the man. “I still ended up treating him better than he treated me,” she told officers. “He got exactly what he deserved, instead of spending a few months in jail he ended up getting hurt just like I did, and now he’ll never be able to rape anyone again.”",JustBadNews,0
Tik Tok now Banned in India.,http://indiatoday.in/india/story/centre-announces-ban-chinese-apps-privacy-issues-1695265-2020-06-29,"The government of India has decided to ban 59 apps of Chinese origin as border tensions simmer in Ladakh after a violent, fatal face-off between the Indian and Chinese armies. The list of apps banned by the government includes TikTok, which is extremely popular.

The government announced the ban on the 59 Chinese apps (full list below) Monday night. The government said these apps were engaged in activities that were prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity and defence of India.

A government press release announcing the ban stated: ""The Ministry of Information Technology, invoking it’s power under section 69A of the Information Technology Act read with the relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules 2009 and in view of the emergent nature of threats has decided to block 59 apps since in view of information available they are engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order"".

The press release further said that the Ministry of Information Technology has received ""many representations raising concerns from citizens regarding security of data and risk to privacy relating to operation of certain apps"".

""The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) has also received many representations from citizens regarding security of data and breach of privacy impacting upon public order issues,"" the press release mentioned.

It further says that the move to ban these Chinese apps move will ""safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users"". This decision is a targeted move to ensure safety and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace, it said.

Chinese apps' popularity deteriorated after Galwan clash

Earlier this month, data from the Finland-based mobile-ranking platform, AppFollow, indicated that applications like TikTok have borne the brunt of Indian anger over Ladakh tensions.

The popular short-form video app was ranked 5 in top-ten free applications on Apple’s platform in India before the May 5 scuffle between Indian and Chinese troops.

A month later, TikTok slipped down to number 10 on App Store.

Among Android users, the same Chinese application dropped from number 3 to number 5 in India ranking.

But it still remained on the list of top-ten popular apps in India.

India not the only country to act against Chinese apps

The move to ban these Chinese apps predates violent faceoff at LAC in Ladakh. The government had issued an advisory on April 16 in this regard in the wake of security concerns over zoom meetings.

India is not the only country to act against Chinese apps citing privacy and cyber security issues. Taiwan has banned some Chinese apps. So has Germany including zoom.

Earlier, the US national security advisor Robert O'Brian had said all Chinese apps function as arms of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to further its ideological and geopolitical agendas.

The move was speeden up after June 15 clashes between Indian and Chinese troops.

Popularity of Tik Tok in India

Popular among youngsters, TikTok has the maximum number of users in India, followed by China and the US.

TikTok crossed the 2 billion mark soon after surpassing the 1.5 billion mark in the first quarter of 2020. Out of the 2 billion, India turned out to be the biggest driver with over 611 million downloads.

According to the report by Sensor Tower, TikTok’s surge in popularity was due to the coronavirus pandemic. People found TikTok to be most entertaining and engaging in quarantine.",JustBadNews,0

'If you're black you can't go out': Africans in China face racism in Covid-19 crackdown,http://france24.com/en/20200411-if-you-re-black-you-can-t-go-out-africans-in-china-face-racism-in-covid-19-crackdown,"This file photo taken on March 2, 2018 shows people gathering on a street in the ""Little Africa"" district in Guangzhou, the capital of southern China's Guangdong province.

Africans in southern China's largest city say they have become targets of suspicion and subjected to forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing as the country steps up its fight against imported infections.

China says it has largely curbed its Covid-19 outbreak but a recent cluster of cases linked to the Nigerian community in Guangzhou sparked the alleged discrimination by locals and virus prevention officials.

Local authorities in the industrial centre of 15 million said at least eight people diagnosed with the illness had spent time in the city's Yuexiu district, known as ""Little Africa"".

Five were Nigerian nationals who faced widespread anger after reports surfaced that they had broken a mandatory quarantine and been to eight restaurants and other public places instead of staying home.

As a result, nearly 2,000 people they came into contact with had to be tested for Covid-19 or undergo quarantine, state media said.

Guangzhou had confirmed 114 imported coronavirus cases as of Thursday – 16 of which were Africans. The rest were returning Chinese nationals.

It has led to Africans becoming targets of suspicion, distrust and racism in China.

Several Africans told AFP they had been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels.

""I've been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat... I cannot buy food anywhere, no shops or restaurants will serve me,"" said Tony Mathias, an exchange student from Uganda who was forced from his apartment on Monday.

""We're like beggars on the street,"" the 24-year-old said.

Mathias added that police had given him no information about testing or quarantine but instead told him ""to go to another city"".

Police in Guangzhou declined to comment when contacted by AFP.

A Nigerian businessman said he was evicted from his apartment earlier this week.

""Everywhere the police see us, they will come and pursue us and tell us to go home. But where can we go?"" he said.

Growing tensions

Other Africans said the community had been subject to mass Covid-19 testing even though many had not left China recently, and placed under arbitrary quarantine at home or in hotels.

China has banned foreign nationals from entering the country and many travellers are being sent into 14-day quarantines either in their own accommodation or at centralised facilities.

Thiam, an exchange student from Guinea, said police ordered him to stay home on Tuesday even after he tested negative for Covid-19 and told officers he had not left China in almost four years.

He believes the measures are specifically and unfairly targeting Africans.

""All the people I've seen tested are Africans. Chinese are walking around freely but if you're black you can't go out,"" he said.

The US State Department on Saturday issued an alert advising African Americans, or those with potential contact with African nationals, to avoid Guangzhou.

Denny, a Nigerian trader evicted from his flat on Tuesday, said police moved him to a hotel for quarantine after he spent several days sleeping on the streets.

""Even if we have a negative test result, police don't let us stay (in our accommodation) and they don't give a reason why,"" he said.

'Crazy fear'

The infections in Guangzhou have sparked a torrent of abuse online, with many Chinese internet users posting racist comments and calling for all Africans to be deported.

Last week a controversial cartoon depicting foreigners as different types of trash to be sorted through went viral on social media.

""There's just this crazy fear that anybody who's African might have been in contact with somebody who was sick,"" said David, a Canadian living in Guangzhou who did not want to give his full name.

China's foreign ministry acknowledged this week that there had been some ""misunderstandings"" with the African community.

""I want to emphasise that the Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally,"" said spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday, urging local officials to ""improve their working mechanisms"".

Separately, in an unusually open critique, the speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives tweeted a video of himself pressing the Chinese ambassador on the issue.

Today I met with the Chinese🇨🇳 Ambassador to Nigeria on the disturbing allegation of ill treatment of Nigerian citizens in China. I showed him the video clip that had made the rounds. He promised to look into it and get back to my office on Tuesday. pic.twitter.com/9SUxH0rI7X — Femi Gbajabiamila (@femigbaja) April 10, 2020

“It’s almost undiplomatic the way I’m talking, but it’s because I’m upset about what’s going on,” Femi Gbajabiamila says.

“We take it very seriously,” Ambassador Zhou Pingjian replies.

Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama said he summoned the ambassador to express “extreme concern” and call for an immediate government response.

The complaints in Guangzhou contrast with a welcome reception to Chinese efforts in battling the coronavirus across the African continent, where Beijing this week donated medical supplies to 18 countries.

""When China engages Africa it's the central government that does that, but when it comes to immigration enforcement that happens at the local level,"" said Eric Olander, managing editor of the China Africa Project.

""That explains why there's an inconsistency in the more upbeat messaging we hear about Chinese diplomacy on the continent and the increasingly difficult realities that African traders, students and other expatriates face in their day-to-day lives in China.""

'They are leading us to catastrophe': Sweden's coronavirus stoicism begins to jar,http://theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/catastrophe-sweden-coronavirus-stoicism-lockdown-europe,"There’s a surreal calm in the last country in Europe to hold out against lockdown. But the death toll is rising and some are voicing dissent

The Øresund Bridge – yes, that bridge – is an engineering marvel linking the Swedish city of Malmö and Copenhagen that normally transports 70,000 people daily. It has fallen eerily silent. Denmark is under coronavirus lockdown, and the Danes have imposed strict border controls. On the Swedish side, the Øresund remains open, although, understandably not many are making that journey.

It feels surreal in Sweden just now. Working from my local cafe, I terror-scroll through Twitter seeing clips of deserted cities, or army trucks transporting the dead in Italy, surrounded by the usual groups of chatty teenagers, mothers with babies and the occasional freelancer.

Outdoors, couples stroll arm in arm in the spring sunshine; Malmö’s cafe terraces do a brisk trade. On the beach and surrounding parkland at Sibbarp there were picnics and barbecues this weekend; the adjoining skate park and playground were rammed. No one was wearing a mask.

The global pandemic has closed down Europe’s economies and confined millions of people across the continent to their homes. But here, schools, gyms, and (fully stocked) shops remain open, as do the borders. Bars and restaurants continue to serve, and trains and buses are still shuttling people all over the country. You can even, if you wish, go to the cinema (it smainly indie fare: The Peanut Butter Falcon and Mr Jones were on at my local arthouse over the weekend).

The precautions that Swedes have been advised to adopt – no gatherings of more than 50 people (revised down from 500 last Friday), avoid social contact if over 70 or ill, try to work from home, table service only in bars and restaurants – seem to have allayed public fears that the shocking images from hospitals in Italy and Spain could be repeated here.

The prime minister, Stefan Löfven, has urged Swedes to behave “as adults” and not to spread “panic or rumours”.

Panic, though, is exactly what many within Sweden’s scientific and medical community are starting to feel. A petition signed by more than 2,000 doctors, scientists, and professors last week – including the chairman of the Nobel Foundation, Prof Carl-Henrik Heldin – called on the government to introduce more stringent containment measures. “We’re not testing enough, we’re not tracking, we’re not isolating enough – we have let the virus loose,” said Prof Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, a virus immunology researcher at the Karolinska Institute. “They are leading us to catastrophe.”



Strong words, but stoicism is a way of life here, as is unflappability. A 300-year history of efficient and transparent public administration, and high levels of trust in experts and governing officials, have left the public inclined to believe what they are told, and that those doing the telling have their best interests at heart.

“I trust that the doctors working with the government know what they are doing, so I suppose we’re as well prepared as we can be,” Robert Andersson, 50, a vendor manager in IT who lives in Södermalm, Stockholm, said. “This ‘hysteria’ that the media is launching is far more dangerous than the virus itself.”

Simon Strand, 30, a business consultant in Östermalm, Stockholm, agrees. “There is no reason to believe the authorities are not paying attention,” he said.

Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, who is leading the government’s handling of the crisis, advocates a strategy of mitigation: allow the virus to spread slowly without overwhelming the health system, and without recourse to draconian restrictions. Just don’t call it “herd immunity”, a phrase that Tegnell, and the authorities, have steadfastly refused to use.

It says much for the transparency and accountability that Swedes expect from public figures that Tegnell remains so accessible to the media. With criticism of Sweden’s response to Covid-19 mounting, he has the slightly exasperated tone of a man tired of repeating the obvious when asked what he thinks of the growing concern and calls for a city-wide quarantine of Stockholm, given the very recent spike in cases there. On Monday, Sweden said it had recorded 3,700 cases and 110 deaths.

“Yes, there has been an increase but it’s not traumatic so far. Of course, we’re going into a phase in the epidemic where we’ll see a lot more cases in the next few weeks, more people in the ICU, but that’s just like any other country – nowhere has been able to slow down the spread considerably.”

Play Video 4:59 Who is most at risk from coronavirus and why? – video explainer

Sweden’s nearest EU neighbours – the Danes, Finns, and Norwegians – have accepted a lockdown strategy, closing schools, workplaces, and borders weeks ago. “The problem with that approach is you tire the system out,” Tegnell said. “You can’t keep a lockdown going for months – it’s impossible.”

But such a situation may become inevitable. “The government thinks they can’t stop it, so they’ve decided to let people die,” Söderberg-Nauclér said. “They don’t want to listen to the scientific data that’s presented to them. They trust the Public Health Agency [Folkhälsomyndigheten] blindly, but the data they have is weak – embarrassing even.

“We are seeing signs of a higher doubling rate than Italy, Stockholm will soon have an acute ICU shortage, and they don’t understand that by then it will be too late to act. All of this is very dangerous.”

Tegnell gives such criticism short shrift: “There is no evidence whatsoever that doing more at this stage would make any difference. It’s far better to introduce stringent measures at very specific intervals, and keep them running for as little time as possible.”

While there is a constant reappraisal of the situation, Tegnell says Sweden has the crisis under control. “We believe we have the most important measures in place already. Of course, we might have to do more things, but we’re not there yet.”

For now, Swedes seem to believe him, going about their daily routines wondering if – not when – that point might be reached. Tegnell and the government have set their course, and while it is hard to doubt their sincerity, it is difficult to reconcile Sweden’s response with efforts across the rest of Europe. Perhaps other Swedes privately feel the same, but so far are unwilling to give voice to such concerns.

Orla Vigsö, a professor of crisis communications at Gothenburg University, sums up the dilemma. “People are starting to ask: are others stupid and paranoid? Or is Sweden doing it wrong?”",JustBadNews,0
"John Prine: singer-songwriter critically ill with Covid-19 symptoms, family says | Music",http://theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/29/john-prine-coronavirus-symptoms-critical,"The country musician John Prine has been hospitalised and is in now in a stable condition after experiencing symptoms of coronavirus. A post to his official Twitter account said that Prine, 73, had been taken to the hospital on Thursday and intubated on Saturday.

“This is hard news for us to share,” the post says. “But so many of you have loved and supported John over the years, we wanted to let you know, and give you the chance to send on more of that love and support now. And know that we love you, and John loves you.”

Prine’s wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, said on 19 March that she had coronavirus and that the couple were quarantining separately. On Monday, she tweeted that she had recovered and that his condition was stable.

“We are humbled by the outpouring of love for me and John and our precious family,” she tweeted. “He is stabile. Please continue to send your amazing Love and prayers. Sing his songs. Stay home and wash hands. John loves you. I love you.”

Prine won the Grammy award for best contemporary folk album in 1992 and 2006, and a lifetime achievement award this year. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2019.

Joan Baez posted a cover of Prine’s 1971 song Hello in There in tribute to the musician and his wife.

Joan Baez: Hello in There (John Prine cover).

Stars including Patton Oswalt, Bette Midler, Tim Heidecker and Drive-By Truckers paid tribute to Prine on Twitter. Singer Kacey Musgraves tweeted: “To say he’s special to me is an extreme understatement.” Margo Price, who has performed and collaborated with Prine, said: “We sit around the fire again and pray for John Prine and listen to his songs and ask God for a little bit of mercy.”

Two noted musicians have died of complications related to coronavirus. Country artist Joe Diffie tested positive for Covid-19 and died age 61 on 29 March. Diffie had 17 top 10 country hits in the US in the 1990s, including Bigger Than the Beatles and If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets). He worked in the oil industry before moving to Nashville in the 80s and working with a songwriter, signing as an artist with Epic in 1990.

A vast number of musicians paid tribute to Diffie. “Consistently one of the kindest artists to run into,” country pop star Kelsea Ballerini tweeted. “This is really heavy.” Jason Aldean. “This guy was an amazing singer and an even greater person. Such a sad week for the country music world.”

Alan Merrill, best known for writing and performing the original I Love Rock’n’Roll with his band the Arrows, has also died after contracting coronavirus. He was 69. His daughter Laura Merrill said on Facebook that she was given two minutes to say goodbye to her father in the hospital before she was “rushed out”.

“He seemed peaceful and as I left there was still a glimmer of hope that he wouldn’t be a ticker on the right-hand side of the CNN/Fox news screen. I walked 50 blocks home still with hope in my heart … By the time I got to my apartment I received the news that he was gone.”

Bronx-born Merrill was among the first western artists to find pop stardom in Japan in the late 60s with his bands the Lead and Vodka Collins. He moved to London in the 70s and formed the Arrows, which had a Top 10 hit with Touch Too Much. I Love Rock’n’Roll, released in 1975, was originally a B-side but was later released as an A-side that failed to chart.

Joan Jett saw the Arrows performing I Love Rock’n’Roll when she was touring England with the Runaways in 1976. She recorded a cover in 1979 with Sex Pistols Steve Jones and Paul Cook. This too was originally released as a B-side, but elevated to A-side status in 1981, when Jett released a rerecording that topped the US singles chart for seven weeks.

Jett paid tribute to Merrill on Twitter: “I’ve just learned of the awful news that Alan Merrill has passed. My thoughts and love go to his family, friends and music community as a whole. I can still remember watching the Arrows on TV in London and being blown away by the song that screamed hit to me. With deep gratitude and sadness wishing him a safe journey to the other side.”

The French musician Christophe, AKA Daniel Bevilacqua, is also in intensive care with respiratory failure and suspected coronavirus symptoms. The 74-year-old was admitted to a Paris hospital on Thursday evening. Laurent Castanié, Christophe’s live producer, said he was in a stable condition. Musicians including Keren Ann sent well wishes to the star, who had his first French hit with Aline in 1965.",JustBadNews,0
"With all of the COVID-19 news and panic going on, the U.S. Government has been sneakily trying to pass the so called EARN IT Bill which would remove end-to-end encryption on messages and calls, and allow a scanning software to read all of them. Websites that don't comply will lose protections.",http://eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-bill-governments-not-so-secret-plan-scan-every-message-online,"Update 10/1/2020: The EARN IT bill has been amended since this blog post was published. We still oppose the bill.

Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle such messages wouldn’t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they’d lose legal protections that allow them to operate.

Take Action

Stop the Graham-Blumenthal Attack on Encryption

That’s what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The so-called EARN IT bill, sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will strip Section 230 protections away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,” meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message.

The EARN IT bill had its first hearing today, and its supporters’ strategy is clear. Because they didn’t put the word “encryption” in the bill, they’re going to insist it doesn’t affect encryption.

“This bill says nothing about encryption,” co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said at today’s hearing. “Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness.

It’s true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption. It would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by the Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear [PDF] what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.

You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys. The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is just another way to break end-to-end encryption. Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others.

The 19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.

The Commission won’t be a body that seriously considers policy; it will be a vehicle for creating a law enforcement wish list. Barr has made clear, over and over again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once it’s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those governments want to suppress.

The privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law enforcement is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption. Senators should reject the EARN IT bill.

Saudi Crown Prince Boasted That Jared Kushner Was ?In His Pocket?,https://theintercept.com/2018/03/21/jared-kushner-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman/,"Until he was stripped of his top-secret security clearance in February, presidential adviser Jared Kushner was known around the White House as one of the most voracious readers of the President’s Daily Brief, a highly classified rundown of the latest intelligence intended only for the president and his closest advisers. Kushner, who had been tasked with bringing about a deal between Israel and Palestine, was particularly engaged by information about the Middle East, according to a former White House official and a former U.S. intelligence professional. In June, Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman ousted his cousin, then-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, and took his place as next in line to the throne, upending the established line of succession. In the months that followed, the President’s Daily Brief contained information on Saudi Arabia’s evolving political situation, including a handful of names of royal family members opposed to the crown prince’s power grab, according to the former White House official and two U.S. government officials with knowledge of the report. Like many others interviewed for this story, they declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about sensitive matters to the press. In late October, Jared Kushner made an unannounced trip to Riyadh, catching some intelligence officials off guard. “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy,” the Washington Post’s David Ignatius reported at the time. What exactly Kushner and the Saudi royal talked about in Riyadh may be known only to them, but after the meeting, Crown Prince Mohammed told confidants that Kushner had discussed the names of Saudis disloyal to the crown prince, according to three sources who have been in contact with members of the Saudi and Emirati royal families since the crackdown. Kushner, through his attorney’s spokesperson, denies having done so.

“Some questions by the media are so obviously false and ridiculous that they merit no response. This is one. The Intercept should know better,” said Peter Mirijanian, a spokesperson for Kushner’s lawyer Abbe Lowell. On November 4, a week after Kushner returned to the U.S., the crown prince, known in official Washington by his initials MBS, launched what he called an anti-corruption crackdown. The Saudi government arrested dozens of members of the Saudi royal family and imprisoned them in the Ritz-Carlton Riyadh, which was first reported in English by The Intercept. The Saudi figures named in the President’s Daily Brief were among those rounded up; at least one was reportedly tortured. The Saudi Embassy did not respond to questions from The Intercept. The White House referred questions to National Security Council spokesperson Michael Anton. Anton declined to comment, referring questions on Kushner’s discussions with MBS to Lowell. It is likely that Crown Prince Mohammed would have known who his critics were without Kushner mentioning them, a U.S. government official who declined to be identified pointed out. The crown prince may also have had his own reasons for saying that Kushner shared information with him, even if that wasn’t true. Just the appearance that Kushner did so would send a powerful message to the crown prince’s allies and enemies that his actions were backed by the U.S. government. One of the people MBS told about the discussion with Kushner was UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, according to a source who talks frequently to confidants of the Saudi and Emirati rulers. MBS bragged to the Emirati crown prince and others that Kushner was “in his pocket,” the source told The Intercept. Access to the President’s Daily Brief is tightly guarded, but Trump has the legal authority to allow Kushner to disclose information contained in it. If Kushner discussed names with MBS as an approved tactic of U.S. foreign policy, the move would be a striking intervention by the U.S. into an unfolding power struggle at the top levels of an allied nation. If Kushner discussed the names with the Saudi prince without presidential authorization, however, he may have violated federal laws around the sharing of classified intelligence. On November 6, two days after the detentions in the Ritz began, Trump took to Twitter to defend the crackdown:

I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2017

....Some of those they are harshly treating have been “milking” their country for years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2017

In the months that followed, the arrestees were coerced into signing over billions in personal assets to the Saudi government. In December, the London-based Arabic-language newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi reported that Maj. Gen. Ali al-Qahtani had been tortured to death in the Ritz. Qahtani’s body showed signs of mistreatment, including a neck that was “twisted unnaturally as though it had been broken,” bruises, and “burn marks that appeared to be from electric shocks,” the New York Times reported earlier this month. Senior U.S. government officials have long worried about Kushner’s handling of sensitive foreign policy issues given his lack of diplomatic experience. They have also raised concerns about the possibility that foreign officials might try to influence him through business deals with his family’s real estate empire. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly examining Kushner’s business ties as part of his ongoing probe. The Washington Post reported this week that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster “expressed early concern that Kushner was freelancing U.S. foreign policy.” According to the Post, Tillerson once asked staffers in frustration: “Who is the secretary of state here?” Indeed, Kushner has grown so close to the Saudi and Emirati crown princes that he has communicated with them directly using WhatsApp, a reasonably secure messaging app owned by Facebook and popular in the Middle East, according to a senior Western official and a source close to the Saudi royal family. Asked about Kushner’s use of WhatsApp to communicate with foreign officials, his attorney’s spokesperson Mirijanian said, “Without commenting on who he talks with and how he does his work, Mr. Kushner is in conformity with the Presidential Records Act and other rules.” Kushner’s attorneys have since told him not to use the app for official business, according to a source with direct knowledge of the exchange. Kushner’s unconventional communications with regional leaders excluded diplomats during the summer of 2017, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE initiated an economic blockade aimed at weakening their Gulf neighbor Qatar. Tillerson’s attempts to mediate the crisis were quickly undercut by Trump and Kushner, who supported the blockade. Three State Department officials told The Intercept that Tillerson was largely in the dark about Kushner’s communications with MBS during that period. In the wake of MBS’s crackdown in Saudi Arabia, the National Security Council’s policy coordination committee suggested that Tillerson intervene and try to reason with the crown prince, according to a former White House official and a former State Department official. Tillerson declined, telling colleagues doing so would be “pointless” given that Kushner was already in close and direct contact with him. The National Security Council’s Middle East adviser, retired U.S. Army Col. Michael Bell, has also complained in recent months that he was out of the loop on the Gulf crisis and the Arab-Israeli conflict, the former White House official said. Bell has told colleagues that Kushner frequently micromanaged those subjects through direct interaction with regional leaders, without offering Bell any worthwhile readout on their interactions. Bell, speaking through National Security Council spokesperson Anton, denied that Kushner has kept him out of the loop and said he respects Kushner’s lead role in the region.

Scots 'Nazi dog' film maker found guilty of being grossly offensive online,http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/16099568.Scots__Nazi_dog__film_maker_found_guilty_of_hate_crime/,"THE SCOT who trained his dog to respond to his calls of ""gas the Jews"" has been found guilty of posting an offensive message online.

Sheriff Derek O'Carroll found Mark Meechan guilty of communicating a video which was ""grossly offensive"".

The Meechan case became an international freedom of speech talking point after his video titled M8 Yer Dugs A Nazi was posted two years ago.

Among those criticising the verdict was award-winning comedy writer and performer Ricky Gervais who said: ""A man has been convicted in a UK court of making a joke that was deemed 'grossly offensive'.

""If you don't believe in a person's right to say things that you might find 'grossly offensive', then you don't believe in Freedom of Speech.""

Sheriff O'Carroll said: ""In my view, there is no doubt it's [the video] grossly offensive.""

Meechan, 30, recorded his girlfriend’s pug, Buddha, responding to statements such as “gas the Jews” and “Sieg Heil” by raising its paw. He said he made the video to annoy his girlfriend Suzanne Kelly.

After complaints about the content, police were called in and he was arrested for allegedly committing a hate crime by uploading the footage in April 2016.

In the video, which was viewed more than three million times, Meechan, who goes by the You Tube moniker of Count Dankula repeats the phrase ""gas the Jews"" 23 times which The Crown described as ""reckless"" and ""extremely offensive to the Jewish community"".

Meechan, of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, had denied any wrongdoing.

Sheriff O'Carroll told Airdrie Sheriff Court the video, was ""threatening and grossly offensive"".

He said Meechan knew the video was offensive as he said himself during his evidence that he ""likes offensive comedy.""

The sheriff added: ""He said he chose 'gas the Jews' as it was the most offensive phrase associated with the Nazis that he could think of.

""It was the centrepiece of the joke. He said it was so extreme that it added to the comedy.""

Sheriff O'Carroll said Meechan ""knew what he was doing"" adding: ""It is self-evident that the material is anti-semitic.""

He did not believe Meechan's defence that the video was made as a private joke to annoy his girlfriend, as he had ""not taken any steps to prevent the video being shared publically"".

Sentencing has been deferred till April 23.

But prosecutors alleged he communicated material that would cause fear and alarm and stir up hatred on religious grounds by posting a clip which was 'anti-semitic in nature' to YouTube.

Just before going in to hear the verdict he told his YouTube followers: ""If the worst comes to the worst, and everything goes terribly, keep fighting for free speech, keep fighting the good fight, the great meme war.

""I am going to leave you with a great Scottish saying, ""don't let the b******s grind you down.""

Police were called in after complaints were made about the content, and he was arrested for allegedly committing a hate crime by uploading the footage.

Yup that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.. pic.twitter.com/fdyxTLi5hN — Count Dankula🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 (@CountDankulaTV) February 18, 2017

The stunt provoked outrage but also sparked a freedom of speech row as YouTube initially refused to remove the 'Nazi Dog' video.

A YouTube source said at the time that while it was recognised that many would find the video offensive, many videos on the site were, and it was a site that believed in freedom of expression.

The source said the intent of the video regardless of how ludicrous and unpleasant it is perceived was ""clearly comedic"".

""If we felt it was toxic hate speech, we would have taken it down.""

But eventually it was.

Guilty.



Recess called to await sentencing. — Count Dankula🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 (@CountDankulaTV) March 20, 2018

In a commentary by Nat Hentoff, a member of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and Nick Hentoff, the criminal defence and civil liberties attorney in New York pointed to the case as an example of hate speech prosecutions that are ""patently absurd"".

Sunday was a victory for free speech. But, today the battle continues in Scotland where @CountDankulaTV's trial will set a judicial precedent which will either, strengthen freedom of speech, or create an offense at common law for spreading ""hateful content"". #countdankulatrial — Opinionated European 🇬🇧🇵🇱 (@OpinionatedEuro) March 20, 2018

""Every dog owner knows that if you speak in a high-pitched voice, your pet will react with as much excitement to the question, 'Do you want some bacon?' as 'Do you want to tear my throat out?'. Which begs the question whether a satirical video that compares Nazis to a dog’s Pavlovian tendency for unthinking repetition can reasonably be regarded as offensive to anyone but Nazis.""

While awaiting sentencing, Court has ordered that I meet with a court social worker for an assessment as to whether or not a Restriction Of Liberty Order will be placed on me. This would involve a GPS tracking device being attached to me and me being placed under house arrest. — Count Dankula🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 (@CountDankulaTV) March 20, 2018

The case prompted at least one copycat video

At the start of the video Meechan posted, he says: ""My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is so I thought I would turn him into the least cute thing I could think of which is a Nazi.""

But the procurator fiscal argued that they do not believe the video was intended to be a joke and that Meechan had ""a particular audience in mind"" when he uploaded it to YouTube.

Meechan, who has lost eight jobs since posting the video, claimed he only intended it to be seen by seven of his friends, who follow his YouTube channel, Count Dankula.

But he says the video was shared, by someone he doesn't know, on the social news aggregation site Reddit which led to the surge in it's popularity.

The prosecution described Meechan as a ""highly intelligent and articulate individual"" but said that the pug was being used as a ""prop"".

In the video, Buddha was shown watching a speech given by Adolf Hitler in the film 'Olympia' by German film director Leni Riefenstahl.

It documents the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

In the featured footage, Hitler said: ""Once, our enemies worried us and persecuted us and, from time to time... removed the lesser elements from the Movement for us.

""Today we must examine ourselves and remove from our midst the elements that have become bad.""

A crowdfunding page set up to raise money for Meechan's legal fees made £12,000 in eight hours of being launched.",JustBadNews,0
The CIA's New Deputy Director Ran a Black Site for Torture,https://theintercept.com/2017/02/02/trumps-cia-chief-selects-major-torture-operative-to-be-agencys-deputy-director/,"Update: March 13, 2018

President Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel as the new director of the CIA, announcing the news on Twitter. Mike Pompeo, the previous director, was nominated to run the State Department to replace the ousted Rex Tillerson.

* * * * *

In May 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake-up” by then-Director John Brennan. As Miller documented, this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush-era torture regime.

As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees. Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.

Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations. The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane. A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.

The name of that CIA official whose torture activities the Post described is Gina Haspel. Today, as BuzzFeed’s Jason Leopold noted, CIA Director Mike Pompeo announced that Haspel was selected by Trump to be deputy director of the CIA.

This should not come as much of a surprise given that Pompeo himself has said he is open to resurrecting Bush-era torture techniques (indeed, Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan, was forced to withdraw from the running in late 2008 because of his support for some of those tactics only to be confirmed in 2013). That’s part of why it was so controversial that 14 Democrats — including their Senate leader Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Tim Kaine — voted to confirm Pompeo.

That Haspel was the actual subject of the 2013 Post story was an open secret. As Leopold said after I named her on Twitter as the subject of that story: “All of us who covered CIA knew. She was undercover and agency asked us not to print her name.” Gina Haspel is now slated to become the second-most powerful official at the CIA despite — or because of — the central, aggressive, sustained role she played in many of the most grotesque and shameful abuses of the war on terror.",JustBadNews,0
Schwarzenegger planning to sue oil companies for 'knowingly killing people all over the world',http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/377894-schwarzenegger-targeting-oil-companies-for-knowingly-killing,"Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) is planning to sue oil companies, alleging they are ""knowingly killing people all over the world.""

Schwarzenegger said during an interview with Politico's ""Off Message"" podcast that he is still working on the timing for his push, but he is now speaking with private law firms.

""This is no different from the smoking issue. The tobacco industry knew for years and years and years and decades that smoking would kill people, would harm people and create cancer, and were hiding that fact from the people and denied it. Then eventually they were taken to court and had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars because of that,” Schwarzenegger, a global environmental activist, said.

“The oil companies knew from 1959 on, they did their own study that there would be global warming happening because of fossil fuels, and on top of it that it would be risky for people’s lives, that it would kill.”

Schwarzenegger accused oil companies of being irresponsible and vowed to go after them.

""It’s absolutely irresponsible to know that your product is killing people and not have a warning label on it, like tobacco,” he said.

“Every gas station on it, every car should have a warning label on it, every product that has fossil fuels should have a warning label on it.”

He said he hopes to spread awareness about the harmful effects of fossil fuels.

“I don’t think there’s any difference: If you walk into a room and you know you’re going to kill someone, it’s first-degree murder,"" he said during the interview.

""I think it’s the same thing with the oil companies.”

Sen. Al Franken accused of sexual abuse in 2006 by news anchor Leeann Tweeden.,http://www.wcpo.com/news/national/news-anchor-accuses-sen-al-franken-of-sexual-abuse,"U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-Minnesota) has issued an apology to a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her.

Leeann Tweeden, a news anchor for KABC in Los Angeles, says the abuse occurred during a USO Tour in 2006.

Tweeden says Franken, a former writer for Saturday Night Live, wrote a sketch for the tour in which his character kissed her on stage. Tweeden claims Franken repeatedly insisted the two needed to ""practice"" the kiss on stage, and at one point forcibly kissed her.

Following the tour, Tweeden found a photo of Franken groping her breasts over her clothes while she was sleeping.

""I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it,"" Franken said, according to Politico.

"Video shows Utah nurse screaming, being dragged into police car after refusing to let officer take blood from unconscious victim",http://www.sltrib.com/pb/news/2017/08/31/utah-nurse-arrested-after-complying-with-hospital-policy-that-bars-taking-blood-from-unconscious-victim,"A nurse says she was assaulted and illegally arrested by a Salt Lake City police detective for following a hospital policy that does not allow blood draws from unconscious patients.

Footage from University Hospital and officer body cameras shows Detective Jeff Payne and nurse Alex Wubbels in a standoff over whether the policeman should be allowed to get a blood sample from a patient who had been injured in a July 26 collision in northern Utah that left another driver dead.

Wubbels says blood cannot be taken from an unconscious patient unless the patient is under arrest, unless there is a warrant allowing the draw or unless the patient consents. The detective acknowledges in the footage that none of those requirements is in place, but he insists that he has the authority to obtain the draw, according to the footage.

At one point, Payne threatens to take Wubbels to jail if he doesn’t get the sample, and he accuses her of interfering with a criminal case.

“I either go away with blood in vials or body in tow,” Payne says.

After Wubbels consults with several hospital officials and repeats the policy, Payne tells her she is under arrest and grabs her, pulling her arms behind her back and handcuffing her. The footage shows the detective dragging Wubbels out of the hospital and putting her inside a patrol car as she screams, “Help! Help! Somebody help me! Stop! Stop! I did nothing wrong!”

A University of Utah police officer and other officers, who provide security for the hospital, were present at time of the arrest and did not intervene.

As he stands in the hospital parking lot after the arrest, Payne says to another officer that he wonders how this event will affect an off-duty job transporting patients for an ambulance company.

“I’ll bring them all the transients and take good patients elsewhere,” Payne says.

Parts of the footage were shown Thursday at a news conference at the office of Karra Porter, a Salt Lake City attorney representing Wubbels.

Salt Lake police Sgt. Brandon Shearer said the department started an internal investigation, which is ongoing, in response to the incident.

Payne was suspended from the department’s blood-draw program — where officers are trained as phlebotomists so they can get blood samples — but he remains on duty with the Police Department, Shearer said. The department also has held training for the officers in the program as a result of the incident, he said.

In a written report, Payne said he was responding to a request from Logan police to get the blood sample, to determine whether the patient had illicit substances in his system at the time of the crash. Payne explained the “exigent circumstances and implied consent law” to Wubbels, but, according to his report, she said “her policies won’t allow me to obtain the blood sample without a warrant.”

Payne — who says he wanted the blood sample to protect the patient, not punish him — said he was advised by Lt. James Tracy, the watch commander on duty that night, to arrest Wubbels for interfering with a police investigation if she refused to let him get the sample, according to his report.

Tracy said in his report that he spoke on the phone with Wubbels and told her he believed that they had implied consent to get the sample, but she cut him off and said she would not allow the draw without a warrant. He then went to the hospital and tried to tell the nurse why she was in custody, but “she appeared to not want to hear my explanation,” Tracy wrote.

No claim or lawsuit has been filed, Porter said, but she has had discussions with Salt Lake City police and she believes the department will educate its officers.

Wubbels said she has heard anecdotally of other health care workers being bullied and harassed by police, and that these videos prove that there is a problem.

“I can’t sit on this video and not attempt to speak out both to re-educate and inform,” she said. Police agencies “need to be having conversations about what is appropriate intervention.”

Wubbels, who was not charged, said she has watched the footage four or five times and said, “It hurts to relive it.”

She never said “no” when Payne asked to take a blood sample; she merely explained the blood draw policy to him, according to Wubbels, who also said she was trying to keep her patient safe and do things the right way.

Porter and Wubbels declined to release information about the patient, but Payne’s report identifies him as 43-year-old William Gray, a reserve officer in the Rigby, Idaho, Police Department, who suffered burns during a July 26 crash in Cache County.

Gray is a truck driver when he is not serving as a reserve police officer, according to the Idaho State Journal.

At about 2 p.m. on July 26, Gray was driving a semi north on State Road 89/91 near Sardine Canyon when a man fleeing from the Utah Highway Patrol crashed a pickup truck into him head-on, according to Logan police, who investigated the collision.

The crash caused an explosion and fire, Logan police have said. Gray was on fire when he exited the semi. The driver of the pickup truck, Marcos Torres, 26, died at the scene.





Police have said Torres was fleeing from the UHP after other drivers reported him driving recklessly.

Americans have more confidence in Merkel than Trump,http://thehill.com/policy/international/340707-poll-more-confidence-among-americans-in-merkel-as-leader-than-trump,"A majority of Americans say they have more confidence in German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a leader than they do in President Trump, according to a Pew Research survey published Wednesday.

Fifty-six percent of Americans polled said they have more confidence in Merkel, while 46 percent said they have more confidence in Trump.

Results are divided along party lines. Eighty-nine percent of Republicans said they have more faith in Trump, and 64 percent of Democrats said they had more trust in Merkel.

The poll’s release comes days before Trump is set to meet with global leaders, including Merkel, at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.

Trump has distanced himself from other world leaders over issues including climate, trade and immigration.

Merkel recently hit Trump on his anti-globalization stance in an interview with a German publication.

""While we are looking at the possibilities of cooperation to benefit everyone, globalization is seen by the American administration more as a process that is not about a win-win situation but about winners and losers,"" the German leader said.

The White House said the two leaders had an ""extensive discussion"" over the phone on Monday, in which they ""addressed climate issues, the Women’s Entrepreneurship Financing Initiative and trade, including global steel overcapacity.""

Two women feared dead in Grenfell Tower tragedy were threatened with legal action - after raising alarm about fire safety,http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/two-women-feared-dead-grenfell-10640944,"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inbox Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email

Two women feared dead in the Grenfell Tower tragedy were threatened with legal action by housing bosses after raising fears about safety in the doomed block.

Mariem Elgwahry, 27, and mum-of-three Nadia Choucair, 33, are believed to have received letters warning them to stop a campaign calling for improved fire safety.

But the pair battled on in their fight against Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation in a bid to prevent the sort of disaster they both appear to have perished in.

Mariem and Nadia were helped in their protest by the Radical Housing Network. The group’s Pilgrim Tucker said: “The TMO’s response was to threaten tenants with legal action and send out letters. Nadia and Mariem would have received them too.

“They both just wanted to do their best for their neighbours and keep everyone safe. Things had got so bad they knew a disaster like this was inevitable, but if there was a chance of stopping it they were up for the fight. But no one listened and now this community is ­devastated. We have to get justice for them. The TMO treated tenants disgracefully and with disdain.

“They bullied them and persecuted those like Nadia and Mariem who were brave enough to speak out, branding them troublemakers.

“Their job was to listen to the tenants and make sure homes were safe and they didn’t do that. If they had then this would never have happened.”

Pilgrim told how Mariem and Nadia organised a barbecue and party for residents to get them involved, held protests outside the management offices and set up a petition, signed by 90 per cent of tenants.

And when the TMO still didn’t listen, the pair encouraged householders to put up signs on their front doors and deny access to contractors who were carrying out a major refurbishment.

There have been claims cheap ­cladding used on the outside of the building may have helped the inferno spread quickly, trapping residents.

Just days ago it emerged Kensington and Chelsea Council threatened tenant Francis O’Connor with legal action after he blogged about fire fears.

Lawyers accused him of “defamatory behaviour” and “harassment”.

And residents of a nearby block were handed legal letters on the morning of the deadly blaze – warning their ­children about ball games.

Nursery officer Nadia is feared to have died with husband Bassem, daughters Mierna, 14, Fatima, 11, and Zeinab, three, and her mum Sirria, 60, from Lebanon.

Her heartbroken brother Hisam Choucair, 39, had to be restrained by police as he tried to enter the burning tower to rescue his family from the 22nd floor. Wife Kona told how Nadia’s sister Sawsan heard the family’s desperate cries for help on the phone as the inferno raged around them.

She said: “She could hear the ­children screaming and crying in the background. Nadia said to her: ‘Please, help us, the fire is here.’ Then the line went dead.

“Hisam is devastated. He has lost his mum, his sister, his brother-in-law and his beautiful nieces.”

“Nadia was worried about safety after the refurbishment work. If more had been done to make the building safe, this wouldn’t have happened.”

How a handcuffed Black man suffocated as Rochester police restrained him,http://democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/09/02/daniel-prude-rochester-ny-police-died-march-2020-after-officers-restrained-him/5682948002/,"How Daniel Prude suffocated as Rochester police restrained him

Steve Orr | Rochester Democrat and Chronicle

A Black man died of asphyxiation earlier this year after Rochester police officers trying to take him into protective custody pinned him to the ground while restraining him.

The incident occurred in March — two months before George Floyd's very similar death in Minneapolis touched off nationwide protests — yet it didn't become public until now.

The curtain was lifted on the death of 41-year-old Daniel T. Prude at a late-morning news conference Wednesday at which Prude's family and local activists called his death a murder and demanded that the officers involved be fired and charged in his homicide.

""We are in need of accountability for the wrongful death and murder of Daniel Prude. He was treated inhumanely and without dignity,"" said Ashley Gantt, a community organizer from Free the People Roc and the New York Civil Liberties Union. ""These officers killed someone and are still patrolling in our community.""

The case also brought calls from activists for changes to policing, including an end to the practice of having police officers respond to mental health calls. Clashes with police at the Public Safety Building Wednesday afternoon led to the arrests of nine people, including Gantt. All protesters arrested face misdemeanor charges and were issued appearance tickets.

Gantt said what happened to Prude was not an isolated event.

""The Rochester Police Department has shown time and again that they are not trained to deal with mental health crises,"" Gantt said. ""These officers are trained to kill and not to de-escalate. Daniel's case is the epitome of what is wrong with this system and today we stand firmly seeking justice for Daniel and his family, and for all the victims who have been murdered and terrorized by the Rochester Police Department.""

Prude's death on March 30 parallels numerous others locally and nationally in which people who are mentally or emotionally stressed, many of them people of color, have been killed when officers forcefully restrained them.

Monroe County Medical Examiner Dr. Nadia Granger ruled Prude’s death a homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint,” according to the autopsy report.

Who was Daniel Prude: What we know about man who died in police custody

The New York state Attorney General’s office has been investigating the officers' conduct in the Prude case since mid-April and has the ability to seek criminal charges.

The officers' interaction with Prude was captured on police body-worn camera video, a compilation of which was made public Wednesday.

Public disclosure of the case and release of the video could make Rochester the latest in a series of American cities to be embroiled in controversy over a police-related death and the latest focus of national attention. The most recent high-profile case was the police shooting of a Black man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Jacob Blake, that was captured on video.

Unlike that and some other recent police-death videos, the one compiled about the Prude case is not a graphic depiction of officers shooting or beating a suspect.

Rather, it depicts at least three officers holding Prude prone and forcing his head and chest into the pavement for several minutes until, apparently unnoticed by the officers, he stops breathing.

The events are indicative of how the rules of engagement that police use can result in harm to a suspect or a person in the throes of a mental-health episode.

A copy of the video and some case documents, including the autopsy report and internal police investigations of the case, were provided to the Democrat and Chronicle earlier this week by one of the family’s lawyers.

Local officials react

A notice of intent to sue the city has been filed and city officials are said to be aware of the family’s anger over Prude’s death.

At a press briefing Wednesday afternoon, Mayor Lovely Warren said in response to a question that she had seen footage of the officers' fatal restraint ""a while ago.""

""It's a disturbing video,"" Warren said. ""I can sympathize and empathize with the family.""

She said she was notified the day Prude suffocated during the restraint and was taken unresponsive to the hospital. But Warren bristled at suggestions that she lacked transparency by not disclosing Prude's death until months later.

""I want everyone to understand that at no point in time did we feel that this was something that we wanted not to disclose,"" Warren said, ""We are precluded from getting involved in it until that agency (the AG's Office) has completed their investigation.""

Singletary echoed those comments, saying several times ""this is not a cover-up."" He did not directly respond when a reporter asked about the fact that other police-custody deaths investigated by the attorney general are public knowledge from the beginning.

In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Attorney General Letitia James called Prude's death ""a tragedy"" and promised resolution.

""We will follow the facts of this case and ensure a complete and thorough examination of all relevant parties,"" she said. Her statement said nothing about when the investigation might be done.

Singletary declined to answer any specific questions about his officers' interactions with Prude, but said he had initiated both a criminal investigation and an internal investigation the same day the incident occurred.

What happened: What we know about Daniel Prude's death after Rochester cops restrained him

He said the probes were halted when the attorney general stepped in and would be finished after the state investigators have concluded their work.

However, a report on the internal RPD investigation, provided by the family's lawyer, contained a conclusion saying, ""The officers' actions and conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and consistent with their training."" The report was dated April 27, 11 days after the attorney general's office began its inquiry.

Singletary denied Wednesday that the internal investigation was done.

He also confirmed the officers involved in Prude's killing were not disciplined and remain on active duty. The chief said he was precluded from suspending any of the officers involved until the AG's investigation had concluded.

District Attorney Sandra Doorley said Wednesday afternoon that her office was investigating the Prude death when it received a preliminary autopsy report on April 16. That report determined the death was a homicide caused by asphyxiation.

Doorley said that she notified the Attorney General’s Office within an hour of receiving the preliminary autopsy findings.

Records show that, within a week, Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Sommers, a deputy chief in the state agency’s special investigations and prosecution unit, confirmed in a letter to Doorley that the Attorney General’s Office had launched an investigation under its mandated responsibilities.

Rochester City Council member Mary Lupien said she was ""horrified, deeply saddened, and shocked"" at what she saw in the video of Prude's death.

""I can’t believe something like this has been hidden from the community for so long,"" Lupien said outside the Public Safety Building Wednesday afternoon. ""If we continue to deny these issues, we have no hopes of solving them.""

'Cold-blooded murder'

Joe Prude described his brother Daniel's death as a ""cold-blooded murder"" and accused involved officers of handling his brother ""like a damned animal"" during a Wednesday morning news conference about the fatal encounter.

""I placed a phone call to get my brother help, not to have my brother lynched,"" he said, noting that he had called 911 for help early March 23 after his brother exited his home. ""How many more brothers have to die before society understands this needs to stop?""

Joe Prude asked who will be held accountable for his brother's death, why his brother's death was ""covered up"" and how an officer could treat another person so inhumanely.

Prude was suffering from acute mental-health problems when Rochester officers detained him in the early morning hours of Monday, March 23, as he walked naked and bleeding down Jefferson Avenue in the southwestern part of the city.

His family told police they suspected he was under the influence of the powerful hallucinogen phencyclidine, or PCP. They said he might have ingested it unknowingly.

A resident of Chicago, Prude had arrived in Rochester the day before to stay with his brother's family in their home on Rochester's west side.

Prude rode Amtrak to Buffalo but was thrown off the train there, his brother later told police. After being driven to Rochester, he began to act out. After jumping head-first down the basement stairs, Joe Prude said he called police for help. Prude was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital for a mental-health evaluation and released the evening of March 22. Details of these events were included in the police investigation narrative and in a portion of the raw police video during which an officer talks to Joe Prude's family.

After some hours of stable behavior, Prude ran out the back door of Joe’s home at 3 a.m. when his brother was out of the room, prompting another call for help to 911.

How the incident unfolded

Police believe that Prude broke windows at a West Main Street business as he walked along before officers found him. Several people encountered him on West Main and at least one of them called 911 to report his erratic actions, the police narrative said.

Prude had left his brother’s home wearing only long underwear, a tank top and socks. He took off the clothes while on West Main, a witness told police. One passerby stopped to shoot a Facebook Live video of Prude after seeing the disturbed man get on his knees and beg another motorist to call 911.

When the motorist responded that he was on the phone with the emergency center, Prude ran off.

After being intercepted moments later by a police officer on Jefferson Avenue, Prude was ordered to lie on the ground and place his hands behind his back. He complied immediately with both directives, the video shows, saying, “Sure thing, sure thing,” as he rolled onto his stomach. The time was 3:16 a.m.

The city on Aug. 20 provided family lawyers with a total of 88 minutes of police body camera footage of the incident, pursuant to an open-records request.

The video does not show Prude offering any physical resistance to the half-dozen or so officers who converged on the scene. The video, with one gap of a few seconds, appears to show the entirety of the 11-minute interaction between Prude and the police.

The Democrat and Chronicle reviewed all 88 minutes of raw video, which was provided by the lawyer, and did not see any meaningful action that had been omitted from the compilation.

The police protocol apparently was to subdue and calm Prude and make what is known as a mental-health arrest, which is not a criminal arrest but is a civil detention for the purpose of transporting the person to receive emergency treatment.

Though handcuffed and on the ground, Prude remained agitated, squirming and shouting belligerently at times and spitting into the street. He never got up and never initiated any contact with the police.

But when the spitting began, officers covered Prude’s face and head with a white “spit hood” intended to protect police from a suspect’s bodily fluids. Prude had claimed to officers he was infected with the coronavirus, which likely raised concerns about his spitting.

The hood was the only covering he was given; Prude remained naked in temperatures just above freezing, as light snow fell, throughout the episode.

Four minutes after the police arrived, officers stood in a semicircle around Prude as he sat in the middle of Jefferson Avenue, his hands still cuffed behind his back. He yelled unintelligibly, then shouted, ""Gimme that gun. Gimme that gun, I mean it!"" As he yelled, he scooted on his rear toward an officer and appeared to be trying to get to his feet.

Officers immediately pushed him over. Prude can be heard saying, ""You're trying to kill me!"" as officers began to hold him down.

An officer identified in the video as Officer Mark Vaughn used both hands with much of his weight behind them to forcefully push the side of Prude’s head into the pavement, essentially doing a triangle push-up. The approach was different but still reminiscent of the way that George Floyd’s neck was compressed by an officer’s knee on May 25.

Another officer, identified as Troy Taladay, used his knee at one point to hold down Prude’s torso, and a third held down his legs.

Vaughn, in the report he wrote of the incident, said he had ""segmented"" Prude's head. He also wrote that he used a ""hypoglossal nerve technique,"" which involves jamming fingers into a nerve below the jaw to cause pain and persuade a subject to comply.

In the video, Prude’s body movements can be seen to become less frequent. His incoherent shouts become whimpers. Then he falls silent.

The time stamps on the video indicate that Vaughn pushed down Prude’s head for 2 minutes 15 seconds before letting up and saying, “You good now?” to the prone man, who did not respond. Vaughn then resumed pushing with one hand for 45 more seconds.

Officers chatted with each other and with an emergency medication technician from an AMR ambulance that had arrived but cannot be heard making any mention of the fact that the man they were assisting was not moving.

Finally, a full three minutes after the officers began to press Prude into the asphalt, an ambulance EMT came over and asked the officers to roll Prude onto his back. He later told police investigators this is when he recognized that Prude was not breathing.

The EMT, identified as Brett Barnes, began to administer CPR seconds later as he called his colleague to help. Officers could not immediately find a key to remove the handcuffs, and Prude's hands remained secured behind his back for two minutes while resuscitation efforts continued.

When a police investigator later asked Barnes about the officers' restraint techniques, he told them ""nothing looked 'over the top' or malicious in nature"" and added that ""the officers’ actions appeared appropriate for what Prude was doing, and necessary to keep Prude from running around the entire street.""

The pair of emergency responders had intended to inject Prude with a sedative so he could be safely moved to a hospital, the police narrative said. They were present for about two minutes but had not sedated Prude before the medical crisis eliminated their need to do so.

Prude was loaded aboard the ambulance 11 minutes after the first officer arrived, the video showed. His heartbeat was restored during the short ambulance trip to Strong, according to the police narrative, but his brain had been deprived of oxygen for too long. He was later declared brain dead and died March 30 after being taken off life support, according to the report.

His liver and one kidney were donated for use in transplants, according to the autopsy report.

After Prude was rushed to the hospital from Jefferson Avenue, one of the officers was dispatched to his brother's home to tell him that Prude had been located.

""We got him. Your brother's at Strong,"" the officer can be heard to say on the unedited police video. The officer spoke with Joe Prude and members of his family for several minutes but never betrayed the fact that his brother's heart had stopped beating after being aggressively restrained by police.

""So he cooperated?"" Joe asked. ""Yeah, um ..."" the officer answered. He excused himself a moment later to make a phone call.

Traces of PCP found

Toxicology tests done as part of the autopsy found a low level of PCP, also known as angel dust, in his blood. The drug can induce schizophrenia and wildly erratic, violent behavior.

The autopsy report listed ""acute phencyclidine intoxication"" as a complication of his death. The medical examiner did not say whether the levels of PCP in his blood explained Prude's behavior before and during his detention by city police, and did not make any mention of pre-existing mental health issues that might have come into play.

The autopsy report also listed several health conditions — two different lung diseases, heart inflammation and a brain injury — that were complications of his death.

The report at one point indicated the cause of death was ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint due to excited delirium due to acute phycyclidine intoxication,” as if one followed on the other.

That is, as if Prude's PCP intoxication caused excited delirium, which prompted the physical restraint that deprived Prude of oxygen and left him brain dead.

The term ""excited delirium"" and the concept behind it is a controversial one. It is often applied to suspects who aggressively resist police detention efforts. Officers and pathologists frequently assert that the suspects are high on drugs.

Proponents say someone suffering from the syndrome is more likely to die from pre-existing health problems, such as a bad heart.

Both AMR personnel who were on the scene that morning later told the Rochester police investigators that it appeared Prude may have been experiencing excited delirium.

But critics say the term has no formal meaning in medicine, and is used as a way to explain resistant behavior of suspects and to normalize officers' aggressive responses. It is applied most often to young men of color, some have asserted.

In the video of the Prude incident, a paramedic from the ambulance crew, identified in the police report as Julie Purick, speaks to an officer as her colleague tries to revive Prude.

""PCP can cause what we call excited delirium,"" she said.

""Yeah, I know what excited delirium is,"" the police officer responds.

""I guarantee you that's how he coded,"" Purick goes on, using a shorthand expression for the sudden cessation of lung and heart function. ""It's not you guys' fault. You've got to keep yourselves safe.""

"3 year old girl dies, hospital admitted her but wouldn't treat her as they had a contract that only her doctor could bill her - and he had gone home for the night",http://kvia.com/health/2020/08/25/former-mayoral-candidate-sues-prominent-doctor-el-paso-childrens-hospital-over-daughters-death/,"Health

EL PASO, Texas -- A wrongful death lawsuit filed earlier this month accuses a prominent El Paso doctor and El Paso Children’s Hospital of “gross negligence” in the death of a young girl a year ago.

The suit was filed by David Saucedo, a 2017 candidate for El Paso mayor and small-business owner, and his wife, Mariana Terrazas Saucedo, over the death of their then-3-year-old daughter, Ivanna.

The suit names Dr. Robert Canales, a well-known family doctor, the children’s hospital and pediatric neurologist Dr. Rodolfo Fierro-Stevens.

The Saucedos are asking for a jury trial and damages of more than $1 million. The lawsuit was filed in the court of 171st District Judge Bonnie Rangel.

The suit says that the death of their child “was no accident.”

The suit alleges that Canales has “been misdiagnosing and injuring children across El Paso for decades.”

It also blames Ivanna’s death on the Children’s Hospital’s “systematic and wide-spread policies and procedures which endangered patients” and placed profits over patients to entice doctors like Canales to conduct business at the hospital.

Prior to Ivanna’s death, she had suffered from hydrocephalus, which is commonly referred to “water on the brain.”

On Aug. 29, 2019, their daughter began to vomit.

The Saucedos contend that they were forced to wait hours at the hospital for Canales to arrive and treat their daughter. No else on the hospital’s staff stepped up to provide care during the wait, either, the suit contends.

They say their daughter fell into a coma, her condition continued to worsen and she died on Sept. 2, 2019.

Officials with El Paso Children's Hospital declined to comment to ABC-7, saying they don't discuss pending litigation.",JustBadNews,0

Introduction

Reports estimate that as many as fifty thousand people have been displaced by ethno nationalist mobs, and hundreds killed. This is not the first time similar atrocities committed against, in particular non-Oromos[1], orthodox Christians[2] [3]and a number of minority groups. Why the terrorist group namely Queerro[4] has not been accused of genocide, and what actually qualifies under the title? What exactly constitutes genocide, and why is it that hard for the Ethiopian government to admit that the atrocity crimes are in fact genocide? Well, genocide is officially defined in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” [5]The United Nations adopted the Convention in 1948, following the Armenian Genocide during World War One and the Holocaust during World War Two. Here I am not going to detail conceptual differences, as outlined in the Convention, between Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, and genocide. We cannot afford to play with words. After all, both of them involve systematically killing huge numbers of people Of course, a distinction is made in the focus and purpose of the massacres[6]. When a large number of people are killed in pursuit of a political goal, or something similar, it is considered a crime against humanity. The label also applies in cases of mass slavery, deportation, torture, rape, apartheid, and other crimes. But if the purpose of the killings is specifically to eliminate a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, then it can be called a genocide[7].

Facebook has cracked down on dozens of fake accounts posing as Black supporters for Trump,http://businessinsider.com/facebook-removed-accounts-posing-as-black-supporters-for-donald-trump-2020-8?r=US&IR=T,"Facebook took down more than 30 accounts pretending to represent African-American support for President Donald Trump, the company said on Thursday.

The accounts were pushed out by a foreign pro-Trump troll farm in Romania and used names such as ""BlackPeopleVoteForTrump"" and ""We Love Our President.""

Facebook also removed more than 300 other fake accounts linked to conservative media outlet The Epoch Times, which were peddling pro-Trump conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and anti-racism protests.

Facebook has removed more than 30 accounts posing as African Americans in support of President Donald Trump, the company said on Thursday.

The accounts, that used names such as ""BlackPeopleVoteForTrump"" and ""We Love Our President,"" were pushed out on Instagram and Facebook by a foreign pro-Trump troll farm in Romania.

According to Facebook's head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher there wasn't any ""clear evidence of financial motivation"" or ""clear links to known commercial actors in this space,"" NBC News reported.

The company removed 35 Facebook accounts, three pages, and 88 Instagram accounts in total.

Separately, Facebook also eliminated more than 300 fake accounts linked to conservative media outlet The Epoch Times. It alleged that they were pushing disinformation about Trump's campaign and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The accounts also posted about ""ongoing US protests and conspiracy theories about who is behind them,"" Gleicher said, according to NBC.

The company said it removed 303 Facebook accounts, 181 pages, 44 Facebook groups, and 31 Instagram accounts, which were followed by more than 2 million people.

The fake accounts were tied to a digital media outlet called TruthMedia, allegedly employed by The Epoch Times, and now banned from Facebook.

Stephen Gregory, the publisher of The Epoch Times' English-language editions, told NBC that it was not associated with TruthMedia.

It is not the first time Facebook has confronted The Epoch Times. Last year, it removed more than 700 fake accounts, which were posting stories published by the news outlet and banned it from advertising after it tried to get around Facebook's ad review system.

Facebook's said the crackdown on fake accounts comes as they continue to take action against ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" during the presidential campaign, according to NBC News.

"A new video shows another Black man in custody pleading, 'I can't breathe,' before his death",http://cnn.com/2020/08/07/us/north-carolina-detention-death-video-released-trnd/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29,"(CNN) Video that shows a Black man in apparent medical distress repeatedly telling officers, ""I can't breathe,"" days before he died in a hospital was released this week following a North Carolina judge's order.

John Elliott Neville, 56, of Greensboro, also can be heard telling officers, ""Let me go!"" and ""Help me!"" and calling out, ""Mama!"" during the episode a day after his December 1 arrest. He became unresponsive during the incident and died later at a hospital.

The five corrections officers and the nurse who attended to Neville leading up to his death have been charged with involuntary manslaughter by Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O'Neill. They have been relieved of duty, the sheriff's office said.

The case marks the latest chapter in an unfolding, nationwide reckoning over how police treat Black people. Protests from coast to coast have continued since the May death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, who cried out that he couldn't breathe as an officer knelt on his neck; Floyd also pleaded for his mother's aid in his dying moments.

Forsyth County Sheriff Bobby Kimbrough Jr. apologized to the Neville family on Wednesday, following the court order to release the footage.

""I want to take this opportunity to say how much I appreciate the class in which you have handled the passing of your father,"" Kimbrough said. ""I have stood with you from the beginning and will continue to stand with you.""

CNN has reached out to the district attorney's office and the attorney for Neville's family.

He fell from a top bunk to the floor

Neville was arrested by the Kernersville Police Department on a charge of assault on a female out of Guilford County, according to the sheriff's office.

While in custody at the Forsyth County Law Enforcement Center, he experienced an unknown medical emergency while he slept that caused him to fall out of his top bunk to the floor, O'Neill said last month during a news conference.

Corrections officers and a nurse were dispatched to his cell, where they found Neville disoriented and confused, O'Neill said. The decision was made to move him to an observation cell to see what was causing his distress. Over the next 45 minutes, Neville sustained injuries that caused him to lose his life, O'Neill said.

Videos taken from body and handheld cameras inside the detention facility on December 2 show at least five officers attending to Neville in his cell where he is on the ground. Officers can be heard in the 45-minute video asking him to stay down and informing him that he'd just had a seizure.

Neville can be heard screaming, ""Hold on, let me up, and let me up,"" while officers restrain him on the ground and he struggles with them. Neville yells, ""Help me, help me,"" several times and can be heard yelling, ""Mama! Mama! Mama!"" and several expletives.

An officer can be heard telling him several times, ""John, Listen to me. You are having a medical problem. You need to calm down."" Neville continues to yell and struggle saying, ""Let me go! Let me go! Move your hands, let me up! Come on!""

As Neville continues pleading with officers, he is told to relax and to stop resisting. For several minutes, officers are seen attempting to take handcuffs off Neville, who is seen lying motionless on the ground with a white bag on his head meant to protect the officers from his spittle. Neville is eventually wheeled out of his cell by officers and down the hall.

While walking him down the hall, an officer can be heard asking, ""John, you doing OK, buddy?"" Neville responds, ""No, help me."" The officer said, ""We're helping you. We've got medical here. You've got a medical condition going on, you need to calm down, OK?""

Neville is wheeled to another room where a nurse checks his blood pressure. The nurse asks Neville if he knows where he is, and he says he does not. The nurse can be heard telling him to ""stay relaxed,"" and Neville continues to struggle and yell, ""Help me, somebody! Help me, somebody!"" The nurse tells him they are helping him and to calm down.

Moments later, Neville is moved into another cell where he is placed on the ground and restrained by officers who appear to be trying again to take handcuffs off him. Neville continues to yell, ""Help! My wrists! Help me! Help Me. I can't breathe."" An officer tells him, ""I hear you. You're talking, you can breathe.""

Neville continues, saying, ""Please. I can't breathe. Let me go! I can't breathe, let me go. Please.""

An officer responds, ""John, Relax.""

Neville continues to cry out in despair, saying, ""I can't breathe"" several times.

One officer is heard telling Neville, ""You need to settle down. We are trying to get these cuffs off you, and you're making it hard. You are breathing because you are talking, you're yelling, and you're moving. You need to stop. You need to relax. Quit resisting us. The quicker you relax the quicker we'll be out of here, man.""

Officers continue to try to remove the restraints from Neville, who at this point is no longer yelling and appears to be unresponsive on the ground.

An officer says, ""Alright, John, we're almost there. We are almost there, bud,"" as the others continue to work to remove the cuffs.

Lawyers for 5 defendants respond

CNN has obtained statements from the attorneys for the five officers charged with involuntary manslaughter -- Lavette Williams, Antonio Woodley, Edward Roussel, Christopher Stamper and Sarah Poole.

David Freedman, attorney for Roussel, says his client has worked 30 years in law enforcement.

""The video shows there was no criminal activity,"" Freedman said. ""My client was acting consistent in how he was trained and they were acting under supervision of the health care provider on staff. While the events were tragic, the results to Neville were accidental.""

Woodley's attorney, Niles Gerber, said the situation should not be compared to the George Floyd case.

""My client did everything he could to try and help this man who is clearly having medical or emotional episode, in my opinion,"" Gerber said. ""I don't know what else they were supposed to do. ... I believe there were intervening circumstances that contributed, including the key breaking and the bolt cutters not functioning.""

Williams' attorney, Karen Gerber, said her client has worked 17-20 years at the jail. The detention officers followed their training, she said.

""And though the death is a tragic, they dealt with this situation under adverse circumstances, following the training provided by the agency,"" Gerber said. ""The equipment they were given broke. The handcuffs broke. All the while they were doing the best they could do to help this man out.""

J.D. Byers, lawyer for Stampers, said the video ""shows that the officers were doing exactly what they were trained to do. There was no intention of harming Mr. Neville. It is an incredibly sad incident for everyone involved. I am confident that the court of law will determine the case and I hope people view the video fairly.""

Terrence Hines, lawyer for Sarah Poole, said the defendants were just trying to do their job.

""Her intent and everyone else's intent was to help Mr. Neville, not harm him,"" Hines said. ""They were trying to do their job to make sure he wasn't going to harm them or the nurse trying to assist him. It was a sad situation that no one wants to see someone lose their life and honestly, they were doing everything they could to help. It's an unfortunate and tragic situation.""

CNN has reached out to the attorney for the nurse who was charged, Michelle Heughins, and has not head back.

'Prone restraint' mentioned among causes of death

Neville became unresponsive at some point while officers were attempting to remove the handcuffs, according to an investigation report from the Forsyth County Medical Examiner. CPR was started by medical personnel, and EMS was called.

Upon EMS arrival, Neville's pupils were dilated and nonreactive, the report states. He was taken to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, where he died December 4.

Neville's cause of death is listed as ""complications of hypoxic ischemic brain injury due to cardiopulmonary arrest due to positional and compressional asphyxia during prone restraint,"" according to the autopsy report released by the medical examiner's office. Other significant conditions were listed as ""acute altered mental status"" and asthma.""",JustBadNews,0

A Winnipeg woman is dumbfounded after she received an ambulance bill for her common-law partner who was shot and killed by police in April.

Neveen Al-Fouakhiri said she recently found the $250 ambulance bill in her mail.

“I kind of cried in my house for six hours after,” Al-Fouakhiri told Global News Thursday.

“It’s been a couple months, you try to grieve and then you get this in the mail.” Tweet This

Police were called to Al-Fouakhiri’s home on Anderson Avenue on April 9 for a report of an armed man during a domestic incident. About a half hour after arriving on scene, police opened fire.

Al-Fouakhiri said her common-law partner, 36-year-old Jason Collins, was lifeless on front lawn before he was transported to hospital in an ambulance.

Al-Fouakhiri was taken to hospital in an ambulance as well and has also received a bill which she said she has no problem paying for.

“It’s really not about the money, it’s really not, it’s about bringing everything back all over again,” she said.

“Winnipeg police came to our property and they shot and killed him and they send you the bill for it.”

A spokesperson for the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service said ambulance service billing is an automated process that is not dependent on the circumstances of the call for service or on the patient’s outcome.

When asked at a press conference about Al-Fouakhiri’s situation, Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said he would look into it.

“I’m thinking of the individuals. I can appreciate the questions being raised, as well as concern and anger about getting a bill when the injury was caused by a member of the public service, whether it’s police or any other member of the public service,” Bowman said.

“It’s one that I’ll look into if it’s something you can provide me with some additional information, I’ll personally look into that.”

Global News has since provided the mayor’s press secretary with additional information.

Manuel Ellis' death in police custody ruled a homicide and video shows police repeatedly punching him. Mayor calls for officer firings.,http://cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/tacoma-washington-man-dies-police-custody/index.html,"(CNN) A black man who died in police custody in Tacoma, Washington, could be heard on dispatcher audio screaming ""I can't breathe,"" according to an attorney for the man's family.

Tacoma police tried to arrest Manuel Ellis the night of March 3 after officers saw him ""trying to open car doors of occupied vehicles,"" according to a news release from the city's police department.

Officers said there was a physical altercation and Ellis had to be physically restrained because he was ""combative,"" the release said. Police said the officers called for medical aid when they saw he needed help, but Ellis died at the scene.

The audio recording, captured by the website Broadcastify, provides additional details on the deadly incident. Officers can be heard asking for hobbles -- a kind of leg restraint -- at around 11:26 p.m. About 50 seconds later, as an officer relays a message to the dispatcher, a male voice can be heard in the background exclaiming, ""I can't breathe.""

A few minutes later an officer can be heard requesting an ambulance.

""They're absolutely positive that that is their brother and their son,"" James Bible, the family's attorney, told CNN.

""This family has listened to it repeatedly over and over again in heartbreaking fashion,"" he added.

CNN has reached out to the spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's office, the agency investigating this matter, but did not immediately get a reply. Sheriff's investigators confirmed the recording to CNN affiliate KIRO and said there is also a video of the incident logged into evidence.

""When he said he couldn't breathe they rolled him on the side and he was breathing and he was talking,"" Ed Troyer, spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, told KIRO.

The four police officers have not been charged but they have been placed on administrative leave.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said in a news release Friday night that the state will conduct an independent review of Ellis' death as the Pierce County Sheriff concludes its investigation. The review does not call the results of the investigation into question prematurely, Inslee said, but is intended to provide confidence in the outcome.

""We know that Manuel Ellis was one of far, far too many Black men who died while in police custody in America, including here in Washington state. Washingtonians deserve every assurance that investigations and charging decisions related to police shootings and deaths of people in police custody are handled with urgency, independence and commitment to justice.""

Two videos posted

In another development Friday, two videos posted on social media appear to show Tacoma officers striking a black man and pinning him down before he died in their custody. Bible said the man is Ellis.

Both of the videos of the alleged altercation are under a minute and were posted on Twitter. One video appears to show officers striking Ellis as he lies on the ground. A second video appears to show them holding Ellis to the ground and telling him to put his hands behind his back.

The videos were posted on the page of a local activist group, Tacoma Action Collective, and were shot by Sara McDowell, a local resident who witnessed the arrest.

It's unclear whether the video recordings were taken before or after the ""I can't breathe"" shout was transmitted across the dispatcher audio.

After the videos were posted Friday, Troyer said the sheriff's department was investigating this matter and wouldn't comment.

""We're not commenting on it because we don't have it, it's not ours,"" he said. ""As much as I wish we could all see the totality of the picture and we could have the person come in and bring in a part of the case, that'd be great, but none of that's happened.""

Tacoma mayor and police union clash over death

Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards is demanding that four police officers be fired and prosecuted following Ellis' death. Woodards made the comments after video of Ellis' arrest surfaced.

""In this moment, at this time, based on the information I know today, the officers' actions we saw on this video tonight only confirmed that Manuel Ellis' death was a homicide,"" Woodards said Thursday in a news conference. ""I am asking -- no, I am telling you that I am going to call for several things, and the officers who committed this crime should be fired and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.""

There have been protests in Tacoma over Ellis' death.

Ellis died of respiratory arrest due to hypoxia caused by physical restraint, the Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office determined. Hypoxia is a condition in which the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply.

Ellis was black; two of the four officers in his case are white, one is black and one is Asian, according to police.

The Tacoma Police Union wrote in a statement Thursday the mayor passed judgment on the four officers ""without any facts, without an investigation, without due process, and with less than a minute of short, blurry, partial Twitter videos in hand.""

""She called them criminals. She called for their prosecution. She called for their termination from employment. And she called for all of these things without an ounce of evidence to support her words beyond misplaced rage,"" the union's statement read.

The union also addressed the death of Floyd, saying it was wrong and ""repugnant to the badge"" and humanity.

""But understand; Tacoma is not Minneapolis. The incident involving Mr. Ellis here in Tacoma was not the same as the incident involving Mr. Floyd,"" the statement read. ""This is not the time to sacrifice dedicated public servants at the altar of public sentiment.""",JustBadNews,0

Video of Dallas police pinning a man to the ground for more than 13 minutes until he loses consciousness and dies has been made public after a years-long legal battle.

NYPD officer who put Eric Garner in chokehold should be fired, judge says Read more

Tony Timpa, 32, died in August 2016 as he was restrained by three police officers in a Dallas parking lot. Timpa had called 911 to say he had come off his medication for schizophrenia and depression and needed help.

In the bodycam video, finally obtained by the Dallas Morning News, Timpa, who had been handcuffed by store security guards, is pinned to the ground in a prone position with a knee on his back as he pleads with police to release him.

“You’re going to kill me!” Timpa shouts repeatedly.

The three officers laugh and joke as they restrain Timpa on the ground. One officer mocks Timpa as a “roly-poly”. As he becomes unresponsive, with his face in the grass, the officers joke that he has fallen asleep. When Timpa finally stops moving, the trio continue their mockery.

“Back to school! Come on, wake up!” one officer says.

Another, mimicking a teenager, says: “I don’t want to go to school! Five more minutes, Mom!”

Only after an ambulance arrives do officers show concern. “I hope I didn’t kill him,” one says.

In the ambulance, a paramedic tells the officers Timpa is not breathing. Another paramedic points at Timpa and says: “He’s dead.”

The film forms part of a lawsuit filed by Timpa’s family that claims police used excessive force.

“The footage graphically depicts the needless death of an unarmed young man,” the family’s lawyer, Geoff Henley, told the New York Times on Thursday. “What is worse, some of the officers seemed more interested in sophomoric gallows humor than ensuring that they were keeping Tony alive.”

For three years following a Dallas Morning News investigation, city and state authorities resisted its release.

Initially, they argued first that the video’s publication would interfere with an open criminal case that charged the officers with “engaging in reckless conduct that placed Timpa in imminent danger of serious bodily injury”. Later, officials cited the case’s dismissal.

In March, the charges were dismissed because Dallas county district attorney John Creuzot, after consulting three medical examiners, concluded it was unlikely prosecutors could secure a conviction. The officers were disciplined, and returned to active duty a month later.

Timpa’s death was classified by an autopsy as a homicide, his death caused by sudden cardiac death due to “the toxic effects of cocaine and the stress associated with physical restraint”.",JustBadNews,0
Mayor: Death of George Floyd by Minneapolis police 'completely and utterly messed up',http://fox9.com/news/mayor-death-of-george-floyd-by-minneapolis-police-completely-and-utterly-messed-up,"Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called the death of a black man in police custody Monday night “completely and utterly messed up.”

“Being black in America should not be a death sentence,” he said.

Attorney Benjamin Crump identified the man who died as George Floyd, and said he has been retained by Floyd's family.

“We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him to the police car and get off his neck,” Crump said in a statement. “This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge. We will seek justice for the family of George Floyd, as we demand answers from the Minneapolis Police Department. How many ‘while black’ deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends?”

Floyd died at the hospital after he was detained by Minneapolis police officers near the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue South. A video taken by a bystander showed one of the officers pinning Floyd to the ground and pressing his knee into the man’s neck as the man repeats that he cannot breathe. Floyd eventually becomes unresponsive, but the officer continues to hold his knee to the man’s neck until an ambulance arrives.

The mayor appeared visibly upset at a press conference Tuesday morning after having viewed the bystander video of the incident.

“For the better part of the night, I’ve been trying to find the words to describe what happened and all I keep coming back to is that he should not have died,” the mayor said.

He apologized to the black community for what happened.

“It was traumatic and it serves as a clear reminder of just how far we have to go,” Frey said.

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter also reacted to the incident.

“The video of a Minneapolis police officer killing a defenseless, handcuffed man is one of the most vile and heartbreaking images I’ve ever seen,” he said in a statement. ""The officer who stood guard is just as responsible as his partner; both must be held fully accountable. This must stop now.”

The FBI is taking the lead in the investigation into the incident, assisted by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he called the FBI in to investigate possible civil rights violations.

The officers were wearing body worn cameras, which were activated during the incident.

Arradondo said the officers have been placed on relief of duty status, meaning they will get paid, but will have no law enforcement duties or responsibilities until the investigation into the incident is complete.",JustBadNews,0

Video of the incident shows that a white police officer had a black man pinned to the ground next to the back tire of his patrol car with his knee on the man's neck.

""Please, please, please, I can't breathe,"" the man begs. ""My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please. I can't breathe.""

Onlookers outside the Minneapolis deli urge the officer to get off the man.

""You're stopping his breathing right now, you think that's cool?"" one man says. ""His nose is bleeding. Look at his nose!"" says a woman.

The officer does not budge.

And then the man goes silent. More people begin to intervene and call for the officer or his partner to check for a pulse. The officer remains on the man's neck, even as he lies apparently unresponsive, for a total of about eight minutes before paramedics arrive and the man is placed on a stretcher.

This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by police for questioning about a non-violent charge,"" Crump said.

""We will seek justice for the family of George Floyd, as we demand answers from the Minneapolis Police Department,"" Crump added. ""How many 'while black' deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends.""

Minneapolis police said in a statement early Tuesday that the officers had responded to a report of a forgery in progress and found the suspect in his car. He stepped out of the car when he was ordered to, police said, but then physically resisted officers.

""Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress,"" the statement said. ""Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.""

The four officers involved have been fired, Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted Tuesday afternoon.

""This is the right call,"" he said.

The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement that it was not the time to rush to judgment and that the officers were fully cooperating in the investigation.

""We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner's report,"" the statement said. ""Officers' actions and training protocol will be carefully examined after the officers have provided their statements.""

Initially, police said the department had called in the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to investigate independently. A short time later, the department announced that the FBI would also be investigating.

""We put out the information that we believed to be wholly honest and true. As we dug into it deeper, we realized that in fact it would be appropriate to have the FBI be apart of this investigation as well,"" said the department's director of public information, John Elder.

""The public has seen the video. To call this a 'medical incident' is an insult.""

Police Chief Medaria Arradondo added during a news conference Tuesday morning: ""There was additional information that I had received, quite frankly, from a community source that just provided more context than what I had preliminary, originally."" That prompted him to get the FBI involved ""knowing that there could be a question of civil rights.""

Federal agents were on the ground, Arradondo said. Body camera video was available, but has not been made public. Police said no weapons were used by anyone involved in the incident.

He said the officers were on paid leave. Neither of the officers in the video has been identified by the police.

The state public safety bureau said investigators would like to speak with anyone who recorded or witnessed the incident. The bureau would be sharing its findings with the FBI and presenting the completed investigation to the Hennepin County attorney's office for review.

""What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up,"" Mayor Jacob Frey said of the video during the news conference. ""I believe what I saw, and what I saw was wrong at every level.""

""This man's life matters,"" Frey said. ""He should not have died. He was a human being, and his life mattered. ... Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the single truth that he should be with us this morning.""

""Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" Frey said. ""When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help, and this officer failed in the most basic human sense.""

A protest was planned for Tuesday night at the scene. Frey encouraged protesters to express their anger but asked them to do so safely and while social distancing.

Jessi Zendejas asked people who remembered the ""gentle giant"" who worked as a security guard at a Minneapolis bar and restaurant to ""please stand with us.""

""Everyone who knows him knew he loved his hugs from his regulars when working as a security guard and would be mad if you didn’t stop to greet him because he honestly loved seeing everyone and watching everyone have fun,"" Zendejas wrote on Facebook.

Jovanni Thunstrom, the owner of Conga Latin Bistro, said Floyd had worked there as a security guard for more than five years. He said Floyd was also a friend and had been a tenant of his.

He wrote on Facebook that he first saw the video and later found out the person who died was Floyd. He said he was writing the post through teary eyes.

""My employee George Floyd was murdered by a police officer that had no compassion, used his position to commit a murder of someone that was begging for his life,"" Thunstrom wrote.

In a statement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said: ""Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country.""

""We heard his repeated calls for help. We heard him say over and over again that he could not breathe. And now we have seen yet another horrifying and gut-wrenching instance of an African American man dying,"" Klobuchar said.

In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Minnesota called for a fair investigation and justice for Floyd.

""Nearly six years after Eric Garner's death in New York — and four years after Philando Castile's in Minnesota — this tragic video shows how little meaningful change has emerged to prevent police from taking the lives of Black people,"" said Paige Fernandez, policing policy adviser for the national ACLU. ""Make no mistake: George Floyd should be alive today. The officers responsible must be held accountable.""

""The public has seen the video,"" Fernandez added. ""To call this a 'medical incident' is an insult.""",JustBadNews,0
Hong Kong government orders full review and apology from Radio Television Hong Kong for its show Headliner insulting the police,http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1527089-20200519.htm,"Govt orders full review, public account from RTHK

RTHK has been told to address concerns raised about its programmes, management and governance. File photo: RTHK

The government on Tuesday issued Radio Television Hong Kong with a list of demands including a full review of its editorial system, an apology, and disciplinary action against any staff found to have committed mistakes or ""negligence"".



The statement from the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB), which oversees the public broadcaster, came after the Communications Authority gave the station a warning over a February episode of the satirical show Headliner that had mocked the police force.



""The CEDB took the view that the situation is very serious given that RTHK, as a public service broadcaster, has been repeatedly ruled to have breached the various provisions in the [Television Programme] Code, including failure to ensure the accuracy of the factual contents in the programme; remarks and content regarded as hate speech, denigrating and insulting the police; and failure to include a sufficiently broad range of views in the personal view programme.""



The bureau then said it had asked RTHK to undertake several measures, the first being to state clearly that it fully accepts the Communication's Authority's decision regarding Headliner and to offer an apology.



The CEDB said RTHK should examine whether there is ""any negligence and error committed by staff and personnel in the course of the programme production and editorial processes, and, if so, to follow up or take disciplinary actions"".



In addition, it demanded a full review of the programme production and editorial system to make sure shows fulfil the public purposes and mission specified in the station's charter.



""The secretary for commerce and economic development has been stressing that RTHK must fully abide by the Charter of RTHK, duly meet its responsibility as a public service broadcaster and strictly comply with the relevant codes of practice issued by the CA,"" the statement said.



""RTHK should address the concerns raised by different stakeholders on its programmes, management and governance. It should take positive and proactive follow-up actions and give an account to the public.""



The warning from the Communications Authority had been RTHK's second in a month, after the station was found to have made multiple breaches of the TV Programme Code regarding the show Pentaprism, where a guest host gave his views last November on clashes between police and protesters at Chinese University and Polytechnic University.



Last month, the CEDB also said that RTHK had breached the ""One China"" principle by asking the World Health Organisation if it would reconsider Taiwan's membership in light of the Covid-19 outbreak.



RTHK has faced repeated allegations that it has been biased in favour of the city's pro-democracy protesters since Hong Kong's social unrest erupted last June.

"4 in 5 Canadians dislike and distrust China, poll finds",http://thinkpol.ca/2020/05/13/4-5-canadians-dislike-distrust-china/,"Four in five people in Canada view China unfavourably, while even more agree that the Chinese government has not been transparent or honest about the COVID-19 situation in that country, the latest study from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute finds.

Just 14% of adults in this country now say they have a positive opinion of China, a level half as high as it was six months ago (29%) as the Communist Party of China faces accusations from Western intelligence agencies that Beijing hid the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in the early days of the pandemic and pressured WHO to underreport the severity of the impending coronavirus pandemic .

Canadian public opinion towards China, which had been on the decline since 2017, dropped precipitously after Beijing arbitrarily arrested and detained two Canadians in a tit-for-tat reaction to Canada’s arrest – and subsequent release on bail – of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.

The dislike for and the distrust of China is a non-partisan issue, as Conservative, Liberal and NDP voters all overwhelmingly hold a negative view of that country.

Three-quarters of Canadians say Canada should prioritize human rights and the rule of law over economic opportunity.

Canadians’ view of their neighbour the south is also becoming less favourable.

Just 38% of Canadians now say they hold a favourable view of the United States – Canada’s largest trading partner.

The decline has been largely attributed to the widely unpopular term of President Trump, and may now be exacerbated by his administration’s widely criticized response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While Canadians are becoming more wary of China and the United States, the European Union has been winning the war on hearts and minds.

The majority of Canadians view the EU as the top choice to develop closer trade ties among Canada’s major trading partners.",JustBadNews,0
Hong Kong broadcaster rejects WHO claim that interview with top doctor was 'distorted',http://hongkongfp.com/2020/04/16/hong-kong-broadcaster-rejects-who-claim-that-interview-with-top-doctor-was-distorted/,"Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK has rejected an allegation that it distorted a video interview with a World Health Organisation (WHO) doctor after he refused to answer questions about Taiwan’s membership status.

WHO adviser Dr Bruce Aylward appeared to end a Skype call with producer Yvonne Tong from RTHK’s current affairs programme The Pulse last month after she asked whether the UN body would reconsider Taiwan’s bid to join. He also declined to answer a question about the government’s handling of the outbreak.

In an emailed response to HKFP on Thursday, a WHO spokesperson accused The Pulse of editing the clip and causing a misrepresentation. They also claimed it was Aylward – not the producers – who took the initiative to call back after the connection was apparently cut.

“RTHK re-shot the interviewer and questions afterwards and edited the interview in a way that created substantial distortion and misrepresentation,” it read.

The spokesperson also said RTHK had declined to share the unedited interview footage with the UN body.

In response to the allegations – first reported by the Washington Post’s Emily Rauhala – RTHK’s Head of Corporate Communications and Standards Amen Ng told HKFP that they stood by the content of the interview and “strenuously reject any allegations of ‘distortion and misrepresentation.'”

“None of the shots of the interviewer or her questions were re-filmed after the interview,” the written response read. Ng defended the decision not to release non-transmitted materials to WHO as a standard “in common with news broadcast and media organisations worldwide and to ensure editorial independence.”

She added that it was RTHK who sought to reconnect the call: “We would point out that the inability to hear a repeated question, the encouragement to forget it and move to another question, the inability to hear it a second time, and the lost connection, occurs in one single 18 second UNCUT shot. It is this sequence that drew international attention.”

Gov’t intervention

The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, which oversees RTHK, released a statement on behalf of secretary Edward Yau criticising the programme after it was broadcast. It claimed the line of questioning had breached the One-China Principle and its charter.

“It is common knowledge that the WHO membership is based on sovereign states,” the statement read. “As the Editor-in-chief of RTHK, the Director of Broadcasting should be responsible for this.”

https://twitter.com/yvonne_tg/status/1246733489744953344

On April 7, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she endorsed and supported Yau’s position: “RTHK has to fulfil the very important and fundamental principle of upholding ‘One Country, Two Systems’.”

Four protesters previously staged a demonstration outside RTHK’s buildings, accusing Tong of being “wicked” and seeking to “incite Taiwanese independence.”",JustBadNews,0
Indian Muslims are being blamed for the Corona virus by millions of Hindu Nationalists,http://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/tablighi-jamaat-india-muslims-coronavirus.html,"Slate is making its coronavirus coverage free for all readers.

MUMBAI, India—In the weeks since India announced the world’s largest lockdown to protect its 1.3 billion people from the spread of COVID-19, millions have participated in government-instigated shows of unity and solidarity, from collectively banging on pots and pans to lighting candles.

Unfortunately, but perhaps predictably, as criticism of aspects of the lockdown has grown, so has Islamophobia. Across cable television and India’s ubiquitous WhatsApp groups, the country’s 200 million Muslims have become a useful scapegoat for the spread of the virus. As the centerpiece of this campaign, government and media figures have implied sinister intent behind a peaceful religious gathering that was held in the nation’s capital, New Delhi.

Between March 8 and March 10, two weeks before the lockdown was announced, members of the Muslim missionary organization Tablighi Jamaat gathered from across India and Southeast Asia in the Nizamuddin neighborhood of Delhi for a long-scheduled event. Many of the missionaries then left from Delhi to visit villages and towns around India to preach a form of Sunni Islam, some of them carrying the coronavirus with them. Now the Indian government is engaged in a large-scale effort to locate and test anyone who may have recently visited the society’s global headquarters. Officials says that more than 1,400 coronavirus patients are linked to Tablighi Jamaat across 17 states. Some prominent outlets have claimed a majority of new cases in India are linked to the event, but those numbers are almost certainly distorted by the lack of widespread testing.

Angry messages have exploded across Twitter via hashtags like #CoronaJihad, #Biojihad, and #TablighiJamatVirus claiming Muslims intentionally spread the virus. These same conspiracy theories have been disseminated through the country’s ruling party officials, national television channels, and journalists asking whether “Indian agencies should seriously probe if #CoronaJihad is a ground reality.” Meanwhile, a slew of fake videos are being shared purporting to show Muslims conspiring to spread the coronavirus, including one allegedly capturing Muslim men intentionally sneezing on others to infect them. In fact, the video was filmed months ago and had no connection to the coronavirus whatsoever.

Tablighi Jamaat is a nonpolitical organization that has existed for nearly 100 years and currently operates in 150 countries. It aims to promote religious reform and instill purist Islamic values in other Muslims. It furthers this goal through preaching missions, in which members of Tablighi Jamaat connect with other Muslims in their own communities. For many of the organization’s members, it has been a challenging time. Just days ago, a tea seller in the state of Himachal Pradesh committed suicide after facing a social boycott from his community over his connection to the group, and in Delhi a man who attended a Tablighi Jamaat gathering was brutally beaten because of suspicions that he was intentionally spreading the coronavirus. Shahid Ali, the organization’s spokesperson, says they are “definitely very worried about the lives of the people” and what may come next for the group. “Shame on the media,” says Shaikh Mohammed Saeed, a Tablighi Jamaat member. “To connect the organization, which works for the welfare of society, to terrorism and to #coronajihad … I’m very shocked about it all.”

Authorities have filed police reports against several people from the organization for violating lockdown rules and not maintaining social distancing. The government has also blacklisted 960 foreign nationals who came to India for the event. However, Tablighi Jamaat officials point out that as late as March 13, days after their event in New Delhi, the central government said the coronavirus was not a national emergency. In the immediate aftermath of the lockdown, the group asked for police support for the 2,000 people stranded at their premises, and the request went ignored until new incidents of the coronavirus began popping up in other states with links to Tablighi Jamaat.

Joshua Castellino, the executive director of the London-based Minority Rights Group International, says many Indian government leaders appear to be focusing on assigning blame rather than channeling their energy into responding to the crisis. “If your house is on fire, you need to put it out—not figure out if it was the neighbor in house 3 or house 10 that started it.”

It’s clear that Tablighi Jamaat was hardly alone in failing to immediately halt large gatherings: Multiple large-scale religious, political, and personal events were taking place in Delhi and all across the country until the lockdown came into effect on the night of March 24. Some Hindu temples in the state of Gujarat saw upward of 10,000 visitors between March 18 and March 19. In the second week of March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party celebrated an electoral victory in the state of Madhya Pradesh with a massive rally in the streets. And in Punjab, 40,000 people were quarantined after the death of a man who attended a Sikh religious festival.

These events have not attracted a fraction of the vitriol now faced by members of Tablighi Jamaat. Castellino, who is originally from India, says the anti-Muslim narrative is simply a “knee-jerk” reaction for the current government. Since the election of Modi and the BJP in 2014, Hindu-Muslim tensions have steadily escalated. Most recently, the country has been embroiled in protests due to the passage of the anti-Muslim Citizenship Amendment Act, which codified a religious requirement for new citizens for the first time in the nation’s history. Tensions reached a breaking point in February, when more than 50 people were killed during anti-Muslim riots in New Delhi.

The coronavirus outbreak shifted national attention toward containing the spread of the virus, but after the government faced criticism in late March for the unintended consequences of the sudden lockdown—including the thousands of migrant laborers abandoned far from their homes without food or shelter—government leaders began publicizing the events at Tablighi Jamaat. More than a week after the onslaught of negative attention directed toward Tablighi Jamaat, however, the central government now says that it is concerned about “polarization along religious lines.” But ironically it was the government’s own minister of minority affairs who recently described the group’s actions as a “Talibani offense.”

Some Indian Muslims are bracing for long-term consequences of being blamed for the spread of the coronavirus in India. Currently, a group of Muslim families are camping in a riverbed after being driven from their homes in North India. One of the women interviewed said that their Hindu neighbors accused them of being “sick Muslims spreading virus.”

Javed Khan, a septuagenarian watchmaker who lives and works in Nizamuddin—the neighborhood where Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters is based—predicts that it could take a year for his community to recover. Until recently, the Nizamuddin community had been mainly associated with its abundance of flower sellers, a reputation for pluralism and peace, and an important 13th century Sufi shrine.

Professor Tanweer Fazal, who studies nationalism, identity, and collective violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, says that Tablighi Jamaat probably made an “error in judgment” in going forth with its event and accepting a large flow of visitors in March. But given the relentless pace at which the coronavirus is being connected solely to the gathering, Fazal says one dire outcome may be that “the entire responsibility of the spread of coronavirus in India will be put on Nizamuddin and the Muslim community itself.”

These feelings are unlikely to recede quickly once the lockdown lifts.",JustBadNews,0
80% of Coronavirus test kits 'gifted' to Czechs by China faulty: China charged Czech government millions of crowns for defective Coronavirus test kits.,http://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3903937,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Czech news site on Monday (March 23) revealed that 80 percent of the much-touted traunch of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) rapid test kits ""donated"" from China are faulty, forcing healthcare workers to rely on conventional laboratory tests.

On March 18, as is the case with many of its other quasi charitable acts, Chinese state-run mouthpieces used the verbs ""supplied"" and ""delivered"" to give the impression that the communist regime was donating 150,000 portable, rapid COVID-19 test kits to the Czech Republic. In fact, the central European nation's Health Ministry paid some 14 million crowns (US$546,000) for 100,000 test kits, while the country's Interior Ministry footed the bill for another 50,000, reported Expats.cz.

However, Czech news site iROZHLAS on Monday revealed that local healthcare workers have discovered that up to 80 percent of the Chinese kits give false results. During a crisis staff meeting held for the Moravian-Silesian Region by regional hygienist Pavla Svrcinova, the error rate for the test kits was found to be 80 percent, prompting officials to suggest they only be used for those persons who are nearing the end of their quarantine and never previously tested positive.

According to Svrcinova, the Moravian-Silesian Region will continue to rely on conventional laboratory testing instead. Currently, only 900 such tests can be processed each day.

""We checked them at the University Hospital in Ostrava, but unfortunately the error rate was quite high. So now we are waiting for the results of further testing across the country, and we are considering using them only with people reach the end of their quarantine and have never tested positive, because it works with antibodies,"" said Svrcinova.

She added that the tests yield both false positive and negative results. ""We tested those who searched for a sampling point. Fortunately, we were so farsighted that samples were immediately compared with traditional tests, and that just proved the error rate of the [Chinese rapid] tests, ”said Svrcinova. She said that even if the tests are used with patients who are nearing the end of their quarantine, healthcare workers will need to check their reliability first.

However, Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (CSSD) said that the wrong methodology has probably been chosen. ""In my opinion, this is not about some scandalous revelation that it is not working,"" said Hamacek after a government meeting.

According to Hamacek, the Chinese rapid test kits can be ""used when the disease has been around for some time,"" ""or if someone returns after quarantine after fourteen days,"" he added. The leader said that in his opinion, it would be most appropriate to use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (conventional lab test) to detect the disease at an early stage.

""The child is very, very critical, but we are doing everything we can,"" Roic told N1.

09:53: The Zagreb Office for Emergency Situations has urged citizens not to enter damaged buildings following three earthquakes in the capital on Sunday morning.

""After the earthquakes in Zagreb this morning, we are informing citizens not to enter the damaged buildings. Teams of construction experts are coming to the scene, who will prioritize damage assessment of buildings and mark buildings according to the assessment. The priority is hospitals and later all other buildings.

In addition, teams of construction workers have been hired to clean roads and corridors,” they reported.

""There is also a Special Search and Rescue Civil Protection Unit on the ground, and it is starting to work. All general-purpose Civil Protection units are invited to report to their assembly sites and take on tasks.

NO Krško is not damaged and the electricity supply is normalized and the failures are not large. Unfortunately, we cannot know when and what the subsequent earthquakes will be, but according to seismologists, they should not be stronger than the first earthquake.

We ask all citizens to remain calm and follow the notices of official sources. We ask all citizens to respect the coronavirus-related social distance recommendations in this situation as well,"" they said.

09:39: There was another earthquake, this time of 3.0 magnitude.

09:38: Contrary to initial reports that a 15-year-old child was the first victim of an earthquake in Zagreb, the child has apparently been resuscitated and is fighting for life

Index had initially reported breaking news that the 15-year-old boy died due to the earthquakes. Hina had confirmed that the child died at the Zagreb Institute of Emergency Medicine, having been transported there by ambulance following the collapse of the building at Djordjiceva 13.

There were three initial earthquakes, all a few kilometres north of Zagreb. The first had a magnitude of 5.3 at 06:24, the second 5.0 at 07:01, and a third at 07:41, measuring 3.7. There were two further quakes, both 3.0, 6km north of Zagreb at 09:04 and 09:10. Follow this official global earthquake monitoring website for the latest.

Perhaps the biggest symbol of the physical devastation is Zagreb Cathedral, which has lost part of one of its iconic towers.

The Zagreb earthquake today comes at a critical time for Croatia, as it battles to stop the COVID-19 catastrophe currently happening in Italy. The Croatian authorities have imposed strict new rules, and Zagreb residents were advised to stay indoors and off the streets, public transport was largely cut, and efforts were being stepped up to enforce the required social distancing.

And then, this. One of the most most worrying aspects of these earthquakes is the fallout from the hospital at Rebro, which was also damaged.

What to do? Where to run? One of the scenes of confusion and fear in the immediate aftermath. Heartbreaking.

We will follow the developments of the earthquake live here on this article.

Then later today it emerged another two medical workers had passed away from the illness, the Italian national federation of doctors guilds said.

More than 2,600 medical workers have been infected with coronavirus in Italy - 8.3 per cent of the country's total cases, it emerged last night, as the government extended lockdown measures beyond the start of April today.

There has been growing concerns about the safety of front-line medical staff who come into regular contact with infected patients.

Dr Buttafuoco, who tested positive for the virus, was unable to overcome the symptoms of the disease and passed away yesterday at the age of 66.

Dr Giuseppe Finzi, 62, worked at University Hospital of Parma and had previously run for mayor of Soragna, local media report.

Dr Luigi Ablondi died at the Cremasco hospital, which he had run for 11 years, on Monday at the age of 66, according to Il Nuovo Torrazzo.

It was also announced that pneumologist at Sant'Anna hospital in Como, Giuseppe Lanati, and GP Luigi Frusciante, who was a GP in Sagnino, had died on Sunday.

Both Lanati, 73, and Frusciante, 71, had come out of retirement to help their community during the coronavirus crisis, which had hit Italy harder than any other country outside China.

Previously doctors Raffaele Giura and Franco Galli also died of coronavirus, local media reported last week.

The latest figures on infected healthcare workers were released by a health foundation which said the 'huge number' of infected medics showed that procedures and protection equipment for doctors were 'still inadequate'.

The problem is far worse than in China, because '8.3 per cent is more than double the percentage of the Chinese cohort', the Gimbe foundation's president Nino Cartabellotta told Italian media.

According to the figures, which are drawn from official data, the number of infected medics has risen by more than 1,500 just in the last eight days.

The figure of 2,629 infected medical professionals means that nearly 0.3 per cent of Italy's health workers have caught the disease - taking them out of service when they are desperately needed.

'No more talking: adequately protect those who must protect us,' Cartabellotta urged last night.

It came as Italy recorded a record 4,207 infections and 475 new deaths from the virus yesterday, squashing hopes that the unprecedented national lockdown was beginning to slow the spread of the pathogen.

Prime minister Giuseppe Conte has now warned that quarantine measures 'must be extended beyond their original deadline'. Some had initially been due to expire as early as next Wednesday.

New cases per day in Italy: The number of daily cases was fairly stagnant at the start of this week, settling down at around 3,500 new patients per day

99% of people who died from virus had previous health problems More than 99 per cent of Italian virus deaths so far are patients who had previous health conditions, a study by the country's health authority suggests. Research into 355 deaths showed that only three of the victims, 0.8 per cent, had no pre-existing health problems. Nearly half of them - 48.5 per cent - had three or even more health conditions before they were infected with coronavirus. Another 25.6 per cent had two other 'pathologies', while 25.1 per cent had one. The research is consistent with previous findings that people with existing medical problems are more likely to die if they catch the coronavirus. According to the Italian study, the most common of these problems include high blood pressure and heart disease. Some 76.1 per cent of the dead patients had previously had problems with high arterial blood pressure, the study found. More than a third - 35.5 per cent - had diabetes, while 33.0 per cent had ischemic heart disease. Nearly a quarter, 24.5 per cent, had suffered from atrial fibrillation. Less common examples included dementia and liver disease. The study also found that the average age of people who died from the virus was 79.5. Again, that is consistent with previous findings that older people are more vulnerable to the disease. Advertisement

Italy's 475 new deaths are the largest number that any country, even China, has reported in a single day since the outbreak began late last year.

The previous record high of 368 deaths was also recorded in Italy, on Sunday.

The mounting death toll forced the army to intervene in the city of Bergamo yesterday to transport dozens of coffins out of the city.

The local crematorium has been overwhelmed by the crisis with staff handling 24 bodies a day, twice the usual maximum.

Italy's new surge in cases, which takes the total to 35,713, puts an end to four days of stalling infection numbers and dampens hopes that the quarantine is working.

Italians have been ordered to stay indoors, with schools and universities shut, shops closed except for grocery stores and pharmacies, and heavy restrictions on travel.

However, officials warn there is a lag time between the lockdown being imposed and its effects becoming noticeable in the figures.

'The main thing is, do not give up,' Italian National Institute of Health chief Silvio Brusaferro said in a nationally televised press conference.

'It will take a few days before we see the benefits' of containment measures, said Brusaferro.

'We must maintain these measures to see their effect, and above all to protect the most vulnerable.'

Imposed nationally on March 12, the shutdown of most Italian businesses and a ban on public gatherings were initially due to expire on March 25 with schools shut until April 3.

But prime minister Giuseppe Conte said today that the lockdown will be extended beyond the April 3 deadline.

'The measures we have taken... must be extended beyond their original deadline,' Conte told Thursday's edition of the Corriere della Sera newspaper.

A top government minister hinted yesterday that the school closure could be extended well into next month, if not longer.

Layoffs banned and rents reduced in Italian economic plan Companies are barred from laying off workers and rents have been reduced under Italy's economic survival plan. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte hailed his €25billion (£23bn), 127-point programme as the 'Italian model' that the rest of Europe could adopt. Firms are prohibited from laying off workers for the next two months without 'justified objective reasons' while the self-employed and seasonal workers such as tour guides will receive €600 payments. The government will also cover €100 bonuses for low-wage employees. Families are being issued €600 vouchers to cover the expense of having to hire baby sitters, with a shutdown of schools and kindergartens expected to last weeks. The self-employed who have to look after their children will receive 'parental leave' payments that cover half of their declared monthly incomes. Conte has shut down all forms of business except for pharmacies and grocery stores for two weeks starting on March 12. The government is compensating owners of closed shops by offering them tax credits to cover 60 per cent of their March rent payment. The self-employed and freelancers with home mortgages can ask to have their payments suspended for up to 18 months if they can prove that their incomes fell by a third. A variety of taxes and social service payments are being suspended for sectors and professions deemed most affected by the crisis. The government is also sending €20million to repair the damage caused to prisons by rioters who were anxious about the new disease. Italy's sport federations get four-month tax privileges and 130 million euros will go to support cinemas and the movie industry. Advertisement

Italy's National Research Council (CNR) expects a 'significant reduction' in the growth rate of new infections in the Lombardy region around Milan by next Tuesday or Wednesday.

The northern region of around 10million people has been at the epicentre of the crisis since the start, reporting two thirds of all the deaths in the nation of 60 million.

It has been under lockdown since March 8.

Noting that infections are starting to rise in the south, where many Italians moved after the start of containment measures in the north, the CNR predicts that figures across Italy will only stabilise between March 25 and April 15.

There have been fears that the health system of the poorer south would be entirely unable to cope with an outbreak on the scale which the north has suffered.

The rates within Italy itself remained stable yesterday, with two-thirds of the deaths - 1,959 in all - reported in the northern Lombardy region around Milan, the Italian financial and fashion capital.

The neighbouring Emilia-Romagna region of Bologna has suffered a total of 458 fatalities, and Turin's Piedmont region has had 154 deaths.

Rome's Lazio region has a toll of 32 deaths and 724 infections.

Doctors on the front line of Italy's coronavirus outbreak have described 'catastrophic' scenes in hospitals which are creaking with the sheer volume of cases.

Some patients have been lying face-down on their hospital beds, which researchers believe can raise survival rates in intensive care by improving oxygen levels in the blood.

A new Oxford University study has suggested that Italy may be particularly vulnerable because it has such an old population and the elderly come into frequent contact with the young.

Italy's population is the second-oldest in the world, behind only Japan.

Oxford researchers said it was common for young adults in rural areas to live with their parents and grandparents but to commute into cities, such as Milan, to work and socialise.

Young people may have been picking up the virus while travelling and brought it home without realising they were ill, the Oxford researchers said.

The study is a warning to Britain, which has an ageing population. Older people are known to be more likely to die of Covid-19 if they are infected with the virus.

Italy is also rushing 10,000 student doctors into service, scrapping their final exams, in an effort to help the struggling health service cope with the coronavirus.

University Minister Gaetano Manfredi said the government would let this year's medicine graduates start work some eight or nine months ahead of schedule and waive the mandatory exams they normally sit before qualifying.

'This means immediately releasing into the National Health System the energy of about 10,000 doctors, which is fundamental to dealing with the shortage that our country is suffering,' he said in a statement.

The graduates will be sent to work in general practitioners' clinics and at old peoples' homes, freeing up more experienced colleagues who will be sent to the rapidly filling hospitals.

Over three weeks, 1,135 people have needed intensive care in Lombardy, the northern region hardest hit.

The region has only 800 intensive care beds, according to Giacomo Grasselli, head of the intensive care unit at Milan's Policlinico hospital.

Authorities have been working to set up hundreds of intensive care beds in a specially created facility in the Fiera Milano exhibition center, but are still waiting for sufficient respirators and qualified personnel.

Italy's fleet of the dead: Military trucks transport scores of coronavirus victims' coffins to be cremated

Coffins of coronavirus victims were whisked away on a fleet of army trucks last night after a cemetery in northern Italy was overwhelmed by the death toll.

The column of army trucks brought the dead out of Bergamo on Wednesday night in what Italians have called 'one of the saddest photos in the history of our country'.

The cemetery in Bergamo can no longer cope with the mounting death toll in the city, where more than 4,300 people have been infected and at least 93 have died.

Mortuaries are full and crematorium staff have been handling 24 bodies a day, including the regular drumbeat of non-virus deaths, meaning the bodies of virus victims have had to be dispatched to neighbouring provinces.

An army spokesman confirmed today that 15 trucks and 50 soldiers had been deployed to move bodies to neighbouring provinces.

Italian media said there were around 70 coffins in the grim procession last night as the bodies were taken from the crematorium to the highway and out of Bergamo.

Giacomo Angeloni, the local official in charge of cemeteries in Bergamo, said earlier this week that the crematorium was handling around 24 bodies a day, almost twice its normal maximum.

Local authorities in Bergamo had appealed for help with cremations after being overwhelmed by the death toll.

The pews of the crematorium church have been removed to leave space to lay out scores of coffins but more have been arriving every day.

One Italian who saw the picture of a column of trucks said it was 'one of the saddest photos in the history of our country', while another said it was a 'photo of war'.

'We are Italians and it is at times like these that we bring out the best in us. We will get out of it and we will do it for them too,' one said.

"Yes, it is worse than the flu: busting the coronavirus myths",http://theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/yes-it-is-worse-than-the-flu-busting-the-coronavirus-myths?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Post_on_Reddit,"The truth about how you can catch coronavirus, who is most vulnerable and what you can do to avoid infection

Claim: ‘Face masks don’t work’

Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).

If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.

However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.

Claim: ‘It is mutating into a more deadly strain’

All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection – the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most “successful”. This doesn’t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.

Genetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.

The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more “aggressive”, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage – there haven’t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.

Claim: ‘It is no more dangerous than winter flu’

Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country’s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.

Claim: ‘It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax’

Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.

Claim: ‘You need to be with an infected person for 10 minutes’

For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.

Claim: ‘A vaccine could be ready within a few months’

Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.’",JustBadNews,0

"Sarah Lawrence College parent accused of sex trafficking, abusing students",http://boston.com/news/crime/2020/02/11/sarah-lawrence-college-father-accused-sex-trafficking,"NEW YORK — Lawrence V. Ray showed up at his daughter’s elite college, in a New York City suburb, in late 2010, shortly after being released from prison, and moved into her dormitory. Soon, he started doing “therapy sessions” with her roommates, convincing them he could help with their problems.

Over time, using threats and coercion, he persuaded the young adults he first met at the school, Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, to confess to crimes they had not committed and then extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from them, prosecutors said.

He eventually compelled some of them to work without pay on his family property in North Carolina, and he threatened others with knives. He forced one young woman into prostitution, taking the hundreds of thousands of dollars she made from selling sex to strangers, the prosecutors said.

On Tuesday, Ray, 60, once a close associate of former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik, was charged in a federal indictment in Manhattan with conspiracy, extortion, sex trafficking, forced labor and related charges. For eight years, through 2018, the indictment said, Ray “subjected the victims to sexual and psychological manipulation and physical abuse.”

“For the better part of the last 10 years, Ray has continued to mentally and physically torture his victims,” William F. Sweeney Jr., head of the FBI office in New York, said at a news conference Tuesday.

Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York, Nov. 8, 2018.

The charges depict Ray as a man who exploited his victims, initially college sophomores, like a cult leader, learning intimate details of their private lives and their mental health struggles under the pretense of helping them.

He alienated several of the young adults from their parents, convincing them that they were “ ‘broken’ and in need of fixing” by him, the indictment said.

“For so many of us and our children, college is supposed to be a time of self-discovery and newfound independence, a chance to explore and learn all within the safety of a college community,” Geoffrey S. Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said at the news conference announcing the charges.

Ray “exploited that vulnerable time in these victims’ lives through a course of conduct that shocks the conscience,” Berman said.

Ray’s extortion scheme relied on false confessions that he extracted from his victims, using tactics like sleep deprivation, psychological and sexual humiliation, verbal abuse, physical violence and threats of legal action, the indictment charged. He got them to falsely confess to damaging property, stealing from him and in some cases to trying to poison him, then used those confessions as leverage, the indictment said.

Ray was also accused of laundering about $1 million he obtained from his victims, the indictment said. He was arrested Tuesday morning at his home in Piscataway, New Jersey and was ordered jailed overnight after a brief hearing in Federal District Court. Ray was escorted into the courtroom smiling, dressed in a flannel shirt, cargo pants and work boots with his legs shackled.

The investigation that led to the charges against Ray was prompted by an article in New York magazine in April titled “The Stolen Kids of Sarah Lawrence,” Berman said at the news conference.

The startling accusations are all the more remarkable for the environment in which prosecutors say they first played out — the verdant Sarah Lawrence campus, where red brick buildings frame wide lawns and a wisteria arbor dominates the grounds.

Equally remarkable is Ray’s own strange history, a life where he seemed to seesaw between mob figures, on the one hand, and top law enforcement and military officials, on the other; he even has made claims, largely credited, that he worked for a United States intelligence agency in Kosovo.

He was an FBI informant in the late 1990s, dishing dirt about a Gambino crime family soldier, but his efforts to cooperate with the bureau failed, and he was later charged with more than a dozen other men in a federal racketeering and stock fraud case in Brooklyn.

Perhaps the most unusual public episode in Ray’s career came in 1997 when he arranged a City Hall meeting for Mayor Rudy Giuliani with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

Earlier in the 1990s, Ray became close to Kerik, whom Giuliani had appointed as New York’s City’s correction commissioner and later named the police commissioner.

Ray was the best man at Kerik’s wedding and paid for part of the celebration; a short while later, Kerik helped Ray get a $100,000-a-year job with a construction company, Interstate Industrial Corp. Part of Ray’s responsibility was to help the business get a license from city regulators, despite allegations it was tied to organized crime.

But Ray and Kerik had a falling out in 2000, around the time of the racketeering indictment, and Ray began cooperating with prosecutors investigating Kerik, who ultimately pleaded guilty, first to state and then later to federal charges stemming from the renovations and his efforts on behalf of Interstate.

In the New York magazine article, Kerik was quoted as saying: “Larry Ray is a psychotic con man who has victimized every friend he’s ever had. It’s been close to 20 years since I last heard from him, yet his reign of terror continues.”

Sarah Lawrence said in a statement that the school had just learned of Ray’s indictment and called the charges “serious, wide-ranging, disturbing and upsetting.” The school said it would cooperate with investigators if asked.

Ray later served time in a New Jersey state prison on charges stemming from a child custody dispute. It was after his release in New Jersey that Ray moved in with his daughter in student housing at Sarah Lawrence.

During the months he spent living at the school, Ray “laid the groundwork for psychological conditioning that would eventually lead these young adults to become unwitting victims of sexual exploitation, verbal and physical abuse, extortion, forced labor and prostitution,” Sweeney said.

In the summer of 2011, the indictment said, some of the Sarah Lawrence students moved with Ray into a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he continued to exploit them.

The indictment also charged that Ray subjected his daughter’s friends to interrogation sessions that often lasted hours at a time and escalated into verbal and physical abuse. He would falsely accuse them of damaging his apartment and property and of lying about him and his family, the indictment said.

Around 2013, the indictment said, Ray took some of his victims to Pinehurst, North Carolina, where he forced them to perform manual labor on his family’s property, including the installation of an irrigation system, purportedly to repay money he claimed they owed him.

He forced one woman to work as a prostitute from 2014 to 2018, and took more than $500,000 from the money she earned, authorities said. Ray was also physically violent with her and once tied her to a chair, placed a plastic bag over her head and nearly suffocated her, the indictment charged.

The indictment also said that Ray extorted $1 million from five of his victims, which he shared with two unidentified associates who helped him collect the money. “Some victims drained hundreds of thousands of dollars from their parents’ savings accounts at Ray’s direction,” Berman said.

On the college campus Tuesday, a number of students said they had been aware of the New York magazine article and felt relief at Ray’s arrest. But they expressed concern his actions had evaded the attention of authorities for so long.

“It’s pretty shocking that it’s taken 10 years to get this guy charged,” said Wyatt Button, 20, a sophomore who is studying film.

Audrey McGonagle, 18, a freshman studying dance, said that although Ray’s stay on campus was some years ago, she felt uncomfortable when she visited the dorm, Slomin 9, where Ray had installed himself with his daughter and her friends.

“It’s just creepy,” McGonagle said.",JustBadNews,0
I stumbled across a huge Airbnb scam that's taking over London,http://wired.co.uk/article/airbnb-scam-london,"It’s November 2019 and I’m standing in an Airbnb in Battersea, south London. But this is not the Airbnb I booked. Everything is slightly, confusingly, off. All the rooms are the wrong sizes, all the furniture in the wrong places. There are hints everywhere that something is up: the apartment block, a barely finished newbuild sandwiched between Battersea Park station and a Catholic church, is teeming with cleaning staff. There are cleaners in the hallways, cleaners lobbing bin bags of rubbish out of the front door, cleaners grabbing armfuls of bed linen in the elevator. It’s like a hotel – except there’s no front desk, and the allegedly clean duvet on my bed has a human-sized, yellow sweat stain running down its centre.

“And for checking out...?” I ask the cleaner who has let me in, gesturing at the open door of my sparsely decorated apartment. “Just leave the key on the table and close the door,” she replies. “And it will lock behind me?” I ask. “No, you don’t need to lock it.” I raise an eyebrow, and she explains that one of the cleaning staff will come and collect the key straight after I leave. “So nobody lives here?” I say as she steps out of the open door. “No I don’t think so,” she replies, half-laughing.

I close the door, look around the apartment again and open the Airbnb app on my phone. “I’m a little confused,” I write to my host, who goes by the name Robert & Team. “The apartment I’m in right now isn’t the one I booked.” Within minutes, a reply: “Hi James, Hope all is well. Rest assured that you are at the apartment that you have booked through Airbnb.” I reply, explaining that this can’t be the case. In the photos on Airbnb, the kitchen had countertops on both sides. The kitchen I’m standing in has a countertop on one side only. There’s a hallway where there should be a solid wall. Heck, the whole lounge is completely the wrong shape. “Rest assured that you are at the correct property,” my host replies, before going silent.

That night, I knock on the doors of the other apartments in the building. At one, three men who have just arrived are trying to work out why there are only two beds when they had booked an apartment with three. As we speak, the cleaner who checked me into my apartment rushes past, her arms filled with fresh linen. At the door of the penthouse, a couple from Newcastle complain about the complete lack of pots and pans in their kitchen. Standing at the open door, I notice something: the artwork on the walls is the same as in my apartment, so are the sofas, table and chairs. At the door of the apartment I had actually booked through Airbnb, the woman staying there explains she is also in the wrong listing. I return to my apartment, open my laptop and click on my host’s Airbnb profile. I count seven listings for the building I’m staying in, all with identical furniture, all with the same bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne. I flick back and forth between the listings on Airbnb, the bottle of champagne following me, mockingly. Who or what, I wonder, is Robert & Team?

On Airbnb, it turns out, scams aren’t just the preserve of lone chancers. As the short-term rental goldrush gathers pace, Airbnb empires are being rapidly scaled and monetised, with professional operators creating scores of fake accounts, fake listings and fake reviews to run rings around Airbnb, local law enforcement and the guests who place their trust in the platform. Reviews from guests paint a grim picture of people who have been tricked into staying in accommodation with blocked drains, broken fixtures and fittings, filthy floors, dirty bed linen – or, in some cases, accommodation that they simply did not book.

To squeeze every penny out of these inner-city goldmines, scammers have started outsourcing property management to ill-equipped call centres in the Philippines. The scammers call it “systemising”, a process of grabbing as many apartments as possible, filling them with identikit furniture, taking professional-looking photographs and then using every trick in the book to turn them into lucrative investments. Some of these tricks, though morally dubious, are perfectly legal. But others breach both Airbnb’s policies and local planning laws, while also putting the safety of guests at risk. As Vice found in October 2019, Airbnb is littered with fake and downright dodgy listings. But in London, where Airbnb enforces an annual 90-day limit on all “entire homes” listed on its platform, scammers have made a mockery of lax enforcement both by regulators and Airbnb itself, by turning entire new-build apartment blocks into de facto hotels designed for the short-term rental market. And the problem is far worse than anyone realises.

My Airbnb host, Robert & Team, started out life on another Airbnb account, currently using the name Leon. Today, Leon claims to be a 30-year-old dancer living in London, but in August 2012 he was a man called Christian living in Munich. “My girlfriend and I stayed in Christian’s room for quite a few weeks,” reads a review from a man called Gary. “Christian was a great host and even though he was staying elsewhere (since the room you stay in was his own), he still came back to check we were OK.” Christian was equally pleased with his choice of guest. “Gary and his girlfriend were wonderful guests,” he wrote. “They took great care of my apartment, have always stayed in good contact with me and looked after my cat very well when I did not have time.” The story of my host, I would come to realise, was also the story of Airbnb. From sharing economy dream to scam economy nightmare. From renting out his own room in Munich, to turning a south London apartment block into a hotel, hiding in plain sight on Airbnb.

It was in November 2016 that Christian suddenly became Leon. And then things started getting weird. A month later a man called Peter from Horsham left Leon a glowing review. “I had an amazing experience, the flat is in immaculate conditions,” Peter wrote. A reverse image search of Peter’s Airbnb profile picture shows that it is, in fact, a misappropriated photo of Pietro Labriola, chief executive of Brazilian wireless carrier TIM Participacoes. And Peter has left a lot of very nice reviews of Leon’s Airbnb listings. In January 2017, Peter was back, this time praising one of Leon’s listings in London for being “very nice”, adding that the “hosts was very nice and responsive to all request”.

It wasn’t just Leon’s listings that Peter loved. In November 2017, he reviewed a listing from my Airbnb host, Robert & Team, near London’s Borough Market. “Magnificent!” he wrote. “I enjoyed the stay and it was excellent positioned for my points of interest,” he enthused. Peter’s Airbnb profile has since been deleted. Earlier that month, an Airbnb user called Elaine was equally impressed: “I am 150% satisfied! this place is even better than i expected!” Unlike Peter, Elaine’s Airbnb profile is still active and shows that she has been reviewed by just two Airbnb hosts: Robert & Team and Leon. Both left exactly the same review: “A perfetc guest, very reliable and nice. Highly recomend! Would be happy to host again!!” That exact same review was also left by Leon for an Airbnb user called Alex, who back in 2017 was known as Elena.

Alex Cosmin also loves one of Leon’s listings. ""I highly recommend Leon’s place,"" he wrote in October 2018. His Airbnb profile shows that he has also stayed at another listing run by Leon, two run by Robert & Team and one run by a host called Elaine & Team. All these host profiles have a few things in common: they all use stock photography as their profile pictures, and they all use similar text in their bios. Before long, a network of connected host accounts emerges. As well as Robert & Team, Leon and Elaine & Team, there’s also Eveline, Natalia, Felly, Robert Lusso Management and Alex. Airbnb listings hosted by these accounts are littered with fake reviews. As well as Peter, Elaine and Alex Cosmin (whose profile picture has actually been misappropriated from the casting page of a model called Alexandru Mitrache, and who also appears on LinkedIn as a “Guest Service Agent” at a company called CB Platinum Apartments), there’s Florica (who appears on LinkedIn as “General Operations Manager” at CB Platinum), Igor, Anton, Нина and Julliana. These accounts have only booked themselves into listings from the network of host accounts I had uncovered, and they all left glowing reviews. Between them, they have received over 2,100 reviews on 200 listings, most of them in London.

All of these accounts are essentially one person, or at least one company. And yet they have all passed Airbnb’s account verification and safety processes, with most supplying government identification, selfies, email addresses and phone numbers. Two of these accounts, though, are more closely connected than the rest: Leon and Robert Lusso Management. And that’s because they both used to be called Christian.

Robert Lusso Management (lusso being Italian for luxury) joined Airbnb in 2016. His first review from an Airbnb host was in September of that year. “Christian was a great guest. I would recommend him to all hosts,” reads the review from Elaine & Team. A month later, Robert Lusso Management, né Christian, stayed at another of Elaine’s listings (“Great guest. I would fully recommend christian to stay !”). He then stayed with a lady called Karen (“Charming couple a pleasure to host. Even my dogs loved them.”), before staying with Robert & Team (“Christian was a great guest. All easy and smooth.”) and then Leon (“I HIGHLY recommend Christian as a guest for airbnb.”). Then, in February 2017, Christian becomes Robert. “Rob is an amazing guest,” reads a review from Elaine & Team, which is followed by three reviews from Robert & Team. The first review for a listing hosted by Robert & Team is also from Robert Lusso Management. “To be honest it was hard to leave the house today. I would like to stay there! I will come back - for sure!” Robert Lusso Management wrote in October 2016 about his stay in a now-deleted Airbnb listing.

Among a sea of Airbnb profiles, one thing seems clear: whoever is behind this is probably called Christian. Or Robert. I scroll through my inbox, remembering that when I booked my Airbnb I had been spammed with emails from a management company. That company, Continental Apartments, had offered to upsell me, among other things, a portable air conditioner (from £15), an additional set of linen (from £35), a highchair (from £16.67), an airbed (from £127.78) and a London Cheese Experience (from £25). A company number listed on the website of Continental Apartments (which is embellished with reviews from delighted clients – Lance K, Annie G, Joel S, Marcellus N – the profile pictures of whom have all been taken from stock photo libraries) leads to a firm called Lusso Management, which was founded in May 2018 by a German man called Christian Robert Baumann.

I had, finally, found my Christian. And my Robert. But I’d also found something else. A scam, co-ordinated across a number of Airbnb accounts, encompassing hundreds of listings and thousands of reviews. Many of the reviews and host profiles are fake or misleading, and, in some cases, the properties listed don’t exist. In one instance, pictures on a listing in London Bridge are mirrored versions of the pictures used on another. The bottle of wine on the counter, the microwave and the washing machine are all, curiously, backwards. Two other listings, which appear to be from the same building, again use the mirroring trick to flip the lounge, bedroom and kitchen.

And, at its centre, is the scam’s crowning glory: what has materialised into a secret hotel built for short-term rentals. That building, planning documents reveal, has 24 units. When I look on Airbnb, I find 28 listings, each a confusing hodgepodge of all the others – the pictures, descriptions and property names (Ideal Penthouse+Private Terrace next2 Chelsea9859, Luxurious&Spacious 2bed Penthouse in Battersea9858, Mesmerizing 2bed Apartment in Battersea 9879) blending into one. Some of these apartments don’t exist. When I had booked my night in Battersea I had simply been chucked in any available apartment, likely to help the hosts max out the building’s occupancy rate and dodge around London’s 90-day law.

Continental Apartments also lists its properties on other short-term rental sites. The entire building in Battersea appears twice on Booking.com (though one of these listings is no longer active), once on Expedia, and a single apartment is listed on Vrbo. In total, Continental Apartments has 61 properties on Booking.com and dozens on Expedia. Many of the company’s listings on Booking.com and Expedia are the same as those listed on Airbnb. London’s 90-day rule applies across all platforms, but there’s little to stop hosts from listing the same properties multiple times.

Duplicate listings are not allowed on Airbnb. Nor are fake listings for apartments that don’t exist. Airbnb hosts are also not allowed to delete and re-list properties after they attract too many negative reviews. Nor are individual accounts or groups of accounts allowed to engage in potentially fraudulent activity. The accounts I had uncovered were seemingly in breach of all of these Airbnb terms and had been for a number of years. But, as I dug deeper, things got stranger still.

Two Airbnb listings use the same images but mirror them so they appear different. Here, the kitchen on the right is backwards Airbnb/WIRED

On LinkedIn, Christian Baumann describes himself as an “incredible driven individual”. In November 2014, he founded London CBP, which, according to the company’s website and LinkedIn page, worked with investors and local councils to “provide short term, long term and emergency accommodation to Councils and Housing Associations in the UK”. In April 2018, Baumann shifted his attention to the far more lucrative Airbnb short-term rental market. His LinkedIn page boasts “up to 300%” better return on investment from listing on Airbnb compared with long-term lettings. Records held by Companies House give Baumann’s address – and the address of Continental Apartments – as a Regus virtual office near London Bridge. On other entries, Baumann’s address is listed as a flat near Farringdon. A Google search for the address brings up a short-term rental listing. The photos bear a striking resemblance to one of the Airbnb listings hosted by Elaine & Team, with the layout of the flat, the artwork on the walls and the decor matching almost perfectly.

In an attempt to find out more about my Airbnb booking, I call up a London number listed on the Continental Apartments website, which redirects me to a call centre where a distant-sounding voice with a nondescript North American accent asks how they can help. I hang up and call the UK mobile phone number listed on my Airbnb booking. I get through to the same call centre. The same operative picks up. I ask where they are from. “I’m not allowed to disclose that information,” the operative, who gives her name as Lovely, tells me. Lovely, though, is able to read the Airbnb messages I exchanged with Robert & Team. I ask to speak to Robert, saying I have a complaint about the Airbnb listing I stayed in recently. Lovely says she can message “the team” and let them know we’ve spoken. “I’ll tell them that you called so Robert can speak to you,” she says, before hanging up on me mid-sentence.

I call another number, this one listed on the website of CB Platinum (the CB presumably standing for Christian Baumann), another name used for Continental Apartments but actually the same company. A slightly different automated message plays and, once again, Lovely picks up the phone. I say hello, and she immediately hangs up. I call another number listed for CB Platinum. Again I get through to Lovely. Before she can hang up I ask, again, to speak to Robert. “You’ll have to wait ten minutes because he’s not here yet,"" she says, brusquely. I’m put on hold, and after ten minutes she hangs up on me again. I call again. Lovely picks up again. When I suggest that, perhaps, Robert doesn’t exist, Lovely gets angry. “He does exist! How could you suggest he doesn’t exist?!” she says. “I’m looking for someone to speak to you since Robert isn’t here.” She puts me on hold for ten minutes and then tells me to hang up so someone can call me back.

Seconds later, much to my surprise, my mobile phone rings. I had called Lovely from a different line and had never given her my mobile number. When I ask who I’m speaking to, the man, who also has a nondescript North American accent, gives his name as Russell. “So you’re not Robert?” I ask. There is a long pause. “I don’t think we have anybody by that name,” Russell replies, before explaining that he’s a senior customer relations manager and that he’d like to help me. I explain that I was put in a listing that I did not book. “But it’s the same location,” Russell says after checking the details of my booking. “There are a lot of apartments that we have in Battersea,” he adds.

Russell explains that the company I booked through has a call centre in the Philippines. When I ask where he is, he tells me he’s from “the London team”. When I ask him if he’s actually in London, he dodges the question. When I ask him what the time is in London, there’s a long, awkward pause. ""You are speaking to someone who is part of our team,” he says. He offers me a five per cent discount on any future booking made with the company – a tactic I’ve seen used countless times in responses to negative reviews for Airbnb listings from Continental Apartments. I ask him, if Robert doesn’t exist, who I was exchanging messages with on Airbnb. “Based on what I’m seeing, you were speaking to two different people,” he explains. I ask him, again, if he’s actually in London. We’ve been on the phone for almost an hour, and Russell, though patient, is starting to sound annoyed. “I’m not going to do that because now I don’t know if you are who you say you are,” he says.

Some days later, I phone Continental Apartments again and explain that I am a journalist and need to speak to Baumann. The Filipino operative hangs up on me and blocks my number. I try again from a different line and the same happens. I try a third time and am blocked again. I send an email to CB Platinum asking to speak to Baumann and never receive a reply. I add Baumann on Facebook and LinkedIn – he either doesn’t see my requests or ignores them.

Leon's profile as it appeared on Airbnb. Until November 2016 the account used the name Christian Airbnb/WIRED

It’s at this point that I discover a link to the Catholic Church. In July 2015, the Southwark Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation sold a 250-year lease for a sliver of land to PE Mount Carmel, a partnership between property developer Portchester Estates and Glyn Watkin Jones, the chairman of one of Britain’s largest construction firms. In late 2017, planning permission was approved for the construction of 24 residential units – a mix of one-and two-bed apartments in a yellow-brick building with a distinctive, steep-pitched roof. A local residents group protested about the lack of affordable housing in the development, but these complaints were dismissed by planning officers because of the building’s location. The church saw the project as a great boon. “A new development on parish land will fund much needed facilities for our parish,” read an update posted on its website.

During construction, a hoarding outside the site teased, “Coming Soon Luxury Apartments”. An artist’s impression of the building shows it brimming with life, with people relaxing on its sun-drenched balconies and walking through its wisteria-draped grounds. Work was completed in the spring of 2019, after which PE Mount Carmel leased all 24 units in the building to Urban Stay, a serviced accommodation company. And Urban Stay handed over the management of these units to Christian Baumann. Could it be that the building in Battersea that I booked through Airbnb was being used for a single, rather more dubious purpose – to make a killing off short-term rentals?

When I phone the Archdiocese of Southwark, which runs the church that owns the land on which apartments were built, I’m put through to Chris Millington, the church’s property manager. He explains that the diocese hoped to have transferred the freehold to the developer some time ago. This, he explains, would have removed the church from documents relating to the land. But delays in the construction process, and other problems, meant the church still owned the land. Millington described the church’s continued presence on the land registry documents as “quite annoying”. When I explain that the building is being run as a de facto Airbnb hotel, he says my findings are “interesting”. But, he says, with the impending transfer of the freehold, the church will soon be out of the picture. “Making sure that planning is at it should be is not our responsibility,” he adds. Nevertheless, he refers to the situation as “a very complicated story”.

That story is further complicated when I speak to James Swift, co-founder of Urban Stay, the firm that has a five-year lease on the 24 apartments in Battersea. Swift explains that his company has “zero involvement” in the building, and that management of it has been assigned to “another company”, which he refuses to name. When I ask if the apartments in the building should be listed on Airbnb, he sounds confused. “We don’t list anything on Airbnb or anything like that. We have direct relationships with companies and relocation companies. Those are our clients.” (I would later find an Airbnb profile for Urban Stay, which has 28 listings. Swift did not respond to subsequent questions about his Airbnb profile.)

When I explain that I have stayed in the building for one night and booked my stay through Airbnb, there is a long pause. “Really?” Swift replies. “The understanding I have with them is that this is not allowed. I need to find out what’s going on. I’m a little bit surprised,” he says. I again ask him to share the name of the management company running the building, and again he refuses. When I explain the full scope of the scam – the duplicate listings, the fake reviews, the call centre customer service – Swift says he is “absolutely shocked”, adding that this would likely be a breach of his agreement with the management company. When I ask if the names Christian Baumann, CB Platinum or Continental Apartments ring a bell, Swift sighs. “Yes,” he says, before reluctantly confirming that the management company is CB Platinum, and the man he has been dealing with is Baumann. In a follow-up email, I send Swift links to the 28 Airbnb listings created by Baumann’s company. I also ask him to share any contact details he has for Baumann. Swift never replies, and the listings are not deleted.

Another Airbnb listing managed by CB Platinum that uses the mirrored-image trick. Such tactics can be used to make short-term London rentals available for longer than the 90-day limit Airbnb/WIRED

When Baumann founded Lusso Management in May 2018 he wasn’t working alone. In fact, Baumann resigned as director in September of that year and was replaced by a man called Alex Milburn, who had previously been company secretary. (The pair also founded a company called World Short Stay in February 2018, which has a number of listings that have since been rebranded under the name Continental Apartments. Records held by Companies House show that accounts for World Short Stay are overdue and that the company may soon be struck off the register.) Millburn, like Baumann, is behind a smattering of property investment firms. But unlike Baumann, who has next to no online profile, Milburn sees himself as something of a property investment celebrity. He stars in YouTube videos where he explains how, “with very little, or none of your own money, you can create a six figure income” using his genius property investment strategy.

His strategy is this: take out a small loan, or use your own money, to negotiate deals with landlords that guarantee them market rent for, say, three years. Then, rather than renting properties out to long-term tenants, you kit them out with “hotel-like amenities”, list them on Airbnb and Booking.com “and charge a higher nightly rate”. The profit, Milburn explains, is yours to keep. According to some estimates, the yield someone can make from listing a property on Airbnb is between three and five times what they would receive from a long-term tenant.

Milburn is also behind the Serviced Accommodation Specialist Club, where he offers one-on-one mentorship classes priced at £1,100 per day, or two-day group courses for £1,598. The courses, according to the company’s website, reveal how to “outsource, systemise and automate every aspect” of running a serviced accommodation, or short-term rental, business. When I speak to Milburn on the phone, posing as a potential client for his mentorship scheme, he explains that barriers such as London’s 90-day rule are of little concern. “These big, multi-billion pound companies, they just ignore this [London] 90-day rule because it’s basically impossible for the authorities to police,” he says. “Think about it – without standing outside an apartment and ticking off each day that someone’s stayed, it’s impossible for the authorities to police the rule. That’s why everyone just ignores it, basically.”

And the process of getting around any enforcement, Milburn explains, is laughably easy. “You get three months through Booking.com, three months through Airbnb, three months through Expedia, and three months through direct bookings,” Milburn says. In London, it is against the law to rent out homes on a short-term basis for more than 90 days a year, regardless of the platform they are listed on. On Airbnb, once a London listing reaches 90 days it cannot be booked. But Milburn explains the law – and Airbnb’s systems – are easy to dodge if you know how. “There are certain ways round it, but that comes down to industry knowledge and tricks of the trade,” he teases. “You’ve just got to know how and when to get around it.” I ask what one of those tricks might be. “Some people have two Airbnb accounts,” Milburn explains. Or, in the case of the scam I’m following, more than a dozen. Milburn tells me that he has “quite a lot of units in London”.

But some of what Milburn details is simply sharp practice, rather than a breach of the law. He describes the serviced accommodation business as “fast paced” and “sexy” and says that he has never set foot in many of the properties in his portfolio, with their management handled by a team of contractors based in the Philippines who work full-time and are paid £100 a week. “Once it’s all set up and in place – and you know where to find these Filipino workers, how to train them, all this sort of stuff – that’s when you can set things in motion and step back.” One Airbnb listing managed by Elaine & Team, an account used by Baumann’s company, includes images watermarked with Lusso Management’s logo. The listing is also in Sheffield, where Milburn is based. Two listings on Milburn’s own Airbnb host profile are co-hosted by Felly and Leon, two of the profiles with links to Baumann.

On his Facebook and LinkedIn pages, Milburn evangelises about his property investment strategy and posts photos of himself driving luxury cars and working topless beside sun-drenched swimming pools. Referring to the use of duplicate listings to get around London’s 90-day rule, I ask him if he’s worried about getting caught by either Airbnb or local councils. “The councils have tried,” he says. “But I think there are 54,000 serviced apartments in Greater London. Even if there were [only] 5,000 they wouldn’t have the resources to be able to manage it, so that’s not a big worry for me,” he says. “Serviced accommodation is completely unregulated, almost. It’s unbelievably unregulated.”

My experience backs that up. After I spent the night in the de facto Airbnb hotel in Battersea I reported the building to Edward Appah, a senior planning enforcement officer at Wandsworth Council. An investigation was launched, but, after seeing tenancy agreements for the flats, all of which exceeded six months, the council ruled that all the units remained “in lawful use” and that “no breach of planning control [had] occurred”. I sent Appah links to several Airbnb listings for apartments in the building – many of which had several recent guest reviews – and asked him how the units could have both long-term tenants and be advertised as available to rent on Airbnb. “The management agents have informed me that they have not placed the advertisement and were not aware of it until I brought it to their attention,” Appah wrote in an emailed reply. “I have suggested to them to investigate it and ensure that they are removed in order to prevent any confusion in future.” Many of the listings were deleted only to appear again a short while later on different Airbnb accounts, complete with different titles, descriptions and photos.

Claire Fallows, a partner at legal firm Charles Russell Speechlys, specialises in planning law and describes this decision as “interesting”. While not wishing to comment in detail on a specific case, Fallows tells me that any planning enforcement decision is down to an “interpretation” of the evidence available. “It sounds like there are flagrant breaches of planning control going on and so the question is getting the authorities to do something about it,” she says. “There is the 90-day letting limit, which does provide some degree of clarity in London, but if it’s not being enforced, then clearly that does give cause for concern where there have been flagrant breaches of it.” When I ask, based on the details I have given her, how serious such a breach might be, Fallows says it “does seem extreme”.

A review left by Zoë Buckman, an artist and photographer married to Friends star David Schwimmer. “This place is unsafe!” she wrote in January of this year Airbnb/WIRED

Then, out of nowhere, David Schwimmer’s wife gets involved. Zoë Buckman, the British artist and photographer who has been married to the Friends star since 2010, stayed in one of Robert & Team’s listings in London in January of this year. “This place is unsafe!” Buckman, who confirmed via email that the Airbnb account was hers, wrote in her review of a two-bedroom apartment near London’s Liverpool Street. “Me and my 8 year old daughter experienced violence and harassment from a man on the ground floor, and the hosts did nothing to help protect us. We fled because of the threats and they refused to refund us,” the review continues. “The apartment smells horrible and the common areas are a total mess, but ultimately it’s a dangerous environment and women and children should not go any where near it. Do not expect any understanding or care from the hosts.” Buckman did not respond to a request to comment further on her review. But her poor experience is just one of many.

While a lot of reviews for Airbnb listings managed by Continental Apartments and CB Platinum are positive – guests are often delighted by the locations of such apartments, many of which are right in the centre of London – there’s a drip feed of concerningly negative reviews. A review of a listing managed by Robert & Team left by Claire in February 2017 is fairly typical. She complains that the windows in the apartment did not close, that the electricity went off for a whole day because nobody had paid the bills, and that one of the toilets was blocked. But none of these comments relate to the Airbnb Claire actually booked. “As we couldn’t stay in the place chosen initially, we stayed in Islington,” she writes. “We had agreed on a discount for the disagreement. The team accused us of blocking the toilet and refused to refund any money. I just think this team cannot be trusted.”

Other guests of Robert & Team claim that they were asked to lie to anyone in the building who asked who they were. Others say they were sent messages encouraging them to leave five-star reviews in exchange for a 15 per cent discount on future bookings. Others complain of convoluted check-in processes, non-existent blinds at bedroom windows, broken furniture, terrible smells and non-responsive hosts. One review of Robert & Team, left by Ahmed in October 2019, claims that the host subjected their guests to racist abuse. “Said we had knives with us because of our race,” he wrote. A response from Robert & Team claims Ahmed “partied inside the listing”, adding that “every host should be aware of this guest and think a lot of times before allowing him to stay at your place”.

Lea, who stayed in a Robert & Team Airbnb listing in August 2019, opens her review by explaining she is rating it “one star only because zero stars isn’t an option”. She complains of a filthy apartment, with “dog hair and human hair everywhere, dirty bathrooms, dirty floors, and three bales of stinking wet towels and linens from previous tenants stuffed under the couch where we were supposed to be sleeping.” Lea also writes that the kitchen sink wouldn’t drain and that one of the showers was broken. “We waited around all afternoon on our first day in London for maintenance, but no one ever came despite my repeated inquiries. Each day of our stay we were told that maintenance would come, but they never did.” Towards the end of their stay, the other shower broke.

In September 2019, Brandi, whose Airbnb profile says she is from North Carolina, booked her and her husband into an Airbnb listing managed by Robert & Team as part of their honeymoon in London. “We were sorely dissatisfied,” her review reads. “The entire apartment looks as if someone had just vacated the unit and this property manager threw in some cheap furniture to rent it out.” She adds that the sheets were so filthy they were unable to sleep under them. When she complained, the host failed to provide clean linen. “Overall, this was a terrible experience, we canceled the rest of our trip and booked a new AirBnB.”

Other guests complain of being unable to find lockboxes to gain access to the apartment they booked, leaving them stranded on the streets of London in the middle of the night with a host who won’t respond. Others claim they were cancelled on at the last minute. “They’ve cancelled the booking less than 24 hour prior arrival during the night. I woke up finding out we had to flight to London in few hours with not place where to stay. Outrageous,” reads a review left by Allesandra in September 2019. Last year, Robert & Team received 26 similarly negative reviews.

When I alert Airbnb to the scam, it suspends all listings and host accounts linked to Baumann and Continental Apartments. “We have zero tolerance for any attempt to evade our systems,” a spokesperson says, adding that such issues are “extremely rare”. But measuring the scale of this problem is impossible. Following the Vice exposé of scam listings in the United States, Airbnb said it would review every single listing and host on its platform. In an email titled “In The Business Of Trust” that was sent to employees and later published on its website, Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said that all listings and hosts would be verified for accuracy and quality standards. What’s left behind, given Airbnb’s pledge to take the matter seriously, may be a very different service indeed: more spare rooms and real homes, and fewer high-yield investment opportunities filled with identikit furniture.

It won’t be an easy task. Take London as an example. Research by London Councils, a body that represents local authorities in the capital, found that one in every 50 homes in the city are listed on platforms such as Airbnb. Across all 32 London boroughs and the City of London there were 73,549 entire homes listed on online platforms in December 2019 alone. Globally, Airbnb has more than seven million listings, a huge network built almost entirely on the flimsy notion of trust.

According to Inside Airbnb, a service that scrapes Airbnb to shine a light on the platform’s impact on cities around the world, there are an estimated 36,964 listings on Airbnb in London that are listed by a host with at least one other listing. While Airbnb presents itself as a sharing economy company, the business of hosting is becoming increasingly systemised and professionalised, with critics arguing that businesses are able to make huge sums of money at the expense of local residents who are unable to access properties locked away by the short-term rental gold rush.

So what, if anything, can be done about it? To date, attempts to adequately regulate and police Airbnb listings have been spasmodic at best, leading to a patchwork of confusing, siloed approaches. In December 2019, more concerted regulation efforts were dealt a blow when the European Court of Justice ruled that Airbnb was an “information society service”, not a real estate agency. Such rulings mean that cities must continue to act alone – with mixed success.

Darren Rodwell, London Councils’ executive member for housing and planning, says the capital’s short-term rental market is “utterly out of control” and that the situation is creating “drastic implications” for housing stock. “It’s hugely concerning to hear about the scams taking place,” he says. Against the sheer number of rogue listings, he argues, officials are fighting a losing battle. Rodwell believes it is now essential that the government legislate to create a “mandatory registration scheme” for short-term rentals.

Academics and planning experts say that having access to this data would, at the very least, make it possible for officials to know what properties are being rented out short term, by whom and for how many days a year. At present, Rodwell says, the law in the UK “isn’t fit for purpose”. As a result, the city’s councils are fighting an increasingly difficult battle with rapidly decreasing resources. Since 2010, they have had their budgets cut by 63 per cent. Against tens of thousands of short-term rental listings, London’s boroughs have just a handful of planning officers working on enforcement.

One academic specialising in urban planning, who does not want to be named, says that large-scale abuse of Airbnb’s policies – and local planning laws – is alarmingly common. “Entire buildings have been turned into de facto hotels,” the academic explains. “We’ve heard stories of local investors, sometimes foreign investors, coming in and buying an entire building, throwing out the remaining tenants, sometimes through intimidation, doing up properties and turning the whole building into holiday flats.” The academic says they have seen instances of this in Amsterdam, Barcelona and Lisbon. They describe the scam I have uncovered in London as among “the most elaborate” they have heard of.

The key issue for regulators, the academic explains, is Airbnb’s refusal to open up its platform to scrutiny. Echoing Rodwell’s call for some form of short-term rental registration system, the academic says that without access to data nothing will change. And access to data will only come about, they argue, once we have better laws to govern companies like Airbnb. “It’s the data that you need to govern the city, to regulate, to do urban planning. And Airbnb refuses to give this data, which makes it impossible for policymakers to effectively measure and monitor the phenomenon, let alone regulate it.” An Airbnb spokesperson says the company has previously backed calls from the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to create such a system.

That lack of transparency is giving scammers a place to hide and prosper. Yet, for many, this is what Airbnb has become: a thin sharing-economy veneer hiding a vast slurry of unscrupulous profiteers. In Toronto, they call them “ghost hotels”; in Prague, they are “distributed hotels”; in the industry they are known as “systemised” Airbnb listings. But to Airbnb, they are homes – a chance to stay in “unique, authentic places” on a platform “powered by local hosts”. Airbnb claims that it “promotes people-to-people connection, community and trust”, but, after months of trying, the only people-to-people connection I’ve found involves being lied to and then hung up on by call centre workers in the Philippines.

Then, days before this story is due to be published, Baumann accepts my LinkedIn invitation. I send him a message, which he sees but doesn’t reply to. But being connected on LinkedIn lets you see the other person’s contact details. I send Baumann an email, telling him I would like to ask him some questions. He replies, saying he is currently traveling and will respond to my email as soon as he gets it. I send a long list of questions. Baumann doesn’t respond. In his email signature are two phone numbers. I call a London number and select an option to speak to property management. A man with a British accent picks up the phone. I say my name and he hangs up immediately. I call a second number, Baumann’s mobile, which goes straight to voicemail. Crackling down the phone line I, at last, hear his voice. “I’m sorry. I’m currently not available,” the prerecorded message tells me. Still yearning for a people-to-people connection, I ask Baumann to get back in touch with me. I am still waiting for his reply.

"Boris Johnson is deadly serious about building a 20 billion bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, which one engineer described as being 'as feasible as building a bridge to the moon",http://businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-northern-ireland-scotland-sea-bridge-plans-twenty-billion-2020-2,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pushing ahead with plans for a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.

The bridge would reportedly be constructed across the largest munitions dump in the world.

One retired offshore engineer in 2018 described the project as being ""as feasible as building a bridge to the moon"" adding that ""no sane contractor or responsible government"" would attempt it.

Sources inside Downing Street confirmed to Business Insider that Johnson remained personally committed to the project, despite doubts about its viability.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is deadly serious about building a bridge connecting Scotland with Northern Ireland and is preparing to give the project the green light.

The prime minister has previously said a bridge connecting the two countries across the North Channel would be a ""very good"" idea, despite warnings about cost and unexploded bombs dropped in the sea after World War II.

Now Johnson has instructed civil servants to look at how the project can be delivered and is awaiting an official assessment on whether it is feasible.

A representative for Johnson said on Monday that ""work is underway"" on the project, adding that ""it's an idea that the prime minister has expressed interest in in the past, and as he said at the time, 'Watch this space.'""

They added that government officials were carrying out a ""proper piece of work"" on the proposal.

Downing Street sources confirmed to Business Insider that Johnson remained personally committed to the project despite doubts about its viability expressed both inside and outside the government.

'As feasible as building a bridge to the moon'

Officials reportedly think the bridge could be based on the Oresund Bridge, which connects the Swedish city of Malmo with Amager, an island near Denmark's capital, Copenhagen.

Officials working on the plans have produced a route from Larne in Northern Ireland to Portpatrick in Scotland.

Reports have suggested that the construction would be part bridge and part tunnel, to avoid unexploded bombs in the water. Beaufort's Dyke, 7 miles off the Scottish coastal village of Portpatrick, is the site of tonnes of rockets, metal drums, and radioactive waste dumped there following World War II.

The project is estimated to cost about £20 billion, but costs could spiral because of the need for connecting infrastructure on either side of the bridge.

The UK Chamber of Shipping said that while it welcomed ""any initiative which seeks to improve trade and tourism links,"" Johnson's plan to build a bridge across the North Sea was ""unnecessary.""

A spokesperson said: ""There are already a range of ferry operators taking tourists and trade between Northern Ireland and Scotland.

""Spending £15 billion-£20 billion of taxpayers' money on a bridge simply to replicate what those ferries already do is unnecessary. The money could be far better spent improving road and rail links to our ports across the UK.""

Johnson first suggested the idea of a bridge across the Irish Sea when he was the foreign secretary in 2018. He has revived it since entering Downing Street as part of his plans for major infrastructure projects across the UK.

His proposal was, at the time, branded by one expert as a ""thoughtless soundbite"" that ""no sane contractor or responsible government"" would sanction.

Writing in a letter to The Sunday Times, James Duncan, a retired offshore engineer from Edinburgh, said the idea was ""about as feasible as building a bridge to the moon.""

""Many long bridges have been built, but none across such a wide, deep and stormy stretch of water,"" he continued.

""For a great part of the 22-mile route the water is more than 1,000ft deep. It would require about 30 support towers at least 1,400ft high to carry the road deck across the deepest part and above the shipping channel. In total the bridge would require 54 towers, of heights never achieved anywhere in the world.""",JustBadNews,0
China jails University of Minnesota student over tweets mocking President Xi Jinping,http://techspot.com/news/83701-china-jails-university-minnesota-student-over-tweets-mocking.html,"WTF?! It’s no secret that China’s government monitors its citizens’ online activities, even when they’re abroad, and those who step out of line face imprisonment. A University of Minnesota student discovered this after being arrested for tweets—posted while he was in the US—that mocked President Xi Jinping.

Axios reports that 20-year-old freshman Luo Daiqing was arrested in July last year when he returned to his hometown of Wuhan for the summer break. According to court documents seen by the publication, he was sentenced to six months in prison in November for using ""his Twitter account to post more than 40 comments denigrating a national leader's image and indecent pictures,"" which ""created a negative social impact."" The tweets were posted in September and October 2018, while he was studying at the University of Minnesota.

Axios found a now-deleted Twitter account belonging to Luo. It included Chinese government slogans posted over images of Lawrence Limburger, a name that may be familiar to fans of 1990s cartoon Biker Mice From Mars. The main villain from the show bears a resemblance to Xi. There were also retweets of Winnie the Pooh—a character that’s banned in China over comparisons to the president.

Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has called on China to release the student. ""This is what ruthless and paranoid totalitarianism looks like,"" he said.

Last year, it was reported that China’s government is detaining, interrogating, and threatening its citizens for posting anything considered inappropriate on Twitter. One user, activist Huang Chengcheng, was chained to a chair and questioned for eight hours. Once his ordeal was over, he had to sign a promise to stay off Twitter. While the platform is one of many western websites blocked by China’s Great Firewall, some residents use VPNs to circumvent the ban.

Update: According to The Star Tribune, Daiqing has now been released to his hometown of Wuhan, the city at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak no less.",JustBadNews,0
"Jeffrey Epstein suicide tape erased by ""technical errors""",http://bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-51053205,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jeffrey Epstein was charged with sexually abusing dozens of girls

Surveillance video from disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's first suspected suicide attempt was destroyed by accident, prosecutors say.

US prosecutors say the jail mistakenly saved footage from the wrong cell.

Epstein, a convicted sex offender, first tried to kill himself in July last year, then hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.

He had pleaded not guilty to abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14.

Soon after Epstein's death, in August, two of the CCTV cameras outside his cell had malfunctioned and were being examined by the FBI, US media reported.

Epstein was found semi-conscious in his prison cell with injuries to his neck on 25 July. After this incident, he was placed on suicide watch.

Eventually, Epstein was moved to a different cell, where he died on 10 August. Two prison guards have since been accused of failing to check on him during this time and falsifying records to say that they had.

There have been ongoing questions over the July recording, which was initially deemed missing and then was said to have been located by jail staff.

A letter filed by Assistant US Attorneys Jason Swergold and Maurene Comey said ""the footage contained on the preserved video was for the correct date and time, but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was located"", New York City media report.

Video caption Prince Andrew: ""I let the side down, simple as that""

""The requested video no longer exists on the backup system and has not since at least August 2019 as a result of technical errors.""

The request for the video was made by a lawyer for Nicholas Tartaglione, a former New York police officer who shared a cell with Epstein in July and is charged with homicide in an unrelated case.

The attorney argued the video could show his client had acted ""admirably"", possibly helping Epstein.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.

New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections.

He was often seen socialising with the rich and powerful, including US President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew.

Epstein was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002-05. He was arrested on 6 July.

He avoided similar charges in a controversial deal in 2008, pleading guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution.

Hong Kong police arrest 4 for 'money laundering' and freeze HK$70m used to support pro-democracy protesters,http://hongkongfp.com/2019/12/19/hong-kong-police-arrest-4-for-money-laundering-and-freeze-hk70m-used-to-support-pro-democracy-protesters/,"Four people were arrested on Thursday in relation to Spark Alliance, a non-profit group that raises money to provide financial aid to Hong Kong protesters.

Police arrested three men and one woman – aged between 17 and 50 – for alleged money laundering offences, and froze around HK$70 million in funds and insurance products. In response, Spark Alliance denied allegations of money laundering and said police were “smearing” them.

“We found these four arrested persons in connection with an organisation named Spark Alliance, which is a prominent online fundraising platform for the current civil unrest,” said Acting Senior Superintendent Chan Wai-kei of Financial Investigation Division of Narcotics Bureau.

Spark Alliance is one of the largest crowd-funded initiatives in support of pro-democracy protesters, with the money going towards living subsidies and covering legal and medical costs. The group is estimated to have collected about HK$80 million in the past six months, Chan added.

Police said the operation was based on “suspicious financial transactions” over the past six months conducted by a shell company, including large cash deposits and funds used to buy personal insurance products.

“They claim the funds will be used to support persons arrested in the civil unrest. However, we found a certain portion of money has been used to purchase personal insurance products, of which the amount is incommensurate with its beneficiary,” he said.

During the arrests on Thursday, officers also confiscated HK$130,000 in cash, 3,300 supermarket coupons worth HK$165,000, six arrows, two laser pointers and large amounts of protective gear.

Citing the weapons found, Chan said police “do not exclude the possibility” that the funding is being used as a “reward” to encourage teenagers to join the civil unrest.

Two of the arrested people worked as secretaries, one was a student and one was a human resources manager. Police said that one of the people arrested was the shareholder and director of the shell company.

While police made the arrests on suspicion of money laundering, Chan said those arrested may also have aided and abetted lawbreaking activities.

‘Inaccurate description’

In a statement on Thursday night, Spark Alliance condemned the police for smearing its reputation. It said that the arrested members have lawyer support, but cannot disclose further details as the case had entered legal proceedings.

“Police are trying to use inaccurate descriptions to say we have malicious purposes such as money laundering, in an attempt to smear Spark Alliance and other support channels,” the group wrote.

Last month, HSBC bank closed a corporate account used by Spark Alliance after finding its activities did not match the business purposes stated by the client.

Spark Alliance announced that its HSBC account would cease operations on November 21, and told its supporters to stop using bank transfers to donate money. It also said that its funds in the account had been properly dealt with, and that it would announce new channels for fundraising.

“This protest support platform will continue our work as usual, and will continue to support arrested and jailed comrades to the fullest,” it said in a post dated November 18.

The student, named as Mr Chow by police, remains in a serious condition in hospital.

Another activist, Mr Woo, 19, who was in the vicinity when the shooting occurred, has also been arrested for unlawful assembly, attempted robbery for allegedly trying to snatch an officer’s gun, and possession of offensive weapons, police confirmed.

There were stand-offs on Tuesday in several neighbourhoods throughout the financial hub, including in the central business district around lunchtime, where some office workers joined in demonstrations.

Activists again disrupted public transport, starting around 7am, purposefully targeting the city’s bustling morning commute hours by holding subway car doors open or hurling objects onto the tracks, including petrol bombs.

Hong Kong protester shot by police as clashes erupt citywide,http://edition-m.cnn.com/2019/11/10/asia/hong-kong-protester-shot-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) A man has been set on fire in Hong Kong only hours after a protester was shot by police with a live round, as the city experiences one of the most dramatic days in over five months of protests.

Protesters began disrupting transit as early as 7 a.m. local time as part of a day-long general strike, and clashed with police in several locations. In Sai Wan Ho, on eastern Hong Kong Island, a traffic police officer shot a 21-year-old protester in the torso.

The protester was in a critical condition on Monday morning, but by the afternoon, police said there was no immediate threat to his life. The shooting sparked public outrage, escalating what had already looked to be a long day of demonstrations.

In a separate incident, a man who confronted a group of pro-democracy protesters was doused in a flammable liquid and set alight, according to a graphic video seen by CNN and widely shared on social media. The video shows an unidentified and unarmed man shouting expletives at protesters before saying ""you're all not Chinese.""

The man is in hospital in a critical condition, the city's Hospital Authority told CNN. A Hong Kong police source said that they are investigating the incident which took place on Monday at the Ma On Shan subway station in the New Territories.

Skirmishes continued through the evening as protesters called for another round of demonstrations on Tuesday, according to flyers shared online.

Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam condemned the violent scenes, which injured 60 people, during a press conference on Monday evening.

She said the escalating unrest was bringing Hong Kong ""to the brink of no return"" and the government would not yield to protestors demands.

""If there is any wishful thinking that by escalating violence the (Hong Kong) government will yield to pressure to satisfy protesters' so-called demands, I'm making this clear that will not happen,"" she said.

The day saw protesters hurl petrol bombs, set fires, build barricades and disrupt transit in several locations, including the crucial cross-harbor tunnel that connects Hong Kong Island with Kowloon. In total, demonstrators vandalized or blocked roads in over 120 locations around the city, police said at a press conference on Monday afternoon.

""We appeal to everyone to please stay calm and rational,"" Tse Chun-Chung, Hong Kong Chief Superintendent of Police, said. ""Continuing this rampage is a lose-lose situation for Hong Kong -- everyone is a loser.""

Tse said a police officer has been suspended from front line service after driving a motorbike through a crowd of protesters in Kwai Fung, in the New Territories. But he said that while his officers were under great pressure, they were not out of control.

Office workers in the city's Central financial district have been sent home as riot police fired tear gas to disperse protesters. Video footage from the ground shows people rushing into a subway station to escape the gas, and a massive crowd chanting ""murder"" as they march past luxury fashion shops.

Several subway lines experienced minor to severe delays, with some stations closed and routes partially suspended ""due to an escalation of the situation in stations,"" according to the MTR subway operator. At least five universities have closed and canceled classes on Monday.

Protester shot

Monday's shooting occurred as police attempted to disperse protesters who had blocked roads in Sai Wan Ho, Tse said.

According to Tse, an officer was arresting a protester when another protester ran towards him. The officer pulled his gun, and then shot it, as he believed the protester would attempt to snatch his gun which could result in ""death and casualties,"" Tse said.

A video clip of the shooting shared online shows the traffic officer grappling with a protester. A second protester, dressed in black and wearing a face mask, approaches the scuffle, and the officer raises his gun.

The second protester appears to try and wave or slap the gun away, and the officer shoots him at close range, to screams from the surrounding crowd of protesters and passersby.

Several more protesters then grapple with the officer, and two more live rounds are fired off-camera.

Police officers have since cordoned off the area where the protester was shot.

In a statement , police responded to ""online rumors"" of reckless firearm use, calling the accusations ""totally false and malicious.""

""Police (have) strict guidelines and orders regarding the use of firearms,"" the statement said. ""All police officers are required to justify their enforcement actions.""

Protesters throw bricks in Wong Tai Sin district on November 11.

Five months of protests

The anti-government protests, which began in June in opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have dragged on for five months . The bill's withdrawal satisfied just one of the protesters' five major demands, which include an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality and wider democratic reforms.

In response to the demands, the government appointed a panel of overseas experts to assist Hong Kong's longstanding Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), which is conducting a fact-finding study into alleged police misconduct during the protests.

People run into a mall after police fired tear gas in the Central district of Hong Kong on November 11.

But on Saturday, one of the experts tweeted a copy of the panel's progress report, criticizing the IPCC's investigative capabilities, and saying it needed to ""substantially enhance its capacity"" to assess evidence from witnesses and assemble a coherent account of the facts.

The IPCC said it was ""disappointed"" that it was not consulted before one of the overseas experts made the progress report public. On Sunday, the Hong Kong government said the IPCC's study would be ""by no means a final report.""

This isn't the first time a protester has been shot -- police first used lethal force in October by firing a live shot and injuring an 18-year-old man.

But things kicked up a notch on the weekend, with raging protests fueled by anger over the death of a 22-year-old student

Chow Tsz-lok, a computer sciences student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), died on Friday morning, days after falling and suffering a severe head injury in a parking garage close to the scene of protests.

Chow had been in a coma and on life support until Friday. There is no indication that Chow was involved in the nearby protest the night of his injury.

Protesters and fellow students mourned his death throughout the weekend, with a vigil on Friday night and a memorial on Sunday. HKUST students left flowers and messages on Post-it notes on campus, and vigil attendees laid flowers and lit candles.

Chow's death also prompted an outpouring of anger from anti-government protesters, who claim that police actions on the night of the accident resulted in paramedics being temporarily unable to access him.

This anger spilled out during the weekend protests, with protesters on the streets shouting for ""revenge.""

Police expressed ""profound sadness"" over Chow's death, but have strenuously denied responsibility and maintained that at no point did officers obstruct ambulance or fire services from assisting him. A police statement released on November 5 described the allegations as ""certainly false.""

According to police, ambulance crews arrived at the scene on November 4 approximately 19 minutes after being called. Hong Kong's ambulances pledge to arrive at the scene of the incident within 12 minutes of a call.",JustBadNews,0
Man bites off ear of pro-democracy district councillor during brawl outside Hong Kong mall,http://hongkongfp.com/2019/11/03/man-bites-off-ear-pro-democracy-district-councillor-brawl-outside-hong-kong-mall/,"[Graphic pictures] A pro-democracy district councillor has had his ear bitten off by a man in Tai Koo moments after the attacker reportedly slashed several other people with a knife. The assailant was then beaten up by a crowd in retaliation.

Several sit-in protests occurred at shopping malls across the city on Sunday before riot police entered to disperse them.

At Cityplaza in Tai Koo, police stormed the mall early in the evening after the entrances of two restaurants were spray painted.

A police press release said officers attended to make arrests: “Police warn the masked rioters to stop all destructive and illegal acts and appeal to the protestors to stay rational and calm.”

Knifeman attack

Outside the mall, a Mandarin-speaking man in a grey shirt slashed several people with a knife, according to RTHK.

A crowd confronted him, including 34-year-old Democratic Party member Andrew Chiu who has represented the Tai Koo West constituency since 2008.

Chiu tried to grab the man to stop him from leaving. At around 7:30pm, he bit Chiu’s left ear off, which fell to the ground.

Onlookers helped put Chiu’s bitten off ear into a plastic bag as he bled.

Other people attempted to subdue the man, but he struggled. They punched and kicked the man in retaliation.

Five injured people, including one in serious condition, were rushed to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, according to a government spokesperson.

Outside the hospital, Democratic Party lawmaker James To said Chiu was undergoing emergency treatment.

“We don’t know if his ear can be connected again,” he said.

Photo: Stand News.

To said Chiu was urging residents to go home, as not to risk attack: “He was worried that police may use violence at residents,” To said.

Protests first sparked by the now withdrawn extradition law have continued since June. They have evolved into sometimes violent displays of dissent against police action, calls for democracy, and anger over Beijing’s encroachment.

Chiu is running in the District Council election’s Tai Koo Shing West constituency. Kacee Ting of the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong is also running.

Trump's Betrayal of the Kurds May Be the Dumbest Move of His Presidency,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/trump-abandon-kurds-in-syria-turkey-invasion-stupid.html,"Let’s dispense with this fiction that Donald Trump knows what he’s doing. Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images

A few long years ago, Donald Trump overcame 16 other Republican candidates — and the unified opposition of the GOP Establishment — to win his party’s nomination. He then overcame the most well-funded presidential candidate in history, and the unified opposition of respectable Beltway elites, to win a lease on the White House.

These events gave a lot of people a strong incentive to view the mogul as a political savant. After all, if Trump were merely who he appeared to be — a pathological narcissist acting on a combination of pure impulse and the banal insight that a lot of GOP primary voters dislike immigrants — what would that say about the competence of those who failed to stop him? Surely, for all his eccentricities and liabilities, the man was a savvier tactician than he let on. The president’s Twitter tantrums may read like the ravings of an emotionally labile Fox News grandpa, but they were actually savvy bids to distract the media from his true malfeasance. And it may look like America’s entire political class was so inept, and its republic so broken, that a senescent sociopath could win the presidency on the strength of partisan polarization, white racism, and the widespread misconception that The Apprentice was a documentary. But Trump was actually a (very unstable) genius playing 12-dimensional Yahtzee.

This theory is much less popular today than it was when Trump took office. For most observers, 33 months of watching the president score own goals has been sufficient to dispel the fiction that he knows exactly what he’s doing. But if any grudging admirers of Trump’s strategic prowess remain, the president’s decision to abet a Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria this week should make them see the inconveniently stupid truth. Naming the single dumbest thing Trump has done as president, in terms of his own political interest, is an intimidating task given the cornucopia of contenders for that title. But his decision to abandon America’s Kurdish allies in Syria this week has to be pretty high up on the list.

To review: Trump entered Sunday enmeshed in a fight over impeachment. To prevent the House’s investigation of his blatantly corrupt dealings with Ukraine from threatening his presidency, the White House aimed to portray the inquiry as a partisan witch hunt. The overriding goal was to maintain low-information swing voters’ aversion to impeachment. To do that, the GOP needed to send a clear message — only far-left Democrats believe Donald Trump has been dangerously misusing the powers of his office or undermining our national security. As long as Republicans maintained a unified front, independents would view the whole inquiry as a partisan food fight and blame the instigators. Meanwhile, the RNC could mine a fundraising bonus from the GOP base’s freshly inflamed siege mentality. With a little message discipline, they could turn this whole episode into a net positive.

Then Trump hopped on the phone with Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And without consulting the Pentagon, the State Department, or leaders of his own party, the president gave his Turkish counterpart permission to wage war on America’s Kurdish allies in northeastern Syria.

There are very few things Trump could do to provoke loud criticism from his allies in Congress or on the Christian right. In abandoning the Kurds to their fate, he chose to do one of them. Before Trump took Erdogan’s call, Lindsey Graham was incessantly broadcasting the (insane) message that congressional Democrats were destroying the Constitution by conducting oversight of the executive branch. Since bombs started falling on Kurdish border towns, Graham has been broadcasting the message that Trump is exercising executive authority in a way that brings shame on America and jeopardizes its national security.

Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 9, 2019

And many of Trump’s other Republican allies have echoed Graham’s sentiments, thereby sending the meta-message that this president is misusing power in a manner so severe even staunch conservatives can’t help but speak out.

The Evangelical right has forgiven Trump for a wide variety of deadly sins, but the movement is deeply invested in the fate of Syria’s Christian minority, which could fare worse under the rule of Turkey’s Islamist government than it currently does under the Kurds’ secular leadership. On Monday, televangelist Pat Robertson sorrowfully informed his faithful that if Trump allowed the Turkish invasion to proceed, he would be “in danger of losing the mandate of heaven.” As of this writing, it is unclear whether God is now an undecided voter. But Trump does appear to be at risk of losing the mandate of Franklin Graham.

Meanwhile, the upside for Trump here is difficult to discern. Sure, a large swath of the American public is sick of forever wars. But the president isn’t actually bringing our troops home from Syria; he’s merely relocating 50 U.S. service members. Trump may believe this symbolic gesture is sufficient to convey the impression that he is fulfilling a campaign promise to draw down America’s military commitments, but if he thinks this half-hearted gesture towards paleoconservatism is more politically beneficial than interviews like this are damaging, he is almost certainly mistaken.

I just spoke to a distraught US Special Forces soldier who is among the 1000 or so US troops in Syria tonight who is serving alongside the SDF Kurdish forces. It was one of the hardest phone calls I have ever taken.

The danger for Trump here is not that his betrayal of the Kurds will persuade a critical mass of GOP senators to vote for his removal from office. Lindsey Graham is still interspersing his prayers for the Kurds with demagogic defenses of Trump’s corruption, and there are still nowhere near enough votes in the upper chamber to evict Trump from the White House. But the impeachment push doesn’t need to succeed to damage the president’s reelection hopes. And against all odds, Trump has managed to manufacture one of the few circumstances in which devout Republicans will loudly endorse the broad premise of Nancy Pelosi’s inquiry: that Trump is using presidential power in ways that shock the conscience of patriotic Americans, no matter their partisan allegiance.

Which seems ill advised given that public opinion was already moving in favor of impeachment before this week’s events got underway.

By itself, all this would be more than adequate proof that our president is a lucky idiot who is bad at politics. But Trump’s new Syria policy has an additional dimension of stupidity. It jeopardizes one of his few (putative) nonpartisan accomplishments as president.

Trump may or may not deserve credit for the decline of ISIS over the past three years, but the fact that he presided over that decline was sufficient for him to declare himself a great slayer of terrorists without mainstream fact-checkers complaining. In clearing the way for a war between Turkey and the Kurds, Trump may well have forfeited that right. Kurdish forces have been guarding 1,200 ISIS prisoners. The burgeoning conflict threatens to divert forces from that prison camp and provide the ISIS fighters with a prime opportunity for a jailbreak.

Remarkably, Trump does not deny this. The president’s official position is that his decision to withdraw 50 U.S. service members from one region of Syria does, in fact, come with a significant risk of reviving ISIS, but this is an acceptable risk because he made sure to relocate two of the 1,200 terrorists in advance — and the rest will probably just descend on Europe anyway.

In case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles, out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst! — Donald J.

"Without evidence, Brazil's Bolsonaro claims NGOs may be burning the Amazon. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday said, without presenting evidence, that non-governmental organizations could be burning down the Amazon rainforest to bring shame on his government after he cut their funding.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-brazil-politics/without-evidence-brazils-bolsonaro-claims-ngos-may-be-burning-the-amazon-idUKKCN1VB1BS,"BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday accused non-governmental organizations of burning down the Amazon rainforest to hurt his government, as a growing global outcry against the wildfires raged through social media.

Presented without evidence and disputed by environmental and climate experts, Bolsonaro’s comments enraged critics and fanned a growing social media campaign over the dangers to the Amazon, one of the world’s key bulwarks against climate change.

#PrayforAmazonas was the world’s top trending topic on Twitter on Wednesday, and millions of people took to Instagram and Facebook to share concerns over the future of the Amazon. With global awareness growing, Bolsonaro’s comments risk creating a spiralling crisis for his government, imperilling an EU-Mercosur trade pact and upsetting key agribusiness clients.

“Everything indicates” that NGOs were going to the Amazon to “set fire” to the forest, Bolsonaro said in a Facebook Live broadcast on Wednesday morning. When asked if he had evidence to back up his claims, he said he had “no written plan,” adding “that’s not how it’s done.”

The former army captain turned politician said the slashing of NGO funding by his government could be a motive.

“Crime exists,” he said. “These people are missing the money.”

Bolsonaro said his administration was working to control the Amazon fires, which have reached a record number this year. Brazil’s space research centre, INPE, has detected 72,843 fires so far in 2019, an 83% increase on the same period in 2018.

Environmental and climate experts labelled his claims that NGOs were responsible a “smoke screen” to hide his government’s dismantling of protections for the world’s largest tropical rainforest. They said farmers clearing land were responsible for the uptick in fires.

“This is a sick statement, a pitiful statement,” said Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace Brazil’s public policy coordinator. “Increased deforestation and burning are the result of his anti-environmental policy.”

Bolsonaro, a longtime skeptic of environmental concerns, wants to open the Amazon to more agriculture and mining, and has told other countries worried about rising deforestation under his watch to mind their own business.

Congressman Nilto Tatto, leader of the lower house environment caucus, said Bolsonaro’s “stunning” attack on NGOs was an attempt to obscure his administration’s destruction of 30 years of Brazilian environmental protections.

Climate scientist Carlos Nobre said farmers seeking to clear land for cattle pastures wait for the dry season when forests become combustible and then set them alight. He attributed this year’s spike to illegal deforestation since it has not been unusually dry.

“NGOs working in the Amazon do not use fire in farming. On the contrary, they encourage rural communities to avoid fire,” said Nobre, senior researcher at Sao Paulo University’s Institute for Advanced Studies.

Former presidential candidate and environment minister Marina Silva took to Twitter to criticise Bolsonaro.

“The Amazon is on fire,” she wrote. “The president says NGOs may be behind this. The lack of commitment to the truth is a chronic pathology. This irresponsible attitude only aggravates an environmental disaster in Brazil.”

Speaking later on Wednesday, Bolsonaro also took aim at the Paris climate accord, saying that if it were so good, the United States would have stayed in it. But he added that for the time being, Brazil would remain in the pact.

French President Emmanuel Macron warned in June he would not sign the EU-Mercosur trade treaty if Bolsonaro pulled Brazil out of the Paris accord.

Earlier this month, Norway and Germany suspended funding for projects to curb deforestation in Brazil after becoming alarmed by changes to the way projects were selected under Bolsonaro.",JustBadNews,0
"Tumblr sold today for less than $3M compared to original purchase at $1.1B, posing a >99.7% loss for Verizon.",http://axios.com/verizon-tumblr-wordpress-automattic-e6645edd-bc73-45c2-9380-9fe8ca34291f.html,"Verizon is set to sell the social network Tumblr to Automattic Inc, the owner of online publishing tool Wordpress. A source familiar with the deal puts the price-tag ""well below"" $20 million, while another source puts it below $10 million.

The big picture: Tumblr, while unprofitable, hosts more than 450 million blogs and was once considered a major player in the social media space. The network was acquired by Yahoo for $1.1 billion in 2013, before moving under Verizon's umbrella through the carrier's acquisition of Yahoo in 2017. Verizon's desire to sell Tumblr had been previously known, but as of May, Pornhub had been the only bidder to show public interest.

Automattic Inc. will buy the network and take on its 200 employees.

Between the lines: Tumblr has faced backlash over the years for not properly monitoring pornographic content, which Verizon ultimately banned last year. Automattic's Chief Executive Matt Mullenweg told the Wall Street Journal that he plans to maintain the ban.",JustBadNews,0
WhatsApp co-founder says it is time to delete Facebook,https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17145200/brian-acton-delete-facebook-whatsapp,"In 2014, Facebook bought WhatsApp for $16 billion, making its co-founders — Jan Koum and Brian Acton — very wealthy men. Koum continues to lead the company, but Acton quit earlier this year to start his own foundation. And he isn’t done merely with WhatsApp — in a post on Twitter today, Acton told his followers to delete Facebook.

“It is time,” Acton wrote, adding the hashtag #deletefacebook. Acton, who is worth $6.5 billion, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. WhatsApp declined to comment.

It was unclear whether Acton’s feelings about Facebook extend to his own app. But last month, Acton invested $50 million into Signal, an independent alternative to WhatsApp.

The tweet came after a bruising five-day period for Facebook that has seen regulators swarm and its stock price plunge following concerns over data privacy in the wake of revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of user data.

Acton is not the first former Facebook executive to express unease about the company after leaving it. Last year, former head of growth Chamath Palihapitiya caused a firestorm after saying “we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.” Other former executives to express regrets include Sean Parker, Justin Rosenstein, and investor Roger McNamee.",JustBadNews,0
YouTube comedian Count Dankula convicted over 'grossly offensive' Nazi salute dog video,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/youtube-comedian-count-dankula-guilty-hate-speech-nazi-dog-video-145920581.html,"Mark Meechan filmed the dog responding to statements such as “Sieg Heil” and “gas the Jews”(SWNS)

A man who posted a video of his girlfriend’s dog doing a Nazi salute on YouTube has been been convicted over the “grossly offensive” footage.

Mark Meechan, 29, who goes by the name Count Dankula, was arrested in April 2017 after footage of his girlfriend’s pug appearing to respond to Nazi slogans such as ‘gas the Jews’ went viral.

In a case that attracted widespread attention, Meechan was found guilty on Tuesday at Airdrie Sheriff Court of a charge under the Communications Act 2003.

Sheriff Derek O’Carroll dubbed the video “grossly offensive” and said he did not believe Meechan’s defence that he had made it only to annoy his girlfriend.

Prosecutors accused Meechan of posting material that was ‘anti-semitic and racist in nature’ and was aggravated by religious prejudice.

In a tweet on Tuesday, Meechan confirmed he had been convicted, later adding that he is due to be sentenced in April.

Outside court, Meechan said: “There has been a huge miscarriage of justice.

“I think it’s a very, very dark day in regards to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.

“The thing that was most worrying is that one of the primary things in any action that is to be considered is things like context and intent, and today context and intent were completely disregarded.

“For the system to actually disregard such things as that means that your actions no longer matter, they decide what your context and intent is.

“For any comedians in Britain, I would be very worried about making jokes in future because your context and intent behind them apparently don’t matter anymore

“I made the video to annoy my girlfriend and that is the reality.

“If they don’t wish to see it then there isn’t really much I can do about that. That literally is fact, and if they don’t want to consider that fact then it’s not up to me.

“It was a joke. A joke made to annoy my girlfriend and I stand by that.”

At the time, Meechan apologised profusely over the offence caused by the video, titled ‘M8 yer dugs a Nazi’, which wracked up more than 3 million views.

He said: “I am not a racist at all, anybody who knows me could tell you that. I’m freaked out because everyone’s going to actually think that I hate Jews now and I don’t at all. I’m kind of panicked about it.

“Honestly I don’t hate anyone. The whole purpose of this was just to annoy my girlfriend.

While the BBC may be in hot water for the gender disparity highlighted in its recent salary report, there has been little said about the state of pay within the fashion industry.

A new study, however, has shed some light on the situation - and women come out on top.

Reportedly earning around 75% more than their male counterparts, women make up 9 of the top 10 highest earning models in British fashion.

Losing her place in the top spot is Kate Moss, who has been overtaken financially by friend and model 19 years her junior Cara Delevingne.

Earning £8 million a year, Delevingne has the power of Instagram to thank for her £22,000 a day salary according to new research conducted by lingerie brand Bluebella based on catwalk day rates and commercial deals.

With over 40 million Instagram followers - compared to Moss's agency account's 631,000 - the 24-year-old model-turned-actress dominates a more influential arena on social media, rendering her more attractive to advertisers.

Landing the second spot was new mother Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who reportedly earned £6.5 million last year with thanks, in part, to her 7.6 million Instagram followers.

Snapchat refuse to release information in relation to microwaved puppy criminal cruelty case,https://m.independent.ie/irish-news/news/man-23-charged-in-connection-with-death-of-puppy-sparky-36574444.html,"A picture of the 11-week-old puppy has been circulating on social media.

A 23-year-old has been charged with causing unnecessary suffering to animals after a puppy was killed with a hammer in Co Armagh.

He is due to appear at Craigavon Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

A 16-year-old male has been released on bail pending further police enquiries.

It's believed the incident happened on Saturday and was shared on the social media platform Snapchat.

The remains were recovered from a bin and a post mortem is to take place to determine the cause of death.

Since reports of the incident first emerged on Monday night speculation over the incident reached fever pitch, which police have attempted to quell.

Earlier officers urged anyone who may have seen posts about the incident on Snapchat or other networks to get in touch.

Police have said Snapchat will not be releasing data relating to the barbaric killing of the 11-week-old puppy.

Officers said the social network would only share information on certain crimes and this incident did not fall into one of those categories.

They have also urged the public to stop sharing names of individuals they may think are involved as it could ""prejudice the court case,"" urging anyone with information instead to contact police.

Lawsuit exposes internet giant's culture of intolerance,http://quillette.com/2018/02/01/lawsuit-exposes-internet-giants-internal-culture-intolerance/,"James Damore, the former Google engineer who was fired last summer after authoring a document questioning the company’s diversity policies, has filed a lawsuit against the company. In a 161-page complaint, he does far more than challenge his firing and accuses Google of systemic discrimination against and harassment of white and male employees, as well as of violating a California state law that prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of an employee’s political persuasion. He has joined together with another engineer by the name of David Gudeman who was also fired after he expressed politically incorrect views. Together, the two of them are requesting that their case be treated as a class action on behalf of all employees who have faced similar treatment at the hands of the Internet giant. The charges that they make are broad and far-reaching, but they are not asking that their claims be taken on faith alone. More than half of the complaint is taken up by an 87-page-long exhibit consisting of screenshots from internal systems used by Google employees to communicate. These screenshots present a stunning display of unprofessional behavior not just by rank-and-file employees but managers and even a senior vice president, including overt discrimination, prejudice on the basis of race and gender, conflation of dissenting political views with racism and sexism, punishment of those who asked questions about what behavior was permitted, endorsement of politically motivated violence, and even an attack on the very notion of truth itself.

The most important lawsuit in modern American history, by @JamesADamore, against the most powerful company that has ever existed, @Google, about whether it can keep imposing its political agenda on the world. So, yeah, it's kinda worth reading.https://t.co/QgFkFsqsxP — Geoffrey Miller (@primalpoly) January 9, 2018

The complaint alleges that Google’s affirmative action programs went beyond merely setting targets and conducting outreach events restricted to certain demographics. At a “Diversity Team Kickoff” event, a director announced plans “to freeze headcount so that teams could find diversity candidates to help fill the empty roles,” with “diversity candidates” being defined to mean “women and non-Caucasian individuals” (Complaint 46). In other words, Google saw fit to stop hiring white men at all for certain teams until the desired numbers of favored groups were met. Not only did Google practice this discrimination itself, but it also attempted to use its power in the industry to coerce other companies into doing the same, with one manager instructing his employees as follows:

Next time you get invited to speak at a conference, especially if you’re a white male – ask the organizer to confirm you’re the only white male on the panel / in the speaker lineup. If not, say you are honored, but must decline, and give the reason. And because you are at Google, guess what – they’re going to change the panel for you. You’ll feel bad about inconveniencing them. But not that bad. When the cheesy white male executive is in the “green room” and glaring at you because he was bounced for the panel in favor of a woman on his team, you’ll feel pretty damn smug. Or you won’t: you’ll feel bad that you might have put her in a tough spot, and you’ll go above and beyond to make good with the schmucky senior dude (Complaint 42).

Smug indeed. The willingness to displace all of the other people on a panel, people who presumably worked hard to earn those speaking opportunities, displays a level of ego that is striking.

Despite these glaring acts of discrimination, the social justice activists within the company are still not satisfied and are pushing for ever-more-extreme forms of affirmative action. Proposals have included adding points to the interview scores of favored candidates (Exhibit 25), penalizing senior vice presidents whose teams didn’t hire the desired demographics by taking away half of their equity compensation (Exhibit 25), and even an outright “moratorium on hiring white cis heterosexual abled men who aren’t abuse survivors” (Exhibit 83). One manager proposed an experiment in discrimination:

I think only women and [people of color] should be allowed to make hiring decisions at google [sic] for a year. And/or randomly assign a third of each position type to only be hired by women, [people of color], or unselected type. Look at the resulting data. Google likes experiments? Do an experiment (Exhibit 25).

Apparently, it never occurred to her that her proposal is a flagrant violation of federal civil rights laws. Another manager saw fit to take matters into his own hands, declaring that he would begin each interview with “a discussion of experience with diversity” and only proceed to the technical questions that assess a candidate’s qualifications for the job once he was satisfied that the candidate had met his ideological litmus test (Exhibit 25).

This tendency toward discrimination was accompanied by numerous instances of prejudice directed at white men. The complaint alleges that “the presence of Caucasians and males was mocked with ‘boos’ during company-wide weekly meetings” by individuals who included “high-level managers…who were responsible for hundreds, if not thousands, or hiring and firing decisions” (Complaint 3). One employee posted to a forum, “If you put a group of 40-something white men in a room together and tell them to come up with something creative or innovative, they’ll come back and tell you how enjoyable the process was, and how they want to do it again, but they come up with fuck-all as a result!” (Complaint 43) This claim is, of course, demonstrably false as evidenced by the many inventions and discoveries contributed to humanity by white men in their forties. When another employee complained to human resources that the post constituted harassment on the grounds of race, gender, and age, all of which are protected classes under federal law, Google responded that the post was acceptable because its purpose was “to highlight that it is helpful to have diverse perspective” (Complaint 43). It seems that Google’s definition of diversity does not require respecting the basic human dignity of all people.

These are far from the only instances of prejudice documented in the complaint. Employees mocked those who expressed concerns about unfairness to those passed over by affirmative action, declaring that they “already have all the advantages in the world” (Complaint 40) and that “it’s not sexism / racism if it’s against males / whites” (Exhibit 76). Such concerns were dismissed as “devil’s-advocate troll-bullshit” (Complaint 41). One employee declared all white men to be part of the problem: “By being a white male, you are in a privileged class that is actively harmful to others, whether you like it or not. So, no, you really actually don’t get to complain about your right to an opinion” (Exhibit 53). Another pontificated, “The only way we ‘move past color’ in America is for white people to shut up and listen” (Exhibit 47). Slurs casually flung around included “whitesplaining” (Exhibit 58), “white fragility” (Exhibit 59), “white tears” (Exhibit 85), “toxic whiteness” (Exhibit 61), and of course “mansplaining” (Exhibit 74). In some cases, the slurs were sexually explicit, with one employee declaring that “being a computer programmer is even sweeter if you have a dick” (Exhibit 84) and another congratulating anyone who disagreed with him on his “white penis” (Exhibit 55). One employee compared the reaction of “straight white men” to her use of the word “privilege” to “vampires being fed a garlic tart at high noon” (Exhibit 52). A manager advised his subordinates, “It’s good to be periodically reminded, given how popular Dilbert is amongst us geek-folk, that the creator of Dilbert is…a paranoid sexist dickbag” (Exhibit 50). Another manager challenged others to “Stop Reading White Straight, Cis Male Authors for One Year” (Exhibit 51).

The intolerance on display was not just racial and sexual but also political. One employee openly declared, “I personally believe that a majority of self-identified ‘Republicans’ can be placed in the bucket category of idiots (or uneducated)” (Exhibit 3). Another proclaimed his hostility, “If you’re concerned about discussing conservative values at work, maybe you should be. Maybe that’s a feature, and not a bug” (Exhibit 2). An employee who sympathized with his heterodox colleagues recounted, “I have lost count of the times at Google…people tell me privately that they cannot admit their voting choice if they are Republican because they fear how other Googlers will react” (Exhibit 11).

Conservative ideology was treated by many as being the equivalent of racism and sexism: “The choice to be a Republican is the choice to align yourself with a white supremacist, xenophobic regime” (Exhibit 1). Another employee declared that “one of two major American political party [sic] has adopted white supremacy as a political platform” (Exhibit 1). When one employee discussed “Conservative Christianity” as being among “legitimate world views,” another responded, “I admire your tolerance, but pairing those two phrases still sounds like an oxymoron to me” (Exhibit 1).

The vilest treatment, however, was reserved for those who supported the candidacy of Donald Trump. One Trump voter at the company recounted his experience following the election:

As a Republican at Google and a person who voted for Trump, I already knew I was in the minority. What I didn’t foresee is the fact that I would have to come into work yesterday and hear my cube mates ridicule and mock people like myself that voted for Trump, and then have that behavior reinforced by senior leaders who sent emails condoning the beratement of Republicans (Exhibit 14).

When one employee urged others to show respect and try to understand one another even if they chose different candidates, another replied:

I mean no disrespect, but statements like this come off rather condescending IMO when the rule of law has been killing blackfolks for generations and is now well documented, and part of the platform of the man who was elected was that law would be harder on blackfolk. This sort of statement smells strongly of privilege that many people in the US do not have (Exhibit 15).

The notion that it would make a difference if someone voted for Trump for reasons other than his incendiary rhetoric was explicitly repudiated:

Unfortunately, when you vote for or nominate a candidate, you vote for the entire package. You can’t support Donald Trump without also supporting his racism, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia. Or even worse, if you vote for Donald Trump because of his economic policy or because you feel the other party is corrupt, then what you’re saying is that economics is more important than the safety of your peers (Exhibit 31).

In this climate of little tolerance for dissent, it is understandable that employees whose views differed from the prevailing opinions might wish to ascertain exactly what the boundaries were. However, the complaint alleges that employees were punished for merely asking such questions. Two such questions leading to punishment were as follows:

Are you insinuating that it is a “jerk move” to share your opinion about a political blog post if 98% of Googlers disagree with you, but it’s OK to share your opinion about a political blog post if 98% of Googlers agree with you? If so, how do you reconcile this view with [Senior Vice President Urs Hölzle’s] request to help make Google a supportive place for minorities of any kind? (Complaint 24) Many Googlers have claimed that it is “harassment” or some other rule violation to critique articles that push the Social Justice agenda. A few Googlers have openly called for others to be fired over it. Do you support this viewpoint, and if so, can we add a clear statement of banned opinions to the employee handbook so that everybody knows what the ground rules are? (Complaint 24)

One employee responded to the latter question, saying, “yes, the posting of this kind of ‘critique’ – and in fact, the posing of this very question itself – directly contributes to the creation of a hostile work environment for women at this company” (Exhibit 21). In doing so, he seems to be engaging in what the equity feminist Christina Hoff Sommers has termed “fainting couch feminism,” treating women as too fragile to be exposed to an opinion with which they might disagree and thereby reinforcing many of the stereotypes that earlier generations of feminists fought so hard to erase.1

Some of the behavior on display at Google went beyond hate speech into the realm of outright endorsements of politically motivated violence. One employee proclaimed:

This is why I refuse to condemn rioters or punching Nazis. This is targeted, political, defensive violence. It’s what happens when you leave otherwise nonviolent people with no other choice, and it’s what happens when a movement ignores everything else: facts, morality, empathy, justice, fairness, whatever… So, let some black bloc guy punch a Nazi, and let the world point and laugh. Let it be symbolic and let all the Nazis fear. And then repeat after me: this is not normal. This is not normal (Exhibit 39).

Others join in the calls for violence: “If you subscribe to an ideology that, as a matter of fact, wants to kill people because they are different – and has, by the millions – then you deserve being punched in the face. Repeatedly” (Exhibit 40). One employee declared that “we are at a point where the dialogue we need to be having with these people is ‘if you keep talking about this shit, I [sic] will hurt you’” and that “the only way to change people’s minds is to make being a fucking nazi [sic] have consequences” (Exhibit 40). Another casually announced, “Also in the mood to punch Nazis, but none within punching distance” (Exhibit 41). For one employee, simply being a male engineer was enough to justify the desire for violence: “Every time I’m reminded of the travails of Kathy Sierra it makes me want to pound a brogrammer in the face” (Exhibit 48). Another employee announced his participation in #TheIdesofTrump, a movement to protest Trump on the date of the assassination of Julius Caesar (Exhibit 81).

Yet perhaps the most shocking revelation in the complaint was the declaration by Senior Vice President Urs Hölzle that the scientific method should not be applied to questions pertaining to diversity:

As engineers, we’re trained to pay attention to the details, think logically, challenge assumptions that may be incorrect (or just fuzzy), and so on. These are all excellent tools for technical discussions. But they can be terrible tools for discussion around race, discrimination, justice, and so on, because these discussions touch topics with a high cultural and emotional content. That’s because questioning the exact details can easily be perceived as questioning the overall validity of the effort, or the veracity of the historical context.

Behind Hölzle’s statement is the assumption that it is wrong to question the validity of a diversity effort that treats people differently due to innate characteristics beyond their control or the truth of the narrative used to justify it. Instead, these claims must be taken on faith. The emotions of those who would benefit are so inviolable as to warrant suppressing inquiry into the facts, yet no regard is given for the emotions of those who are suffering from this discrimination. Those who believe this should be ashamed to call themselves supporters of either science or justice.

Hölzle goes on to compare questioning the narratives behind diversity programs with going to a funeral and criticizing the deceased. It would be the wrong time to do so out of respect for the mourners, even if the deceased was a person who deserved criticism. This is undoubtedly true, but it also a deeply flawed analogy. A funeral lasts for a short period of time. The fact that someone has died does not grant that person the right to be perpetually treated as infallible. If now is not the right time to question these policies, then when is? No answer is provided to this question.

For a better example of how to address these issues, we might do well to look to Alan Dershowitz, a Jewish law professor at Harvard, who was once confronted with an anti-Semite who denied the historical accuracy of the Holocaust. Rather than seeking to censor the anti-Semite, Dershowitz instead proposed a debate between the two of them that would take place at Auschwitz, where the evidence for the Holocaust is located.2 As Justice Louis Brandeis said when defending the importance of transparency and free speech, “Sunlight is said to be one of the best disinfectants.” If one is confident in the strength of the evidence to support one’s claims, then there is no good reason to fear scrutiny.

Based on the information revealed in Damore’s complaint, we would do well to recognize that Google has through its actions forfeited a great deal of its credibility. It cannot claim to be a neutral arbiter of information when it denies a hearing to any ideas that do not conform to its politically correct dogma. It cannot claim to be a leading proponent of science when it prioritizes emotions over truth. It cannot claim not to be evil when it censors and discriminates. The case is still in its earliest stages, and there is no doubt that even more of Google’s ugly internal culture will be revealed when witnesses begin to be interrogated. It seems likely that Damore’s charges will resonate with a jury that, unlike Google, will contain Americans from across the political spectrum. Yet whatever the outcome of the case is in a court of law, what has been revealed ought to affect the degree of trust that the public extends to Google.

Dutch Reporters Stun Trump's Ambassador by Pressing Him to Admit He Lied About ?No-Go Zones?,https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/dutch-reporters-stun-trumps-ambassador-pressing-admit-lied-no-go-zones/,"White House correspondents who routinely allow the president of the United States to repeat false claims unchallenged should study the footage of how their Dutch counterparts greeted Donald Trump’s new ambassador to the Netherlands on Wednesday. Dutch reporters simply ignored a plea from the new U.S. ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, to forget all about the fact that there is video of him lying about their country in 2015. In that video, Hoekstra can be seen insisting that parts of the Netherlands have been surrendered to Islamist radicals who supposedly rule over “no-go zones” for non-Muslims — areas where, he said, Dutch politicians have even been set on fire. After Hoekstra refused to answer one reporter’s direct question — “Are politicians being burned in the Netherlands? … Is that something you believe, yes or no?” — his colleagues immediately followed up.

Today Dutch press welcomed @petehoekstra as new ambassador to the Netherlands. In 2015 Hoekstra said Dutch""politicians are being burned"" (not true). The only one who did get burned today is... Hoekstra himself. By refusing to answer our questions. pic.twitter.com/Dv2aalbhDP — Roel (@rgeeraedts) January 10, 2018

“If you are truly an honest and wise man,” another journalist asked, “would you please take back the remark about burned politicians — or name a politician that was burned in the Netherlands?” When Hoekstra, who was born in the Netherlands but raised in Michigan as a staunch social conservative, called for another question, two reporters asked him, “Why don’t you answer the question?” Another told the former Congressman, “This is the Netherlands; you have to answer questions.”

After Hoekstra had presented his credentials to the Dutch king in the Hague on Wednesday, the new ambassador told reporters that he would be “moving on” from the controversy over his remarks. But the reporters failed to play along, with one quickly asking, “Will you be visiting our ‘no-go areas?'”

""Meneer de ambassadeur, kunt u een Nederlandse politicus noemen die de afgelopen jaren is verbrand?"" Geen antwoord. Nieuwe Amerikaanse ambassadeur Pete Hoekstra had een lastige eerste ontmoeting met de Nederlandse pers. ? https://t.co/8IDcPrVBPE pic.twitter.com/N0TiGaaBzj — NOS (@NOS) January 10, 2018

Hoekstra had spectacularly failed to defuse the crisis in an interview in December, in which he told a reporter from the Dutch state broadcaster NOS that it was “fake news” to claim that he had said exactly what he had been recorded saying in 2015. Later in the same interview, Hoekstra stunned the reporter by claiming that he had not used the term “fake news” minutes earlier.

@Nieuwsuur to new US ambassador: ""You mentioned [..] that there are no go-zones in the Netherlands and that cars and politicians are set on fire.""



Pete Hoekstra: ""I didn't say that. That's actually an incorrect statement [..] fake news.""



Hmm, let's have a look at the footage ? pic.twitter.com/vlstN9vhSK — Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) December 21, 2017

After that debacle, Hoekstra issued a statement in which he expressed “regret” for lying to the NOS program, Nieuwsuur. But he refused to retract his original comments about the entirely imaginary threat of non-Muslims being banned or attacked in areas of the Netherlands ruled according to Islamic Sharia.

Please see my comments regarding recent interview. Thank you. Pete pic.twitter.com/gxQOcZ8Duk — Pete Hoekstra (@petehoekstra) December 23, 2017",JustBadNews,0
U.S. places Pakistan on special watch list for ?severe violations of religious freedom?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-religion/idUSKBN1ET1OA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has placed Pakistan on a special watch list for “severe violations of religious freedom,” it said on Thursday, days after the White House said Islamabad would have to do more to combat terrorism to receive U.S. aid.

The State Department also said it had re-designated 10 other nations as “countries of particular concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act for having engaged in or tolerated egregious violations of religious freedom.

The re-designated countries were China, Eritrea, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. They were re-designated on Dec. 22.

“The protection of religious freedom is vital to peace, stability, and prosperity,” the department said in a statement. “These designations are aimed at improving the respect for religious freedom in these countries.”

U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Pakistan for not doing more to combat terrorism, and his administration has informed members of Congress that it will announce plans to end “security assistance” payments to the country.

Pakistan has said it is already doing a lot to fight militants, and summoned the U.S. ambassador to explain a tweet by Trump that said the United States had been foolish in dispensing aid to Islamabad.",JustBadNews,0
"Bitcoin plunged below $13,000 (?10,970) on Friday after losing around a third of its value in just five days, with the digital currency on track for its worst week since 2013 after a blistering ascent to a peak close to $20,000 on Sunday.",http://www.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1EG0A8,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin plunged by 30 percent to below $12,000 on Friday as investors dumped the cryptocurrency after its sharp rise to a peak close to $20,000 prompted warnings by experts of a bubble.

After falling to as low as $11,159, it recouped some losses to trade above $14,000 on the Bitstamp platform, down 9 percent on the day. It is down around 25 percent this week, its largest weekly loss since April 2013.

It capped a brutal week that had been touted as a new era of mainstream trading for the digital currency when bitcoin futures debuted on CME Group Inc, the world’s largest derivatives market on Sunday.

Friday’s fall bled into the U.S. stock market, where shares of companies that have lashed their fortunes to bitcoin or blockchain - its underlying technology - took a knock. Long Blockchain Corp, Overstock.com Inc, Riot Blockchain Inc and Marathon Patent Group Inc lost between 2 percent and 15 percent.

The biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has risen around twentyfold since the start of the year, climbing from less than $1,000 to as high as $19,666 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Sunday and to over $20,000 on other exchanges. But it has fallen each day since.

In the futures market, bitcoin one-month futures <0#XBT:> on Cboe Global Markets were earlier halted due to the steep price drop, while those trading on the CME hit the limit down threshold.

“The crypto markets have experienced several flash crashes over the past few years but we do believe there has been some overvaluation in the market, particularly over recent months,” said Jamie Burke, chief executive officer at venture capital firm Outlier Ventures.

“It’s much more likely this is a natural correction following over-exuberant market sentiment.”

On Friday, Mike Novogratz, the former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, told Bloomberg he had halted plans to launch a crypto-currency hedge fund. (bloom.bg/2BA9gGN)

“We didn’t like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we’re doing,” he told Bloomberg.

His Galaxy Digital Assets Fund was due to start on Dec. 15, but he called clients on Dec. 12 and told them he had changed his mind, Novogratz said in an interview with Bloomberg.

Novogratz told Reuters in November he hoped to raise about $500 million, making it the largest fund of its kind.

Warnings about the risks of investing in the unregulated market have increased - Denmark’s central bank governor called it a “deadly” gamble - and there have been worries about the security of exchanges on which cryptocurrencies are bought and sold.

South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit said on Tuesday it is shutting down and is filing for bankruptcy after it was hacked for the second time this year.

Coinbase, a U.S. company that runs one of the biggest exchanges and provides digital “wallets” for storing bitcoins, said on Wednesday it would investigate accusations of insider trading, following a sharp rise in the price of a bitcoin spin-off hours before it announced support for it.

On Friday, Coinbase said it had temporarily suspended buying and selling of bitcoin due to high traffic.

CRYPTO-RIVALS

As some rival cryptocurrencies slid along with bitcoin, the total estimated value of the crypto market fell to as low as $440 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap, having neared $650 billion just a day earlier.

But other cryptocurrencies rose this week, with investors moving into cheaper digital coins, rather than cashing out of the sector.

Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market size, soared to almost $900 earlier in the week, from around $500 a week earlier. Ripple, the third-biggest, has more than quadrupled in price since Monday.

Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for retail FX broker Oanda in Singapore, said there had also been moves out of bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash, a clone of the original cryptocurrency. Oanda does not handle trading in bitcoin.

“Most of it is unsophisticated retail traders getting burned badly,” Innes said on bitcoin’s recent retreat.

While some say the launch by CME and its rival Cboe Global Markets of bitcoin futures over the last two weeks has given the digital currency some perceived legitimacy, many policymakers remain skeptical.

Bitcoin is known to go through wild swings. In November, it tumbled almost 30 percent in four days from $7,888 to $5,555. In September, it fell 40 percent from $4,979 to $2,972.",JustBadNews,0
Venezuela's Children Are Starving to Death,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/world/americas/venezuela-children-starving.html,"Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But in the last three years its economy has collapsed. Hunger has gripped the nation for years. Now, it’s killing children. The Venezuelan government knows, but won’t admit it.

For five months, The New York Times tracked 21 public hospitals in Venezuela. Doctors are seeing record numbers of children with severe malnutrition. Hundreds have died.

SAN CASIMIRO, Venezuela — Kenyerber Aquino Merchán was 17 months old when he starved to death.

His father left before dawn to bring him home from the hospital morgue. He carried Kenyerber’s skeletal frame into the kitchen and handed it to a mortuary worker who makes house calls for Venezuelan families with no money for funerals.

Kenyerber’s spine and rib cage protruded as the embalming chemicals were injected. Aunts shooed away curious young cousins, mourners arrived with wildflowers from the hills, and relatives cut out a pair of cardboard wings from one of the empty white ration boxes that families increasingly depend on amid the food shortages and soaring food prices throttling the nation. They gently placed the tiny wings on top of Kenyerber’s coffin to help his soul reach heaven — a tradition when a baby dies in Venezuela.

When Kenyerber’s body was finally ready for viewing, his father, Carlos Aquino, a 37-year-old construction worker, began to weep uncontrollably. “How can this be?” he cried, hugging the coffin and speaking softly, as if to comfort his son in death. “Your papá will never see you again.”

Hunger has stalked Venezuela for years. Now, it is killing the nation’s children at an alarming rate, doctors in the country’s public hospitals say.

Venezuela has been shuddering since its economy began to collapse in 2014. Riots and protests over the lack of affordable food, excruciating long lines for basic provisions, soldiers posted outside bakeries and angry crowds ransacking grocery stores have rattled cities, providing a telling, public display of the depths of the crisis.

But deaths from malnutrition have remained a closely guarded secret by the Venezuelan government. In a five-month investigation by The New York Times, doctors at 21 public hospitals in 17 states across the country said that their emergency rooms were being overwhelmed by children with severe malnutrition — a condition they had rarely encountered before the economic crisis began.

“Children are arriving with very precarious conditions of malnutrition,” said Dr. Huníades Urbina Medina, the president of the Venezuelan Society of Childcare and Pediatrics. He added that doctors were even seeing the kind of extreme malnutrition often found in refugee camps — cases that were highly unusual in oil-rich Venezuela before its economy fell to pieces.

For many low-income families, the crisis has completely redrawn the social landscape. Parents like Kenyerber’s mother go days without eating, shriveling to the weight of children themselves. Women line up at sterilization clinics to avoid having children they can’t feed. Young boys leave home and join street gangs to scavenge for scraps, their bodies bearing the scars of knife fights with competitors. Crowds of adults storm Dumpsters after restaurants close. Babies die because it is hard to find or afford infant formula, even in emergency rooms.

“Sometimes they die in your arms just from dehydration,” Dr. Milagros Hernández said in the emergency room of a children’s hospital in the northern city of Barquisimeto, noting that the hospital had started seeing an increase in malnourished patients at the end of 2016.

“But in 2017 the increase in malnourished patients has been terrible,” she added. “Children arrive with the same weight and height of a newborn.”

Before Venezuela’s economy started spiraling, doctors say, almost all of the child malnutrition cases they saw in public hospitals stemmed from neglect or abuse by parents. But as the economic crisis began to intensify in 2015 and 2016, the number of cases of severe malnutrition at the nation’s leading pediatric health center in the capital more than tripled, doctors say. This year looks even worse.

In many countries, extreme malnutrition “can be caused when there is war, a drought, some sort of catastrophe or an earthquake,” said Dr. Ingrid Soto de Sanabria, the chief of the hospital’s nutrition, growth and development department. “But in our country it is directly related to the shortages and inflation.”

The Venezuelan government has tried to cover up the extent of the crisis by enforcing a near-total blackout of health statistics, and by creating a culture in which doctors are often afraid to register cases and deaths that may be associated with the government’s failures.

But the statistics that have come out are staggering. In the Ministry of Health’s 2015 annual report, the mortality rate for children under 4 weeks old had increased a hundredfold, from 0.02 percent in 2012 to just over 2 percent. Maternal mortality had increased nearly fivefold in the same period.

For almost two years, the government did not publish a single epidemiological bulletin tracking statistics like infant mortality. Then in April of this year, a link suddenly appeared on the Health Ministry’s official website, leading to the unpublished bulletins. They showed that 11,446 children under the age of 1 had died in 2016 — a 30 percent increase in one year — as the economic crisis accelerated.

The new findings made national and international headlines before the government declared that the website had been hacked, and the reports were swiftly removed. The health minister was fired and the military was put in charge of monitoring the bulletins. No reports have been released since.

Doctors are censored in hospitals, too, often warned not to include malnutrition in children’s medical records.

“In some public hospitals, the clinical diagnosis of malnutrition has been prohibited,” Dr. Huníades Urbina said.

But doctors interviewed by The Times at nine of the 21 public hospitals said that they had kept at least some count. They encountered nearly 2,800 cases of child malnutrition in the last year alone, with starving children regularly brought to emergency rooms. Nearly 400 of the children died, the doctors said.

“Never in my life had I seen so many hungry children,” said Dr. Livia Machado, a pediatrician who gives free consultations at her private practice to children who had been hospitalized at Dr. Domingo Luciani Hospital in the capital, Caracas.

The hospital is one of the few still accepting malnourished infants for treatment. Other hospitals often turn them away, telling desperate parents that they do not have enough beds or medical supplies to treat their children. Nearly all of Venezuelan hospitals report shortages of basic provisions like baby formula.

President Nicolás Maduro has acknowledged that people are hungry in Venezuela, but he has refused to accept international aid, often saying that Venezuela’s economic problems are caused by foreign adversaries like the United States, which he says is waging an economic war against his country.

Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But many economists contend that years of economic mismanagement set the stage for the current disaster. The damage was masked when oil prices were high, giving the government large resources. But when oil prices began a steep fall at the end of 2014, scarcities became common and food prices skyrocketed. Inflation could reach 2,300 percent next year, the International Monetary Fund warned in October.

The Health Ministry and the National Institute of Nutrition did not respond to requests for interviews or official health reports containing malnutrition statistics. But the nation’s political opposition, which has been stripped of its power by the government, continues to sound the alarm.

“We have a people who are dying of hunger,” Luis Florido, a congressman who leads the National Assembly’s foreign policy committee, told lawmakers in November, calling the food crisis “a humanitarian emergency that all Venezuelans are living.”

‘So Many Children’

Kenyerber was born healthy: 6 pounds 7 ounces. But his mother, María Carolina Merchán, 29, was bitten by a mosquito and infected with a severe case of the Zika virus when Kenyerber was 3 months old. She had to be hospitalized, and doctors instructed her to stop breast feeding because of serious complications from her illness.

Unable to find or afford infant formula, the family improvised with whatever they could find: bottles of cream of rice or cornstarch, mixed with whole milk. It did not provide Kenyerber with the nutrients he needed.

At 9 months, his father found him listless in bed, with blood running from his nose. He rushed him to the overcrowded pediatric emergency room at Dr. Domingo Luciani hospital, where patients and beds spill out of rooms, into dingy hallways paced by armed soldiers.

Kleiver Enrique Hernández, 3 months old, was being treated for severe malnutrition a few beds down from Kenyerber. He too was born healthy — 8 pounds 2 ounces — but his mother, Kelly Hernández, could not breast-feed him, either.

Again, despite searching endlessly, Ms. Hernández and her boyfriend, César González, could not get infant formula for their son. It was not for lack of trying.

In online inventory searches of Locatel, one of the largest pharmacy chains in Venezuela, The Times found that only one of its 64 locations across the country reported having the infant formula doctors had prescribed for Kleiver in stock.

It is unlikely that Ms. Hernández could have afforded it anyway. Hyperinflation has shriveled wages paid in the local currency, bolívars, to a small fraction of what they were worth two years ago. A month’s worth of the formula Kleiver needed cost more than twice the entire monthly salary that Mr. González earned as an agricultural worker.

Formula shortages hit the hospitals, too. Doctors in the emergency room at Dr. Domingo Luciani hospital said they had no formula in stock to feed patients like Kenyerber and Kleiver. The 2016 National Survey of Hospitals found that 96 percent of Venezuelan hospitals reported not having all of the infant formula they needed to attend to patients. More than 63 percent reported having no formula at all.

With so few options, Kleiver’s mother warily prepared bottles of rice starch and water, occasionally with whole milk, when they could find it. It was not enough.

His parents had taken him to three emergency rooms. Each hospital was full. “I was desperate — and seeing so many, so many children in the same situation as our boy,” Ms. Hernández said.

When they were admitted to Dr. Domingo Luciani, they were tremendously relieved. But soon they watched a steady stream of parents arriving with malnourished babies — only to leave, crying, “My child has died!”

They waited anxiously for Kleiver’s condition to improve, sleeping in a chair by his side or in the courtyard outside, on alert to go searching for any supplies the doctors might ask for.

After 20 days in the hospital, they became one of the families they had watched in horror. A team of doctors worked for hours to help Kleiver, inadvertently covering him in blood and bruises as they tried to insert a tube into his neck. By the time doctors finally accepted that they could not save him, his lifeless body looked brutally beaten. Kleiver had suffered an incredibly painful death, his doctors said — one that they said could have been avoided had infant formula been available.

Severe acute malnutrition is both self-evident and strikingly complex. Even when doctors are open to recording it for a patient, it is not necessarily the official cause of death. Instead, acute malnutrition can set off a range of pathologies in the human body, leading to death from respiratory failure, infection or other ailments. But in the case of Kenyerber and Kleiver, a rare situation occurred for Venezuela: Severe malnutrition was listed as a cause of death on their death certificates.

More than 100 friends and family members came to the all-night wake in Kleiver’s family home. His aunts and cousins hung large posters decorated with colorful hand-drawn cartoons and messages. Kleiver lay underneath, in a small white coffin, on paper wings.

Just three months earlier, the family had colored signs and tacked them to the walls — to celebrate his birth. One still hung over his bed the night of his wake, cut into the shape of a balloon.

“Welcome Kleiver Enrique, I love you so much,” it said.

After the sun came up, the neighborhood held a large funeral procession to the cemetery. Ms. Hernández collapsed on a nearby tombstone, sobbing uncontrollably. Overcome by the guilt of not being able to breast-feed or find infant formula for her son, she shouted repeatedly, “Am I an awful mother? Please, just say it!”

Helpless and Indignant

In Barquisimeto, Dr. Hernández rushed into the emergency room, shouting: “I’m coming in with an 18-day-old baby. He was fed with anise tea, cow’s milk and sometimes breast-fed by a neighbor. It’s a bad one!”

Doctors and nurses at Dr. Agustín Zubillaga University Hospital of Pediatrics worked quickly to assess the baby, Esteban Granadillo. He weighed 4 pounds 10 ounces, and looked scared, fixing his hollow eyes on the doctors outside the thick plastic walls of his incubator.

“Tell me what you gave him to eat,” Dr. Hernández asked the boy’s great-aunt, María Peraza, who had taken him to the hospital. “This child’s stomach was destroyed and possibly even his liver by what you fed him!”

Children suffering from malnutrition occupied four of the 12 beds in the pediatric emergency room that day in August. Doctors there said they had received malnutrition cases nearly every day — a rarity until the crisis started getting worse two years ago.

But only a fraction of the medicines they need are available. In June, the hospital director at the time, Dr. Jorge Gaiti, said he had requested 193 necessary medications from the government agency responsible for distributing them to public hospitals. Only four of the 193 were delivered, according to the reports visible on his computer. The hospital even lacks the most basic medical supplies — soap, syringes, gauze, diapers and latex gloves.

Nurses send parents away with lists of items to look for in pharmacies or to buy from the black-market vendors who circle the hospital, selling exorbitantly priced, hard-to-find medical supplies.

Dr. Hernández said she felt indignant and helpless as a doctor, as children died in her emergency room unnecessarily. “It is unfair,” she said.

Esteban’s mother was single, disabled and unable to breast-feed him, his great-aunt said. In desperation, relatives had asked a neighbor with a young child to step in and breast-feed. The family also fed him bottles of cow’s milk, or chamomile water and anise tea, to fill his stomach.

“We could not find formula anywhere,” said Ms. Peraza, the great-aunt, acknowledging that she knew the food could hurt the baby. “Yes, it was bad, but I tell you — if we had not done it, this baby would have died.”

Ms. Peraza stayed at the hospital next to Esteban’s incubator for days, stroking his stomach through the openings and whispering softly to him. He spent weeks in and out of the hospital — and died on Oct. 8.

Three floors above, pediatricians examined a 1-month-old baby, Rusneidy Rodríguez, a week after she was admitted for severe malnutrition. Her mother, hospitalized with an infection, had been unable to breast-feed her. As in Esteban’s case, her relatives had been unable to find formula, so they made bottles out of what they could find: whole milk, cream of rice, or water mixed with barley — an ingredient used to make beer.

The emergency room was so overwhelmed that gurneys overflowed into the hallway. Sometimes the hospital has to double up patients, two per bed.

In the incubator next to Esteban, a 5-month-old girl, Dayferlin Aguilar, struggled to open her eyes and smile at her mother, Albiannys Castillo. Ms. Castillo had brought Dayferlin to the hospital when the little girl became very weak, falling in and out of consciousness and suffering uncontrollable diarrhea. Doctors diagnosed malnutrition and dehydration.

Ms. Castillo could not produce any breast milk, so she routinely arrived at 1 a.m. to wait in line outside pharmacies until they opened, to search for infant formula. More often than not, she said, they had none in stock or would run out by the time she got to the front of the line.

“Your mamá is here with you, my daughter — and I love you,” she told Dayferlin when the little girl managed to open her eyes.

Dayferlin died three days after being admitted to the hospital. She was buried with fuchsia-colored wings made from paper, trimmed in turquoise, with a matching crown placed on her head.

Digging Through Garbage

Oriana Caraballo, 29, waited in line for hours with her three children — Brayner, 8; Rayman, 6; and Sofia, 22 months — to enter a crowded soup kitchen run by a local Roman Catholic church in Los Teques. Aside from drinking water, they had not eaten for three days.

Before the crisis, Ms. Caraballo fed her children using the wages from her job at a restaurant. Now she wept as she spooned soup into Sofia’s mouth — and recounted how her children had foiled her suicide attempt.

Ms. Caraballo could not bear the pain of watching her children go hungry. She said she had taken them outside her home, while her baby daughter was sleeping, then went back inside and shut the door. She hung a cable and wrapped it around her neck, she said. When she was just about to hang herself, she heard her daughter start to cry.

“I heard a voice tell me, ‘Do it, do it, do it,’” she said. “Then in my other ear I heard, ‘Don’t do it, don’t do it — look at your children.’”

Her son called to her, telling her to open the door. She became overcome with guilt and decided against suicide. Her oldest son has fainted several times at school, from going without breakfast or dinner the night before. He cries every night because he is hungry and, at 8, begs his mother to let him work to buy food for the family.

A recent report by the United Nations and the Pan American Health Organization found that 1.3 million people who used to be able to feed themselves in Venezuela have had difficulty doing so since the economic crisis began three years ago.

In soup kitchens around the country visited by The Times, many of the parents who brought their children had full-time jobs. But hyperinflation had destroyed their salaries and savings. A 2016 survey by three Venezuelan universities found that nine out of 10 households had become “food insecure” in Venezuela.

Caritas, the Roman Catholic aid group, has been weighing and measuring groups of children under 5 in working-class communities in multiple states since last year. Fifty-four percent of children in them suffer from some sort of malnutrition, the study has found.

Many families scavenge for food in the streets or at garbage dumps. Few are homeless, and most said they had never had trouble finding food before the crisis. Hundreds of people can be seen picking through garbage cans each evening when restaurants, grocery stores and residential buildings take out their trash for collection.

In the coastal town of Morón, dozens of people waded knee-deep in garbage at a large dump, looking for food and recyclables to sell. The nearby port in Puerto Cabello was once the driving force behind the local economy. Now it is largely empty.

Many of the people picking through the trash at the dump said that they used to work in the port but were now desperate to feed their families after being laid off once ship traffic slowed to a trickle. Several mothers said they had never imagined having to feed their families from discarded garbage.

Families are also increasingly sending their children into the streets to beg, or to work for money for food. Some never returned.

Turning to the Streets, or Sterilization

In Caracas, two brothers — José Luis Armas, 11, and Luis Armas, 9 — said they had run away from home, where there was scarcely enough to eat. Now they live in the streets with other homeless boys in street gangs, getting into knife fights to expand or defend their territories and to control areas for panhandling or picking through garbage for recycling.

Several of their friends have been killed, they said. Luis raised his shirt to show a large gash across his stomach — the result, he said, of a machete attack by a member of another gang. The attack nearly killed him, he said.

They say they prefer to live on the streets, despite the danger, because they eat better than they could living at home with their families. They spend their days panhandling, searching for discarded food and recyclables, bathing in public fountains, stashing their belongings in trees and storm drains, while constantly avoiding run-ins with the police and rival gangs.

Nelson Villasmil, a government social worker in the capital, said that before the crisis, most of the homeless children he encountered lived in the streets because of parental negligence or abuse. But now when he interviews them, he says, they often tell him they left their homes because there was no food to eat.

“What they cannot find in their houses, they go to find in the street,” Mr. Villasmil said.

Three months ago, Yail Fonseca, 13, said he left his home in Los Valles del Tuy to search for food in Caracas.

“I left my home because things are hard,” he said. “We weren’t eating well.”

He says he eats better as a homeless person on his own in the capital than at home with his family on the outskirts of the city. He sleeps under an overhang at an outdoor skate park with a group of other homeless adults and children, waking up at 6 a.m. to search through garbage for food or beg for handouts from local restaurants.

In the evenings, he says, he practices sparring with other young members of his gang, using sticks to become more agile at knife fights. His leader requires them to practice at least 30 minutes a day.

The gang leader, an adult who would not reveal his full name, said they had a code: If anyone in the gang is attacked by a single member of a rival gang, he must defend himself alone, even to the death, no matter how old he is. The rest of the gang will step in only if a member is attacked by multiple rivals at once. Four young members of the gang had been stabbed to death in recent months, the leader said. The boys around him lifted up their shirts to show their own scars.

Sometimes the state steps in, taking away children from some homes where hunger is common. After two of their children died of complications from malnutrition, Nerio Parra and Abigail Torres lost three more — to social workers.

Their 7-month-old daughter, Nerianyelis, died in September 2016 when the family could not find infant formula for sale, they said. Mr. Parra had a full-time job at a company that makes labels, but the couple said they could afford to feed their children only once a day. The morning Nerianyelis died, she was sluggish and very thin. Her parents said they had carried her in the rain to the hospital, to no avail.

Abigail was so distraught that she broke down and refused to let go of her daughter’s body, they said. Hospital security had to forcibly separate the two. Then on Dec. 1, 2016, their 5-year-old son, Neomar, who suffered from malnutrition, dehydration and other ailments, died as well, his case worker said.

After Neomar died, social services took away the three remaining children and placed them in group homes. Now, the couple visit their surviving children and go to the cemetery to visit the graves of their deceased ones.

The burden of caring for children in Venezuela can be so great these days that many women are opting to be sterilized. Just after dawn one Saturday in July, 21 young women dressed in surgical gowns waited to be surgically sterilized during a free event at the state-run José Gregorio Hernández Hospital in a working-class neighborhood of the capital.

The hospital says it has sterilized more than 300 women through this program. On that Saturday, all 21 of the women, who ranged from 25 to 32 years old, said they already had children and wanted to be sterilized because the economic crisis had made it too difficult to raise children. Each feared becoming pregnant again, citing dire shortages of essential supplies like diapers, formulas, milk and medicine.

The crisis has also led to widespread shortages of birth-control pills and condoms. Many of the mothers at the sterilization event said that their most recent pregnancies had been unplanned and unwanted, but that they did not have access to birth control.

Eddy Farías, 25, a hair stylist, said she was nervous about the operation but resolute in her decision to undergo it. As a single mother with a full-time job, she said her wages at a salon were barely enough to feed her five children.

“It’s hard to be a mom,” she said. “If your child gets sick, you have to run circles trying to find a hospital,” she added. “It is a war just to survive day to day.”

After her operation, she said, she was in pain from the large incision across her lower abdomen, but relieved.

“If I got pregnant again, that would mean I’d have to go to war again for diapers,” she said. “It is like war to have to buy diapers on the black market, or have to wake up before dawn to wait in long lines and fight others for the food, the diapers, the personal things a child needs.”

Skipping Meals So Her Children Can Eat

Six weeks after cutting out angel wings from the food rations box to bury Kenyerber, his family was still battling hunger.

His mother, María Carolina Merchán, said she had wilted to 66 pounds from skipping meals so that her four surviving children had a little more to eat. Government social workers said she was severely malnourished, as were her own mother and her 6-year old daughter, Marianyerlis. The family has gone as long as five days at a time without consuming anything besides water.

Marianyerlis follows Ms. Merchán around for hours, wailing and sobbing, begging for food. Ms. Merchán stares blankly at the floor as tears roll down the little girl’s cheeks.

“Mama, I’m hungry!” she cries.

Her weight fluctuates between 20 and 29 pounds, depending on how much food she is able to get. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists 6-year-old girls who weigh less than 35 pounds in the lowest fifth percentile. Marianyerlis recently fainted after going two days without eating.

The family have made their home with relatives in an abandoned government housing project, with no running water or indoor plumbing, and jury-rigged electricity. It is uncomfortable, but all of their income must be spent on food.

Baby portraits of the children, one of their few cherished belongings, hang prominently on the wall. The only food in the entire house is half a bag of salt, and one lime.

“This is a nightmare,” said Ms. Merchán’s sister, Andreína del Valle Merchán, 25, describing how the children start to vomit, sweat and become sluggish after days of not eating. Her own 5-year-old daughter had lost 11 pounds this year and now weighed only 17 pounds, she said.

The suffering of Venezuelan families is expected to worsen next year. Beyond the I.M.F.’s warning that inflation could surpass 2,300 percent, observers worry that the leftist government will continue to refuse international aid for political reasons.

“If they accept the help, they accept that there is a humanitarian crisis here, and officially recognize that their population is vulnerable, and just how much their policies failed them,” said Susana Raffalli, a specialist on food emergencies who consults for Caritas in Venezuela.

The Venezuelan government has used food to keep the Socialists in power, critics say. Before recent elections, people living in government housing projects said they were visited by representatives of their local Socialist community councils — the government-aligned groups that organize the delivery of boxes of cheap food — and threatened with being cut off if they did not vote for the government.

Kenyerber’s relatives do not expect the economic crisis to improve anytime soon. They fear that another child in the family may die as well.

“I worry about it day and night,” said his aunt, Andreína.",JustBadNews,0
Amazon removes circumcision training kits from sale: Critics say non-therapeutic circumcision in the UK is unethical and puts infant boys at risk of serious injury.,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/20/amazon-removes-circumcision-training-kits-from-sale,"Amazon has removed circumcision training kits from its UK website after complaints that they normalised unnecessary and risky practice.

The infant circumcision training kits were offered for sale by ESP through Amazon, retailing at between £365.16 and £456.60. It included a model of a boy’s genitals made from “lifelike” material, plus scissors and scalpels.

Amazon UK withdrew the kits from sale after being urged to do so in a letter from the National Secular Society (NSS).

Dr Antony Lempert, the chair of the NSS’s secular medical forum, wrote: “Male circumcision in the UK is wholly unregulated and we fear that the sale of this product may encourage unqualified practitioners to carry out unnecessary surgery on infants in non-clinical conditions, resulting in serious harm.

“Non-therapeutic circumcision is unethical and unnecessary and is putting infant boys at risk of death and serious injury. This practice could be encouraged by the morally negligent sale of infant circumcision training kits to the public.”

Amazon confirmed on Wednesday it had removed the products. The kits, available in a variety of colours, were advertised as “made with soft, lifelike material, which is pliable, delicate, and realistic to the touch”. Associated accessories could be purchased separately. Similar kits remain for sale on Amazon’s US site.

Lempert said the sellers had misrepresented the health benefits of circumcision. “No medical association in the world actively recommends routine infant male circumcision for health reasons,” he wrote. “Any associated claims for medical benefit of surgical training equipment should be accurate.”



Ritual male circumcision is practised by Jews and Muslims. The British Association of Paediatric Surgeons advises there is rarely a clinical reason for circumcision and that it should always be performed by, or under the supervision of, doctors trained in children’s surgery.

In January 2015 the head of the family division of the high court in England and Wales, Sir James Munby, said non-therapeutic infant male circumcision caused “significant harm” to boys.

The practice has been linked to serious injuries and deaths. In 2009, Birmingham children’s hospital’s A&E department admitted 105 boys for circumcision related injuries. In 2011, the hospital admitted 11 boys aged from newborn to one year old to its paediatric intensive care unit with life-threatening complications directly caused by circumcision.

The NSS campaigns for non-consensual, non-therapeutic circumcision to be outlawed and its chief executive, Stephen Evans, welcomed Amazon UK’s decision to stop selling the kits.

He said: “No child should be subjected to unnecessary medical surgery. The morally negligent sale of infant circumcision training kits to the public normalises this form of abuse and risks encouraging it.

“A growing number of medics and lawyers are questioning forced genital cutting and recognising the need to safeguard boys from this unethical practice. Religious freedom is not an absolute right and certainly doesn’t justify the amputation of healthy, functioning body parts from babies’ bodies.”

"Internet Defenders Urge Mass Revolt to Fight FCC's ""Scorched-Earth"" Attack on Net Neutrality: ""FCC Pai is handing over the internet to a few humongous gatekeepers who see the rest of us as products to be delivered to advertisers, not as citizens needing communications that serve democracy's needs.'",https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/11/21/internet-defenders-urge-mass-revolt-fight-fccs-scorched-earth-attack-net-neutrality,"Open internet advocates warned that ""we're running out of time"" to save the web from corporate control and called on Americans to make their representatives' phones ""ring off the hook"" Tuesday after FCC chairman Ajit Pai unveiled (pdf) his long-awaited plan to scrap net neutrality that critics slammed as ""naked corporatism"" designed to give a major gift to the telecom industry at the expense of the public.

""The reckless wrecking ball strikes again,"" former FCC commissioner and current special adviser at Common Cause Michael Copps said in a statement. ""FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's scorched-earth plan for net neutrality displays callous disregard for both process and substance. The chairman's plan to do away with net neutrality will be a disaster for consumers and yet another handout for big business.""

Matt Wood, policy director at Free Press, said Pai's plan ""makes no sense"" for a variety of key reasons.



""Internet rights are civil rights. Gutting net neutrality will have a devastating effect on free speech online.""

—Jay Stanley, ACLU

""It ignores the will of people from across the political spectrum who overwhelmingly support these protections. It ignores the law and the courts, which have repeatedly upheld the 2015 Title II rules. And it ignores the vibrancy of the internet marketplace following adoption of that 2015 order, with incontrovertible economic data showing that both investment in networks and online innovation are flourishing under the very same rules Pai wants to destroy,"" Wood said.

#NetNeutrality is NOT DEAD YET. Congress has stopped FCC votes before. Do NOT give up! 1) RETWEET this to help spread the word that we can still stop this. 2) CALL your lawmakers: https://t.co/S8d0OxZQe0 3) PROTEST at Verizon stores on Dec 7: https://t.co/OvdNJe0Idh pic.twitter.com/oPXgyGRsam — Fight for the Future (@fightfortheftr) November 21, 2017

Framed by Pai and its corporate backers as a push to ""restore internet freedom,"" the plan outlined Tuesday would do precisely the opposite, say critics, by allowing massive telecom companies to block or throttle online content and charge more for services.

""Internet rights are civil rights,"" Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, declared in a statement on Tuesday. ""Gutting net neutrality will have a devastating effect on free speech online. Without it, gateway corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T will have too much power to mess with the free flow of information.""

The praise Pai's plan quickly attracted from major corporations appeared to vindicate critics' concerns that the Republican-controlled FCC is working to deliver a massive ""handout to big business."" In a statement on Tuesday, Verizon said it is ""very encouraged"" by the proposed return to ""light-touch"" regulation—disregarding the fact that opinion polls have clearly and consistently shown that American consumers favor net neutrality.

But if Pai's announcement on Tuesday is any evidence, he gives public opinion very little weight. As Devin Coldewey of Tech Crunch notes, Pai ""made no mention of the inconvenient and embarrassing fact that his proposal had attracted historic attention, garnering over 22 million comments—the majority of which opposed it.""

""There can be no truly open internet without net neutrality. To believe otherwise is to be captive to special interest power brokers.""

—Michael Copps, Common Cause

If Pai's proposals are approved—the FCC is expected to vote on December 14—companies like Verizon and AT&T will be given extremely broad leeway to charge consumers more for internet access, products, and services while facing less oversight.

In addition to reversing the classification of the internet as a public utility, Pai's plan would strip the FCC of enforcement power and effectively rely on what critics have derided as an ""honor system,"" under which corporations will be responsible for transparently reporting their practices.

""Relying more heavily on Internet providers' own promises on net neutrality is a departure from the current rules, which lay out clear, federal bans against selectively blocking or slowing websites, as well as speeding up websites that agree to pay the providers a fee,"" observes the Washington Post's Brian Fung.

Copps of Common Cause concluded that contrary to Pai's lofty rhetoric about ""restoring internet freedom,"" the newly unveiled proposals would spell the end of the open internet.



""There can be no truly open internet without net neutrality,"" Copps said in a statement on Tuesday. ""To believe otherwise is to be captive to special interest power brokers or to an old and discredited ideology that thinks monopoly and not government oversight best serves the nation. In this case, I think it's both. The FCC under Pai is handing over the internet to a few humongous gatekeepers who see the rest of us as products to be delivered to advertisers, not as citizens needing communications that serve democracy's needs.""",JustBadNews,0
Russia's Finance Ministry has proposed a law to make importing sanctioned products a criminal offense punishable by up to 12 years behind bars.,https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russian-ministry-urges-heavy-prison-sentences-importing-western-produce-59602,"Russia's Finance Ministry has proposed a law to make importing sanctioned products a criminal offense punishable by up to 12 years behind bars.

Russia imposed sanctions on products from the U.S., EU and other Western countries in 2014 in response to their sanctions over Moscow’s role in Ukraine. Sanctioned goods, however, continue to appear in the Russian market.

The proposed law would only apply to corporations and sole proprietors, not to individuals.

The illegal import of goods would be punishable by a prison term of 3 to 7 years with a fine of up to a million rubles ($17,000). Prison terms for organized groups importing Western produce would be as high as 7 to 12 years.

Currently, fines for illegal imports range from 2,500 rubles ($42) for individuals to 20,000 ($335) for officials and 300,000 ($5,030) for corporations.

In February of this year, a draft law proposing fines for storage and transport of such goods failed to pass in parliament, The Bell reports.

A source told The Bell that to get a truckload of illegal apples through Russian customs costs around $2,500 in bribes.

That figure — and the cost of imported food — will only go up if prison terms are imposed for such smuggling, the source said.",JustBadNews,0

In Sonoma County, the dead were found “in the hot spots” of the fire, an official said.

“We are a resilient county; we will come back from this,” said Sonoma County Supervisor Shirlee Zane. “But right now we need to grieve.”

The vast devastation over just a few hours made this firestorm one of the worst in California history, with Gov. Jerry Brown declaring a state of emergency. Officials said the fires in Northern California have scorched 73,000 acres.

Local hospitals were treating those injured while others are unaccounted for, officials said. Additional fatalities were possible as search efforts continued.

One of the raging fires had Santa Rosa under siege Monday morning, with a large swath of the city north of downtown under an evacuation order.

The area of Fountaingrove appeared to be particularly hard hit, with photos showing numerous homes on fire. The Fountaingrove Inn, a Hilton hotel and a high school also burned. Officials said homes were also lost in the community of Kenwood and at a mobile home park off the 101 Freeway.

Coffey Park, a large Santa Rosa subdivision of dozens of homes, was burned to the ground.

“It’s fair to say it’s been destroyed,” Cal Fire director Ken Pimlott said of Santa Rosa’s Fountaingrove neighborhood.

“Late last night starting around 10 o’clock you had 50 to 60 mph winds that surfaced — really across the whole northern half of the state,” he said. “Every spark is going to ignite.”

Northern California has seen its share of horrific wildfires — the state’s second-deadliest is the October 1991 Tunnel fire in the Oakland Hills, in which 25 people died. The Tunnel also ranks as the most destructive, charring 2,900 buildings.

But the combination of high winds, dried-up vegetation and low humidity driving flames into neighborhoods is more typical of Southern California.

“This is exactly what you would expect in the Southern California fall fire season,” Pimlott said.

Despite a wet winter, he said vegetation still hasn’t recovered from California’s punishing drought, and at the end of the summer dry season, was ready to burn.

Firefighters are hopeful the winds will calm Monday afternoon. But red flag weather conditions will persist into Tuesday.

The city of Santa Rosa imposed a curfew starting at 6:45 p.m. Monday until sunrise Tuesday to prevent looting of empty homes in the evacuation zone, said acting Santa Rosa police chief Craig Schwartz.

“We have had a number of reports in the evacuation zone and the fire zone of people driving around and suspicious behavior,” Schwartz said.

While many evacuation centers were set up, some were filled to capacity due to the large number of people fleeing.

The Tubbs fire near Santa Rosa has burned more than 35,000 acres as of 6:40 a.m., Napa County Supervisor Diane Dillon said during a televised news conference Monday morning. Officials said the other large fire in Napa County — Atlas Peak — has reached 25,000 acres.

Schools throughout the Napa and Sonoma valleys were closed for the day, and cellphone service has been affected in Napa County, where residents and businesses are experiencing power outages and trees have been knocked down by the wind, officials said.

More than 50 structures, including homes and barns, have burned in the Atlas Peak fire alone, Napa County Fire Chief Barry Biermann said during the news conference.

Residents described running from the approaching flames early in the morning.

Late Sunday night, Ken Moholt-Siebert noticed the smell of the smoke from his Santa Rosa vineyard just off Highway 101.

It was not until midnight that he spotted the flames: a small red glow growing a couple of ridges to the east, off Fountaingrove Parkway.

He ran up the hill on his property to turn on a water pump to protect the ranch his family has been raising sheep and growing grapes on for four generations.

Before the pump could get the water fully flowing, a small ember from the Tubbs fire landed nearby. With the wind picking up, the ember sparked a spot fire about 50 feet in diameter. Then it was 100 feet in diameter.

“There was no wind, then there would be a rush of wind and it would stop. Then there would be another gust from a different direction,” Moholt-Siebert, 51, said. “The flames wrapped around us.”

He ran for cover.

“I was just being pelted with all this smoke and embers,” he said. “It was just really fast.”

Moholt-Siebert retreated through a 150-year-old redwood barn on his property — where his son’s wedding reception had been held in June. He jumped a fence back toward his house and fell to the ground to catch gulps of less smoke-contaminated air before reaching his home.

As he fled with his wife Melissa in their Ford sedans, the flames reached their vineyard full of Pinot Noir grapes and crept toward a 200-year-old oak tree on the property — the namesake for the family winery, Ancient Oak Cellars.

As he drove through falling embers and smoke he thought about what he left behind. The sheep on his ranch, he thought, would be safe since they were on shortly cut wet grass. He left behind family mementos and furniture from his grandparents.

The property was dotted with old valley and black oak as well as some California ash trees.

“That is probably all gone,” Moholt-Siebert said. “I have a feeling there is not going to be much left.”

Smoke from the fires drifted into the Bay Area, into San Francisco and as far south as San Jose.

In Santa Rosa, Kaiser Permanente Hospital and Sutter Hospital were evacuated.

“We have safely evacuated the Santa Rosa medical center due to fires burning in the area. Many patients were transported to Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael and other local hospitals,” Kaiser spokeswoman Jenny Mack said in an email. “All scheduled appointments and surgeries have been canceled for the day in Santa Rosa and the Napa medical offices.”

The Santa Rosa fire began around 10 p.m. The cause of the fires is still under investigation.

Upward of 300 firefighters are battling the blazes in Napa County, she said. There are three evacuation centers for Napa County residents, though one — the Crosswalk Community Church — is full, she said. The other two are the Calistoga Fairgrounds and at Napa Valley College.

Those who evacuated described a chaotic scene.

Around 2 a.m., the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office ordered evacuations around Kay Drive and Mark West Station Road in Windsor. Jen Ancic, 31, fled with her two young sons and boyfriend.

As the family drove north on U.S. Highway 101, Ancic said she could see buildings and trees burning.

“The whole town was on fire,” she said. “It was crazy.”

A Santa Rosa native, Ancic said that fires in the mountains are not uncommon, but “nothing like this has happened in Santa Rosa.”

She was devastated to learn from online news reports that Coffey Park, where she’d played as a child and had recently held a recent birthday party for her son, had burned. “There’s nothing left,” Ancic said.

Weather conditions — strong winds and high temperatures — made conditions ripe for a major inferno.

“We also had really gusty winds and really warm temperatures,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Mehle. “This time of year it does happen quite a bit. For the San Francisco Bay Area, our summer is late September to early October; that’s when we have our warmest and driest conditions.”

Fires in Northern an Southern Calif. create widespread damage, destroying homes and claiming live

The destructiveness of the fires shocked officials. The worst fire in recent California history was the Cedar blaze in San Diego County in 2003, which destroyed more than 2,800 homes. The 2007 Witch fire, also in San Diego County, destroyed more than 1,600. Both of those fires occurred in October.

“This time of year is when historically the state’s largest, most damaging and most deadly fires have occurred,” Upton said. “Critical fire conditions fanned by high winds” act as “a fuse for sparks,” she said.

A key reason why the fires burning through Napa and Sonoma counties became so devastating was that the ignitions happened at the worst possible moment: extremely dry conditions combined with so-called Diablo winds that fanned flames on the ridgetops with gusts as high as 70 mph.

It’s similar to the conditions that caused one of the most destructive blazes in Northern California history, the October 1991 firestorm that struck the Oakland and Berkeley hills that killed 25 people and destroyed more than 3,300 single-family homes.

The wine country fires so far haven’t approached that level of catastrophe, with officials reporting at least 1,500 structures lost, in part because the area burned isn’t as densely populated as the area that was hit hard in 1991.

Staffers at Safari West, a wildlife preserve in Santa Rosa, fled the property Sunday night, but some employees returned Monday afternoon to find the fire “basically jumped over” the preserve Sunday night.

“There are still a lot of fires all around so the situation is very dynamic at the moment,” Safari West executive director Keo Hornbostel wrote in an email.

The 400-acre property is known for its rhinos, giraffes, zebras and other animals. Guests also can stay in tents on site.

Marie Martinez, conservation and outreach manager at Safari West, said that staff and guests left the facility Sunday night, with staffers taking some birds and a tortoise with them.Erin Harrison, director of marketing and communications at Oakland Zoo, said the zoo is willing to coordinate evacuation of the Safari West animals if needed.

"Coca-Cola increased its production of plastic bottles by a billion last year, says Greenpeace - Increase puts Coke's production at more than 110bn single-use plastic bottles a year",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/02/coca-cola-increased-its-production-of-plastic-bottles-by-a-billion-last-year-say-greenpeace,"Coca-Cola increased its production of throwaway plastic bottles last year by well over a billion, according to analysis by Greenpeace.

The world’s biggest soft drinks company does not disclose how much plastic packaging it puts into the market. But analysis by the campaign group Greenpeace reveals what they say is an increase in production of single-use PET bottles from 2015-2016.

The increase puts Coke’s production at more than 110bn bottles each year, according to Greenpeace.

Coca-Cola has confirmed that single-use plastic bottles made up 59% of its global packaging in 2016 compared to 58% in the 12 months before.

The scale of production contributes to a plastic mountain which is growing vastly year on year. Figures obtained by the Guardian reveal that by 2021 the number of plastic drinks bottles produced globally will reach more than half a trillion.

But only a tiny fraction of these bottles are recycled. Fewer than half of the bottles bought in 2016 were collected for recycling and just 7% of those collected were turned into new bottles. Instead, most plastic bottles produced end up in landfill or in the ocean.

Between 5m and 13m tonnes of plastic leaks into the world’s oceans each year to be ingested by sea birds, fish and other organisms, and by 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic by weight than fish, according to research by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Louise Edge, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace, said: “Coca-Cola talks the talk on sustainability but the astonishing rate at which it is pumping out single-use plastic bottles is still growing.

“We have calculated it produced over 110bn throwaway plastic bottles every year – an astounding 3,400 a second – while refusing to take responsibility for its role in the plastic pollution crisis facing our oceans.

“We would love Coke to provide detailed breakdowns of what it produces – so we would welcome any clarifications they have to offer on our estimates.”

Amid growing concern about marine pollution and increasing evidence that plastic is finding its way into the food chain of fish and humans, Coca-Cola European Partners announced it had changed its mind about plastic bottle deposit schemes.

The company has expressed support for a deposit scheme and told Westminster MPs a new approach was needed to improve the stalled recycling rates in the UK of 57% for PET bottles, and is calling for collaborative efforts from government and industry to improve recycling rates.

Coca-Cola, which operates in more than 200 countries, has said disclosing the volume of plastic packaging it puts on the market annually is “commercially sensitive”.

In July Coca-Cola European Partners announced it would increase the amount of recycled plastic in its bottles to 50% by 2020.

But plastic drinking bottles could be made out of 100% recycled plastic, known as RPet – and campaigners are pressing big drinks companies to radically increase the amount of recycled plastic in their bottles.

A spokesperson from Coca-Cola Great Britain said: “Our global PET bottle usage number for 2016 is 59%, an increase of 1% from 58% in 2015. We continue to review and adjust our packaging strategy as part of our overall business plan.

“In the UK, all of our bottles and cans are 100% recyclable and have been since 2012. Our plastic bottles contain 25% recycled material and we have recently pledged to double this amount to 50% by 2020.”",JustBadNews,0
Arizona Child Removed from Loving Family and Placed into Foster Care Where She was Repeatedly Raped ? then 80% of Body Burned,http://healthimpactnews.com/2017/arizona-child-removed-from-loving-family-and-placed-into-foster-care-where-she-was-repeatedly-raped-then-80-of-body-burned/,"by Health Impact News/MedicalKidnap.com Staff



Earlier this year (June 2017) we reported on one of the most horrific examples of child abuse of a child who was taken into state custody by a “Child Protection” social service agency, and put into the foster care system, that we have ever reported.

We reported how one Arizona child was repeatedly raped as part of a pornographic pedophile ring in foster care, and then placed into a different foster home where 80% of her body was burned with scalding water.

We were only able to report on this because a court-appointed guardian of the child sued the Arizona Department of Child Safety, making the alleged crimes public knowledge. See:

(WARNING! Content in the article linked below not suitable for younger audiences!)

However, what was not published by the general media who reported on this story was the birth mother’s perspective, and why the child was taken away from her family in the first place.

Health Impact News has interviewed the mother and investigated her story, and we now bring it to the public. It is yet another example of just how corrupt child “protective” services have become, especially in Arizona.

How Arizona Removed an Innocent Child from Her Family and Destroyed her Life

A little girl from Tucson, Arizona, was taken away from her family by Child Protective Services and placed into state custody. One of the foster parents is now in prison for running a pornographic pedophile ring, and another faces criminal charges for holding her down in scalding water, causing burns over 80% of her body.

Young Devani was seized from her family just days before her second birthday. The social worker had no warrant or court order when she made the decision that would change the child’s life forever.

The question arises: What horrors did the real parents do that could justify CPS putting a child into such heinous situations?

Our investigation reveals the shocking truth: nothing.

The beautiful blond-haired, blue-eyed toddler was allegedly taken from her home under false pretenses. The allegations were shown to be wrong from the very beginning, yet CPS (now renamed DCS – Department of Child Services) continued to pursue their case, placing the child into one nightmare situation after another, which almost cost her life. Some people claim she would have been far better off if she had been killed, rather than face the horrors no child should ever have to face.

Her maternal grandmother was already approved by the State of Arizona when she adopted another child, yet DCS has consistently refused to consider placing Devani with her. Her paternal grandmother, likewise, was never considered as an option.

Though she had never been abused in her own home, Devani was placed into foster care with strangers, and her abuse began almost immediately. According to her mother:

They took that precious angel and destroyed her life. If I could take her place, I would.

More than anything, Michelle wants her little girl home with her, so that she can protect her.

In our previous report of the case, we referred to the child as “Jane Doe,” because that is what she is called in the lawsuit that was filed against the abusers and many within the State of Arizona responsible for placing her in harm’s way. (See lawsuit.)

Other media outlets have identified her in their coverage as Devani, with no last name given. Her name has since been legally changed by the people who adopted her, but she was born as Devani, and that is what we will call her.

Allegations Dismissed BEFORE Child Taken

Devani was born on April 29, 2011. She lived with her parents, Michelle Tremor-Calderon and Jonathan Hileman, in Tucson, Arizona. She was described as a happy, loving little girl who was very much loved by her family.

In early April 2013, Michelle and Jonathan got into an argument – a shouting match during which allegedly there was no physical contact and no violence. A neighbor called the police, and domestic violence charges were filed against Michelle. The charges were quickly determined to be without merit, and they were dismissed immediately.

At the time of the incident, Devani was at her paternal grandmother’s home. She did not witness the argument.

Nonetheless, DCS became involved. On April 17, the day after the charges were dismissed, social worker Norel Alviti showed up at the grandmother’s home without a court order or warrant to take Devani into state custody. Michelle and Jonathan were at work at the time.

Michelle expected that this was all a misunderstanding which would be cleared up as soon as she took the social worker documentation that the charges had been dropped. It should have been over then.

However, when Michelle showed up at the DCS office with the paperwork, the social worker Alviti then demanded that Michelle take a drug test.

This was apparently based on an anonymous report, possibly from a disgruntled neighbor, that the parents had been doing drugs. Michelle flatly denied the allegation and complied immediately.

The 10 panel drug test came back completely negative. She was clean. Again, this should have ended right then.

It did not.

Without a shred of evidence, social workers allegedly were “concerned” about the possibility that the parents might, in the future, do something that would cause harm to their child, so DCS kept Devani in their custody, placing her in very real, and unimaginably horrific, foster care situations.

Michelle and Jonathan were assigned one hoop after another to jump through in order to try to get their child back.

DCS Double Standard: Parents Investigated, but Foster Caregivers Not

As the case wore on, DCS dug further and further into the parents’ history, while apparently neglecting to dig into the history of the foster and adoptive families that they place children in.

Devani’s parents acknowledge making some bad choices in their past, but by the time Devani came along, they had cleaned up their act. They loved their daughter and wanted the best for her.

Michelle’s first child was born with a congenital heart defect. When he passed away at the age of 3, Michelle fell apart. In her pain, she turned to drugs. In 2001, she gave birth to another child, who was adopted by Michelle’s mother. It was a very difficult season in her life. But after much therapy and counseling, she was able to get her life back on track.

The DCS social worker learned about Michelle’s drug history, a season that was over by the time Devani was born. Michelle was clean, and proved it on the day that Devani was taken. During the entire time that DCS was involved with her family, Michelle has allegedly remained free of drugs.

Yet, her prior history continues to be used against her, both in the courtroom and in the media. Social workers are quick to point out her drug usage from 13 years prior, but reportedly neglect to tell the court that she has been free of drugs during Devani’s life.

Since Devani was taken, most of the focus has been on Michelle. Jonathan, Devani’s real father, saw the writing on the wall early on. He recognized that his daughter’s best chance to come home would be for him to be out of the picture. Though the original allegations used to take his daughter away were not centered on him, he knew that his history would be used against him.

Jonathan has a record. He made some very poor decisions when he was young. He was involved in a robbery and a sexual assault of an adult, for which he served a 10 year prison sentence. After he got out, he reportedly changed his ways and cleaned up his act.

When he and Michelle met, he treated her with respect and kindness. They worked hard to build a new life and leave their past behind.

There was never any child abuse, or even allegations of such, with Devani’s real parents. Sources have reported that both Michelle and Jonathan were devoted, loving parents who obviously thought the world of Devani.

However, DCS told the couple that the only hope that Michelle had of getting Devani back was for Jonathon to get out of the picture. So, he did.

Health Impact News spoke with Beth Breen, who transported Devani back and forth to visits with her parents for more than a year. In that capacity, she was able to observe the interactions between Michelle and Jonathan and their daughter:

The love between the parents and Devani – you just know it’s there.

Breen made a chilling statement about Devani’s experiences in DCS custody:

What they [DCS] were trying to protect her FROM is the exact thing that they did to her.

Abused in Foster Care from the Beginning

Right away, Michelle recognized that her baby girl was not faring well in foster care. As a loving mother who was very bonded with her child, she saw signs from the very beginning that something was desperately wrong. Her concerns were not only dismissed, but were actually used against her.

Michelle was accused of coaching her daughter and of sabotaging placements – placements which, it turned out, never should have been options for any child.

Advocates point out that DCS was quick to say they wanted to protect Devani from potential harm that could possibly come to her in the future, but hadn’t yet, based on her parents’ past history.

At the same time, they repeatedly placed the child into situations with numerous warning signs, and they ignored actual abuse that was occurring right under their noses.

According to the lawsuit:

Mandatory Reporters Failed to Report Signs of Real Abuse, Blamed Mother

As mandatory reporters, the social workers were required to report the abuse, and their failure to do so was in violation of Arizona law. Yet, no one within the system has faced any charges.

In contrast, a school vice-principal and a counselor were arrested in Tucson on felony charges for failure to report an incident that is not nearly as horrific as the abuse that Devani was subjected to. (See story.)

At the very first visit with her daughter after she was taken, Michelle noted scratches and bruises on Devani. A week later, there were more scratches and bruises, as well as bite marks. Michelle took pictures and reported the abuse to case workers and supervisors.

When nothing was done by those who were charged with protecting her child, Michelle took action and called the police herself. The foster woman became angry and dropped Devani off at the DCS office.

The second foster care placement proved disastrous. Social workers placed Devani in the care of David and Barbara Frodsham, who had been approved and licensed by the State of Arizona as foster parents since 2002.

Mr. Frodsham is currently in prison, serving a 17 year sentence for state and federal crimes. According to the lawsuit:

Almost immediately after her daughter was placed with the Frodshams, Michelle saw signs that Devani was being sexually abused. According to reports:

There were thumb marks on her daughter’s hips and arms, scratches, bruises.

She developed a painful, smelly urinary tract infection that Michelle reported to case worker Jeannette Sheldon and her supervisors, but her concern was dismissed.

Instead, Mr. Frodsham’s wife blamed Michelle, saying that the UTI was from Devani’s real mother giving her too much juice during visitations. Devani was taken to a doctor who worked with DCS, who backed up Mrs. Frodsham’s story and blamed the juice, ignoring the signs of sexual abuse.

The social workers, who are supposed to be trained in recognizing signs of abuse, didn’t question the illogical proposition that, somehow, Devani consumed so much juice in her 2 hour visit per week with her mother, under supervision, that she developed a UTI and kept it for 8 months. Nor did they question the fosters’ neglect in taking Devani to a doctor for medical treatment for an infection which caused her to hold her private area and cry in pain.

A transporter noticed the smell of the infection as well. Beth Breen worked for a transport company formerly called IMA Trans, LLC, which was contracted by DCS to transport children to and from visits with their biological parents.

Beth Breen told Health Impact News that she was the primary transporter for Devani for about a year, because Devani was terrified of male transporters. She has submitted an affidavit to the Pima County Court about what she witnessed while transporting Devani.

In the very beginning, both parents were at all the visits. Beth Breen said that the love within the family was obvious.

Later, DCS stopped allowing Devani’s father to attend the visits, due to his past history. While DCS purportedly protected her from imagined harm, the little girl was being subjected to very real harm in the house where social workers placed her.

Breen describes Devani’s excitement when she would pick her up at the Frodshams’ house and drive her for the 90 minute trip to see her parents, and later just her mother:

She was always so happy to see them, singing and happy. She would wave at her parents, blow kisses to them, and once unbuckled she would jump into her mother’s arms with a huge smile and a sigh.

The drive home was a different matter altogether. Devani would scream, kick, and cry as she reached out for her mother when she had to leave. She would often cry inconsolably for an hour or more on her way to the Frodshams, crying herself to sleep. When they arrived, she would look around and start crying again.

Beth Breen said that throughout the time that she transported Devani, she was always happy and excited about seeing her mother. The screams and cries on the way back to the Frodshams’ house, however, eventually “became more of a whimper.” She had apparently figured out that crying out was hopeless.

Devani had never demonstrated a fear of men before being at the Frodshams’ house, but after she arrived, she was absolutely terrified of men she didn’t know. DCS blamed this on Devani’s mother, even testifying in court that Michelle had “coached” her daughter.

In reality, the child had every reason to be terrified of men. During the investigation of David Frodsham and a soldier in the Army, Spec. Randall Bischak, law enforcement found a video made by Frodsham of explicit sexual abuse of a little girl about 3 or 4 years old.

While Michelle’s maternal instincts told her that her baby was being harmed, all of her concerns were ignored and dismissed.

In fact, her concerns were actually turned against her. Social workers accused Michelle of “disrupting the foster care placements” and “coaching” her daughter.

Later, investigations by ICE, Homeland Security, and the FBI proved all of Michelle’s fears for her daughter’s safety to be justified, and more charges are still expected to be filed against David Frodsham for his role in the pedophile pornography ring.

Even so, that has not mattered to DCS or the Pima County Court, as they continue to blame the mother instead of the real abusers.

Child Betrayed by Those Entrusted to her Care

Throughout the case, as per Arizona law, Devani has had an attorney appointed to represent her interests. Thea Gilbert has been with the case since the beginning. She reportedly told Devani’s family and the court that she was happy and “bonding with” the Frodshams. She said that it would be “detrimental” and “not in her best interests” for her to be removed from that placement.

The numerous signs of abuse while she was with the Frodshams didn’t outweigh the state’s apparent interest in keeping Devani in their care. Gilbert and DCS even advocated for Devani to be adopted by the Frodshams.

It wasn’t until Mr. Frodsham showed up drunk at the DCS office that Devani was removed from his house.

While at the next foster placement, Devani showed up at a visit with a goose-egg sized bump on her forehead from allegedly being slammed into a wall.

Meanwhile, Michelle was allegedly in full compliance with everything that DCS asked of her, working toward reunification. She was on time for every visit, tested clean for every drug screen, and completed every class. She has a stack of certificates to show, but wonders what it was all for.

Near the end of the reunification process, DCS brought in the Easterseals Blake Foundation, an organization contracted with DCS to do parent/child therapy. One advocate told Health Impact News that the pattern of Arizona DCS has been to assign the Blake Foundation to work with families at the end of the case, which often leads to reunification failure.

A Blake Foundation employee, Alexis Kirkendall, LMSW, was assigned to evaluate the interaction between Michelle and her traumatized daughter. Kirkendall reportedly backed up the DCS accusation that Michelle’s concerns about Devani’s placements indicated that she, not the foster placements, were unfit, and that Michelle jeopardized the foster care placements by calling the police when she suspected abuse.

Kirkendall and DCS caseworker Jeanette Sheldon reportedly testified that Devani wasn’t bonded well with her mother because “she exhibited prolonged temper tantrums, self-urination, and crying.” The symptoms which were actually signs of the abuse that Devani was experiencing in foster care were instead used as justification for stopping Michelle’s visits with her daughter.

Their last visit was on July 14, 2015. At the end of their visit, Michelle told Devani not to be sad because they would see each other the next week and have fun together. Kirkendall reportedly used that incident to accuse Michelle of not knowing how to support her daughter’s emotional needs, and she stopped visitations.

That was the last time that Michelle saw Devani. Her parental rights were terminated in October 2015 by Judge K.C. Standford at the Tucson Juvenile Court.

Judge Standford has since retired from the bench. An advocate for the family says that he retired “as the press started to heat up regarding this case.”

Michelle tried to file an appeal, but the appeal was thrown out.

According to Beth Breen, DCS portrayed Michelle as overreacting, but she says:

That doesn’t make her crazy; that makes her a concerned parent!

Grandmother Passed Over, Again

Michelle’s mother moved back to Arizona in early 2015 and contacted DCS social worker Jeanette Sheldon about getting custody of Devani. Sheldon had her move into a larger home, and she said she would do a home study, but it never happened.

After that, Sheldon reportedly stopped answering calls. All of her attempts to work with the department to get her granddaughter into a safer place allegedly fell on deaf ears.

Adoptive Family Warning Signs Ignored – Child Burned in Hot Water

After Michelle’s parental rights were terminated, Devani became available for adoption. The social workers and Devani’s attorney Thea Gilbert had been advocating for the Frodshams to adopt her, but Frodsham’s arrest put him out of the running.

After all that the child had been through, it would seem that those tasked with looking out for Devani’s best interest might have learned to be more careful in choosing a placement for her.

Unfortunately, agents of the state of Arizona once again placed the child in harm’s way.

Justin and Samantha Osteraas applied to adopt her through the now-closed St. Nicholas of Myra adoption agency, which worked with Christian Family Care. According to the lawsuit and advocates, the adoption licensing agency and DCS missed numerous signs that the Osteraas family could be harmful to children.

According to court records, DCS was warned that Samantha abused drugs and had a tendency toward violence. Justin’s brother told Pima County detectives that he had warned the adoption agency that Samantha was dangerous and should not be licensed to adopt. (See source.)

Nonetheless, Devani was placed with the couple, who have three other children.

On December 29, 2016, Samantha reportedly held Devani down in a bathtub of scalding water, then left her suffering for six hours before calling 911. According to the lawsuit:

“Defendant Samantha Osteraas submerged and held down Jane Doe, a 5-year-old, in a bath of scalding hot water. Jane Doe suffered severe burns over 80 percent of her body. When police arrived, there was blood on the floor and pieces of Jane Doe’s skin were falling off her body. There were bruises to her neck and arms along with other signs of trauma.”

Devani was placed into a medically-induced coma. She was in danger of organ failure. All ten toes had to be amputated. She has endured multiple surgeries and skin grafts since the abuse.

Police investigators sent a plumber to the house, who discovered that the water heater had been turned to the maximum setting of up to 140 degrees.

Samantha Osteraas was arrested on January 5, and bail was set at $25,000. She is currently out on bail and awaiting trial.

When Devani’s mother learned what had happened to her daughter, she petitioned the court to allow her to visit her in the hospital, to let her know that her mommy loves her and that she is not alone.

Not only was her petition denied, but the minor’s counsel Thea Gilbert reportedly told Michelle that the only way that she would see her daughter was if she was dying.

A gag order has been placed on Michelle Tremor-Calderon and other members of Devani’s family regarding the Osteraas case, so they were not permitted to discuss that case.

Mother Prays for a Miracle – What Other Hope Does She Have?

Devani is now in yet another foster home, and she has had numerous reconstructive surgeries since she was scalded.

No one in her family knows where she is.

Michelle’s mother filed papers last week asking the court to re-open her case and allow the child’s grandmother to have custody. Michelle told us that she wants the case back into superior court.

Thea Gilbert, the attorney appointed in the beginning of the case to look out for Devani’s best interest, is still, shockingly, on the case, even though every action taken by DCS has caused further harm to Devani.

None of the child’s placements have been in the child’s best interest.

Advocates for the family ask that Thea Gilbert be removed as minor’s counsel, and replaced with someone who will make better decisions for her.

This little girl has suffered tremendously in the protective custody of the state, beginning with the trauma of her being taken away from her mother, with whom she was strongly bonded.

There was no warrant, court order, or any valid reason whatsoever to remove the child from her mother.

How much more should little Devani have to suffer before someone intervenes to bring justice, and place her back into the safety and protection of her own family?

Her mother wants Devani to know that she loves her very much, and that she is fighting for her and praying every day for a miracle: for her to be returned home safely.

Canada's top court rules Google must block some results worldwide,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-google-idUSKBN19J27N,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian courts can force internet search leader Google to remove results worldwide, the country’s top court ruled on Wednesday, drawing criticism from civil liberties groups arguing such a move sets a precedent for censorship on the internet.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

In its 7-2 decision, Canada’s Supreme Court found that a court in the country can grant an injunction preventing conduct anywhere in the world when it is necessary to ensure the injunction’s effectiveness.

“The internet has no borders - its natural habitat is global,” the Supreme Court wrote in its judgment. “The only way to ensure that the interlocutory injunction attained its objective was to have it apply where Google operates - globally.”

Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The case stems from claims by Equustek Solutions Inc, a small technology company in British Columbia that manufactures network devices, that distributor Datalink Technologies Gateways relabeled one of its products and sold it as its own online and acquired trade secrets to design and manufacture a competing product.

In 2012, Equustek asked Google to remove Datalink search results until the case against the company was resolved. While Google removed over 300 specific web pages associated with Datalink, it did so only on the Canadian version of its search engine.

The Supreme Court of British Columbia subsequently ordered Google to stop displaying search results in any country for any part of Datalink’s websites.

In its appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada, Google had argued that the global reach of the order was unnecessary and that it raised concerns over freedom of expression.

The Supreme Court rejected Google’s argument that the right to freedom of expression should have prevented the order from being issued.

“This is not an order to remove speech that, on its face, engages freedom of expression values,” the court wrote in its ruling. “We have not, to date, accepted that freedom of expression requires the facilitation of the unlawful sale of goods.”

The global reach was necessary, according to the court, because if the removed search results were restricted to Canada alone, purchasers both in and out of Canada could easily continue to find and buy from Datalink.

OpenMedia, a Canadian group campaigning for open communications, opposed the ruling.

“There is great risk that governments and commercial entities will see this ruling as justifying censorship requests that could result in perfectly legal and legitimate content disappearing off the web because of a court order in the opposite corner of the globe,” said OpenMedia spokesman David Christopher.

Google cannot appeal the Supreme Court ruling. If the company has evidence that complying with the order would force it to violate other countries’ laws, including interfering with freedom of expression, it can apply to the British Columbia court to alter the order, the Supreme Court said, noting Google has not made such an application.",JustBadNews,0

Nauman Sadiq is an Islamabad-based attorney, columnist and geopolitical analyst focused on the politics of Af-Pak and Middle East regions, neocolonialism and Petroimperialism.

According to a recent report [1] by CBC Canada, al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, which was formerly known as al-Nusra Front and then Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) since July 2016, has been removed from the terror watch-lists of the US and Canada after it merged with fighters from Zenki Brigade and hardline jihadists from Ahrar al-Sham and rebranded itself as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in January this year.The US State Department is hesitant to label Tahrir al-Sham a terror group, despite the group’s link to al-Qaeda, as the US government has directly funded and armed the Zenki Brigade, one of the constituents of Tahrir al-Sham, with sophisticated weaponry including the US-made antitank TOW missiles.The overall military commander of Tahrir al-Sham continues to be Abu Mohammad al-Julani, whom the US has branded a Specially Designated Global Terrorist with a $10 million bounty. But for the US to designate Tahrir al-Sham as a terrorist organization now would mean acknowledging that it supplied sophisticated weapons to terrorists, and draw attention to the fact that the US continues to arm Islamic jihadists in Syria.In order to understand the bloody history of al-Nusra Front during the Syrian civil war, bear in mind that since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in August 2011 to April 2013, the Islamic State and al-Nusra Front were a single organization that chose the banner of “Jabhat al-Nusra.” Although al-Nusra Front has been led by Abu Mohammad al-Julani but he was appointed [2] as the emir of al-Nusra Front by Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State, in January 2012.Thus, al-Julani’s al-Nusra Front is only a splinter group of the Islamic State, which split from its parent organization in April 2013 over a leadership dispute between the two organizations.In March 2011, protests began in Syria against the government of Bashar al-Assad. In the following months, violence between demonstrators and security forces led to a gradual militarization of the conflict. In August 2011, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was based in Iraq, began sending Syrian and Iraqi jihadists experienced in guerilla warfare across the border into Syria to establish an organization inside the country.Led by a Syrian known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the group began to recruit fighters and establish cells throughout the country. On 23 January 2012, the group announced its formation as Jabhat al-Nusra.In April 2013, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi released an audio statement in which he announced that al-Nusra Front had been established, financed and supported by the Islamic State of Iraq. Al-Baghdadi declared that the two groups were merging under the name “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.” The leader of al-Nusra Front, Abu Muhammad al-Julani, issued a statement denying the merger and complaining that neither he nor anyone else in al-Nusra’s leadership had been consulted about it.Al-Qaeda Central’s leader, Ayman al Zawahiri, tried to mediate the dispute between al-Baghdadi and al-Julani but eventually, in October 2013, he endorsed al-Nusra Front as the official franchise of al-Qaeda Central in Syria. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, however, defied the nominal authority of al-Qaeda Central and declared himself as the caliph of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.Keeping this background in mind, it becomes amply clear that a single militant organization operated in Syria and Iraq under the leadership of al-Baghdadi until April 2013, which chose the banner of al-Nusra Front, and that the current emir of the subsequent breakaway faction of al-Nusra Front, al-Julani, was actually al-Baghdadi’s deputy in Syria.Thus, the Islamic State operated in Syria since August 2011 under the designation of al-Nusra Front and it subsequently changed its name to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in April 2013, after which, it overran Raqqa in the summer of 2013, then it seized parts of Deir al-Zor and fought battles against the alliance of Kurds and the Syrian regime in al-Hasakah. And in January 2014 it overran Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in Iraq and reached the zenith of its power when it captured Mosul in June 2014.Regarding the rebranding of al-Julani’s Nusra Front to “Jabhat Fateh al-Sham” in July 2016 and purported severing of ties with al-Qaeda Central, it was only a nominal difference because al-Nusra Front never had any organizational and operational ties with al-Qaeda Central and even their ideologies are poles apart.Al-Qaeda Central is basically a transnational terrorist organization, while al-Nusra Front mainly has regional ambitions that are limited only to fighting the Assad regime in Syria and its ideology is anti-Shi’a and sectarian. In fact, al-Nusra Front has not only received medical aid and material support from Israel, but some of its operations against the Shi’a-dominated Assad regime in southern Syria were fully coordinated with Israel’s air force.The purpose behind the rebranding of al-Nusra Front to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and purported severing of ties with al-Qaeda Central was to legitimize itself and to make it easier for its patrons to send money and arms. The US blacklisted al-Nusra Front in December 2012 and pressurized Saudi Arabia and Turkey to ban it too. Although al-Nusra Front’s name has been in the list of proscribed organizations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey since 2014, but it has kept receiving money and arms from the Gulf Arab States.It should be remembered that in a May 2015 interview [3] with al-Jazeera, Abu Mohammad al-Julani took a public pledge on the behest of his Gulf-based patrons that his organization only has local ambitions limited to fighting the Assad regime in Syria and that it does not intends to strike targets in the Western countries.Thus, this rebranding exercise has been going on for quite some time. Al-Julani announced the split from al-Qaeda in a video statement last year. But the persistent efforts of al-Julani’s Gulf-based patrons have only borne fruit in January this year, when al-Nusra Front once again rebranded itself from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which also includes “moderate” jihadists from Zenki Brigade, Ahrar al-Sham and several other militant groups, and thus, the US State Department has finally given a clean chit to the jihadist conglomerate that goes by the name of Tahrir al-Sham to pursue its ambitions of toppling the Assad regime in Syria.",JustBadNews,0
"South Yemen is splitting from the North, Banished Aden governor forms independent ""South Yemen"" council",https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/5/11/governor-turned-president-adens-al-zubaidi-announces-council-to-govern-south-yemen,"The former governor of Aden announced the formation of a transitional political council to govern the south of Yemen on Thursday, just weeks after a presidential decree dismissed the official from his post, leading to mass protests from pro-secessionists.

Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the new president of the southern council, will be supported by his vice president Hani Bin Breik – a former minister of state who was also controversially dismissed by President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi earlier this month.

The council consists of 26 members.



These include the governors of Hadramout, Shabwa, Lahj, and Socotra, in addition to leading separatist figures and tribal leaders, said local journalist Saeed al-Batati.

Both al-Zubaidi and Bin Breik are leading figures in the southern secessionist movement and enjoy support from the United Arab Emirates.

In a televised speech al-Zubaidi said that the the newly established council was willing to continue working with the Saudi-led Arab coalition - which also involves the UAE - to battle terrorism in the county, despite the coalition's recognition of Hadi as the sole legitimate leader of Yemen.

Aden was declared the temporary capital after Hadi's government relocated from Sanaa following the Houthi takeover in September 2014.

Despite Yemen's unification in 1990, secessionists in the south continue to feel marginalised by the government in Sana'a, and have repeatedly called for independence from the north.

Although Hadi hails from the south himself, the official worked as vice president for 18 years under former President Ali Abdullah Saleh - now a rival in Yemen's internal power struggle - and is thus seen by some southern factions as a product of the international community and a puppet in the hands of the Saudis.

The prospect of a new secession could complicate the war waged by the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi rebels, who remain in control of the capital Sanaa and swathes of north and west Yemen.

The development could lead to the existence of three entities claiming legitimacy over Yemen - Hadi's in Riyadh, the Houthi-Saleh alliance in Sana'a, in addition to the new UAE-backed alliance claiming to represent the south.

The internationally recognised government of Yemen has yet to comment on developments in the south of the country.",JustBadNews,0
Australian Mandatory Data Retention Abused Just Weeks After Rules Are Put In Place,https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170429/00450037264/australian-mandatory-data-retention-abused-just-weeks-after-rules-are-put-place.shtml,"Australian Mandatory Data Retention Abused Just Weeks After Rules Are Put In Place

from the because-that's-what-happens-with-data-retention dept

We've been talking about Australian politicians' odd obsession with passing ever more draconian data retention rules for years now. As you may recall, the politicians pushing for this appeared to have absolutely no clue what it actually entailed. Just a few months ago, we wrote about reports about how Australia's data retention laws had been abused to spy on journalists and their sources. While some parts of the law went into effect a year and a half ago, it appears some parts just went into effect a few weeks ago. These new rules require every ISP to retain metadata on all online communications for at least two years. And... it took just about two weeks before the Australian Federal Police (AFP) were forced to admit that it had used the info to spy on journalists (again). They insist this was a mistake, of course.

""Earlier this week, the AFP self-reported to the Commonwealth Ombudsman that we had breached the Telecommunications Interception Act. The breach ... related to an investigator who sought and was provided access to the call records of a journalist without the prior authority of a journalist information warrant,"" AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin said on Friday afternoon. ""No investigational activity has occurred as a result of us being provided with that material. Put simply, this was human error. It should not have occurred, the AFP take this very seriously, and we take full responsibility for a breach in the Act. I also want to say there was no ill will, malice, or bad intent by the officers involved who breached the Act. Quite simply, it was a mistake that should not have happened.""

Even if this truly was an accident, it highlights why mandatory data retention is so dangerous. That information will be accessed, and not always for good reasons. There's a reason why we don't allow law enforcement to search our stuff willy nilly without a warrant, and mandatory data retention completely flips this whole concept on its head for no good reason. Such information will almost always be abused -- and sometimes pretty damn quickly after it's available.

"Man fatally shot by Illinois police 'still breathing' when covered by blanket, girlfriend says",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-fatally-shot-illinois-police-still-breathing-when-covered-blanket-n1244952,"In an emotional statement from her hospital bed, Tafara Williams, the survivor of an October 20 police shooting in Waukegan, Illinois, said officers shot her boyfriend, Marcellis Stinnette, and covered him with a blanket while he was still alive.

""They laid Marcellis on the ground and covered him up with a blanket while he was still breathing,"" Williams, 20, said tearfully from her hospital bed. ""I know he was still alive.""

In their description of the incident last week, the Waukegan Police Department confirmed that Stinnette was transported alive to the hospital, where he later died.

Appearing remotely via Zoom at a press conference Tuesday hosted by civil rights attorney Ben Crump and co-counsel Antonio M. Romanucci, Williams' recollection seemed to contradict the Waukegan Police Department's description of the incident as a traffic stop gone wrong.

On the night of Tuesday October 20, when Stinnette was shot and killed, Williams said she and her partner were sitting in their parked car to smoke shortly after having put their baby to bed.

""An officer arrived and pulled up behind my parked car. He didn't turn on his lights or sirens,"" Williams recalled.

She said she threw on all the cabin lights so the officer, who walked up to the driver's seat where she was sitting, could see that she had ""no weapons"" and ""wasn't doing anything illegal.""

Williams said that the officer called out Stinnette by name and asked if she was named Tafara, and indicated he knew her by saying that she was Stinnette's ""baby mama.""

""Then he started harassing Marcellis, he stood near the car with his left hand on the gun and he said to Marcellis, 'I know you from jail,'"" Williams recalled.

Williams said she asked if they were free to leave or if they were under arrest. She said that as the officer stepped away from her car to make a cell phone call, she began to drive away.

""I drove away very slowly because I was scared to get out of the car. I drove out to MLK and turned onto it, the officer was not following me, the police lights were not on, when I turned onto MLK it seemed like there was another officer there waiting for us,"" she said.

""There was a crash and I lost control, the officer was shooting at us, the car ended up slamming into a building, I kept screaming, 'I don't have a gun!,' but he kept shooting,"" Williams said.

""He told me to get out of the car. I had my hands up and I couldn't move because I had been shot,"" Williams said between sobs. ""Marcellis had his hands up. I kept asking him why why he was shooting.""

Williams said more officers arrived with their guns trained on the couple.

""They wouldn't give us an ambulance until we got out of the car; when I moved, blood seemed to pour out of my body,"" she said.

""I can hear Marcellis still breathing, I told them, 'Please don't shoot, I have a baby, we have a baby, we don't wanna die,'"" she recalled. ""An officer dragged me away from Marcellis. I begged him to take him first because he had just got surgery not too long ago. They ignored me.

""They laid Marcellis on the ground and covered him up with a blanket while he was still breathing. I know he was still alive,"" Williams said through sobs. ""They wanted us to bleed out on the ground.""

And then Williams was overcome with emotion and said ""please take me off,"" and the video was cut.

The Waukegan Police Department did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment on Williams' allegations.

An initial police statement released the morning after incident said an officer ""was investigating an occupied vehicle,"" and the car fled. A second officer spotted the vehicle in a nearby area, the statement said, and as the second officer got out of his vehicle the car began to move in reverse and the officer fired ""in fear of his safety.""

No weapons were found in the car, police said. Neither officer has been identified.

The officer who shot at the vehicle was fired for committing “multiple policy and procedure violations” during the incident, Waukegan Police Chief Wayne Walles announced over the weekend. The officer was terminated shortly after Lake County State’s Attorney Michael Nerheim announced that the FBI will assist the Illinois State Police in an independent investigation of the shooting.

At the Tuesday press conference, attorneys Crump and Romanucci praised Waukegan Mayor Bill Cunningham for ""transparency"" in his handling of the case.

Crump and Romanucci said, compared to the response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin — a short distance over the state line — Waukegan officials moved quickly to discipline the officer and to start the process of releasing the body-cam footage, which Crump said is ""imminent.""

But in both Wisconsin and Illinois, Crump said, police officers failed to deescalate.

""It's almost as if you shoot first and you ask questions later, and that seems to be the connection between these two tragedies,"" Crump said.

The attorneys called for a criminal investigation into the officer's actions and promised to pursue a civil lawsuit that will not only seek monetary damages but also injunctive relief in the form of policy changes, with an emphasis on deescalation training.

Other family members spoke emotionally about the impact the shooting had already taken on them.

""Tafara is my child, my only baby,"" mother Tina Johnson said, describing her as ""the strongest person I've ever met.""

""I am asking you to pray for her and my grandson Marcellis Stinnette, Jr.,"" she said. ""If America doesn't stop this disease of violence, this could be anyone's child.""

“Something was amiss, and obviously we are very anxious to see the video,"" Romanucci said. ""Whatever tactics this officer used must have clearly been against policy, not only against policy but against morality and against humanity for anything to have taken place so quickly.""

Crump said: ""They didn't fire him because he did the right thing, they fired him because he did something wrong.""",JustBadNews,0
France Preparing to Deport 213 Foreigners Who Have been on a Government Watchlists and Suspected of Holding Extreme Religious Beliefs Amidst Teacher Beheading,http://france24.com/en/europe/20201019-additional-police-operations-under-way-over-beheading-of-french-teacher,"Three days after the murder of a teacher, France launched a series of police raids.

Days after a suspected Islamist beheaded a French school teacher, police on Monday raided Islamic associations and individuals suspected of extremist religious beliefs, arresting dozens of people, said France’s interior minister, in a sweep expected to last a few more days.

History teacher Samuel Paty, 47, was murdered on Friday in broad daylight outside his school in a middle-class Paris suburb by an 18-year-old of Chechen origin. Police shot and killed the attacker.

Paty was attacked on his way home from the junior high school where he taught in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, 40 kilometres (25 miles) northwest of Paris.

The teenage assassin allegedly sought to avenge his victim's use of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed in a class on freedom of expression to 13-year-olds. Muslims believe that any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.

Public figures called the killing an attack on the Republic and on French values.

Fifteen people, including four students, were arrested Monday for questioning, according to a judicial source. The detainees included a man who was in contact with the perpetrator before the attack, the source added.

Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said there were some 80 investigations being conducted into hate speech online and that he was looking into whether to disband some 51 associations within the Muslim community. The associations included the Collective against Islamophobia in France (known by the French acronym CCIF) and the humanitarian association BarakaCity.

In a statement on the group’s Facebook page, BarakaCity slammed the move: ""Madness has seized the interior minister who, because he cannot find anything against our NGO, has taken advantage of the emotion caused by this tragedy.""

France was also preparing to deport 213 foreigners who were on a government watchlist and suspected of holding extreme religious beliefs, among whom about 150 are serving jail sentences, according to sources.

“They are quite unusual because normally, after such a tragedy, the investigation focuses on what happened, who was behind the attack. This is of course taking place. But the wave of arrests announced by the interior minister that will continue for the next few days is essentially focusing on those who have expressed support for the attacker or against the teacher online,” said Marc Perelman, FRANCE 24’s French politics editor. “So, it’s really a wide net that is being cast by the authorities.”

‘A fatwa against the teacher’

Police detained 11 people in connection with the attack in the 24 hours that followed Paty's killing. They included four members of the attacker’s family, who are being held for questioning.

A photo of the teacher and a message confessing to his murder was found on the mobile phone of his killer, identified as Abdullakh Anzorov, who arrived in France with his family to seek asylum when he was 6 years old.

Police also detained the father of a pupil in Paty’s class who had railed against the teacher online and called for his dismissal.

A judicial source told Reuters that another detained man was known to the intelligence agencies. Born in Morocco, he had used social media to fight against what he called ""Islamophobia"" and to put pressure on the government over its treatment of Muslims. In 2011, he agitated against a high school in Saint-Ouen, a working-class city with a large Muslim community near Paris, because it wanted to ban clothing used by Muslim girls to circumvent a ban on veils.

Darmanin accused the two men of issuing a ""fatwa"" against Paty, using the term for an Islamic edict that was famously used to describe the 1989 death sentence handed down against writer Salman Rushdie by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini.

""They apparently launched a fatwa against the teacher,"" the minister told Europe 1 radio.

Paty, who was praised by pupils and parents as a dedicated teacher, had shown one of the Mohammed cartoons to his civics class.

According to the school, he had given Muslim children the option to leave the classroom before he showed the cartoons, saying he did not want their feelings to be hurt.

The lesson sparked a furore nonetheless and Paty and the school received threats.

French teachers have long complained of tensions around religion and identity spilling over into the classroom.

One education expert warned Monday that the murder might deter teachers from tackling touchy topics in future.

""There's a huge amount of self-censorship,"" said Jean-Pierre Obin, a former inspector for the French education system. ""We must fear that there will now be more.""

But Jonathan Renoir, a 26-year-old history teacher at a junior high school in Cergy near Paris, said: ""We can't give in to fear; we must continue to talk about controversial things in class.""

Another young history teacher in Nice said he, too, was ""determined"" to carry on.

""I will never stop teaching secularism and the freedom of expression – never,"" said the teacher, who asked to remain anonymous.

"16-year-old boy's eyes gouged out, arms chopped off in Zarqa(Jordan)",http://jordantimes.com/news/local/16-year-old-boys-eyes-gouged-out-arms-chopped-zarqa,"AMMAN — A 16-year-old boy was transferred to Zarqa Government Hospital after a group of people cut off his upper limbs and gouged out his eyes, the Public Security Directorate’s (PSD) spokesperson said on Tuesday.

The victim, who was listed in poor condition, said that a group of people took him to an uninhabited area and attacked him in revenge for a murder committed by one of his relatives, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported.

The PSD spokesperson said that investigations have begun to identify the perpetrators and warned against sharing the video related to the assault, stressing that circulating the video would constitute a violation of the law.

Angry mob in Israel descends on home of man seen beating dog,http://timesofisrael.com/angry-mob-descends-on-home-of-bat-yam-man-seen-beating-dog/,"Hundreds of people gathered overnight Tuesday outside the home of a Bat Yam man who was seen in videos beating a dog, and police who arrived to arrest the suspect for alleged animal abuse offenses struggled to reach him and bring him out to a waiting patrol car.

The man was eventually taken out through a rear exit of the building, Hebrew media reported.

“Following reports received about a suspicion of abuse of a dog by its owner in Bat Yam, officers arrived at the suspect’s home with the intention of arresting him and rescuing the dog,” the Israel Police said in a statement.

“Dozens of people gathered at the site and prevented him being brought out to a patrol car,” the statement said.

Police said reinforcements were called in and the suspect was eventually arrested.

In the videos, the man was seen pinning down the whimpering dog and then beating it with his hands or a belt. The clips were received by animal rights groups, Channel 12 reported.

The footage was posted on social media and rapidly shared, with some users identifying the man, who is apparently originally from New York.

The Haifa Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported the abuse to the Agriculture Ministry, which then informed police. Many social media users also reportedly appealed to police to take action.

But before officers could arrive at the man’s home, celebrity bodybuilder Mishel Taroni, who campaigns for animal rights, and a handful of others turned up at the premises and took the dog away.

Video posted on Facebook showed Taroni shouting at the man as he sat on the floor in the entrance to the small apartment, appearing to be both confused and alarmed.

As activists took the dog away, the man protested, explaining in both Hebrew and English that it was not his animal. However, amid scuffles between Taroni and others who tried to get at the man, the dog was removed.

Other video from the evening showed police officers pushing their way through the crowds outside the building and in the stairwell to the apartment as they tried to arrest the suspect.

כל מה שקורה בערב הזה מטורף ומדהים. אם המדינה לא עושה כלום למתעללים בבעלי החיים – אנחנו האזרחים נעשה. מאחל לכלב המסכן הזה שיזכה לבית חם ואוהב כמו שמגיע לו. את האיחולים שלי לאפס המתעלל אשמור לעצמי. צילום: מורן בן זכאי, השקמה בת ים pic.twitter.com/i6rAaNEKOF — Zohar Tzalach (@Zohartza) October 6, 2020

A police spokesperson told Channel 13 in an interview that the crowd apparently wanted to take justice into its own hands.

Among those who joined the angry mob was Bat Yam Mayor Zvika Brot, according to Hebrew media reports.

The crowds did not appear to be keeping to coronavirus lockdown restrictions on social distancing and limits on public gatherings to groups of no more than 20 people.

The suspect was to be brought before a judge for a remand hearing on Wednesday.

The Agriculture Ministry said in a statement that the dog was taken to an animal shelter.",JustBadNews,0
RIP Eddie Van Halen,http://rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eddie-van-halen-dead-200051/,"Eddie Van Halen, the legendary guitar innovator and virtuoso who led Van Halen through five decades and three lead singers, establishing himself as one of the all-time great players in rock history, died Tuesday after a long battle with cancer. He was 65.

“I can’t believe I’m having to write this, but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning,” his son Wolfgang Van Halen wrote. “He was the best father I could ever ask for. Every moment I’ve shared with him on and off stage was a gift. My heart is broken and I don’t think I’ll ever fully recover from this loss.”

“My heart and soul have been shattered into a million pieces,” his wife Janie Van Halen wrote on Instagram. “I never knew it was possible to cry so many tears or feel such incredible sadness. Our journey together has not always been an easy one but in the end and always we have a connection and love that will always be. Saying goodbye is the hardest thing I have ever had to do so instead I say so long, I will see you again soon in a place with no pain or sorrow. Please watch over [our dog] Kody and I. We love you and miss you so very much.”

“40 years ago my life changed forever when I met you,” Van Halen’s ex-wife Valerie Bertinelli wrote. “You gave me the one true light in my life, our son, Wolfgang. Through all your challenging treatments for lung cancer, you kept your gorgeous spirit and that impish grin. I’m so grateful Wolfie and I were able to hold you in your last moments. I will see you in our next life my love.”

“Heartbroken and speechless,” added Sammy Hagar. “My love to the family.”

Van Halen’s older brother Alex, who played drums in Van Halen, shared a simple statement that read, “Hey Ed. Love you. See you on the other side. Your brother, Al.”

Were it not for his titanic influence, hard rock after the late 1970s would have evolved in unimaginably different ways. He may not have invented two-handed tapping, but he perfected the practice and introduced it to a mass audience. Yet despite his complete mastery of the electric guitar, he never learned to read music.

“I don’t know shit about scales or music theory,” he told Rolling Stone in 1980. “I don’t want to be seen as the fastest guitar in town, ready and willing to gun down the competition. All I know is that rock & roll guitar, like blues guitar, should be melody, speed, and taste, but more important, it should have emotion. I just want my guitar playing to make people feel something: happy, sad, even horny.”

Even through Montrose’s Sammy Hagar replacing original frontman David Lee Roth in 1985, Van Halen ruled the rock world from their explosive self-titled LP in 1978 — perhaps the most perfect debut by any group in rock history — all the way to the mid-1990s, when they parted ways with Hagar. The 2000s were marked by battles with alcohol, erratic public behavior, and nostalgic reunion tours with Hagar and Roth, but very little in the way of new music.

Still, no matter who was fronting the group or when they had their last hit, fans never stopped flocking to Van Halen concerts to worship at the altar of Eddie Van Halen. “I suppose what bothers me is that often the kids don’t even notice when I’m bad,” he told Rolling Stone. “I come offstage and get compliments up the ass. That’s so frustrating.”

Edward Lodewijk Van Halen was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on January 26th, 1955, a year and half after his older brother, Alex. His father, Jan, was gifted at the clarinet, saxophone, and piano. “It was difficult to make money playing his type of music,” Eddie told Rolling Stone in 1995. “So he joined the [Dutch] air force band, and he played marches. Every morning at six o’clock he’d have to go up there freezing his ass off and play marches. We’d listen to all those march records, and Al and I would parade around the table in the living room and take pots and pans, doing all that kind of stuff. And at night we’d hear him playing classical music downstairs. He loved classical and jazz.”

The family immigrated to America when Eddie was seven and settled in Pasadena, California. An infatuation with the Dave Clark Five caused Eddie to take up the drums, while Alex tried his hands at guitar. One fateful day, frustrated that he couldn’t nail the Surfaris’ “Wipe Out” on the drums, Eddie swapped instruments with Alex, and the change stuck.

What a Long Great Trip It’s Been.. pic.twitter.com/M5pmkVi7hW — David Lee Roth (@DavidLeeRoth) October 7, 2020

The duo formed a series of bands in the early 1970s with names like the Broken Combs, the Trojan Rubber Company, and Genesis, but never got significant traction until they came across the charismatic son of a wealthy doctor named David Lee Roth. “Roth was the only guy who had a PA,” Eddie said. “We were renting his PA every weekend for $35 and getting $50 for the gigs. So it was cheaper to get him in the band.”

With Roth at the helm, Van Halen — which also featured Michael Anthony on bass — became one of the most popular groups on the Pasadena rock circuit, playing backyard parties, strip clubs, and whatever other venues they could find. Their repertoire consisted largely of covers, but they slowly began to assemble a collection of original tunes like “Runnin’ With the Devil” and “Somebody Get Me a Doctor.” Kiss frontman Gene Simmons recorded a demo with them and tried to land them a deal, but they wouldn’t sign anything until Mo Ostin of Warner Bros. caught one of their gigs and gave them a record contract in 1977.

Years of relentless road work had turned the group into a tight unit, which producer Ted Templeman expertly captured on tape. The guitar solo “Eruption” remains a standout for Eddie’s jaw-dropping chops, while their cover of “You Really Got Me” by the Kinks shows their ability to make even the most familiar rock standard fresh and exciting.

But it’s the group’s original material such as “Ain’t Talkin’ ‘Bout Love” and “Jamie’s Cryin'” that helped their self-titled debut album reach Number 19 on the Billboard 200 and get them a stint on the road opening up for Black Sabbath. “Just three years ago I was … up front with the rest of the kids to see Aerosmith,” Eddie told Rolling Stone in 1980. “Then a year later we’re playing with them. That boggled me to death. I mean, I knew I’d always play guitar, but I had no idea I’d be in the position I’m in now.”

They followed it up the next year with Van Halen II and the hit singles “Dance the Night Away” and “Beautiful Girls.” The next five years were a blur of sold-out arenas, wild parties, and smash albums, even if they didn’t land a ton of big radio hits and many of their singles were covers like “Dancing in the Street” and “(Oh) Pretty Woman,” which Eddie later explained were a result of tension within the band.

“Dave and our producer, Ted Templeman, were threatened by [my new studio, 5150],” he told Rolling Stone in 1995. “The first thing I did up here was ‘Jump,’ and they didn’t like it. I said, ‘Take it or leave it.’ I was getting sick of their ideas of what was commercial. That’s how we ended up doing all those covers on [1982’s] Diver Down. I never wanted to be a cover band.”

The band may have been descending towards chaos, but Eddie found peace offstage when he married One Day at a Time actress Valerie Bertinelli in 1981. The guitarist said that Roth was unhappy with the marriage since it interfered with the group’s reputation as wild, single partiers. “I remember once he said, ‘Tell your old lady not to come to Detroit, because we’re doing a Life magazine interview,'” the guitarist told Rolling Stone in 1986. “He was afraid they were going to corner her and ask her some real things. So she ended up not coming to the show. I put up with it. But it hurt my wife. How do you think she felt? She was a newcomer, and not to be accepted in that way hurt her.”

When it came time to record a follow-up to Diver Down, Eddie insisted they record “Jump” and incorporate synthesizers into other tracks. The result was the smash 1984 that turned them into MTV superstars as videos for “Jump,” “Panama,” and “Hot for Teacher” went into heavy rotation and the album began selling by the millions, reaching Number 2 on the Billboard 200. The subsequent tour took them all over the world, but Eddie and Roth were barely speaking offstage. When the tour ended, Roth left the group and began working on a solo album. “I cried,” Eddie told Rolling Stone in 1995. “Then I called my brother and told him the motherfucker quit. I felt like I’d put up with this guy’s shit for all these years just for him to walk.”

Eddie briefly considered cutting a solo album with a parade of guest singers like Phil Collins, Joe Cocker, and Pete Townshend, but he quickly realized the band should simply carry on with a new singer. Ferrari dealer Claudio Zampolli arranged a meeting with former Montrose frontman Sammy Hagar, who’d just had a huge solo hit with “I Can’t Drive 55,” and they tried jamming together. “There was such chemistry, and it was so exciting,” Hagar told Rolling Stone in 2016. “We played until midnight, about 12 hours without stopping. I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and went, ‘Wow, I’m joining that band.'”

Warner Bros. was unsure about the change and suggested they consider calling the band Van Hagar to separate it from what came before. “It would have been interesting,” said Hagar. “Looking back now, it’s sort of a way to divide the two eras up. But we were so fearless when we realized what we could all do together.”

Anyone who doubted Van Halen’s ability to carry on without Roth were proved wrong in March 1986, when 5150 hit shelves and became their first Number One album. That run at the top of the charts continued with 1988’s 0U812, 1991’s For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, and 1995’s Balance. Even though many hardcore fans preferred the Roth era, Hagar made the band even more popular and brought them huge hits like “Dreams,” “Why Can’t This Be Love,” and “Poundcake.”

Things fell apart, however, when the group got into a fight over, of all things, a contribution to the Twister soundtrack. They’d just completed a long tour and Sammy wanted to take a break with his wife and new baby, but the group wanted to go right into the studio. “I said, ‘Sam, if you want to make another record or do another tour, you’ve got to be a team player,” Eddie told Guitar World. “Van Halen is a band — not the Sammy Hagar show, not the Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, or Michael Anthony show. He finally said, ‘Yeah, goddammit, I’m fuckin’ frustrated. I want to go back to being a solo artist.’ I said, ‘Thank you for being honest.'”

A brief reunion with Roth to record two new songs for a compilation album blew up when the group quarreled backstage at the MTV Video Music Awards. Extreme frontman Gary Cherone, who shared management with the band, was brought in to become their third singer. “The guy got out of the car, and immediately I could tell he was real,” Van Halen told Rolling Stone in 1998. “Not a hint of bullshit, no ego.”

But their 1998 effort Van Halen III failed to connect with fans, and the tour was soft in some markets. When it wrapped, Cherone was given his walking papers and the group went into an extended hiatus. When they reemerged in 2004 with Hagar for a reunion tour, Eddie was deep in the throes of alcohol addiction and acting extremely erratic. “He told me he cured himself [of tongue cancer] by having pieces of his tongue liquified and injected into his body,” Hagar wrote in his memoir. “He also told me when he had his hip replacement, he stayed awake through the operation and helped the doctors drill a hole.”

The tour was marred by sloppy performances and bad reviews. A little more than a year after it wrapped, Bertinelli filed for divorce. When the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, Eddie didn’t make the ceremony, reportedly because he was in rehab. Later that year, the group finally reunited with Roth, though they pushed Michael Anthony out of the band to make room for Eddie’s teenage son, Wolfgang, on bass.

In 2012, they finally released the new LP A Different Kind of Truth, though many of the songs originated as demos in the 1970s. They promoted it with a tour in 2012, and three years later they went out again to play U.S. amphitheaters. But Eddie said that writing new music with Roth was almost impossible. “It’s hard, because there are four people in this band, and three of us like rock & roll,” he told Billboard in 2015. “And one of us likes dance music. And that used to kind of work, but now Dave doesn’t want to come to the table.”

He also said that any sort of offstage relationship with Roth was virtually impossible: “He does not want to be my friend. How can I put this? Roth’s perception of himself is different than who he is in reality. We’re not in our twenties anymore. We’re in our sixties. Act like you’re 60. I stopped coloring my hair, because I know I’m not going to be young again.”

But the last time that Van Halen performed in public, at the Hollywood Bowl on October 4th, 2015, Roth embraced Eddie onstage as they both smiled warmly. “The best years of my life,” he said, “the high points of all my life — onstage with you, homeboy.”",JustBadNews,0
Eco disaster at Kamchatka peninsula with mass death of sea animals at precious Pacific beach,http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/eco-disaster-at-kamchatka-peninsula-with-mass-death-of-sea-animals-at-precious-pacific-beach/,"Ecological catastrophe at the Kamchatka peninsula. Picture from the Khalaktyrsky beach by Kristy_Rozenberg

The black volcanic sand of Khalaktyrsky beach - one of the gems of the Kamchatka peninsula near its largest city Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky - is littered with hundreds of dead sea animals, from deep-sea Giant Pacific octopuses, to seals, sea urchins, stars, crabs and fish.

The Pacific Ocean waves, once favoured by local surfers and loved by tourists, now have a strong toxic smell; water colour has a clear yellow tinge.

The strongly-bonded community of local surfers signalled trouble with the beach three weeks ago, saying that they had a burning sensation in their eyes, strong headaches, often fevers, throat aches and a feeling of losing eyesight after getting out of the water.

Now it emerges that even staying close to the water makes a poisonous effect, posing in pictures of gas masks.

They continue to dive to update on the state of sea animals, bringing devastating news that the once thriving underwater life is gone, with even the strongest shells that could tear wetsuits lying open, dead.

Seals behave as if in a trance, they said, refusing to dive and spending as long as possible on the surface.

Below, pictures by Vladimir Solodov show sample taking at the Khalaktyrsky beach outside Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky

Checks by the regional Ministry of Natural Resources showed there was a spike in levels of phenols (2.5 times) and oil products (3.6 times).

Urgent investigation into the cause of water contamination was ordered today by Vladimir Putin’s envoy to the Far Eastern federal district Yury Trutnev.

Two versions are discussed so far, with one being recent military training at Kamchatka causing the ecological catastrophe.

Another is leakage of oil products and phenol from ships passing through the Avacha Gulf.

Ecological catastrophe at the Kamchatka peninsula. Video from the Khalaktyrsky beach by Kristy_Rozenberg

Earlier today several local residents published satellite pictures shared by Greenpeace Russia, showing a yellow-coloured river flowing into the Pacific Ocean.

There is a military training ground upstream, they said.

‘We are getting new information every hour; just recently we received satellite pictures from @greenpeaceru of the river that flows into the ocean and that evidently killed everything.

'Up the stream there is a military training ground. Knowing how the system works and how these kinds of questions are getting hushed, we must do everything in our power to save the ocean right and to defend from a catastrophe in the future’, wrote one of the surfers under the nickname Yola_La.

‘Our beautiful underwater world is now colour grey and yellow. Fish looks like it’s been boiled. Even the strongest shells that could tear a diving suit fell off the rocks. The scariest of all is that we don’t know what to do, how to help. I am looking at the stunning sunset over the Avacha Bay, knowing that its bottom is covered with dead sea animals’, another local called Kristy_Rozenberg wrote.

Greenpeace today demanded an immediate investigation into the reasons for the contamination.

The scale is not yet determined but the fact that the dead animals are found all over the coast confirms the seriousness of the incident, says the ecological campaigning group.

'Eye witnesses said that water at Khalaktyrsky beach has changed colour and is no longer safe for people’s health,’ said a statement.

‘For weeks people have reported feeling a white veil in their eyes, dry eyes, worsening of eyesight, and throat ache.

‘Doctors registered eye corneal burns. Many people who have been in with water also show symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, high fever, which may indicate phenol poisoning.’

The head of Greenpeace Climate Project in Russia, Vasily Yablokov, called for immediate action to contain, clean and prevent further pollution.

‘Khalaktyrsky beach water pollution has already led to the death of sea animals and poisoning of people.

‘The unique nature of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site, is under threat.

‘One of the best surfing beaches in Russia, one of the main tourist attractions of the region is now life-threatening…’.",JustBadNews,0
"INDIA : Police forcefully cremated hathras rape victim's body, barred family in the house",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/hathras-rape-victim-cremation-up-police-6638470/,"Police take away the father and brother of the 19-year-old Hathras victim from Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, after persuading them to end a dharna on Tuesday. (Express photo: Tashi Tobgyal)

From the time her body left Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital at 9.30 pm on Tuesday to a hurried cremation in a Hathras village 200 km away at 3.30 am on Wednesday — the final journey of the 19-year-old who was assaulted and allegedly gangraped by four upper caste men was marked by a disregard to protocol and heavy handedness by a police force that did not let her family perform her last rites.

The 19-year-old Dalit woman died at 6.55 am on Tuesday at Safdarjung Hospital, where she had been shifted from Aligarh on Monday night as her condition had deteriorated. Her post-mortem was conducted during the day. What transpired after:

9.30 pm: As the body was released and left for Hathras in an ambulance, the family told The Indian Express they were not informed. Instead, accompanying the body in the vehicle was an Uttar Pradesh Police constable, apart from the driver. The father said, “We had been waiting all day to take her home, do the rituals, the last rites… The police did not inform us deliberately.

Authorities at Safdarjung refused to comment. An official said on condition of anonymity: “In a medico-legal case, the body is handed over to the police following the post-mortem. It is then the job of the police to hand it over to the family following a verification process. That’s what was done in this case.”

Meanwhile, even as the body was on its way, the district authorities and police started preparations at the woman’s village for a late-night funeral — logs of wood were arranged, lights of the cremation ground switched on and the road to the victim’s home heavily barricaded.

Roughly half an hour after the ambulance left, the woman’s brother and father started for the village in a government vehicle, escorted by District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar and Superintendent of Police Vikrant Vir.

The SP claimed that after the post-mortem, the body was handed over to the family. “The administration only provided logistical support to transport the body. In fact, the father told me more than once that the time the cremation was done would not matter.”

However, the father said, there was hardly any conversation on the way to the village. “There was just silence; we were so overwhelmed.”

(PTI)

12 pm-1 am: By the time the ambulance reached the village, at least three layers of barricades had been put up between the main road and the victim’s home, and the area was swarming with the police. As the ambulance stopped at a layer of barricades, around 100 metres from the woman’s home and an equal distance from the cremation ground, her family and locals approached the vehicle, asking that it pull up to her house so that her body could be taken inside.

This, local residents and the authorities say, was the first point of flare-up, with an official acknowledging on condition of anonymity that there were instructions to wrap up the cremation at night to prevent a “law and order situation” in the morning.

“The ambulance headed straight to the cremation spot… My mother fell on their feet, the women from the family cried on the bonnet, we folded our hands… My mother said let me put haldi on her, let me take her home one last time… But no one heard us,” said the woman’s brother.

Apart from DM Laxkar and SP Vir, the officials present at the spot were Additional SP Prakash Kumar; Sadabad Circle Officer Bhram Singh; Ramshabd Circle Officer, City, Surendra Rao; Circle Officer Sikandarao; and Joint Magistrate Prem Prakash Meena. Besides, 200 personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary and forces from all 11 police stations of the area were deployed, over two shifts.

1 am-3.30 am: With the family refusing to cremate the body and the district authorities and police officers adamant, the conversation became heated. Said the victim’s brother: “At one point, police personnel got aggressive and pushed, kicked some relatives who were trying to intervene. That’s when we became so scared that we locked ourselves in… We were afraid we would be lathicharged,” the brother

said.

He added that all of them stayed inside — his parents, brother, sisters and other relatives. “For two hours, we weren’t even sure that my sister had been cremated.”

Joint Magistrate Meena, however, blamed the impasse on “outsiders”. “Unfortunately, several persons who did not belong to the family came close to the house of the victim, and there was a general lack of consensus within the family… It was after giving the family ample time that we proceeded with the cremation.” The pyre was lit a little before 3 am.

To counter the family’s claims that they were not involved in the cremation, the UP Police showed a video of three men throwing wood into the fire. DM Laxkar told The Indian Express, “The funeral was carried out by the family members. Senior officials oversaw the entire process and it was done with their consent. The news circulating otherwise is baseless.”

However, one of the men in the video, the woman’s paternal uncle, told The Indian Express he had been “coerced” to attend. The 40-year-old said, “We were outnumbered by the police… They said we have to attend; they didn’t give us an option. We were scared. If they wanted to include family members, they could have allowed the brother and father, but they chose who they wanted.”

Asked if there was any paperwork at the time of the cremation, a district official said the father had signed on the release papers for the body at Safdarjung, which were sufficient to carry out the last rites. He said a death certificate would be prepared later. The woman’s father said he was under the impression that his assent had been asked for only for the post-mortem and for the body to be released from the hospital.

Talking to the media in Lucknow, Additional Director General (ADG), Law and Order, Prashant Kumar said, “The cremation was done in the presence of family members and with their agreement… The body was decomposing and that is why the family members agreed that cremating it late night itself would be better.” He added that they were yet to receive the postmortem report, and will decide further actions based on it.

3.30 am: Still afraid to leave their home, the girl’s brother told The Indian Express, “It appears my sister has been cremated, the police aren’t telling us anything. Why are they doing this?”

Trump less trusted internationally than Putin and Xi after Covid-19 response,http://cnn.com/2020/09/15/politics/trump-us-global-image-coronavirus-pew-survey-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The United States' image around the world has plummeted in the wake of its coronavirus response, a major global survey has found.

Favorability toward the US in the UK, Canada, France, Japan and Australia is the lowest it has been in at least two decades, the survey found.

Trump's personal ratings slumped further in the annual index, with respondents in the UK, Spain, France and Germany giving him ratings comparable to the lowest points of former President George W. Bush's tenure and significantly below the highs of Barack Obama's administration.

Meanwhile, people in all 13 of the major countries surveyed considered the American response to the Covid-19 pandemic worse than that of China, the World Health Organization, the EU or their own governments.

'I feel helpless': mother of Hongkonger captured by Chinese marine police pledges to fight on,http://hongkongfp.com/2020/09/12/i-feel-helpless-mother-of-hongkonger-captured-by-chinese-marine-police-pledges-to-fight-on/,"“It is my humble wish that he is safe and comes back in one piece,” Ms A told HKFP. She is the mother of one of the twelve Hongkongers currently detained in Shenzhen on the suspicion of illegally crossing the border.

On August 23, at around 9 am, Guangdong Maritime Police stopped a speedboat and detained the group which had left Sai Kung en route to Taiwan’s Kaohsiung in an attempt to flee Hong Kong.

Twenty days have passed and so far no news has come from Yantian District Detention Centre, where the group has reportedly been detained. Since last Friday, lawyers appointed by the family members have been denied access to their clients despite repeated attempts to visit them.

According to a source familiar with the matter, none of the family-appointed lawyers has successfully met the detainees.

“I feel helpless,” said Ms A, who is using a pseudonym to protect the identity of the detained person. “News circulates and overwhelms us every day. The message that we receive just gets worse day by day.”

On Wednesday, human rights lawyer Lu Siwei, who represents another detainee, told reporters he was denied access to his client for the second time. The police officer he spoke with told him two other lawyers – whom Lu suspected of being state-appointed – had taken over the case.

“I am deeply worried that they will appoint lawyers for my son,” Ms A said, adding she has been complying with the authorities’ instructions but government officials in touch with her appeared to be attempting to “fool” her with bureaucratic language.

She said she was in close contact with the HKSAR Government Office in Guangdong for the first 10 days of her son’s detention.

“The contact person was responsive at first,” she recalled, but the relationship soured after the first lawyer was refused access to the detainee. The officer – surnamed Su – began to sound impatient and avoid Ms A’s calls, she said.

“We kept calling and he did not pick up both our house phone or mobile. We bought a new SIM card and tried calling with a new number but to no avail.”

The officer eventually answered Ms A’s call on Friday, after nearly a week: “He sounded impatient, displeased and displayed a bad attitude.”

It is unclear what charges her son may be facing and if he is under criminal detention, which could last up to 37 days. The lawyer appointed by Ms A requested to see her son earlier this week but was turned away.

“Is he even in Yantian? It is unknown. Nobody has seen him,” she said.

On Thursday, she received a call from a man who claimed to be a Hong Kong police officer overseeing the case and asked what her demands were.

“He said ‘I understand that you wish to call your son or receive letters from him.’ I said no. My request is simple and humble. It is a basic right. Let the lawyer whom I hired meet my son, not the lawyers sent from the state.”

Ms A’s daughter-in-law, the detainee’s wife, also received a phone call from the Hong Kong Immigration Department, asking the family to draft a letter stating their refusal to accept the newly-appointed lawyers.

‘It gets political’

Ms A said she has been avoiding media interview requests every day: “I have been avoiding talking or discussing it.”

“I know when it comes to politics, it’s not us common people who can afford to get involved. It is incomprehensible to us. I am not wise and, to be honest, my family is not wise for getting involved in politics. That’s why I chose to keep a low profile.”

Chinese law states that those convicted of illegally crossing the border could face up to a year imprisonment, while the organiser could face a maximum of life behind bars. Lu cited a police officer at Yantian as saying some detainees were being considered as the “ringleader.”

“At first I thought I would resign to the fact that he will go to jail. If it’s a year, so be it.”

However, the situation has gotten so bad that she decided to go public, she said.

“He is my son and I have to take this into my own hands… I don’t care if we become political bargain chips. They can have it if they want, so long as my son is rescued.”

In a press statement released on Friday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed concern over the detainees’ welfare and refusal to grant access to the family-appointed lawyers.

“Local authorities have yet to provide information regarding their welfare, or the charges against them. We question Chief Executive [Carrie] Lam’s stated commitment to protecting the rights of Hong Kong residents, and call on authorities to ensure due process.”

Deeply disturbed that Hong Kong democracy activists, arrested two weeks ago, have been denied access to lawyers of their choice. We hope Chief Executive Lam’s stated commitment to protecting the rights of Hong Kong residents is more than just words. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 11, 2020

Pompeo later tweeted that he was “deeply disturbed” by the matter and said he hoped Lam’s commitment was “more than just words.”

Asked whether she had anything to say to her son, Ms A said: “He is not alone. The entire family is confronting the matter together.”

“It may take 10 years to be back in Hong Kong. We will try to make more money during his detention… Let’s start a small business and he can start a new life under a new name.”

“If you don’t like Hong Kong, let’s leave. Even if we are broke, even if we have to beg for a living, we have to leave… We can’t afford to play this political game,” she said, weeping.

New Hampshire police chief refuses to reinstate officer who was fired over racist text messages,http://cnn.com/2020/09/09/us/manchester-police-refuse-reinstate-officer-racist-messages/index.html,"(CNN) The Manchester Police Department in New Hampshire is at odds with an officer they fired in 2018 after a labor arbitrator ruled they must rehire him.

The Manchester Police Department said in a statement posted on Facebook that it received a complaint against Officer Aaron Brown in January 2018. During the course of the investigation, it uncovered text messages ""in which he claimed to have intentionally damaged property while executing search warrants"" as well as ""text messages that included extremely disturbing racist remarks,"" police said in the statement.

The messages regarding the destruction of property required a criminal investigation which was handled by the Strafford County Attorney's Office, the police statement said. The Strafford County Attorney's office determined there was not enough evidence to file criminal charges, police say.

CNN reached out to the Strafford County Attorney's office but did not immediately hear back.

The Manchester police chief fired Brown the day after the internal investigation concluded in April 2018, according to the police statement.

Attorney says ""three to four"" messages were disparaging

Brown's attorney, Mark Morrissette, told CNN the police department is ""trying to inflame the situation and describe him as being racist. That's unfair to Mr. Brown, he's had an honorable and commendable career. They promoted him and they've given him a number of awards during his career.""

He says the police ""harvested"" over 18,000 text messages from Brown's police-issued phone and found ""three to four messages [that] referenced people in a disparaging manner"" in private messages he sent to his wife.

""He himself has said he shouldn't have used those terms, they were wrong...it was private words he said to his wife that he would take back. Again they go back several years, he was asked about these terms, he is not clear about the circumstances, they're in text messages with his wife. He admits they're inappropriate, they shouldn't have been used,"" Morrissette said.

Police say the Manchester Police Patrolman Association filed a grievance over Brown's termination and an arbitration hearing was scheduled for August 21, 2019 - more than a year after Brown was fired.

CNN reached out to the Manchester Police Patrolman Association, but they declined to comment.

The arbitrator did not find enough evidence that Brown had intentionally damaged property, a statement from the department said.

""However, the arbitrator ruled that Brown's racist comments were egregious and had no place in law enforcement and that the Manchester Police Department had properly applied a 'zero tolerance' approach to racist conduct,"" the Manchester police statement said. ""Nevertheless, the arbitrator determined that Brown should not have been fired, but rather simply suspended for 30 days. The ruling called for Brown to receive his job back with back pay, minus the 30 day suspension.""

In their statement, police said, ""once the case goes to an arbitrator it is binding"" and even though they are ""forced to follow the arbitrator's decision,"" police Chief Carlo Capano is refusing to reinstate Brown.

Mayor Joyce Craig backs up the chief and has released a statement saying Brown's behavior was ""egregious"" and ""has no place in the Manchester Police Department or any police department.""

""I believe the arbitrator made a serious error by failing to recognize Brown's racism and significant abuse of authority in reversing his termination,"" Craig said, adding that ""bad cops are bad for our police department, our residents, our neighborhoods, and our city.""

According to the police department's statement on Facebook, ""the Police Union then filed an unfair labor practice charge with the [Public Employee Labor Relations Board] requesting that it order the Police Department to reinstate Brown.""

That case is currently pending, the department says.

""He would love to get back to work. He wants to regain his status and ability to work,"" Morrissette said.

CNN has reached out to the New Hampshire Public Employee Labor Relations Board for an update on the status of the case, but did not immediately hear back.

Disagreements over Brown's backpay

Also under dispute is the amount of backpay that Brown is entitled to receive, police say.

""Despite Brown having made no effort to find other employment since the date of his termination, the City is still required to provide Brown with substantial back pay,"" they said in the statement.

The police department says they are asking the state Police Standards and Training Council to review this matter and determine whether Brown should retain his police certification.

The New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council declined to comment on if they have determined whether Brown should retain his police certification.

""He wants his backpay and he wants to be reinstated as a police officer. He was a police officer for 12 years before this came up, it's been a two year hiatus and hold on his life,"" Morrissette said.

""Manchester police officers take pride in the community we serve and the uniform we wear. Aaron Brown's actions cast a shadow on this agency, but those actions are not representative of this police department as a whole. We will do everything possible to make sure Brown is never in a Manchester Police Uniform again,"" Capano said in the police statement. ""Sometimes fighting for what is right is difficult and an uphill battle, but we take this very seriously and have no intentions of giving up.""

CNN attempted to reach the police department for comment beyond their statement, but did not immediately hear back.",JustBadNews,0
Police shoot 13-year-old boy with autism several times after mother calls for help,http://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/08/linden-cameron-police-shooting-boy-autism-utah,"Linden Cameron was recovering in Utah hospital after suffering injuries to his shoulder, ankles, his intestines and his bladder

This article is more than 1 month old

A 13-year-old boy with autism was shot several times by police officers who responded to his home in Salt Lake City after his mother called for help.

Linden Cameron was recovering in a Utah hospital, his mother said, after suffering injuries to his shoulder, both ankles, his intestines and his bladder.

Golda Barton told KUTV she called 911 to request a crisis intervention team because her son, who has Asperger’s syndrome, was having an episode caused by “bad separation anxiety” as his mother went to work for the first time in more than a year.

“I said, ‘He’s unarmed, he doesn’t have anything, he just gets mad and he starts yelling and screaming,’” she said. “He’s a kid, he’s trying to get attention, he doesn’t know how to regulate.”

She added: “They’re supposed to come out and be able to de-escalate a situation using the most minimal force possible.”

Instead, she said, two officers went through the front door of the home and in less than five minutes were yelling “get down on the ground” before firing several shots.

“He’s a small child,” she said. “Why didn’t you just tackle him? He’s a baby. He has mental issues.”

In a briefing on Sunday, Sgt Keith Horrocks of Salt Lake City police told reporters officers were responding to reports “a juvenile was having a mental episode” and thought Cameron “had made threats to some folks with a weapon”.

Police confirmed they did not find a weapon at the scene.

In a statement to the Salt Lake Tribune, Mayor Erin Mendenhall vowed the investigation would be quick.

“No matter the circumstances, what happened on Friday night is a tragedy, and I expect this investigation to be handled swiftly and transparently for the sake of everyone involved,” she said.

Across the US, killings of unarmed civilians by police, especially Americans of color, have raised alarm among community groups and stoked ongoing protests. Many say law enforcement responses to public health crises often put the mentally ill at risk.

Protests erupted in Rochester, New York, after body-camera video from March showed police responding to a call about a mental health episode mocking 29-year-old Daniel Prude and putting a hood on his head. Prude, who was Black, died of asphyxiation.

Demonstrators in Aurora, Colorado, have sought justice for 23-year-old Elijah McClain, a Black man who went into cardiac arrest shortly after a paramedic administered ketamine as police officers responded to a suspicious person report.

Body-camera footage contained some of McClain’s last words: “I’m an introvert. I’m just different. That’s all, I’m so sorry.”

As activists call for police resources to be reallocated toward public health initiatives, some cities have shifted emergency response strategies.

Regarding the incident in Salt Lake City, Neurodiverse Utah said in a statement: “Police were called because help was needed but instead more harm was done when officers from the SLPD expected a 13-year-old experiencing a mental health episode to act calmer and [more] collected than adult trained officers.”

Barton launched a fundraiser to cover her son’s medical bills. She described Cameron as a typical young boy who loves “video games, four wheeling and long-boarding”. She also demanded answers about why her son was not subdued.

“Why didn’t they Tase him? Why didn’t they shoot him with a rubber bullet? You are big police officers with massive amounts of resources. Come on. Give me a break.”",JustBadNews,0
Hope turns to despair as Egypt arrests witnesses to alleged 2014 gang rape. Government takes opportunity to crush women and lgbtq rights rather than rapists,http://theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/07/hope-turns-to-despair-as-egypt-arrests-witnesses-to-alleged-2014-gang,"Egyptian security forces have arrested six witnesses, including three women, in an investigation into an alleged gang-rape case previously hailed as a watershed moment for women’s rights.

Feminist campaigners and a researcher from the organisation Human Rights Watch said six people had been arrested overnight in their homes by the country’s powerful National Security Agency, including a woman seized from her car in front of her building. Another was arrested at her holiday home after the NSA could not find her at her Cairo address.

Campaigners in contact with the detainees said some of the women had been forced to undergo vaginal examinations and the men anal examinations while in custody.

The group of witnesses were threatened with charges of “violating Egyptian family values”, “damaging Egypt’s public image” and “debauchery”, a charge frequently used to target members of the LGBTQ community.

“It’s a terrifying moment for the LGBTQ and the feminist community,” said Amr Magdi, a researcher at Human Rights Watch.

The three detained women had previously provided witness testimony in an investigation into an alleged gang rape in 2014, while two men seized with them were detained alongside the women.

A sixth man, a prominent event organiser, was detained in connection with the party at a central Cairo hotel six years ago, where a group of wealthy men allegedly filmed themselves gang-raping the woman at the centre of the ongoing investigation.

One of the women detained holds dual American-Egyptian citizenship. The US embassy has been contacted for comment.

Last month, Egypt’s public prosecutor issued arrest warrants for nine men accused of the rape. Activists said seven were connected to the alleged rape, while two were accused of other sexual assaults.

The Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to seek the arrest of seven men who fled the country, leading to the arrest of three in Lebanon. Two more were detained in Egypt. None has commented publicly on the charges against them.

The authorities’ move to detain the men was hailed as a landmark moment by campaigners who sought rare justice for survivors of sexual violence in Egypt, especially for crimes allegedly perpetrated by wealthy attackers. Months of grassroots organising provided a rare glimmer of hope for Egyptians, as activists pressured the authorities to detain and charge another prominent individual accused of multiple rapes, while MPs drafted laws to protect survivor testimony.

The government’s National Council for Women, a body affiliated with the Egyptian presidency and created to promote women’s issues, urged survivors and witnesses to come forward, promising them support and protection.

Yet the state soon moved to crush the attempt to bring down powerful men accused of sexual assault, and quickly widened the crackdown to target members of the LGBTQ community, feminists or simply elite partygoers. After the detentions, campaigners and their supporters quickly fell silent online, fearing attack or arrest.

“We went from being very proud to being terrified in a matter of a few hours,” said one activist, who could not be named for her own safety. “I’m afraid there will be more absurd arrests – it seems like they’re taking people to scare us into silence. The message from the state is: ‘You wanted a women’s revolution – this is what it looks like.’ Girls are going to bed with their clothes on in case someone comes into their house [to arrest them].”

Egypt’s public prosecution office issued a cryptic statement on the witnesses’ arrests, labelling them suspects. Prosecutors said three people were released on bail after investigators subjected them all to drug tests and seized their mobile phones.

Activists hit out at the National Council for Women, which they said abruptly cut contact after the arrests and reneged on their promises to protect survivors, witnesses, and campaigners who had supplied them with evidence. “I feel betrayed, absolutely betrayed. I think Maya Morsy should step down immediately,” said one activist, referring to the head of the NCW.

Morsy did not respond when contacted by the Guardian. A second member of the NCW also declined to comment.

After security forces seized witnesses’ phones, compromising pictures and video were leaked on to social media, accompanied by a smear campaign across local pro-government websites intended to discredit campaigners and witnesses.

“What’s happening right now is a loud message that if you speak up, your life will be destroyed or you’ll be imprisoned,” said one activist. He pointed to the contrast between earlier messages to witnesses, “that you will be protected, you will be anonymous”, and renewed efforts to shame anti-sexual assault campaigners.

“Who in their right mind would report a predator now after what’s happened?” he asked.",JustBadNews,0

It 'harms everyone': Canadian human rights group calls for ban on tear gas,http://ctvnews.ca/canada/it-harms-everyone-canadian-human-rights-group-calls-for-ban-on-tear-gas-1.5091794,"TORONTO -- A human rights group at the University of Toronto is calling for a ban on tear gas as a riot control agent, arguing police often misuse the chemical weapon and that it can often harm peaceful protesters or innocent bystanders.

In a report released Thursday, the University of Toronto's International Human Rights Program (IHRP) calls for all levels of government to issue legislation banning the use of tear gas, to destroy current stockpiles of the chemical weapon and to halt all imports, exports and manufacturing of it.

“It has an inherently indiscriminate effect and is really abused against peaceful assemblies and against vulnerable populations,” Vincent Wong, a research associate at the IHRP and co-author of the report, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.

It’s because of the “indiscriminate” nature of tear gas that that the report states that it “harms everyone in its vicinity regardless of whether one is engaged in militant actions in a demonstration, protesting peacefully, or merely observing.”

The report also states that tear gas is frequently misused by law enforcement, including incidents of tear gas being used on peaceful protesters and misuse of tear gas guidelines, which state it should not be administered indoors or directly on someone.

Tear gas can cause severe irritation of the lungs, eyes, nose and mouth. It can cause crying, difficulty breathing and temporary blindness. The symptoms can last upwards of 30 minutes after exposure.

Long-term side effects of tear gas include severe eye injures, development of respiratory illnesses and damage to the cardiovascular system. A 1995 report from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, found that one person dies for every 600 times police administer tear gas.

“The long-term (side effects are) now really only starting to come to fruition as medical health professionals have done more longitudinal studies,” Wong said. “What they're showing is that there's actually warnings of higher risks of blindness, permanent chemical burns in the throat and lungs, of respiratory failure that can lead to death, of increased risk of heart attack.”

There is also concern that the use of tear gas could increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 and spreading it, given the well-known increased risk of respiratory illnesses and the coughing and sneezing associated with its use.

In June, 1,288 American public health professionals signed an open letter urging law enforcement to halt the use of tear gas due to the increased risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19.

“Tear gas is not a low-risk weapon; instead, it can cause serious injury and have lasting effects, particularly for more vulnerable groups. This is exacerbated when it is misused by law enforcement officials,” the report states.

The use of riot control agents such as tear gas have been banned from warfare since 1997, but are still allowed for law enforcement in several countries.

“It's really, really absurd when you think about that tear gas in war is even arguably an international war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and yet you see so many different countries -- the U.S. is the one that we see the most in media -- use it on its own citizens and civilians,” Wong said.

According to the report, the use of tear gas has increased worldwide, to the point where it has become the popular option for crowd control during pro-democracy protestsin Hong Kong and most recently during the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. It was also used during a similar rally in Montreal back in June.

“What we're seeing is that tear gas is now being misused as a riot or crowd-control tool of first resort,” Wong said. ""It's just effective, so they just shoot tear gas whenever they think people are not going to disperse if we tell them to.”

In June, NDP MP Matthew Green began a petition to ban the use and manufacturing of tear gas in Canada, which has since amassed more than 9,300 signatures. The deadline for signature is Sept. 8.

“This is not just a foreign issue,” Wong said. “This is also an issue that we are talking about here in Canada and hopefully this (report) will be of some use in those discussions.”",JustBadNews,0
Calling 911 with a false claim because of race can now put you in prison for years in N.J.,http://nj.com/news/2020/09/calling-911-with-a-false-claim-because-of-a-persons-race-can-now-put-you-in-prison-for-years-in-nj.html,"Calling 911 to harass somebody because of their race in New Jersey can now put you in prison for years.

Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill (A1906) into law late Monday making it a crime to call 911 solely to intimidate someone because of their ethnicity, religion or gender, among other categories. Violators face up to five years in prison and fines up to $15,000.

Calling police “as an intimidation tactic against people of color is an unacceptable, abhorrent form of discrimination,” Murphy said in a statement. He added that it “places victims in a potentially dangerous situation” while eroding trust between cops and communities.

The law took effect immediately.

Murphy’s signature came a little more than three months after a white woman was filmed in Central Park calling police on a Black bird watcher who asked her to put her dog on a leash. She originally claimed he was threatening her, but she later apologized for her “false assumptions” and was charged with filing a false police report.

New Jersey’s law also makes filing a false police report a form of “bias intimidation,” which generally carries the threat of a year-and-a-half behind bars and up to a $10,000 fine.

State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement a false call “interferes with 911 emergency operators trying to save lives.” Lawmakers lauded the proposal, saying it was another response to recent protests against police brutality and systemic racism.

In a fiscal note, legislative researchers said fines from violators could lessen the costs of new prosecutions, but concluded exact numbers were impossible to estimate.

Earlier in the summer, New York lawmakers also approved a bill making it easier under civil rights law to sue someone who calls the police “without reason” because of somebody’s race.

Hurricane Laura death toll rises to 12 after two more poisoning deaths due to generators,http://nola.com/news/hurricane/article_b13348b2-e9fe-11ea-a172-03ecf66964d0.html,"Two more people have reportedly died as a result of Hurricane Laura, bringing the death toll to 12.

The Louisiana Department of Health said Saturday that an 84-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman in Allen Parish died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator supplying power to their home.

This comes a day after Governor John Bel Edwards confirmed a Lake Charles family of four died from carbon monoxide poisoning related to a generator, which brought the death toll to 10.

Will Hurricane Laura's evacuations, recovery efforts be fertile ground for spread of coronavirus? There could be another layer to the pain, suffering and destruction wrought by Hurricane Laura this year: the toll the still-active coronaviru…

With one other carbon monoxide poisoning death reported Friday, seven of the 12 deaths caused by Laura stem from the use of a portable generator.

Lake Charles Fire Chief Shawn Caldwell said the carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in Lake Charles were caused by the family placing their generator in an attached garage with a door to the home left partially open.

Caldwell said five people were in the home at the time, with all of them dying. Neel, however, said a coroner told the LDH that only four carbon monoxide poisoning deaths were reported to them.

""It's troubling, it's scary but I want to stress to you guys ... keep (a generator) away from your home,"" Caldwell said at press conference Friday updating recovery in the Lake Charles area. ""Don't put it anywhere near a covered awning, a porch or a garage. Chain it to a tree if there's one left in your yard, but don't let a generator cost you your life.""

Hurricane Laura, the most powerful storm ever to hit the state, has left hundreds of thousands of Louisianans without power and some areas could be without running water for weeks.

The hurricane made landfall in Cameron Parish at 1 a.m. Thursday, with winds of 150 mph. It traveled north, with hurricane-force winds as far away as Claiborne Parish.

After Hurricane Laura, Louisiana's major disaster declaration approved ahead of Trump's visit President Donald Trump has approved Louisiana's request for a major disaster declaration in 23 parishes following Hurricane Laura.

Insurance companies are getting a scope of the damage caused by Hurricane Laura, with an analytics already estimating insured damage in the state at $8 billion to $12 billion a day after the storm tore through southwest Louisiana and left a trail of destruction northward through the state.

State Farm, the largest homeowners insurance company in Louisiana with about 278,000 policies, said Friday morning that 7,430 claims had been filed already. Another 750 auto claims also had been filed with the company.

Malmo: Violence erupts after anti-Muslim activity,http://dw.com/en/malmo-violence-erupts-after-anti-muslim-activity/a-54748905,"Violence broke in the Swedish town of Malmo in the late hours of Friday, after about 300 protesters gathered to protest anti-Islam activities.

Demonstrators threw stones at the police and burned tires during the clashes, which began after anti-Muslim Danish leader was blocked from attending a Quran burning rally. Rasmus Paludan, leader of the Danish anti-immigration party Hard Line, has been banned from Sweden for two years.

The event in Malmo which he was scheduled to attend, was being held on the same day as weekly prayers for Muslims.

Swedish newspaper Daily Aftonbladet reported that several anti-Islamic activities took place earlier on Friday. Three men were found kicking a copy of the Quran among themselves at a public square. The anti-Islam protests occurred after Paludan was denied permission to hold a meeting in Malmo.

Demonstrations escalated in the same location where the Quran had been burned. ""We don't have this under control but we are working actively to take control,"" said a police spokesperson.

Paludan put up an angry message on Facebook, according to agency reports. ""Sent back and banned from Sweden for two years. However, rapists and murderers are always welcome!""

Last year, he had burnt a copy of the Quran wrapped in bacon — meat which is taboo in Islam.

"Delhi police guilty of ""grave human rights violations"" during communal riots earlier this year and were even ""active participants"" in violence, Amnesty International alleged Friday...worst unrest in years between India's majority Hindus and minority Muslims killed around 50 people.",http://ibtimes.com/amnesty-accuses-indian-police-grave-abuses-delhi-riots-3036231,"Delhi police are guilty of ""grave human rights violations"" during communal riots in the Indian capital earlier this year, and were even ""active participants"" in the violence, Amnesty International alleged Friday.

The worst unrest in years between India's majority Hindus and minority Muslims killed around 50 people, most of them Muslims, over several days of running battles in the city's northeast in February.

A field investigation by Amnesty ""has documented a disturbing pattern of grave human rights violations committed by the Delhi police during the riots"", the rights group said in a statement.

""These violations include police officers indulging in violence with the rioters; torturing in custody; using excessive force on protesters; dismantling sites of peaceful protests and; being mute bystanders as rioters wreaked havoc,"" Amnesty said.

The group said it spoke to 50 riots survivors, eyewitnesses, lawyers, doctors, human rights activists and retired police officers.

It also analysed several user-generated videos.

One such video showed officers ""kicking and hitting a group of five wounded men... poking them with rifles and asking them to sing the Indian National Anthem,"" Amnesty said.

Six months on, there has been no investigation into the role of the police in the unrest, it added.

"A 194-year-old apple tree, the matriarch of the Northwest apple industry, has died",http://cnn.com/2020/08/22/us/old-apple-tree-vancouver-washington-dead-scn-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) An apple tree thought to be the oldest in the Pacific Northwest has died this summer at 194 years of age.

The Old Apple Tree in Vancouver, Washington, was planted in 1826 when fur traders of the Hudson's Bay Company settled in the area. It was considered the matriarch of the region's bustling apple industry and produced a green apple that was bitter to the taste but great for baking.

""While we knew this day would come, we hoped it was still years away,"" Charles Ray, urban forester for the City of Vancouver, told CNN.

Around 2015, the team of experts caring for the tree noticed that the cambium layer -- the growing part of the trunk -- was starting to die back, Ray explained. That contributed to the creation of a spiral crack in the trunk, which hollowed out over the years. The tree finally died in June.

""The tree itself has taken on its own persona. It's a living organism, just like us, and it's been faced with a lifetime of challenges,"" Ray said. ""It stood there for generations and witnessed the world change around it.""

The Old Apple Tree weathered countless storms and the construction of railways and highways in its vicinity, becoming a beloved community landmark.

""Local schools would take trips to the tree, it has touched generations of people throughout the Northwest, and probably around the nation,"" Ray said.

The tree is a well-known celebrity among heritage apple experts, who are interested in preserving and studying ancient kinds of apples originally planted by early settlers.

""When anybody speaks of the oldest apple tree in the Northwest, everybody knows it was that apple tree,"" David Benscoter, a retired FBI agent who now runs "" The Lost Apple Project "" told CNN. ""I'm sure people never thought it could reach that age,"" Benscoter said.

In 1984, a public park was built around the tree, and since, every October the city has held a festival to celebrate it. This year's edition was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

On Sunday, members of the Vancouver community held a memorial for the tree on Facebook , sharing stories and memories.

Rooted in history

Legend has it that The Old Apple Tree came to Vancouver as a seed, transported by a British naval officer.

Royal Navy Lieutenant Aemilius Simpson received the seeds at a dinner in London before departing for the Hudson's Bay Company's fur trading outpost in the Pacific Northwest.

""A young woman that was there with him, as she was bidding him farewell, slipped a few apple seeds from her dessert into his jacket pocket, and suggested that he plant those when he reached the Northwest,"" said Brad Richardson, executive director at the Clark County Historical Museum

The Old Apple Tree in a picture from 1940.

After arriving at Fort Vancouver, Simpson handed the seeds to Chief Factor John McLoughlin, who oversaw the establishment of local orchards and gardens for sustenance.

Notably though, the tree is not located within the perimeter of the historic Fort Vancouver's orchard, but about half a mile away from it, in what would have been the living quarters for workers on the Fort. Specifically, it's possible that the tree initially grew in the yard of a house where John Johnson, a British cooper, lived with his wife, according to a history of the Old Apple Tree written by National Parks Service archaeologist Robert Cromwell.

Later on, the Fort became a US Army base, and among those who served there was Ulysses S. Grant

That's not the only time in its long life that the Old Apple Tree had a brush with presidential history.

Richardson said that in 1934, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, visiting the area, was presented with a pie baked with apples from the tree. The pie was baked by Ms. Fay Peabody, the ""official apple pie baker"" of Oregon and Washington, according to news reports of the time.

A descendant of the Old Apple Tree was planted near the Clark County Historical Museum in the 1950s, according to Richardson.

""It'll dump a whole bunch of these green apples all over our walk every year,"" Richardson said. ""It produces very prolifically.""

A 'one of a kind' tree

Apples produced by the Old Apple Tree were dubbed ""English Greenings,"" a generic classification used to describe old-world apples, according to Charles Ray.

A DNA analysis performed by experts at Washington State University's department of horticulture revealed that the Old Apple Tree is genetically unique.

""The Old Apple Tree is not identical to any other named variety in a worldwide collaborative data set of several thousand apple variety DNA profiles,"" Cameron Peace, a professor of tree fruit genetics at WSU told CNN.

""The Old Apple Tree is therefore unique, one-of-a-kind. It will carry genetic factors not present in other heirloom or modern cultivars,"" Peace added.

Scientists were able to establish that the Old Apple Tree is almost certainly a grandchild of the French Reinette, a 500-year-old variety dubbed ""the grandmother of all apple cultivars,"" Peace explained. The French Reinette is a close direct ancestor of most modern varieties and also a parent or grandparent to many heirloom varieties.

A new beginning

As the Old Apple Tree's trunk was dying over time, several ""root suckers"" -- or new shoots -- started coming out of its root system.

""We made the determination to start nurturing these root suckers so that in the future we would have a new tree,"" Charles Ray told CNN.

""It's still the same root system, the same tree growing within that location,"" Ray added.

One of the saplings will remain in the same location to become the ""new"" Old Apple Tree over the years. Part of the original trunk will be removed to allow more light for the new tree, but part will remain on site to decay and illustrate the life cycle of trees.

""It will still be referred to as the Old Apple Tree to assure this legacy lives on,"" Ray said.

The other saplings will be transplanted to the nearby Fort Vancouver historic orchard managed by the National Parks Service, according to Ray.

Do you own a piece of the Old Apple Tree?

If you attended the yearly Old Apple Tree Festival in Vancouver over the years, chances are you might be in possession of a living piece of the Old Apple Tree.

Since 1984, festival visitors would receive cuttings from the tree in every edition to be planted in their backyards.

In Ray's estimation, around 200 cuttings would have been given away each year.

The Old Apple Tree in Vancouver, Washington.

""Over the years, people would come back and tell us stories, their memories of the tree, and whether or not their cuttings took or were starting to grow -- from all along the Pacific, all along the West,"" Ray said.

Ray encourages all those who have a piece of the Old Apple Tree living in their yard, or any memories to share about the Old Apple Tree itself, to participate in the City of Vancouver's "" Letters to Trees "" program.

Ray believes that getting involved with community forests and planting trees is a great way for people across the nation to make history, ""so that in 20 years, or 200 years, there will be heritage trees for others to enjoy and stories to be told.""

Greenland ice melt has passed the point of no return,http://livescience.com/greenland-melt-point-of-no-return.html,"The Greenland Ice Sheet has reached a point of rapid retreat that it couldn't recover from even if global temperatures stopped rising instantly.

This Arctic ice sheet is the second-largest ice sheet in the world, after the one that blankets Antarctica . It covers the majority of Greenland and melts into the seas via outlet glaciers, which have been rapidly losing ice for decades. Now, new research finds that today's glacial ice loss is 14% greater than it was between 1985 and 1999. The ice sheet is losing approximately 500 gigatons of ice each year, more than is replenished by annual snowfall.

Projecting that trend forward, the ice sheet is set to lose mass 99 out of every 100 years, researchers reported Aug. 13 in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

""Glacier retreat has knocked the dynamics of the whole ice sheet into a constant state of loss,"" study co-author Ian Howat, an Earth scientist at The Ohio State University, said in a statement . ""Even if the climate were to stay the same or even get a little colder, the ice sheet would still be losing mass.""

Related: 10 signs Earth's climate is off the rails

Increasing melt

Greenland's ice sheet has long been in peril. In January 2019, researchers reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the ice sheet was losing ice at four times the rate it was in 2003 . Other researchers have found that the ice sheet is sliding on its underlying bedrock faster than expected. This sliding can move ice from the cold interior of Greenland to the warmer edges, where it melts faster.

The new study combined three decades of satellite imagery with data from airplane surveys from Operation IceBridge,providing a detailed timeline of ice thickness, ice flow, ice elevation and the location of the calving front of the ice sheet — the line where the glaciers hit the sea and lose ice through the calving of icebergs. This method allowed the researchers to look at both seasonal changes in ice discharge as well as longer trends.

What they found was an increase of about 60 gigatons of ice loss a year between 2007 and 2018 compared with the period between 1985 and 1999. All told, the ice sheet has lost 4,200 gigatons of ice since 1985.

There are regional differences, with some of the accelerating ice retreat between 2001 and 2005 driven by glaciers in the southeastern part of Greenland moving from relatively shallow parts of the seafloor into deeper sections, where warm water can more easily circulate beneath them and melt them.

Ice-free future?

But regardless of the region of Greenland, the retreat of a glacier by 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) is consistently associated with a 4% to 5% increase in the rate of ice discharge from that glacier. Because these sheets are already retreating, further ice loss is baked in, even in a hypothetical situation in which temperatures stop rising.

""Glaciers have been sensitive to seasonal melt for as long as we've been able to observe it, with spikes in ice discharge in the summer,"" study lead author Michalea King, a researcher at The Ohio State University's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center, said in the statement. ""But starting in 2000, you start superimposing that seasonal melt on a higher baseline — so you're going to get even more losses.""

With the ice sheet set to lose more ice than it gains each year, it might seem like the end of the Greenland Ice Sheet. But that future has yet to be written, Potsdam University physicist and climate scientist Stegan Rahmstorf noted on Twitter . Eventually, he said, the ice retreat will pull the ice sheet away from the ocean. At that point, warm ocean waters will stop melting the ice, and the glaciers will stop calving. The Greenland Ice Sheet will become an entirely land-based entity. When that occurs, a new dynamic will set in: It will be a race between the rate of the surface melt of the ice and the annual snowfall that decides when and whether the ice sheet disappears.

""Thus, Greenland ice loss is a real concern — already today it contributes a lot to sea-level rise,"" Rahmstorf wrote. ""And Greenland does have a tipping point where the ice sheet becomes doomed to total loss. But the new paper by King et al. does not say anything about whether this has been crossed.""

The pesticide that caused bee colonies to collapse is killing birds now,http://salon.com/2020/08/18/the-pesticide-that-caused-bee-colonies-to-collapse-is-killing-birds-now/,"Environmentalists and farmers were relieved to discover that the mysterious and sudden drop in bee populations in the past decade turned out to be linked to neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides that are chemically akin to nicotine. Solving that mystery was not merely important to ecologists, but also crucial to human survival: if major bee communities become extinct or near-extinct, it could devastate human food sources.

Yet as history shows, pesticides applied to kill one type of pest don't generally stay confined to those animals. (See also: DDT.) Horrifyingly but perhaps unsurprisingly, scientists now believe that bees aren't the only animals that are adversely affected by neonicotinoids. Many bird species, too, appear to be in decline as a result of neonicotinoids trickling up through the food chain.

Advertisement:

According to a new research paper published in Nature Sustainability, rising use of neonicotinoids led to a drop in bird biodiversity in the United States between 2008 and 2014, scientists say. While bird populations have been steadily dropping anyway — the authors note that the bird population in the United States has dropped by an estimated 29 percent since 1970 — the researchers were able to separate out the general drop in bird biodiversity from the specific drop that appeared to be due to neonicotinoid spraying.

""Although neonicotinoid [pesticides] are applied at lower rates per acre than non-neonicotinoids, they are considerably more toxic to insects and generally persist longer in the environment,"" the authors explain. Because birds can ingest neonicotinoids when they eat crop seeds or aquatic or emergent insects, there appears to be a correlation between consuming the pesticide and a decline in some bird populations.

Authors Yijia Li, Ruiqing Miao and Madhu Khanna were able to separate data out at the county level in the United States. They found that a ""100 kilogram increase in neonicotinoid use per county"" led to a 2.2% decrease in the grassland bird population (which primarily nest in grasslands); a 1.4% decrease in the non-grassland bird population; a 1.6% decrease in insectivorous bird populations (which primarily rely on insects for their diets) and a 1.5 percent decrease in non-insectivorous bird populations.

Advertisement:

Those numbers might seem small, but they note that the effects of neonicotinoids become much larger over time, given that there are fewer birds available to mate and reproduce. The effect of neonicotinoids on bird populations is ""substantially larger when the persistent effects of neonicotinoids on bird populations are considered through their reducing the number of birds left to reproduce,"" they write. Taking account of that, they find that ""the average annual effect of neonicotinoids on grassland birds is [a decline of] 12% and on insectivorous birds is 5%.""

In case one doubted the relationship between these pesticides and bird populations, there is another, very telling data point. In counties where neonicotinoid use declined, bird populations actually increased. ""We do find a few counties in the northeastern and western United States where the use of neonicotinoids decreased over this period, leading to a small positive impact on bird populations,"" the researchers write.

This is not the first study to draw attention to the possible impact that neonicotinoids could have on birds. Last year researchers at the University of Saskatchewan found that the pesticide imidacloprid, which is also a neonicotinoid, had a negative impact on the ability of migrating birds to lead healthy lives and successfully reproduce. In that study, white-crowned sparrows lost weight and delayed migrating after ingesting just a small amount of the pesticide.

Advertisement:

The new study about neonicotinoids' impact on birds forms the crux of a larger body of concern over the ways in which pesticides affect vital insect populations, particularly bees. In 2017 European scientists revealed that neonicotinoids can have a negative impact on pollinator health during normal agricultural conditions. They tested the effects of crops treated with neonicotinoids for three different bee species across three separate countries (Germany, Hungary and the United Kingdom). The scientists found that there was a negative correlation between neonicotinoid residues and reproductivity among two species of wild bees, indicating that neonicotinoids may lead to ""a reduced capacity of bee species to establish new populations in the year following exposure.""

Another study, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution in 2017, examined the impact of the pesticide on bumblebee queens and found that ""exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides could have dramatic impacts on bumblebee queens, leading to fewer bumblebee colonies, less pollination, and ultimately population extinctions.""

Bees are estimated to be responsible for pollinating more than 70 of the top 100 crops that make up 90 percent of people's diets, and are crucial to the production of a number of commonly used products including elastic, musical instrument varnish, medical wound dressings, cotton, lip balm, skin cream and cotton.",JustBadNews,0
San Antonio Postal Service sorting machines 'thrown in the trash',http://expressnews.com/news/local/politics/article/San-Antonio-Postal-Service-sorting-machines-15490051.php,"Ahead of an expected surge in mail-in voting, recent cuts to the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service have led to months-long delays and the removal of letter sorting machines in San Antonio, according to the leaders of two postal workers unions.

“A lot of mail has been left on the floor, not only at the plant on Perrin Beitel but the stations as well,” said Chris Rincon, president of San Antonio Alamo Area Local 195. “There have been many delays in the mail. There have been many machines that have been taken out of service here.”

At least four letter sorting machines were removed in recent weeks, leaving 28, Rincon said. Each machine can sort about 35,000 pieces of mail an hour.

“They’ve been thrown in the trash,” Rincon said. “They’re not coming back.”

He added, “The removal of the machines will have an impact. The delay of the mail will have an impact. The public is complaining — where is their mail, where is their medicine?”

David Walton, a national spokesman for the Postal Service, declined to comment Monday, but he released a lengthy statement defending the cuts.

“The Postal Service is flexing its available resources to match the workload created by the impacts of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,” the statement read in part. “We appreciate the patience of our customers and apologize for any inconvenience that may have been experienced.”

Fears are mounting that the delays could effectively disenfranchise voters this fall.

On ExpressNews.com: Puro Politics 109: The Post Office Has Been Stolen

Wary of COVID-19, an unprecedented number of Americans are expected to vote by mail in the November election, even as the Postal Service enacts a slew of cost-cutting measures that are slowing deliveries, including the elimination of employee overtime and the removal of the mail sorting machines.

The cuts have coincided with the appointment in June of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Republican megadonor and supporter of President Donald Trump.

Despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud linked to mailed ballots, Trump has said universal mail-in voting — in which states automatically send mail ballots to all registered voters — would result in a fraudulent election.

Trump has said he hopes to starve the postal system of funds so that “you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.”

Universal mail-in voting doesn’t apply in Texas, one of just seven states that limit absentee voting to those who are out of the county during elections, disabled, jailed or 65 years or older. The courts have ruled that fear of COVID-19 does not count as a disability.

Carlos Barrios, clerk craft director at the USPS San Antonio Processing and Distribution Center, said the new Postal Service cuts have caused substantial delays.

“You could go by the plant today, and you’ll see mail that’s been sitting there for months,” Barrios said.

On ExpressNews.com: Voters could be disenfranchised in 46 states

The delays in processing have slashed the amount of mail that letter carriers can deliver each day, said Tony Boyd, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers Branch 421.

“The carriers are getting a lot less mail to take out first thing in the morning,” Boyd said. “All of the mail that they’re supposed to receive in the morning isn’t getting to the station on time. And instead of the carriers waiting as they used to, they’re instructed to leave at a certain time regardless of whether the mail is there or not. That results in a lot of customers not receiving mail.”

Delays can stretch from days to weeks, he said.

“The more mail that gets left behind, the longer it takes to get there,” Boyd said.

DeJoy enacted the cost-cutting rules that are causing the delays.

“It’s directed from the new postmaster general,” Boyd said. “He believes that we need to streamline operations and cut the costs of overtime and late deliveries and this will get things in order, apparently. That’s his vision.”

The Postal Service on Monday blamed the delays on “substantial declines in mail volume and a broken business model.”

“We are currently unable to balance our costs with available funding sources to fulfill both our universal service mission and other legal obligations,” the statement read. “Because of this, the Postal Service has experienced over a decade of financial losses, with no end in sight, and we face an impending liquidity crisis.”

U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, said DeJoy’s actions were meant to appease the president.

“He’s a huge Trump supporter,” Castro said. “What Donald Trump has been able to do in a lot of the federal departments is find a lot of people who are his yes men, who will do things that are even illegal, and this guy appears to be one of them.”

Castro called Trump’s actions “a naked attempt to interfere with people’s right to vote.”

“President Trump a few days ago admitted exactly what he was doing,” Castro said. “I think it’s a way for him to control who comes out to vote, a way for him to make it harder for people to vote and also a way to set up a contested election. He has said repeatedly without proof and against the facts that mail ballot voting is not reliable.”

Castro and Boyd trace the Postal Service’s ongoing financial woes to a 2006 law that required it to pre-fund retiree medical benefits. The Postal Service defaulted on those payments and owes more than $50 billion.

“The financial situation is caused strictly by Postal (Accountability and Enhancement) Act,” Boyd said. “No other company in the world is required to do that.”

Rincon of Local 195 blamed long lines at the city’s 30 stations in part on the Postal Service’s failure to backfill positions emptied by COVID-19. The disease has sickened 360 employees in the Postal Service’s Rio Grande District since the pandemic began, and only 99 have returned, he said.

The district, according to the Postal Service website, stretches from San Antonio to El Paso and Midland in West Texas, follows the Rio Grande counties down to McAllen, snakes up Interstate 35 to Austin, Waco and Temple, and goes south to Corpus Christi.

“Many members have been out because of COVID-19, and instead of hiring more employees, they’re trying to do with what we have,” Rincon said.

“They’re playing our hand so we can’t do our job,” he added. “We’re being told to leave (the mail) where it’s at. Do not process it until we tell you to process it.”

Barrios, the clerk craft director, echoed that complaint.

“We’re told every day we are not to process mail,” he said. “Because we follow instructions, we do what we’re told. But we’re not very happy.”

Neither is Isaac Silva.

The 59-year-old disabled retiree lives in an unincorporated community in eastern Bexar County. On a fixed income, he relies on the Postal Service to pay his bills.

More than two weeks ago, Silva mailed his gas payment to a utility in Floresville and his water payment to another company in La Vernia. On Monday, neither had made it to its destination, he said.

Now, the utility in La Vernia is threatening to shut off his water, he said.

“It’s not around the corner for me to go drop off this bill,” Silva said. “It’s like 18 miles from my house. I rely on our mail service to get me a bunch of my medications. I’m a double lung transplant patient.”

Silva is now wary of mailing in a ballot as a disabled voter, unsure if his vote would even be counted.

Boyd, of the letter carriers union, urged citizens such as Silva to voice their concerns.

“If people don’t like what’s going on, they need to contact their congressmen and senators,” he said. “The letter carriers want to do the job. We want to get all the mail to our customers. We pride ourselves on that. These new regulations are limiting our ability to do so.”

Portland truck driver apparently kicked unconscious as unrest continues,http://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/17/portland-truck-driver-punched-kicked-protest,"A man appeared to have been punched and kicked unconscious by demonstrators just blocks away from a peaceful protest in Portland, as unrest continued in Oregon’s biggest city.

Multiple videos posted online apparently showed the man sitting in the street next to a truck he had been driving, which had crashed and come to a stop on a sidewalk on Sunday night, news outlets reported.

People were crowded around the man and he appeared to have been punched at least once and later kicked in the head – knocking him flat.

The man was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, Portland police Sgt Kevin Allen told the Oregonian/Oregon Live. The truck was towed. It was unclear what exactly led up to the crash and the confrontation.

Separately, a protest that began on Sunday evening was led by Letha Winston, whose son Patrick Kimmons, 27, was fatally shot by Portland police in 2018.

The group marched through downtown and ended up outside the US courthouse, where people left flowers and candles beside a photo of Kimmons.

Demonstrations, often violent, have happened nightly in Portland for more than two months following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. Participants have repeatedly broken into the offices of the Portland Police Association, vandalized them and set fires.

Overnight on Saturday a riot was declared and police used crowd control munitions, including smoke, to disperse a gathering outside a law enforcement building.

Authorities said people threw “softball size” rocks, glass bottles and other objects at officers. Two police officers were treated at the hospital after being hit by rocks. Eleven people were arrested.",JustBadNews,0

Why Wikipedia Decided to Stop Calling Fox a 'Reliable' Source,http://wired.com/story/why-wikipedia-decided-to-stop-calling-fox-a-reliable-source/,"When Karen Bass, a congresswoman from Los Angeles, emerged in late July as a serious contender to be Joe Biden’s running mate, interest in her Wikipedia page exploded. By that time, the entry had grown to 4,000 words, been worked over by more than 50 different editors, and drew a weekly readership of 360,000. During that flurry of editing, a new section twice appeared below a list of offices Bass has held and legislation she has supported: ""Controversy."" It described the ""substantial controversy and criticism"" Bass had received for her words upon the death of Fidel Castro in 2016, and cited a Fox News report.

Each time, less than an hour later, this addition would be gone—deleted by another Wikipedia editor. Anticipating there might be some pushback at the removal, the editor offered a simple explanation: “Fox News is not enough …”

In those few days, Americans first learning about this obscure potential vice-presidential candidate naturally turned to the internet to fill in the details: Googling her name, clicking on a link shared by a Facebook friend, or turning to Wikipedia. Yet where someone wound up getting their information about Bass—who leads the Congressional Black Caucus and had been speaker of the California State Assembly—is hardly a minor matter. It could make all the difference, because while the executives of Google, Facebook, and YouTube seem content to distribute any incendiary reporting that arrives over the transom, the administrators of Wikipedia keep trying to live up to their responsibility as a source for accurate information.

In an aggressive move that is anything but sitting back, a panel of Wikipedia administrators in July declared that Fox News would no longer be considered “generally reliable” in its reporting on politics and science, and in those areas “should be used with caution to verify contentious claims.” (Fox News articles on other topics were unaffected.) There simply were too many examples of misleading, inaccurate, and slanted reporting about science and politics for Wikipedia to pass on Fox News articles as part of a broader search for the truth.

And while the decision hasn’t exactly banished Fox News from Wikipedia on those topics—there are still thousands of links to Fox News articles that appear there—it deprives Fox News of the ability to frame how the public interprets political events and politicians on Wikipedia. The changes to Bass’s article that highlighted a Fox News-promoted controversy give a glimpse at the stakes involved.

The attitude of the large platforms toward Fox News couldn’t be more different from Wikipedia’s. Search Google News or YouTube or Facebook and you will find plenty of Fox News reporting on politics and science, and why not? Once you disregard the importance of accuracy and proportionality, Fox News is great for business. Its biased reporting slakes a thirst of a sizable chunk of the public. According to a tally of the top-performing links published on Facebook each day, a Fox News article was number one for three days of a recent seven-day span.

For a digital platform, Wikipedia is refreshingly old-school in its values. Operated by a nonprofit foundation, it certainly isn’t afraid to be boring. And while I, and others, may be quick to read into the political significance in the decision to minimize Fox News’s influence on Wikipedia, the administrators who announced the changed policy tend to play down the drama. One of those administrators, who is British and goes by the handle Lee Vilenski, took on the matter despite, or actually because of, his lack of interest in politics. His area of editing usually includes snooker and pool; the only Trump he referenced in a long email exchange with me is Judd, the 30-year-old world snooker champion from Bristol.",JustBadNews,0
'Everything is gone.' Flooding in China ruins farmers and risks rising food prices,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/08/economy/china-food-economy-flooding-intl-hnk/index.html,"By this time of year, the rice growing on Bao Wentao's family farm should have been ready to harvest.

Instead, heavy flooding has engulfed huge swathes of southern China, includingmore than 36 acres of rice fields that 19-year-old Bao and his father tend to in their village near Poyang Lake

""The crops have completely failed,"" Bao told CNN Business in an interview over the social media app WeChat, adding that his family has already lost roughly 200,000 yuan ($28,000) worth of produce. ""The rice was nearly ripened and ready to harvest before the flooding. But now everything is gone.""

Surging floodwater burst the banks of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi province last month, destroying thousands of acres of farmland in what's known as the ""land of fish and rice."" The broader Yangtze River basin — which includes Poyang Lake and stretches more than 3,900 miles from Shanghai in the east to the Tibetan border in the west — accounts for 70% of the country's rice production.

For farmers like Bao and his father, the damage has been devastating. Not only did the rainfall ruin crops they were about to collect, but the scale of the flooding has made it impossible to salvage anything from this year.

""The land is still under water,"" Bao said. ""That means we are not going to have any harvest for the entire year.""

The flooding that walloped Bao's farm and 13 million more acres of cropland — about the size of West Virginia — is the worst that that China has experienced in years. China's Ministry of Emergency Management pegs the direct economic cost of the disaster at $21 billion in destroyed farmland, roads and other property. Some 55 million people, including farmers like Bao, have been affected.

The disaster is bad news for the world's second-largest economy, which is already in a fragile state because of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing has so far been able to secure food supplies by importing vast amounts of produce from other countries, and by releasing tens of millions of tons from strategic reserves.

But analysts warn that such measures can only be useful for so long. Tense relationships between China and much of the Western world, and the coronavirus pandemic, may make importing a lot of food trickier in the future. The flooding in China, meanwhile, could soon get worse: Heavy rainfall is expected through much of this month, and Chinese officials have warned that the flooding could creep further north, threatening the country's wheat and corn harvests.

""The flooding is already among the worst since 1998, and could worsen in coming weeks,"" analysts from Nomura said in a note late last month.

This aerial photo taken on July 6 shows flooded farmland in Shimen County, in central China's Hunan Province. The country has been hit by the worst flooding it has experienced in years.

Food security

It's not entirely clear how much of China's food supply may be at risk, since the government hasn't released specifics about the current state of production.

If the flooding is contained by the end of August, agricultural GDP growth could fall by nearly a percentage point in the July-September quarter, according to analysts at Nomura — equivalent to more than $1.7 billion in lost agricultural output. That amount is based on losses recorded in mid-July in seven southern provinces that were hit particularly hard.

Analysts at the Chinese brokerage firm Shenwan Hongyuan, meanwhile, recently estimated that China could lose 11.2 million tons worth of food compared to last year, given how much cropland was damaged by mid July. That would be equivalent to 5% of the rice that China produces.

The damage might be even worse, though. Nomura's analysis was based on data about flooded crop fields that the Chinese government released in July. Since then, the amount of cropland that has been damaged has roughly doubled, according to China's Ministry of Emergency Response. Damage estimates released by analysts also don't include the potential loss of wheat, corn or other crops, which could be threatened should the flooding spread.

Already, analysts point out that corn costs have been surging. The price of corn in China was 20% higher last month compared to a year ago, according to Chinese data provider SCI — the highest level in five years.

Corn is used as feed for China's pig herds, which are repopulating as the country brings last year's African swine fever outbreak under control. Even before the flooding began, corn supply was getting tighter, mainly because of concern that a pest called the fall armyworm was spreading through China, according to the US Department of Agriculture , which keeps statistics on the world's agricultural production.

rise mainly to concerns about extreme weather conditions in soybean production areas, and uncertainty surrounding US-China trade relations. Meanwhile, prices for soybeans have also jumped. In the first half of 2020, domestic soybean prices surged about 30% from the end of last year, according to data from China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs . Analysts from Baocheng Futures, a Chinese futures brokerage firm, attributed therisemainly to concerns about extreme weather conditions in soybean production areas, and uncertainty surrounding US-China trade relations.

It's clear that authorities are troubled. Chinese President Xi Jinping recently surprised farmers in northeastern Jilin province with a televised visit.

""I came here mainly to check out the crops,"" Xi said in a video posted by state broadcaster CCTV. ""There are quite a few disasters this year. I'm concerned about how crops are growing here in the northeast.""

Xi has good reason to visit the area. Northeastern China produces more than 40% of the country's soybeans and a third of its corn — both vital to the food supply chain, since they are fed to livestock and poultry. China uses more soybeans than any other country in the world, and it's only behind the United States in corn consumption. And while the region has so far been spared major flooding, that could change should conditions worsen in the coming weeks.

Xi reiterated food security as a top issue for ensuring economic safety during his visit. And Vice Premier Hu Chunhua, who is in charge of the nation's agricultural affairs, urged senior local officials last week to shoulder the responsibility for safeguarding food security and ensuring that production does not drop off.

China's response keeps rice price stable

Beijing has responded to the crisis with attempts to stabilize food prices and boost supply — including by tapping into strategic reserves of food.

Tens of millions of tons of rice, corn and soybeans have been released into the market in recent months by the China Grain Reserves Corp and the National Grain Trade Center, the two agencies that manage and sell state reserves of grain.

So far this year, the agencies have released more than 60 million tons of rice, about 50 million tons of corn, and over 760,000 tons of soybeans, already surpassing the volumes released during the whole of 2019.

Thanks to the release of those reserves, prices for rice have remained stable. Last week the average price of a ton of rice nationwide was 4,036 yuan ($580) per ton, roughly what it was a month ago, according to data from SCI.

China is also increasing imports — especially from the United States. Beijing committed to buying billions of dollars worth of American goods as part of a truce in the trade war agreed in January.

In the first six months of the year, China imported nearly 61 million tons of grain, up 21% from a year earlier, according to the most recently available Chinese customs data. Corn imports jumped 18% from a year ago, while purchases of soybeans and wheat also increased. The United States, Brazil, Ukraine and France were among the biggest exporters.

Some analysts, though, caution that China shouldn't rely too much on overseas imports.

The trade relationship between Beijing and Washington, for example, could create uncertainty for China's food supply chain should US authorities cut off or heavily tax those imports, according to analysts from Chinese research firm Tianfeng Securities. The United States exported more than 9 million tons of soybeans, roughly 100,000 tons of wheat, and nearly 65,000 tons of corn to China in the first half of 2020, making it a top trading partner, according to the most recently available Chinese customs data.

The Covid-19 pandemic has also caused some countries to suspend food exports, the Tianfeng Securities analysts added in a recent research note, creating more risks for food security in China.

The analysts suggested a few options for China to increase food production, including to loosen restrictions on the production of genetically modified crops. But they also acknowledged that at least in the short term, the country may have to import as much as it can before its trade relationships can deteriorate.

""China needs to put something away for a rainy day,"" they said.

As for farmers like Bao, China has set aside some money for flood relief. As of mid-July, some 1.8 billion yuan ($258 million) had been allocated to help relocate people affected by the floods and rebuild ruined houses, among other measures, according to China's Finance Ministry. The local government in Jiangxi province, where Bao lives, has also allocated 280 million yuan ($40 million) for flood relief.

But that's a drop in the bucket compared to the $21 billion worth of economic damage the flooding has already inflicted.

""Yes, the government has subsidies, but it can't really help much,"" said Bao. His father has already left home to look for other jobs now that there's no hope for another crop season this year. ""Spreading it out for each person, there is not much left.""",JustBadNews,0
China seals off village after bubonic plague death,http://independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bubonic-plague-china-death-inner-mongolia-baotou-suji-xincun-a9660861.html,"A village in China has been sealed off after a resident died from bubonic plague, authorities in the country have said.

Daily disinfection of homes has been ordered in Suji Xincun, a tiny settlement in the Inner Mongolia region.

It has not been revealed how the villager came to have contracted the disease, but health officials in the nearby city of Baotou said no one else has yet tested positive for it.

Nine close contacts and 26 secondary contacts of the patient have been quarantined and found negative for the illness, the Baotou Municipal Health Commission revealed in a statement on Thursday.

Damao Banner, the district where the village is located, has also been put on level three alert for plague prevention, the second lowest in a four-level system.

It is the first death – and only the second case – of bubonic plague China has confirmed this year. The previous case was discovered in July in Bayannur, another city in Inner Mongolia. That also lead to the issuing of a level three alert and the closure of several tourist spots.

Plague, caused by bacteria and transmitted through flea bites and infected animals, killed an estimated 50 million people in Europe during the Black Death pandemic in the Middle Ages.

According to the World Health Organisation somewhere between 1,000 to 2,000 people still catch the disease every year.",JustBadNews,0

DUBAI (Reuters) - One person is dying from COVID-19 every seven minutes in Iran, state television said on Monday, as the Health Ministry reported 215 new deaths from the disease and state media warned of a lack of proper social distancing.

Health Ministry spokesman Sima Sadat Lari was quoted by the state TV as saying the 215 deaths in the past 24 hours took the combined death toll to 17,405 in Iran, and the number of confirmed cases rose by 2,598 to 312,035.

State television showed several Iranians in a busy Tehran street without wearing face masks or social distancing.

Some experts have doubted the accuracy of Iran’s official coronavirus tolls. A report by the Iranian parliament’s research centre in April suggested that the coronavirus tolls might be almost twice as many as those announced by the health ministry.

The report said that Iran’s official coronavirus figures were based only on the number of deaths in hospitals and those who had already tested positive for the coronavirus.

British broadcaster BBC reported on Monday that, based on data from an anonymous source, the number of deaths in Iran might be three times higher than officially reported. Iranian health authorities denied the report and said there had been no cover-up.

With COVID-19 deaths surging since restrictions were eased in mid-April, Iranian authorities have said measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 will be reimposed if health regulations are not observed. Since last month, wearing face masks in public places and covered spaces has been mandatory.

Iran’s National Coronavirus Combat Taskforce was expected to announce later on Monday whether nationwide university entrance examinations, with over 1 million participants, will take place in August. Many Iranians have called on social media for the examinations to be postponed.",JustBadNews,0

America's use of multinational corporations in its global development strategy leads to corruption and is in dire need of reform,http://crossfirekm.org/articles/pivoting-americas-global-economic-development-strategy,"After years of scandal, the investment bank Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay $2.5 billion to the Malaysian government for its role in the theft of funds from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MBD)[1].

The sovereign wealth fund, created by former Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009 for economic development, raised over $6 billion through bond sales, of which Goldman Sachs earned $600 million in commission. As this happened, a handful of Malay officials and two Goldman Sachs bankers siphoned over $4.5 billion into fraudulent shell companies. After the fund’s failure to service debt payments, it became apparent billions were missing.

In 2017, the US Department of Justice seized over $1 billion in assets bought with stolen funds, and the following year saw the political decline of P.M. Najb, who is currently on trial for his involvement in the scandal. Goldman Sachs has worked since 2018 to come to settlement on two cases, one from the Malaysian government and one from the US DOJ.

Incidents like 1MBD seem almost expected. Corruption is present in virtually every country, and when billions of dollars pour into development projects every year, it is inevitable that scandals will arise.

The world’s most well-known investment banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America to name a few, are predominantly headquartered in America. Even international financiers like the World Bank and IMF are led by Americans out of Washington D.C. When scandals such as 1MDB arise, it becomes obvious why the involvement of investment banks are a roadblock to enhancing diplomatic relations with developing and emerging economies.

However, the damaged reputation of the current system of distributing developmental aid goes beyond scandals spurred by large investment banks. The infamous demands for “shock therapy” as conditions for World Bank or IMF funds have often been inappropriately applied, drastically worsening inequality and tension and leading to destabilization. For instance, many speculate the Argentine economic crisis at the turn of the century was worsened by reforms installed as per the IMF’s request[2].

In the same way that policy analysts see crises like the War in Yemen as failures that jeopardize diplomatic relations, it is time to accept that the current regime of developmental economics has failed the Global South and is in need of reform to salvage relations with emerging economies which will undoubtedly be more significant powers in the future.

With Beijing utilizing the Belt and Road Initiative to gain influence in the developing world, this alternative to the Washington Consensus-driven style of development threatens putting more states under the influence of a hostile Chinese state, which only stresses the national security importance of a better development strategy.

In the interest of renewing diplomatic ties, expanding economic opportunities, and confronting Chinese soft power, the US will need to utilize its vast influence to rework the style of its international development programs, aligning ethics with national security.

A New Economic Order

The July 1944 Bretton Woods Conference saw representatives from 44 Allied countries meet in the town of Bretton Woods, New Hampshire to devise the framework for the new economic order to follow World War II. The result was the creation of the Bretton Woods Institutions – the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).

The IMF’s role was to facilitate the adoption of a universal financial system based on stable currency exchange rates all tied to the value of gold. Due to the quantity of America’s gold reserves, the IMF set up many of these exchange rates relative to the US dollar. To prevent the destabilization of currencies, and by proxy the whole system, the IMF was also given the authority to give financial assistance and policy advice to member states facing currency destabilization or other economic woes. When the US dollar became a fiat currency, unbound by the value of gold, the IMF focused more on its lending operations as countries began to peg themselves to the dollar or adopt free-floating rates.

The IBRD was created to support large projects for reconstruction in war-torn countries and economic development for developing economies. The creation of additional bodies like the International Development Association and International Finance Corporation led to the creation of the World Bank Group to consolidate these operations all aimed at funding projects across areas like human capital, industry, and infrastructure.

As is clear from their prowess, the IMF and World Bank eventually evolved to be something of international lenders for mostly developing countries. Given the immense voting power of the US in the IMF and history of American citizens as presidents of the World Bank, it is no wonder the two organizations are critical to Washington’s ability to influence international economics.

Many Strings Attached

In fact, as conditions for lending and assistance programs, the IMF and World Bank require member states to make policy adjustments which typically follow the principles of the Washington Consensus, a set of free market-based ideals setting expectations for low levels of government intervention in the economy. The reasoning for this conditionality is to ensure that member states seeking assistance are implementing long-term economic policies to ensure growth and prevent future need for international assistance[3][4].

However, a great deal of these lending operations have yet to be entirely successful at bringing states into developed status. While the IMF provided significant relief to Russia and a handful of Asian states in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of 1997, long term attempts to restructure economic policies for sustainable growth generally failed.

For instance, the wave of privatization in Argentina created private monopolies that led to rising prices. High government borrowing led to domestic interest rates to rise and stifled domestic business investment as weak job growth left the economy vulnerable to crisis when the Brazilian real devalued and shocked Argentine pesos and exports[5].

Multinational Corporations as Contractors

Going beyond the questionable results of generalized implementation of the Washington Consensus, several economic development projects have delivered uneven results. While the reasons for the inequality of returns are varied, one of the greatest culprits is the involvement of multinational corporations acting as contractors. Through corporate lobbying, there are many reported instances of World Bank funds used to contract multinationals. In addition to opening the door for corruption, these arrangements also limit domestic job growth that could have resulted from construction and development of these projects by domestic firms.

These issues outlined thus far confirm the necessity for one change in the American economic development strategy. The IMF and World Bank need to redefine methods for enhancing economic growth to better account for nuances of individual member states and take on approaches that less aggressively demonize state intervention.

Although private enterprises can be argued to function better, the kind of haphazard privatization of industry in countries like Argentina of the 1990’s turned state monopolies into private monopolies, and without price controls, led to rising costs in industries like utilities. Therefore, when recommending privatization, there must be consideration for ensuring these state industries can first be reorganized to enable seamless transition to smaller, competitive firms.

However, the lack of private industry is not even the cause of constant concern for several states. Many states following the budgeting restrictions necessary for funding have found great difficulty increasing investment in education and healthcare, which catastrophically reduces the ability of such states to generate greater productivity[6]. Going beyond this, IMF and World Bank requirements must not blindly follow the Washington Consensus. Rather, there must be greater emphasis on following the advice of domestic economists, popular opinion (ensuring inclusion of even isolated populations), and neighboring trade partners. Funding allocations ought to also be distributed with the help of IMF/World Bank oversight and watchdog organizations.

The Way Forward

Pouring financial assistance into an economy may be necessary to avert a currency crisis. Only through the immediate firepower of large organizations can such an injection of capital quickly halt hyperinflation or an equivalently devastating shock. Yet, the IMF must now take on the role of ensuring increased access and use of banks and lending institutions. In addition to the expansion of money supply arising from increased citizen participation in domestic financial institutions, such an IMF objective would work toward long term organic growth through the compounding benefits of more citizens using a banking system.

As for the World Bank, multinationals need to be barred from lobbying representatives, and any contracting of multinationals must be done so with the approval of the member state’s government. The World Bank must finance efforts aimed at connecting rural populations through infrastructure, social programs, and education. This would not only drastically improve productivity across largely rural areas, but the more even distribution of economic returns would help reduce the inequality associated with the rapid development of emerging economies and would in turn enhance political stability.

Ensuring that the IMF and World Bank are more responsible about promoting economic growth is critical to repairing the reputation of US development policy, but the US must also be careful to distinguish itself in independent development policy. The US ought to use its influence over the Bretton Woods Institutions to prevent abuse and neglect of the developing states in the Global South, but independently seek to forge mutually beneficial long-term economic ties.

The first target should be vulture funds, which buy up distressed assets, such as sovereign debt of weak economies, and often litigate to force repayment. Because of their presence as a significant actor in the handling of debt, it is virtually impossible to implement a universal sovereign debt restructuring regime. Thus, highly indebted countries are not only unable to receive debt relief, but some may face catastrophic consequences for having to pay loans at inconvenient times. One notorious example was Malawi having to repay loans through selling food reserves, which spurred food shortage for 7 million of its people.

By setting precedent in the court system and creating federal legislation, the US needs to establish that vulture fund litigation will no longer be tolerated because of the threat they pose to economic stability. For instance, such tactics proved disastrous for nations like Puerto Rico. Going beyond domestic policy, the US will then have to ensure allies, especially in the OECD, adopt such programs. Ideally, this could be the stepping stone for the US leading the creation of an international framework for sovereign debt restructuring[7].

Aside from assisting developing countries with debt, the US can also develop close relations with individual countries, creating bilateral trade and migrant worker agreements. In addition to opening trade, such migrant worker programs with the US could allow the flow of remittances to the partnered countries. When considering the addition of research partnerships, training programs, and collaborative corruption investigation, the US has a great deal of resources to offer and ensure the creation of new direct relations with countries of the otherwise neglected Global South.

However, the greatest value proposition that the US can offer is a source of steady foreign direct investment through improving awareness and encouraging investment. Firstly, the office of the US Trade Representative, working with the Department of Treasury and Department of Commerce should actively work to investigate trade and investor climates in countries across the Global South, which currently do not seem to have much information available for investors and businesses wanting to conduct operations abroad. Working with credit ratings agencies such as Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s to rate unrated countries, especially those in Africa, could introduce a new dimension of available information for investors.

Through working with investment banks, the US can oversee the creation of sovereign wealth funds to finance public works projects with the notable aspects of US oversight of investment banks and corruption to prevent a repeat of 1MBD whilst also ensuring foreign contractors do not mute job growth from construction. To further prevent abuse, the involved executive bodies could monitor commissions made by the investment banks, and ideally, these companies would face a tax penalty for failure to raise/donate a certain quota of capital to these funds.

If the US is to reaffirm itself as a leader of the free world, it will need to genuinely work to free the Global South from neglect and economic stagnation. Continuation of widespread debt entrapment and poorly advised economic reform will likely perpetuate the horrifying cycle of weak growth and general dismissal of the Global South’s significance. Xi Jinping’s China noticed the desire for an alternative path to prosperity, but as observers will note, the type of predatory lending and diplomatic pressures presented with the Beijing Consensus is not necessarily a better alternative. Refusal to acknowledge this need for change will only result in persistent poverty for millions and a growing threat to global security.

According to the page, the vet has found semen in the body of the kitten and the preliminary reports suggest that it was subjected to sexual abuse, for continuous days. Multiple plastic bags, allegedly used by the boys to rape the animal, were found in her body by the veterinarian.

The kitten could not sit, walk, eat or even sleep due to the pain and trauma. The parents of one of the accused denied any sort of allegation and said, ""My son hasn't done it.""

'This is Pakistan, and these are Pakistani men': 5th animal sexual abuse incident

The animal shelter page had also added that it was the fifth case of animal sexual abuse they have faced.

This raises issues of the severity of animal abuse in Pakistan. Animal organisations are strongly condemning this incident urging the concerned authorities to take cases of animal abuse seriously. A case has reportedly been filed by the organisations and will see to it that severe action is taken against the accused.

The report further added, ""The kitten is buried and surely speaking to God up there about whatever happened to her in this cruel world. This is Pakistan, and these are Pakistani men. Men are choosing animals for rape now after women and minors,"" As the repulsive incident surfaced it sparked conversation over what has the country come to? Where has humanity gone?",JustBadNews,0

Breitbart is defrauding advertisers,http://branded.substack.com/p/so-thats-how-breitbart-is-still-making,"Welcome back to BRANDED, the newsletter exploring how marketers broke society (and how we can fix it).

We have some big news this week:

For the past few years, we’ve all believed that not funding hate is as easy as blocking bad sites. That you can avoid the risks of being viewed next to terrorist propaganda or hate speech by simply opting out.

But nothing about digital advertising is straightforward.

Last month, Zach Edwards, a data supply researcher, reached out to us with a tip. He told us he had found evidence that Breitbart was continuing to siphon advertising dollars from unsuspecting brands without their knowledge or consent. He told us the average marketer would never know — that you wouldn’t find any clues of this by checking your site list.

This tactic enables vast sums of money to be funnelled towards bad actors mostly without detection, which means that the biggest companies in the world are still funnelling ad dollars towards hate and disinformation. Even if you have blocked Breitbart or use an inclusion list, your brand could still be at risk.

Zach has been our guide to understanding this type of ad fraud, which we find to be so egregious that it should be illegal. We decided to join forces with him for this story.

👉🏽 You can read Zach’s technical version here.

We’re going to walk you through the story and implications in a multi-part series. This is the first issue.

It starts with account IDs

Every website has a number of account IDs to identify them on ad exchanges. Typically, websites that care about quality have just a handful. The New York Times, for instance, has only 12 different account IDs.

There are two types of account IDs: DIRECT and RESELLER.

DIRECT IDs tell advertisers that they’re bidding directly on one website.

RESELLER IDs tell advertisers that they’re bidding on inventory across multiple websites.

Sometimes, media conglomerates share the same account ID across their owned websites. If Condé Nast wanted to, they could do this with Vanity Fair, WIRED, and Teen Vogue. To make it clear that they’re sharing account IDs, they label one website with a DIRECT label, and the others with a RESELLER label. This is called pooling, also known as a ‘sales house,’ and it’s generally acceptable because at the end of the day, it’s all done within the same organization — in this case, it’s all Condé Nast inventory and being properly labeled as RESELLER inventory for buyers.

Technical readers will want us to note that DSPs and SSPs can legitimately use RESELLER labels, too. The RESELLER label is generally used by large SSPs and audience companies to pool audiences across all their client websites.

What outlets are not supposed to do, though, is share their DIRECT account ID with websites and companies that are completely unrelated to them. It’s not a direct sale, it mislabels the inventory, and it funnels advertiser money towards shared advertising accounts owned by unknown entities. That’s why we’re calling this dark pooling.

The mislabelling of DIRECT account IDs across websites means that these sites are sharing data (good for retargeting!) and ad revenues. One way to describe this grouping of DIRECT account IDs is a “sales house.” That makes these groupings “dark pool sales houses.”

That means Breitbart is still getting your ad dollars

Sharing DIRECT account IDs does not necessarily mean you’re committing ad fraud. It is possible to share one or two account IDs with Breitbart, for instance, and not be intentionally involved in a shady ad scheme.

For example, we found that Vimeo.com, MSN.com, Upworthy.com, TalkingPointsMemo.com, NBA.com, MLB.com, and AdWeek.com were all sharing DIRECT account IDs with Breitbart. This is hopefully news to these companies.

Wait, how is this happening?

Saambaa is one of the many sales house companies that seem to be working with Breitbart. On their site, they say that they help curate local content, grow audiences, and provide premium publisher experiences. We think companies like them might be the ones setting up these mislabeled DIRECT account ID records, or looking the other way as it happens.

We think (because of a reddit thread that talked about this) that companies like Saambaa might send their publisher clients a list of account IDs and tell them to put the code into their ads.txt file.

We don’t know, because we haven’t seen a Saambaa email (or emails from other sales houses), whether their instructions also educate the publisher about the difference between the DIRECT and RESELLER labels. Any of the organizations with these overlapping DIRECT account IDs may be surprised to know they’re in a dark pool sales house with Breitbart and other companies.

That’s not good. That could mean that even if they blocked Breitbart.com, they’re revenue sharing with Breitbart without knowing it.

Every account ID is linked to an advertising account, which is linked to a bank account. That gives us some clues as to where the money goes, but there’s no transparency beyond the shared account IDs.

These are generally backroom deals. We don’t know what the ad revenue split is here. These deals almost certainly include complex contracts and revenue sharing agreements, and we don’t know much Breitbart might be making. What are the cuts to manage these pools of mislabeled inventory? Is there some kind of a bonus associated with taking this risk? We don’t know.

RT.com looks like it’s financially tied to Breitbart, too

The story got crazy when Zach visited RT.com’s ads.txt file. He found that RT are really, really organized with their sales houses. They code them as Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, etc. In the RT.com ads.txt file, there are 13 blocks (sales houses). In many of these blocks, he found DIRECT bidding IDs shared across multiple websites. This work is blatant and out in the open. And even more surprising? Some of their ads.txt DIRECT account IDs match Breitbart’s.

Here’s Zach’s take:

If you compare the Breitbart.com/ads.txt file against the RT.com/ads.txt file, you will find at least 4 identical account-bidding IDs that share the “DIRECT” label on both sites, which is mislabeled RESELLER inventory being sold as DIRECT inventory to advertising buyers.

Financially tied like this, RT and Breitbart look to be in cahoots.

There’s a whole network of alt-right profit-sharing?

RT isn’t the only disinformation site Zach saw in Breitbart’s ads.txt records (available here).

He did a Google search of each of their DIRECT account IDs to find more. If you want to try this yourself, open a tab and search for this DIRECT account ID:

“33across.com, 0010b00001shFQpAAM, DIRECT, bbea06d9c4d2853c”

He found lots of associated sites. For instance, this DIRECT account ID is shared across 34 websites including...

Breitbart.com

DrudgeReport.com

PlymouthHerald.co.uk

BirminghamMail.co.uk

Liverpoolecho.co.uk

Mirror.co.uk

essexlive.news

Publir.com

Remember, only one site can have a DIRECT account ID, so this means that the rest of these sites are mislabeling their inventory. If you see a DIRECT account ID that is linked to more than one website it is likely linked to a dark pool sales house.

Here’s what Zach says:

Many of the Breitbart.com dark pool sales houses are labeled on ads.txt files hosted on other websites — so the names of the companies can be found, parsed and flagged. Some of these organizations are violating ethical standards, industry protocols endorsed by the IAB and Google, and likely legal frameworks in numerous jurisdictions, particularly due to their work as data amalgamators without registering as data brokers.

The account ID above appears to be linked to a dark pool sales house owned by Saambaa, which we mentioned earlier.

How is this not illegal?

This type of ad fraud is almost too brazen to believe. It’s taking place in broad daylight, through the same piping that ad industry associations have told us will safeguard our brands.

One of the reasons that this is still legal, or not explicitly known to be illegal, is that ads.txt is only three years old and there hasn’t been, to our knowledge, any major investigative research into the consequences of its design. But even though it is new, its risks are already severe. Ads.txt is a global standard, used in international markets. This giant security hole opens markets and mediascapes around the world to foreign propaganda, hate groups, money laundering, and, of course, fraud. If trade commissions aren't interested in this vulnerability, national security organizations should be.

Where are the ad industry associations on this?

That’s a good question! Ads.txt was developed by the adtech industry to bring transparency and accountability to the advertising supply chain. It was supposed to make it easier to verify that our ads were appearing on the correct inventory. However, because anyone can make up their ads.txt records, schemes like this one are incredibly easy to get away with.

What we need to combat this is free access to a universal ads.txt directory, so we can quickly query account IDs, and block any account IDs that don’t meet our quality thresholds (aka account IDs participating in dark pool sales houses).

A universal directory is essential to finding ad fraud like this. But the records are maintained by a handful of organizations — and it costs $10,000 a year to access them from the IAB Tech Lab. That makes it prohibitively expensive for most businesses as well as researchers like us to get our hands on the data.

We took a shot anyway, and asked three organizations - Google, Facebook and IAB Tech Lab - for a free copy of their ads.txt directory for research purposes. Google and IAB Tech Lab declined (Google said that they wanted to support their industry partners at IAB Tech Lab and TAG). Facebook didn’t respond. IAB Tech Lab told us the ads.txt directory is a source of revenue for their organization.

This raises some interesting questions about conflict of interest. What’s more important, brand safety or their organization’s money-making ventures?

So for now, we have done the tedious, manual and time-consuming work of going through ads.txt without access to a directory. It took Zach over a month to work through the information he presents in his detailed post, and there’s tons more information out there.

What can marketers do to avoid dark pool sales houses?

We believe there should be a free and easily accessible ads.txt directory across all domains in the global advertising inventory available to the public.

But for now, consider blocking all of the account IDs in this Breitbart ads.txt list. Otherwise Breitbart will continue receiving your ad dollars. There are over 230 DIRECT mislabeled publisher IDs in there.

Then, contact your ad exchanges to ask them if they’re giving you a refund for the budget you spent with those account IDs.

That’s it for now. We’ll have more for you next time.

Thanks for reading!

UPDATE (July 22, 10:00pm EST): Saambaa CEO Matt Voigt reached out to us with the following statement:

“Specifically on the ads.txt Direct issue: We run an events discovery module which renders itself on the page as a Javescript widget. The module is our own content and own experience, which is why we represent the inventory as our own inventory. We do not manage inventory for publishers, or run any kind of publisher ad network. We don't work with Breitbart, but since any publisher can copy and paste our ads.txt up, we don't control what they have up. It's an unfortunate reality of ads.txt that there is no control of it for us. The Breitbart ad inventory is managed by a third party ad management company. We work with them on other sites and they have grouped our ads.txt as part of their larger assembly of ad buyers on Breitbart.""

'Game changer' protein treatment 'cuts severe Covid-19 symptoms by nearly 80%',http://standard.co.uk/news/uk/coronavirus-treatment-protein-trial-synairgen-a4503076.html,"ES News email The latest headlines in your inbox twice a day Monday - Friday plus breaking news updates Enter your email address Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid You already have an account.

A “groundbreaking” new coronavirus treatment dramatically reduces the number of patients suffering severe symptoms, according to preliminary trial results.

The treatment, developed by Southampton-based biotech Synairgen, uses a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it contracts a viral infection.

Covid-19 patients inhale the protein into the lungs using a nebuliser, with the aim of stimulating an immune response.

Initial findings, published on Monday, suggest the treatment cuts the chances of a hospitalised coronavirus patient developing severe symptoms of the disease by 79 per cent.

Patients were at least twice as likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, according to Synairgen.

It said the trial also indicated the treatment “significantly reduced” breathlessness – one of the main symptoms of severe Covid-19.

There were also no deaths among patients treated with the new drug.

Professor Tom Wilkinson, the trial’s chief investigator said: ""We are delighted with the positive data produced from this trial, which is the result of a momentous coordinated effort.

“The results confirm our belief that interferon beta, a widely known drug that, by injection, has been approved for use in a number of other indications, has huge potential as an inhaled drug to be able to restore the lung’s immune response, enhancing protection, accelerating recovery and countering the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus.”

Full data from the trial has not yet been released, nor has the study been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

However, if the results are confirmed in larger studies the new treatment will be ""a game-changer"", Prof Wilkinson told the BBC.

The trial was relatively small but the signal that the treatment benefits patients was unusually strong, he explained.

The trial involved 101 volunteers, all Covid-19 patients, who had been admitted for treatment at nine UK hospitals, between March 30 and May 27.

Half of the participants were given the drug, the others received a placebo.

Patient groups evenly matched in terms of average age – 56.5 years for placebo and 57.8 years for those receiving the protein treatment.

""We couldn't have expected much better results than these,"" Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden told the same news site.

He described the results as ""a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients"".

Mr Marsden said the company will be presenting its findings to international medical regulators over the coming days.

They will then seek approval for the treatment, which could take months unless they are granted emergency approval, as was the case with anti-viral drug Remdesivir.

If it does get the green light, the treatment and nebulisers used to administer it will need to be manufactured in large quantities.

Mr Marsden said he had instructed companies to start producing supplies back in April to ensure they were ready for a mass roll-out.

He told the BBC he expects Synairgen to be able to deliver ""a few 100,000"" doses a month by the winter.",JustBadNews,0

After a daily record of 230,000 new cases of COVID-19 were reported to the WHO on Sunday, the U.N. health agency said the pandemic was only going to get worse unless people stuck to the basics of physical distancing, handwashing and wearing masks.

Tedros warned that countries that were easing their way out of lockdowns were now witnessing a resurgence of the virus because they were not following proven methods to reduce risk.

""I want to be straight with you: there will be no return to the 'old normal' for the foreseeable future,"" Tedros told a virtual news briefing.

""Let me blunt: too many countries are headed in the wrong direction.

""The virus remains public enemy number one, but the actions of many governments and people do not reflect this.""

He said mixed messages from leaders were undermining trust.

If governments do not roll out a comprehensive strategy to suppress transmission of the virus, and if populations do not follow basic public health principles, ""there is only one way this pandemic is going to go,"" he said.

""It's going to get worse and worse and worse.""

The novel coronavirus has killed nearly 570,000 people and infected more than 12.9 million since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.

""Although the number of daily deaths remains relatively stable, there is a lot to be concerned about,"" said Tedros.

He said there were four scenarios playing out around the world.

They were: countries that were alert and avoided large outbreaks, those that got a major outbreak under control, those that eased restrictions but are now backsliding, and those that are in an intense transmission phase.

Mother shot dead by BLM protestors.,http://newspunch.com/young-mother-shot-killed-black-lives-matter-protestor-after-saying-all-lives-matter/,"A 24-year-old mother was shot and killed by a Black Lives Matter protester in Indianapolis last week, allegedly for saying “All lives matter.”

Unlike Charlottesville, or any violence from the right, this cold-blooded killing was reported so quietly by the mainstream media that barely anyone heard anything about it.

Jessica Doty Whitaker was shot and killed following a confrontation with Black Lives Matter protesters who were upset that she and her fiance had said the world “All Lives Matter” last Sunday.

“According to the victim’s family, the shooting started with an argument over Black Lives Matter and language. Eventually the two sides separated and walked away from each other, until witnesses claim the killer opened fire from a nearby bridge and ran away,” Fox 59 reports.

“It was squashed and they went up the hill and left we thought, but they were sitting on St. Claire waiting for us to come under the bridge and that’s when she got shot,” the victim’s fiancé Jose Ramirez told the station.

TGP report: Her grandfather posted on Facebook that “multiple black assailants” shot her in the head.

“Why isn’t anybody outraged about this?” he asked in the post. “Is it that BLM was involved or that it was white young adults that [were] the victims?”

Whitaker leaves behind a three year old son.

“She shouldn’t have lost her life. She’s got a 3-year-old son she loved dearly,” said Ramirez.

Her father, Robert Doty, told the Gateway Pundit that the BLM supporters had walked by her and her fiance and said “Black Lives Matter,” to which Jessica responded that “All Lives Matter.”

The BLM activists had allegedly pulled out weapons during the argument, which prompted Ramirez to do the same. This lead to them backing off, but not for long.

“An argument started and guns came out, but they worked things out. Unfortunately, they didn’t drop it and waited for them to walk back through and she was shot in the head,” Doty told TGP.

Doty confirmed that neither CNN nor Fox News has reached out for information about the case, despite the murderer being on the loose.

When asked how the family is holding up, Doty said “one day at a time is all we can do.”

Her sister Jennifer told TGP that they were walking the canal with friends after an “awesome” Fourth of July celebration. She said that Jessica was shot three times, in the head and leg.

“It’s heartwrenching to watch my mother explain to my three year old nephew that mommy is an angel in heaven,” Jennifer told TGP, adding “and him ask when we can go get her and bring her back.”

Jennifer told TGP that her sister was a Certified Nursing Assistant doing home health care and getting ready to go back to school to become a registered nurse.

“Her son was her world, she had the kindest heart and was in no way racist towards anyone,” Jennifer told TGP.

Ramirez says that the hardest part has been explaining to her son Greyson that his mother will not be coming back.

“It’s hard to tell him his mom is in heaven and if you want to talk to her you have to look up and say, ‘I love you mom,’” said Ramirez.

“We’re going through a lot. The 3-year-old boy doesn’t even understand really,” said Ramirez. “I just want justice for Jessica and her son and her family.”

The demonstration Wednesday was billed as an event in support of the Day of Rage called by the Palestinian Authority and other groups to protest Israel’s announced plan to annex up to 30% of the West Bank on or after July 1.

A staff writer for The Washington Examiner, Nicolas Rowan, posted a video of some of the march on Twitter.

Chants also alternated between “Black lives matter!” and “Palestinian lives matter!”

The march, from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol building, was led by a Harvard student, Christian Tabash, who read a poem about Israel’s crimes against Palestinian Muslims, according to the Examiner. The poem referred to Israel as “puppet master of continents,” an age-old conspiracy theory that Jews run the world.

Tabash, a rising senior, also noted several times that the Palestinian movement is “intrinsically tied to Black Lives Matter” and called to defund police departments.

The Republican Jewish Coalition in response said in a statement: “We are horrified by this vicious hatemongering by Black Lives Matter protesters. The Black Lives Matter charter is filled with anti-Israel and antisemitic lies. It is deeply disturbing, but not surprising, to hear those sentiments chanted in the streets of Washington, DC.”

The statement called on former Vice President Joe Biden, “as the standard bearer of the Democrat Party, to condemn these anti-Semitic chants by BLM protesters.” PJC",JustBadNews,0
Trump 2020 campaign accused of 'ripping off' Nazi eagle logo,http://globalnews.ca/news/7130932/trump-nazi-eagle-logo-america-first/,"Send this page to someone via email

Donald Trump‘s re-election campaign has a new “America First” logo — and it looks a lot like the Nazi eagle used by Adolf Hitler and modern white supremacist groups, according to many critics on Twitter.

The logo, which can be found on T-shirts sold through the Trump campaign website, shows a stylized eagle grasping a circle containing the American flag. The eagle has its wings spread and its head turned to show its profile.

Photos of the new apparel quickly went viral on Twitter Wednesday, with critics sharing side-by-side images of the Trump logo and the Nazi eagle, which the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes as a “hate symbol.”

The Nazi symbol shows an eagle clutching a circle containing a swastika. The Trump and Nazi symbols depict the eagle in the same perched spread-wing pose, although the Nazi bird is typically drawn with more sharp-edged lines.

“Trump’s latest logo is yet another rip off of the Nazi logo,” tweeted Qasim Rashid, a lawyer, activist and Democratic candidate for Congress.

“Come. On,” wrote the Lincoln Project, a Republican anti-Trump political action committee.

Gen. Michael Hayden, the former director of the NSA and the CIA, expressed his astonishment on Twitter with a pair of four-letter words.

“Holy sh–,” he wrote, in a retweet that’s racked up more than 26,000 likes.

Others suggested that the design was an attempt to troll Trump’s left-leaning critics — something the campaign has done several times in the past by altering slogans such as “defund the police” or “Black Lives Matter.”

I've been pretty hard on people who make the Nazi comparisons around here, but Christ, even *I* saw this one right away.

“The President of the United States is campaigning for reelection with a Nazi symbol,” Bend the Arc, a U.S. Jewish political action committee, tweeted on Wednesday. “It’s not an accident. Bigotry is their entire brand.”

The logo itself appears to be an altered stock image, as Reddit users pointed out on Thursday afternoon. “Trump 2020” and “America First” seem to have been added to the existing photo.

The Trump campaign responded to the outcry on Twitter by suggesting, without evidence, that Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, is a “secret Nazi.”

Zach Parkinson, the campaign’s deputy director of communications, described the comparison as “so stupid” in a separate tweet. Parkinson also included several photos of official U.S. seals that show eagles clasping various objects in their claws.

The images show the eagle with its head facing the opposite direction, and with its talons extended to the side.

Parkinson’s tweets show several takes on the Great Seal of the United States — a stylized eagle clutching an olive branch in one talon and several arrows in the other.

“The olive branch and the arrows held in the eagle talons denote the power of peace and war,” according to the National Museum of American Diplomacy.

The ADL notes on its website that eagles are a common symbol among nations around the world, including the U.S.

“Not every image of an eagle is derivative of the Nazi eagle,” it said. “It is not uncommon, for example, for some Americans to mistake the Blue Eagle logo of the Roosevelt-era National Recovery Administration for a Nazi-derived symbol.”

The ADL says neo-Nazis will occasionally remix the logo to show the bird clutching other symbols of hate. “Occasionally, extremists will leave the circle blank where the swastika normally would appear,” the ADL says. “This seems to be more common in countries where the swastika is prohibited.”

The Nazi eagle was a prominent symbol in Hitler’s Germany, and a massive version of the logo lorded over the German Reichstag during the Second World War.

This is the second time in two weeks that the Trump campaign has been accused of using Nazi imagery. Facebook says it removed several Trump campaign ads on June 18 because they included images of an upside-down triangle — a symbol the Nazis used for political prisoners. Facebook said the ads violated its policies against organized hate by using a “banned hate group’s symbol.”

The logo emerged less than a week after Trump retweeted a video showing some of his supporters shouting “White power!” in a Florida retirement community. Trump eventually deleted the video and the White House claimed he hadn’t heard the slogan.

Trump’s “America First” slogan also has its roots in Nazi history, as researcher Molly McKew pointed out on Twitter.

“‘America First’ was the propaganda of the American Nazi Party,” she tweeted. “Trump used it anyway and didn’t care and basically no one called him on it.”

Nazi ideology wasn’t always verboten in the United States. There actually was an American Nazi Party in the 1930s, and it managed to pack about 20,000 people into New York City’s Madison Square Garden for a rally in 1939. “America First” was a popular slogan for the party at the time, as the Washington Post and The Atlantic have previously reported.

Trump has previously claimed that he is the “least racist person in the world.”

Snowden: Tech Workers Are Complicit in How Their Companies Hurt Society,http://vice.com/en_us/article/wxqx8q/snowden-tech-workers-are-complicit-in-how-their-companies-hurt-society,"Former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden says that tech workers need to think long and hard about how their labor is used by companies to amass power, surveil people, and fundamentally change society, and need to think about whether it is ethical to work at tech companies at all.

During a panel on technology and surveillance hosted by Motherboard and Mijente, Snowden was asked by Mijente campaign organizer Jacinta González what needs to be done to get workers within the tech industry to take a stronger position in the dismantling of oppressive systems.

Reflecting on his own experience, Snowden acknowledged there does seem to be an awakening occurring within the tech industry, but said those within tech need to think harder about the technologies they’re working on and the greater implications of their work.

“The reality is all work is political work. I don’t care if you’re selling hotdogs on the street. We’re all confronted with choices about how our labor is used, how we direct that, who we are really serving, who we’re working for and who benefits from the labor of our lives,” Snowden said.

Many in the tech industry have organized in recent years. In the past few weeks alone, we’ve seen a “virtual” walkout by hundreds of Facebook employees in protest to the company’s decision to leave up inflammatory posts by President Trump, and a letter signed by at least 1,666 Google employees demanding the company stop selling technology to police departments.

But González noted that even though these moments are exciting, many in the tech industry have not used their power to actually stop dangerous technologies from coming out when confronted by impacted communities. Many tech workers have shown they’re willing to sign their name to a letter, but relatively few have been willing to quit or become whistleblowers.

Snowden said many in the tech industry believe their work is value neutral, making a comparison to the physicists who worked to harness the power of the atom believing it would be used to build clean energy. The result of course was one of the most devastating weapons in human history.

“Engineers like to believe that they’re like scientists, what they do is something that is pure, and they’re just trying to get the rocket up. Where the rocket comes down is not their department,” Snowden said.

“People who make spreadsheets, people who make weather apps, people who just wanted to create family tree websites, all of them are being bought out, are being subverted, are being corrupted, are being incentivized into building capabilities into their platforms, into their apps that fundamentally work against the public and in the favor of some institution wherever they happen to be,” Snowden said.

He also referenced planes recently spotted flying circles above protestors in Portland, Oregon, noting these were the same surveillance strategies utilized in Afghanistan in which drones were used to map cell phones.

“These technologies were forged in the war front but they have a way of moving to the home front and they’re used against the disenfranchised, they’re used against the people with the least, they’re used against vulnerable minorities, and then they’re used against everyone. Even if you feel like this doesn’t affect you personally, it does and it will in time,” Snowden said.

He called on those in the tech industry to look at the bigger picture regarding their work and its implications beyond simply a project—and to think deeply and take a stronger stand with regards to who their labor actually serves.",JustBadNews,0
Nurse leader accuses Brazil of sacrificing medics to coronavirus,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/12/americas/brazil-coronavirus-nurses-doctors-crisis/index.html,"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) For Daniele Costa, being recruited as a nurse in Rio de Janeiro was a dream come true. Her friend Libia Bellusci recalls her ecstatic joy on getting the position -- a step up from her ambulance worker job on the city's outskirts.

""'Come here, I'll hug you,'"" she said she recalls Costa telling her, even though social distancing was in place. ""'I can't stop myself.'"" They'd queued for four hours for the interview, on a bright sunny day.

But the lucky break proved fatal. Costa caught coronavirus quickly and the last Bellusci saw of her was a Facebook video, describing her symptoms. Costa, 41, died alone, in a hospital four hours' drive outside of town, the only place she could get an ICU bed, on April 27.

Daniele Costa died just weeks after getting her dream job.

""In her last days she didn't get what she's given her whole life -- love and a great assistance,"" said Bellusci tearfully. ""She was an amazing person, very animated.""

Bellusci is vice president of Rio State's Nurses Union, advocating for a part of Brazil's medical staff that's been hit particularly hard . She herself has had coronavirus, but keeps the enduring lung symptoms of the disease a secret from her family, so as not to worry them. She was only tested courtesy of a privately funded program, and has since been cleared to go back to work, she said.

Nurse Libia Bellusci says nurses and doctors are dying amid an ongoing shortage of staff and equipment to tackle Covid-19.

In Rio state, the pandemic has claimed the lives of 30 doctors and 40 nurses and medical staff, medical staff unions say, likely the worst toll in Brazil. Bellusci describes the healthcare issues in Rio -- a city iconic and popular with tourists, but poor and criticized for its chaotic systems -- as ""very complex.""

""The units are full,"" she said. ""In others there are empty beds, but there aren't enough ventilators. There's also a shortage of health workers, because many got infected.""

""Worst is when, in the despair to assist everybody, we need to leave dead bodies to the side to try and save someone who's arrived very ill in the Covid-19 red zone,"" she said, adding they continue to prepare the bodies for the morgue once the new patient is stable. Bellusci said this problem had eased where she works, but her union had reports of it elsewhere.

Bellusci does what she can to shield her son and mother from coronavirus.

When she comes home, she takes off her clothes and PPE, and does all she can to protect her young son and mother. ""They are putting sick people to die,"" she said of the disregard for the safety of nurses who may have the virus. ""The municipalities, state and federal government are throwing people to death. There's no other explanation.""

Videos released by doctors from the worst moments of Rio's crisis seem to support the claims. One shows nurses sleeping on the floor of a field hospital in mid-May, often sharing mattresses. Another, from May 5, still shows corpses wrapped in trash bin liners, on beds next to a living patient.

The local government has recently said hospital capacity has improved enough to permit an easing of the lockdown, although cases do continue to rise. In one of Rio's better hospitals, the situation is much improved. CNN was shown around the Ronaldo Gazolla Municipal hospital, where 286 patients were being treated, 88 in the full ICU, staff said.

At that time, director Luis Fernando Gandara explained the hospital had about six to eight deaths a day, mostly in the ICU. That equates to a starting death rate of up to 10% of the ICU patients every day. Out the back of the hospital, three white freezer containers stand in a row, able to hold 75 bodies at a time, until they can be claimed and buried.

A coffin is wheeled out of the morgue at Ronaldo Gazolla Municipal Hospital in Rio de Janeiro.

""It's a level of lethality that nobody, no team, was prepared for,"" Gandara said. The challenge now is personnel. ""We need more doctors to work with Covid, and also some medications that are short in the market.""

He told CNN that his hospital had no shortage of PPE, a statement borne out by what we saw. The Rio governor declined requests for an interview on the topic. A statement from the Rio State health secretary said they had purchased millions of items of PPE and staff were trained in the proper use.

More protective equipment such as masks and gowns, here in a hospital in Mangaratiba, Brazil, is being provided, officials say.

Yet the shortages and death rate among patients and nurses is causing even the most committed doctors to quit. Pedro Archer is an ICU doctor in state-funded medicine, who said he is withdrawing from the Covid-19 ""red zones"" for his own health. Pale and with a light sweat on his forehead, he met us after a long shift.

""Last Wednesday, when I started my shift there were already no ventilators available and at 9 a.m. -- just two hours in -- a patient died because there wasn't a ventilator,"" he said. Hours later, an elderly man arrived with comorbidities. The team made the agonizing choice to give a spare ventilator not to him, but to another younger patient who would more likely survive. ""You spend the whole night super stressed,"" he said. ""Many doctors are leaving and resigning because the work conditions are very precarious.""

Archer is a director in the doctor's union in Rio, where he said a doctor has died every other day.

""In public sector they use the same PPE all day,"" he said, adding that in private hospitals they change for every patient. ""Here in Brazil if you have health insurance, you have much higher chances of surviving.""

Archer said some of the large field hospitals built in Rio have reduced the pressure, but colleagues are still resigning. ""It's draining, physically and emotionally. In the first difficult week of the pandemic, I've started my shift at 7 p.m. and I've lost a patient in the first hour.""

Field hospitals like this one in São Gonçalo, across the bay from the city of Rio, have added capacity for treating Covid patients.

""It's hard to face the worst health crisis in the country with a president who doesn't see the reality, or have the maturity to deal with the crisis. A president that fires two health ministers because he didn't agree with their medical opinions. We feel very undervalued, all of us who are in the front, fighting and seeing people dying every day.""",JustBadNews,0
Southaven police serve warrant at the wrong house and shoot man in the back of the head through his door. They say since he was here illegally he had no constitutional rights. Cops not charged.,http://cnn.com/2019/09/29/us/ismael-lopez-southaven-mississippi/index.html,"(CNN) An attorney for a city in Mississippi said in court documents a man who was shot by police in a case of mistaken identity has no Fourth or 14th Amendment protections because he was not a US citizen.

Ismael Lopez was shot and killed at his mobile home in July 2017 after police mixed up his address with that of a man wanted for domestic assault. Murray Wells, an attorney representing Lopez's family, said an investigation commissioned by his firm revealed that Lopez died of a single bullet to the back of the head.

In June, Lopez's family filed a $20 million wrongful-death lawsuit in federal court against Southaven, the city's police chief and the officers involved in Lopez's death.

In response, an attorney for the city filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on September 4, saying Lopez had no Fourth or 14th Amendment protections because Lopez was an ""illegal alien"" at the time of his death.

A number of Supreme Court rulings, such as an oft-cited 1982 decision over the right to education in public schools , have found that constitutional protections do apply to undocumented immigrants. How that plays out in practice is frequent fodder for courtroom battles, including a litany of pending lawsuits over various Trump administration immigration policy changes.

The Mississippi city's recent court filing said Lopez was a convicted felon ""for a crime of violence"" while in the US, and did ""not have the same rights as legal or resident aliens.""

""If he ever had Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment civil rights, they were lost by his own conduct and misconduct. Ismael Lopez may have been a person on American soil but he was not one of the 'We, the People of the United States' entitled to the civil rights invoked in this lawsuit,"" a city attorney wrote in her motion.

In the conclusion, the city lawyer says, ""Federal civil rights are not civil rewards for violating the laws of the United States.""

Lopez had previously been deported twice and re-entered the country without permission, according to a Mississippi Bureau of Investigation report obtained by the Commercial Appeal in Memphis. He had been arrested on domestic violence and DUI charges in Washington State in the 1990s, according to the report.

At a Thursday news conference, Wells, the Lopez family attorney, described the city's response as ""chilling,"" reported CNN affiliate WATN.

""In an address to a federal judge in an open pleading in court, the city of Southaven has announced that it is their policy that if you are an undocumented resident of that city, you have no constitutional protections,"" Wells said.

""Meaning, that storm troopers can come into your house and kill you without regard to any constitutional results or repercussions whatsoever.""

""It's in direct conflict with the Constitution of the United States, which clearly says under the 14th Amendment line one (that) all persons on United States territories have constitutional rights,"" Wells said. ""We're shocked; we do not believe that those arguments are in good faith. We don't believe they're founded on any real law whatsoever.""

A local grand jury declined to indict the two officers, DeSoto County District Attorney John Champion said in July 2018, according to CNN affiliate WREG.

Champion said the grand jury knew the officers went to the wrong address and never identified themselves at the door. He said he gave the grand jury the option to indict on charges of homicide or manslaughter, or to not indict.",JustBadNews,0
"Teargassed, beaten up, arrested: what freedom of the press looks like in the US right now",http://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/george-floyd-protests-reporters-press-teargas-arrested?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"Caught in the middle of a scrum covering protests in Minneapolis on Saturday, photojournalist Ed Ou could feel his hands and face were wet. For a long time, he didn’t know if it was teargas, pepper spray, or blood – in the end, it turned out to be a combination of all three.

'I’m getting shot': attacks on journalists surge in US protests Read more

Sheltered behind a wall in a pack of journalists, Ou had not seen the attack coming. He has documented civil unrest in the Middle East, Ukraine and Iraq, where he learned a few things: never get in the police’s way, find cover, stick together, always know your exit and make sure you are clearly identifiable as press. So when the curfew hit and police fired teargas into the crowd of protesters, Ou stood steady, out of the way, documenting. And then the unexpected happened.

“They literally started throwing concussive grenades in our direction, in the middle of the journalists,” he says. The police approached Ou directly and maced him in the face, spraying his camera, too. What ensued was a prolonged attack that involved being hit at with batons, being teargassed, dodging concussive grenades and begging for help.

The account has been corroborated by several other journalists on the ground, including the Los Angeles Times’ Carolyn Cole, who incurred an eye injury, and Molly Hennesy-Fiske, who was shot with rubber bullets several times in the leg. They describe the journalists as having been “completely against the wall, in an alcove, at least 15ft off the road to allow the police line to pass”.

Having covered conflict nationally and internationally for years, each express that while they understand the dangers of covering civil unrest, they never expected to be directly attacked by police forces in America. “I have never been shot at by police – even when covering protests overseas and war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq,” says Hennessy-Fiske.

This is what freedom of the press in America has looked like over the past week. As of 9pm Thursday, the US Press Freedom Tracker had received 192 reports of journalists being attacked by police while covering the protests across the US.

Among them, some have sustained serious injuries. Linda Tirado, a photojournalist, was hit in the face with a tracer round, resulting in loss of sight in one eye. The Chicago Tribune’s Ryan Fairclough was left with stitches after being shot through the window of his moving car while trying to retreat away from a police blockade. In Detroit, Nicole Hester was hit by pellets fired by Detroit police, leaving welts on her body. Others have been beaten up, arrested, their equipment damaged and they have been threatened for taking photos and filming on public streets.

These are not one-off incidents: this is a picture of widespread attacks on the profession. Whether it is constitutional is already under question – this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed what is thought to be the first lawsuit accusing a US city of breaking the constitutionally mandated freedom of the press.

Ou has gone back to the incident in Minneapolis several times since Saturday, analysing what he could have done wrong, or what he might do differently next time. But he is left with one conclusion: “The biggest mistake I made was trusting that the police would recognize the fact that we are there to document and remain impartial in that situation.”

‘They will treat you any way they choose’

“When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Donald Trump tweeted as mass unrest unfolded in America following the death of George Floyd.

From that point on, the world knew how America’s political leadership wanted to handle the protests. Since then, the president has called protesters thugs, terrorists and hoodlums. He has deployed the national guard, berated governors for being weak while urging them to “dominate” protesters and suggested 10-year prison sentences for them.

I think the police see journalists as attacking their tribe – they feel they are getting a lot of bad press because of what happened to Floyd Barbara Davidson

And at several points, he has made clear that the press is to be viewed as part of the problem. Trump has directly accused journalists of being complicit in the destruction taking place during the protests, suggesting they were in cahoots with looters. “If you watch Fake News CNN or MSNDC [sic], you would think that killers, terrorists, arsonists … would be the nicest, kindest most wonderful people in the world,” he said in one tweet. And then, shortly after: “It is almost like they are all working together?”

For journalists working on the ground, a direct line can be traced between the president’s comments about members of the press and the violence inflicted on them.

“When the president declares you an enemy of the state … Well the police, their job is to protect the state, right? So if they view us as the enemy they will treat you any way they choose,” says Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist Barbara Davidson. “I think the police see journalists as attacking their tribe – they feel they are getting a lot of bad press because of what happened to Floyd and so I think they are retaliating against us,” she adds.

Davidson was attacked on Saturday evening in Los Angeles. After a confrontation with a police officer telling her to move out of the way, she did – then, he came at her from behind and pushed her. She fell to the ground and whacked her head on the curb. As her neck whipped back and she tried to get up, she felt grateful: she had come to the protest wearing protective headgear and goggles.

That cop may have been a bad egg – just as there are looters among the mostly peaceful protesters so too there will be rogue cops who use and abuse their power, she says. But when she is out working, Davidson is not worried about the looters, she is worried about police.

Now, the worst part of Davidson’s day while out covering the protests is finding her car. She runs through highly policed neighborhoods with her head down, waving her press pass and shouting to identify herself.

“That is something you do in war zones – it is such a mindfuck. I am in the streets of Los Angeles,” she says.

‘The police understand the power of visuals right now’

Davidson is not the only one arguing that covering those protests, on American soil, has thrown reporters in extremely dangerous circumstances.

When Christopher Mathias was pushed by a cop in New York while covering the protests on Saturday, he made the mistake of telling the officer to fuck off. Within seconds, cops had their legs on Mathias’s head; twisting his arm and putting pressure on him until he thought his arm might break.

Mathias has covered far-right rallies, the Baltimore uprisings and the first Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson in 2014, and he calls the current protests some of the most intense he has seen. In part, he puts that down to the nature of the protests.

In Charlottesville, Virginia, he watched as armed, white far-right protesters pushed back the police with little resistance. In Georgia, he watched as militarized officers policing a neo-Nazi rally targeted anti-racist protesters, threatening them with semi-automatic rifles while white supremacists were left alone.

You have that badge around your neck, and more often than not it’s going to protect you rather than harm you Christopher Mathias

“There are a lot of Trump supporters in police departments,” says Mathias. He points out the speech made by Trump in Long Island in 2017, when a crowd of officers clapped as he encouraged them to rough people up.

“We are in this fascist moment and it stands to reason that the [police] probably don’t like the press and think that being law enforcement gives them the right to rough up whomever they please,” says Mathias. In other words, while not all officers act this way, now is an opportune moment to hide in plain sight.

Mathias thinks the police probably dealt with him so heavy-handedly because he was disrespectful to them, not because he is a journalist. For him, that’s a reminder of what can happen to any person at a protest in the current climate.

“Journalists have privileges that a lot of people don’t. You have that badge around your neck, and more often than not it’s going to protect you rather than harm you. A lot of cops at least have an understanding that if they mess up a journalist it could backfire,” says Mathias.

Alzo Slade, a Vice journalist who was detained for 45 minutes and fingerprinted for being out after curfew even after officers reviewed his press credentials, points out that if you are a black man, being a journalist makes no difference. When cops cornered him and his film crew and made them lie on the ground, it didn’t matter that they immediately identified themselves as press.

“[Of] four people in our crew, three are black men. Growing up in America, we know if we are to reach for anything besides the sky there’s a signifiant chance we get beat up or shot at.” That, he says, should give pause for thought. “The way we were being treated is nothing … In terms of what people are in the streets angry about, that pales in comparison.”

The reason why we are where we are today is because visual [footage] captured what happened to Floyd Barbara Davidson

If journalists and citizens can’t even attend a protest and safely record from their phones, what happens to truth? “The reason why we are where we are today is because visual [footage] captured what happened to Floyd,” says Davidson. “The police understand the power of visuals right now, and they don’t want the visuals – at least not ones that show them acting abusively.”

For her, the frightening part is that she thinks twice now about reporting on a sticky situation; she has to weigh whether staying out past curfew is worth a rubber bullet to the head. Nevertheless, the case for continuing their work is clear. “If you have nothing to hide, you would not be afraid of journalists or people with cellphones standing and recording you,” says Ou.

In this moment, being able to do their work freely is proving harder than ever.

“Right now, I don’t know how to act, when the very act of bearing truth and just being a witness is now interpreted as a political statement or seen as taking a side,” says Ou. “That’s difficult – because the only side we should take is truth.”

All 57 Buffalo cops resign from unit in protest after two of their own are suspended for injuring 75-year-old,http://yahoo.com/news/75-old-man-shoved-ground-142946876.html,"ALBANY, N.Y. – Two suspended Buffalo police officers were charged with second-degree assault Saturday amid outcry over video showing officers shoving a 75-year-old man to the ground at a demonstration over the death of George Floyd, prosecutors said.

Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski pleaded not guilty to the charges and were released without bail, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a news conference. The two were expected back in court July 20 for a felony hearing.

If convicted of the charge, the officers face a maximum sentence of seven years in prison.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Saturday applauded the work of Buffalo Mayor Bryon Brown and the district attorney after saying Friday that the officers should be fired.

""I think there was criminal liability from what I saw on the video,"" Cuomo said at a briefing Saturday. ""I think what the mayor did and the district attorney did was right, and I applaud them for acting as quickly as they did.”

He added: ""What we saw was horrendous and disgusting, and I believe, illegal.""

All 57 of the members of the Buffalo Police Department's Emergency Response Team resigned from the unit Friday after the two officers were suspended. The unit members have not quit the police department but have stepped down from the tactical unit.

Brown released a statement saying that the city was aware of ""developments related to the work assignments of certain members of the Buffalo police force"" and that contingency plans were in place to ensure public safety.

Asked about the resigning officers at a news conference Friday afternoon, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz he would be ""disappointed"" if they had in fact resigned.

""If they resigned, I'm exceptionally disappointed by it because it indicates to me that they did not see anything wrong with the actions last night,"" Poloncarz said.

Martin Gugino, the man who was pushed to the ground, was in ""serious but stable condition. He is alert and oriented,"" attorney Kelly V. Zarcone said in an emailed statement.

Gugino is ""a longtime peaceful protester, human rights advocate, and overall fan of the US Constitution,"" Zarcone said. He requests privacy and asks that future protests remain peaceful, Zarcone said.

Graphic video from WBFO shows the two officers pushing Gugino down as he approached them in a public square around an 8 p.m. curfew Thursday. Gugino stumbles back and falls, and the video shows him motionless and bleeding from his head.

""Our position is these officers were simply following orders from Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia to clear the square,"" Buffalo Police Benevolent Association President John Evans said. ""It doesn't specify clear the square of men, 50 and under or 15 to 40. They were simply doing their job. I don't know how much contact was made. He did slip in my estimation. He fell backwards.""

The officer's actions drew condemnation from around the state, including the governor, who played video of the incident during a news briefing Friday, watching it wide-eyed before questioning the officers’ action.

""You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency and humanity,"" Cuomo said.

""Why? Why? Why was that necessary? Where was the threat? It was an older gentleman. Where was the threat? And then you just walk by the person when you see blood coming from his head,"" he said.

Sen. Chuck Schumer called for an investigation, according to a statement reported by WIVB-TV.

""The casual cruelty demonstrated by Buffalo police officers tonight is gut-wrenching and unacceptable,"" John Curr, the Buffalo chapter director for the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement, adding that it should be a ""wake-up call"" for city leaders to address police violence.

In its initial statement on the incident, the Buffalo Police Department said a person ""was injured when he tripped & fell,"" WIVB-TV reported. A statement posted later on the department's Facebook page said two officers had been suspended without pay and an internal affairs investigation had begun.

Mayor Byron Brown said in a statement that he and the city's police commissioner were ""deeply disturbed by the video.""

""After days of peaceful protests and several meetings between myself, police leadership and members of the community, tonight's event is disheartening,"" Brown said.

Five protesters were arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct, according to NBC affiliate WGRZ-TV. None of the police officers seen in the video has been criminally charged.

The Buffalo Police Department and the New York State Police did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment on Thursday.

""I can assure you, Martin is a peaceable person,"" said Vicki Ross, executive director of Western New York Peace Center and Latin American Solidarity Committee, an organization Gugino was involved with.

""There is no way that he was doing anything to accost or hurt. He made a judgment to stay out after the curfew because he feels that our civil liberties are so in danger, which they most certainly are.""

Ross said Gugino has been undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.

The incident comes after more than a week of protests against police brutality following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis. Floyd, who is black, died after now-fired police officer, who is white, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as other officers stood by.

Since Floyd's death, which has been ruled a homicide, protesters nationwide have decried police brutality and racial inequality. Some protests have been marred by violence and looting, and police have been caught on camera multiple times using force against protesters – including peaceful ones.

Shock as 81-y-o inmate dies after 40 years in prison without trial,http://loopjamaica.com/content/shock-81-y-o-inmate-dies-after-40-years-prison-without-trial,"Jamaicans have reacted with a mixture of dismay and horror at the recent death of an 81-year-old inmate who had served 40 years in prison without being tried or convicted for an offence.

Noel Chambers, who had been incarcerated at the Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre since February 1980, died earlier this year. The case was brought to the media's attention Wednesday by the Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM), which said the death of Chambers had opened up a wider probe into conditions and procedures at the island's prisons.

Photos also emerged on Twitter that showed the emaciated, insect-bitten body of the 81-year-old man, who seemed to have been malnourished and mistreated while incarcerated even though the official cause of death has been established as a kidney infection.

One user reacted: ""The man is completely skeletal!! this is wickedness!!!!! Justice!!!!"". Another said: ""That's not real. No man. No.""

Former spokesperson and founding member of Jamaicans for Justice (JFJ), Susan Goffe reacted by tweeting: ""His condition at the time of his death indicate he had been kept in the most inhumane and horrific conditions. What now, #Jamaica?"".

A report published on the INDECOM website said: ""His (Chambers) medical record shows that on November 4, 2019, he was examined because he was not eating well, had poor vision, and flu-like symptoms. He was admitted to Kingston Public Hospital (KPH) between November 21 and 28, 2019.""

The report continued: ""There is a referral on file from Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre for KPH dated December 15, 2019 having shown a history of hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol; however, there is no evidence on file that he was taken to KPH. On the night before his death, he was found unresponsive by a medical orderly, taken to KPH and thereafter was pronounced dead. The cause of death given at the post mortem examination was acute pyelonephritis (a sudden and severe kidney infection).""

At the time of his death, Chambers was in a deplorable physical condition. His clothing was filthy and his body showed evidence of chronic emaciation. He was covered with what appeared to be vermin bites, live bedbugs (‘chink’) and he showed signs of having bed sores, the report detailed.

The report said that on January 27, 2020, the Commission commenced an investigation into the death in custody of Chambers. He was being held at the Governor General’s pleasure, deemed unfit to plead to a charge of murder. Therefore he was being held in custody without being convicted for an offence, INDECOM noted.

The report concluded that the ""overall lack of timely and adequate medical attention, in addition to his indefinite incarceration and poor hygiene, highlight serious breaches of his Constitutional rights, the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act (CJAA) and the Correctional Institution Rules"".

Following the death of Chambers, the Commission initiated a wider enquiry into conditions under which persons unfit to plead are being held at correctional institutions and the procedures afforded to them whilst held at the Court’s pleasure.

An inmate is detained at “pleasure” (Her Majesty’s Pleasure/ Governor General’s Pleasure/ Court’s Pleasure) in cases where children are found guilty of a capital offence; persons are found unfit to plead by the Court; or persons found by the Court to be guilty of an offence are adjudged by the Court to be suffering from a mental disorder.

The situation is further complicated by the uncertainty as to whether Chambers had ever been convicted of any offence. The report speaks to ""some confusion"" at the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) regarding whether or not Chambers was convicted.

The Commissioner of Corrections in his report to INDECOM stated that “Noel Chambers was tried and convicted in the Home Circuit Court on February 4, 1980 for the offence of murder. He was deemed unfit to plead and was held at the Governor General’s Pleasure.”

However, the Commission argued that Chambers could not have been unfit to plead and convicted. His commitment document by the Home Circuit Court has the words ‘guilty of’ struck out and replaced with ‘unfit to plead’, according to INDECOM.

This distinction, the Commission said, is important ""as it means the difference between a person, with presumption of innocence, being indefinitely detained as opposed to a convicted person being so detained.""

Twice, Chambers received ‘Fitness for Trial Certificates’ from two different psychiatrists. The first was issued for him on October 10, 2003.

It stated: “this inmate has no history of a mental illness. Repeated mental examinations revealed that there is no mental disorder and he is therefore competent to stand trial. He is not on any medication and is not a risk to himself or anyone at this time”.

The date for the second certificate is apparently 2009.

Despite these certificates being prepared, INDECOM said there is no indication that they were sent to the Court or that Chambers was taken back to court for trial. His medical records further indicated that psychiatrists opined that he was fit to plead in 2007 and 2008. Evidence gathered also indicates that attempts by his family members and a

human rights attorney to have his case heard in Court proved futile.

In time, his family grew disheartened with the process, the report surmised.",JustBadNews,0

(Glynn County Detention Center via AP, File)

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) — A state investigator testified Thursday that a white man was heard saying a racist slur as he stood over Ahmaud Arbery’s body, moments after fatally shooting the black man with a pump-action shotgun.

ADVERTISEMENT

The inflammatory revelation came amid a week of angry nationwide protests over law enforcement biases against black victims that erupted after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

In a hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed with a murder trial, the lead Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent in the case testified that Travis and Greg McMichael and a third man in another pickup, William “Roddie” Bryan, used their trucks to chase down and box in Arbery, who repeatedly reversed directions and ran into a ditch while trying to escape.

Travis McMichael then got out of his truck and confronted Arbery, later telling police he shot him in self-defense after Arbery refused his order to get on the ground, GBI agent Richard Dial said. He said a close examination of the video of the shooting shows the first shot was to Arbery’s chest, the second was to his hand, and the third hit his chest again before he collapsed in the road in a subdivision in the port town of Brunswick.

“Mr. Bryan said that after the shooting took place before police arrival, while Mr. Arbery was on the ground, that he heard Travis McMichael make the statement, ‘f - - - ing n - - - er,’” Dial said.

Bryan gave investigators the information roughly a week after the McMichaels’ arrest, but there’s no indication he told Glynn County investigators before that, Dial added.

Lee Merritt, an attorney for Arbery’s family, told reporters outside the courthouse that prosecutors had warned the family before the hearing of the coming testimony about the slur.

“It was still very difficult to hear in the context of a prolonged chase, that after he murdered Ahmaud Arbery and stood over his body, he used that racial epithet,” Merritt said. The lawyer said Thursday’s testimony revealed that “racism was at the heart” of Arbery’s slaying.

Full Coverage: Ahmaud Arbery

Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones called the release of new details in court “very, very heartbreaking.”

“He was afraid,” Cooper-Jones said of her slain son. “Life had placed him in a position where I couldn’t protect him, and he wasn’t able to protect himself.”

At the conclusion of the probable cause hearing Thursday, Magistrate Court Judge Wallace Harrell found that there was enough evidence for the cases against all three defendants to proceed.

“Ahmaud Arbery was chased, hunted down and ultimately executed at the hands of these men,” prosecutor Jesse Evans told the judge. “He was on a run on a public road in a public subdivision. He was defenseless and unarmed.”

Under questioning by Jason Sheffield, an attorney for Travis McMichael, Dial said Travis told police he raised his shotgun at Arbery from roughly 90 feet (27 meters) away and told him to stop and get on the ground.

That’s when Arbery ran around the passenger side of Travis’ truck, and the two men met in front of it.

Dial said Travis told police Arbery “squared up” like he was going to attack.

“There’s a statement that he might have had his hand on his shirt,” Dial said. “Travis McMichael said his adrenaline was pumping and it all happened very quickly.”

He said Travis then fired the first shot into Arbery’s chest.

Sheffield argued that the pursuit began with a legitimate concern about past crimes in the neighborhood that escalated right before the shooting.

“Travis McMichael used self-defense when he was attacked by Mr. Arbery,” Sheffield said.

“I don’t think it was self-defense by Mr. McMichael,” Dial said. “I believe it was self-defense by Mr. Arbery.”

The testimony presented Thursday raises questions about the idea that the McMichaels and Bryan were legitimately carrying out a citizens’ arrest of a suspected burglar. It also could factor into a federal investigation into whether hate crime charges are warranted.

Dial testified that Greg McMichael told police that “he didn’t know if Mr. Arbery had stolen anything or not, but he had a gut feeling” that Arbery had committed prior break-ins in the neighborhood.

The investigator testified that police body camera footage showed a Confederate flag sticker on a toolbox in Travis’ truck and that investigators discovered at least two more racial slurs in messages on his phone.

In response to questioning from Bryan’s attorney Kevin Gough, Dial testified that he believes Bryan joined the chase because he saw a black man running down the street with a truck following and drew conclusions based on racial bias. There’s evidence of Bryan’s “racist attitudes in his communications,” Dial said, referring to comments found on his cellphone.

The investigator added that several residents of the subdivision where Arbery was killed told investigators they had seen him running in the neighborhood previously.

Dial said the three defendants are the only known witnesses to the shooting and investigators have found no other video of Arbery’s final moments other than what Bryan recorded.

Arbery was killed Feb. 23 after Travis McMichael, 34, and his father, Greg McMichael, 64, gave chase when they spotted the 25-year-old black man running in their neighborhood. Bryan said he saw them driving by and joined the chase, Dial said. It wasn’t until May 7 — two days after Bryan’s cellphone video leaked online and stirred a national outcry — that the defendants were charged.

The McMichaels both wore masks as they sat side-by-side watching the hearing onscreen at the Glynn County jail. The judge rejected defense motions to have them brought to the courtroom, citing emergency precautions because of the coronavirus pandemic. Bryan waived his presence at the hearing.",JustBadNews,0
Louisville BBQ man who was fatally shot when police dispersed crowd used to feed officers for free,http://cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/david-mcatee-louisville-what-we-know-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) David ""Yaya"" McAtee and his BBQ joint were fixtures on the Louisville corner where he was fatally shot as police and the Kentucky National Guard dispersed a large crowd early Monday.

McAtee, 53, called the spot ""one of the busiest locations in West Louisville,"" where he had built a steady clientele over the years that included local cops his mother said usually ate for free. It was a popular outdoor eatery he had dreamed of turning into a restaurant, according to his mother and a February interview he gave the local West of Ninth photo blog

Odessa Riley, center, said her son was killed ""for no reason.""

McAtee's mother, Odessa Riley, questioned the actions of the police, saying her son was ""trying to make an honest dollar to take care of his rent and his bills. And they gonna shoot him down like a dog.""

Surveillance footage appeared to show McAtee fire at police first as officers used pepper balls to clear a crowd in a neighboring parking lot, according to video released Tuesday. The officers appeared to take cover and returned fire.

In one video, McAtee is seen at the door to the restaurant with his right arm extended. Moments later, McAtee moves back into the shop, clutching his chest, and falls to the ground.

Here's what we know about David McAtee and how he died:

Police say they returned fire after being fired upon

Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad was fired after officials discovered two of his officers involved in McAtee's shooting had not activated their body cameras.

""This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Monday.

McAtee was shot as police and National Guard members tried to disperse a large crowd, according to police, who said officers returned fire after being fired upon. The city has a dusk-to-dawn curfew after nights of protests.

The LMPD officers, identified as Katie Crews and Austin Allen, are on administrative leave pending an investigation into the shooting.

Crews joined the police department in February of 2018. Allen joined in February 2016.

The National Guard members have not been identified and have not been been disciplined or reprimanded, said Steve Martin, a spokesman for the state's National Guard.

Kentucky, like other states, has had protests stemming from the the death of 46-year-old George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police last week. But Louisville protesters have also voiced anger over the March death of Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician who was shot multiple times when three LMPD officers entered her apartment by force to serve a search warrant.

Police and National Guard units around 12:15 a.m. early Monday were sent to clear a large crowd in the parking lot where McAtee sold his BBQ at a store front.

""Officers and soldiers begin to clear the lot and at some point were shot at,"" Conrad told reporters. ""Both LMPD and National Guard members returned fire. We have one man dead at the scene.""

Louisville Metro Police Maj. Paul Humphrey said police were trying to disperse the crowd after dealing with other ""unruly crowds"" around the city Sunday night. The gunfire erupted after police used the pepper balls to disperse some people in the crowd, he said.

People usually gathered in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, next to the BBQ spot, on weekends to eat and listen to music.

In dispatch audio released by police an officer is heard saying, ""took fire from the small building just to the east of Dino's, across from 26th Street. Small gray building. We have people barricaded inside that building.""

Interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Robert Schroeder said of the video, ""We are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question. Why did (McAtee) fire? And where were police at the time he fired? We know these are questions the community is asking, and we are asking these same questions ourselves.""

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said state police were investigating McAtee's death.

""It is our belief at this time that approximately 18 shots were fired between the Kentucky National Guard and the Louisville Metro Police that evening,"" Michael Brown, secretary for the governor's executive cabinet, told reporters on Tuesday.

""Those weapons are also in our custody for further testing, and they will be tested for DNA and any other things we can get from them,"" he added.

Russell Coleman, US attorney for the Western District of Kentucky, also said on Twitter his office has started an investigation, which will be carried out alongside FBI Louisville office and state police.

""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.""

""They've nurtured so many people in their bellies and in their hearts before, and for him to be caught up in this, not to be with us today, is a tragedy.""

McAtee was shot while trying to protect his wounded niece

McAtee's nephew, Marvin McAtee, told CNN affiliate WAVE that a niece of the chef was wounded when the gunfire erupted. She survived. McAtee was fatally shot in the chest while reaching out to grab his niece, Marvin McAtee said.

But police said there were no other reports of someone being shot at the scene.

Local officers knew McAtee well, his family said.

""He fed all the policemen,"" Riley told the station. ""Police would go in there and talk with him and be with him. He fed the police. He fed them free.""

Riley told CNN Monday that Fischer had briefly met with her near the scene of the shooting. She said he prayed for her.

""I broke down and started crying, but he, the Mayor Fischer, he's a good person,"" she said.

Last week, seven people were shot downtown in protests over Taylor's death after audio was released of Taylor's boyfriend's call to 911 the day she died. Fischer said the shots came from the crowd, not the police.

'I'm here for a reason,' McAtee told photo blog

In a interview that appeared in the West of Ninth photo blog in February, McAtee said he had been cooking and selling BBQ for about 30 years but had been at the West Louisville location for two.

""I always wanted to be in this spot, and when the opportunity came, I took it,"" he said. ""If I go, somebody else will snatch it. I've already built my clientele, and I'm not trying to give up my clientele.""

McAtee said he had ""some ups and downs"" from ""living a crazy lifestyle"" but he straightened out. He said he had been shot and robbed.

""I have always been blessed with the skills to cook,"" he told the blog. ""I didn't need anything else. People have to eat every single day, and all I need is my skills.""

McAtee had hoped to buy the lot and build a more permanent spot.

""I gotta start somewhere, and this is where I'm going to start. It might take another year or two to get to where I'm going, but I'm going to get there.""",JustBadNews,0

Trump threatens shut down social media platforms after Twitter put a disinformation warning on his false tweets,http://businessinsider.com/trump-threatens-shut-down-platforms-after-tweets-tagged-warning-2020-5,"President Donald Trump has threatened to close down social-media platforms that ""silence"" conservative voices.

He made the threat Wednesday, the morning after Twitter tagged some of his tweets with a fact-check warning.

The platform had been under pressure to take action after Trump leveled a groundless conspiracy theory against the MSNBC cohost Joe Scarborough.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump has threatened to close down social-media platforms that he argues censor conservative voices after Twitter on Tuesday tagged some of his messages with a fact-check warning.

""Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday. ""We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016.""

Twitter had long been criticized for allowing the president to spread conspiracy theories and smears against opponents despite its policies against the promotion of disinformation.

It recently came under increasing calls for it to take action against Trump after he spent weeks promoting a baseless conspiracy theory alleging that the MSNBC cohost Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a staffer, Lori Klausutis, while he was serving as a US congressman.

Twitter has declined to take action against the president for the messages about Scarborough, but on Tuesday for the first time it put a fact-check tag on some of Trump's tweets.

The president wrote two tweets claiming ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""

Twitter tagged each of the two messages with a blue exclamation mark and warning message, linking to articles in The Washington Post, CNN, and other outlets that debunk the president's assertion.

Trump doubled down on his voter-fraud claims in a follow-up tweet Wednesday.

""We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again,"" Trump wrote. ""Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!""

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, Virginia, said that Trump was unlikely to be able to follow through on his threat against social media companies.

""I think that it is mostly bluster. There are steps he might take, but they are likely to be slow, cumbersome and ineffective, although he does have the huge bullhorn of the presidency to persuade the voters that he is correct and deserves reelection,"" he explained to Business Insider by email.

""He could issue executive orders or try to persuade federal agencies to regulate or take action against Twitter or convince Congress to legislate, but none will be fast or help him before November,"" he expalined. ""Reelection might help him achieve some of what he wants in the longer term as agencies and Congress are investigating big tech and may consider legislation but nothing will pass soon.""

Trump has long accused social-media companies of bias against conservatives. In June 2019 he invited several far-right provocateurs and conspiracy theorists, some of whom had had hate speech removed by social-media platforms, to the White House for a social-media summit.

He has also credited being able to communicate on Twitter as a key factor in his election to the White House, remarking that it allows him to communicate with voters directly, unfiltered by media organizations he accuses of partisan bias.",JustBadNews,0
Minneapolis policer officer murders an arrested motionless man by kneeling on his neck,http://cbsnews.com/news/minneapolis-police-fatal-arrest-officer-kneeling-neck-man-died/,"A video taken by an onlooker Monday evening shows a Minneapolis police officer keeping his knee on the neck of a motionless, moaning man at the foot of a squad car. The man, who was later identified as George Floyd, later died.

Tuesday afternoon, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced that four officers involved are now ""former employees"" with the department, CBS Minnesota reports. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted, ""Four responding MPD officers involved in the death of George Floyd have been terminated. This is the right call.""

A police statement said officers were responding to a ""forgery in progress."" ""Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence,"" the statement said. ""Two officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car. He was ordered to step from his car.

""After he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance,"" according to the statement.

The man died soon after, the statement said, adding: ""At no time were weapons of any type used by anyone involved in this incident. … Body worn cameras were on and activated during this incident.""

Arradondo said at a press conference Tuesday that the FBI will lead the investigation into the incident due to the possible civil rights violation.

The man who died was identified as George Floyd by Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney who said he had been hired by Floyd's family.



""We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him into the police car and get off his neck,"" Crump said in a statement. ""This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge.""

Two of the officers involved have been ""relieved of duty status,"" Arradondo said. The officers are still receiving pay, but have no law enforcement duties.

The video, captured by Darnella Frazier, begins with the man, who is black, groaning and repeatedly saying ""I can't breathe"" to the officer who has his knee on the man's neck. The officer is white.

""Please,"" the man pleads. ""I can't breathe,"" and continues to moan. An officer keeps insisting he get in the car, while the man repeatedly says he can't.

""My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts. … (I need) water or something. Please. Please. I can't breathe, officer. … I cannot breathe. I cannot breathe."" That was followed by more groaning.

A female bystander points out the subject's nose is bleeding.

In an ongoing commentary permeated by cursing, a male onlooker says: ""That's bulls**t, Bro. You're stopping his breathing right there, Bro. Get him off the ground, Bro. You're being a bum right now.""

The man says the officer is ""enjoying that. He's a bum, Bro. You could have put him in the car by now. He's not resisting arrest or nothing. You're enjoying it. Look at you. Your body language — you bum. You know that's bogus right now.""

The female onlooker repeatedly urges the officers to check the subject's pulse. ""He's not responsive right now,"" a bystander says. ""He's not moving."" An ambulance then arrives and takes the man away.

""You just really killed that man, Bro,"" the male onlooker says to the officer.

Frazier, who took the video, wrote on Facebook: ""They killed him right in front of cup foods over south on 38th and Chicago!! No type of sympathy 💔💔#POLICEBRUTALITY.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called the man's death ""simply awful,"" and ""wrong at every level"" at the press conference Tuesday.

""For the better part of the night I've been trying to find the words to describe what happened and all I keep coming back to is that he should not have died,"" Frey said.

""What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up,"" he said. ""This man's life matters, he matters. He was someone's son, someone's family member, someone's friend. He was a human being and his life mattered.""",JustBadNews,0
Hong Kong public broadcaster axes satirical show hours after gov't demands apology for 'insulting' police,http://hongkongfp.com/2020/05/19/hong-kong-public-broadcaster-axes-satirical-show-hours-after-govt-demands-apology-for-insulting-police/,"Hong Kong’s public broadcaster has suspended a satirical show hours after the Communications Authority (CA) issued it with a warning for “insulting” the police force.

The statutory body’s ruling on Tuesday referred to a February episode of RTHK’s Headliner: “The CA took the view that the complaints in respect of [the] accuracy of factual contents, denigration of and insult to the Police, and expression of a sufficiently broad range of views in personal view programmes were substantiated,” it said.

RTHK’s Headliner has received complaints after airing a controversial episode. Photo: RTHK screenshot.

The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, which oversees the Communications Authority, said the station must accept the CA’s findings, investigate any cases of negligence by staff and conduct a full review.

“RTHK must fully abide by the Charter of RTHK, duly meet its responsibility as a public service broadcaster and strictly comply with the relevant codes of practice issued by the CA,” a government spokesperson said.

Headliner sparked a row after an episode aired on February 14 jokingly implied that police officers had more protective gear than other frontline government agencies and medical staff amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The episode received more than 3300 complaints, according to Ming Pao, while several protests were staged by pro-Beijing groups outside RTHK’s headquarters.

A spokesperson for the broadcaster reportedly apologised to police officers and all others who were offended. The station said the series will halt after the current season as it conducts a review and studies how to develop the show “in an ever-changing social environment.”",JustBadNews,0
Hong Kong teen who was allegedly gang raped by police in station defends claim after police chief says she must be arrested for lying,http://hongkongfp.com/2020/05/13/hong-kong-woman-who-accused-officers-of-gang-rape-defends-claim-after-police-chief-says-she-must-be-arrested-for-lying/,"A woman who accused officers of gang-raping her in a police station has defended her claim after the force announced plans to arrest her on suspicion of providing false information.

Her statement came a day after police chief Chris Tang revealed at a Yuen Long District Council meeting on Tuesday that the 19-year-old woman – known as “Ms X” – was facing arrest for allegedly misleading detectives. X has left Hong Kong and is now “wanted,” he said.

The force previously confirmed a woman filed a complaint with them on October 22 last year, alleging that she had been gang-raped by unknown officers in Tsuen Wan police station and had to undergo an abortion as a result. She allowed the taking of a DNA sample from the aborted foetus at the time to help identify at least one of the assailants, according to her lawyers.

The alleged incident occurred during months of pro-democracy unrest which saw thousands arrested and police accused of abusing their power to crack down on protesters.

‘Privacy and dignity’ breach

In a statement issued on her behalf by her legal representatives – Vidler & Co. Solicitors – Ms X accused Tang of intentionally publicising her case in a repeated attempt to discredit her.

“… I learnt from media reports that the Commissioner has publicly said that I am facing arrest for ‘making a false statement.’ He again chose to do so publicly, in a manner which any objective observer would be driven to conclude was directed at discrediting me,” it read.

“I hoped and prayed that the complaint would be investigated impartially, in strict confidence and with respect for my privacy and dignity. None of that has happened.”

On November 4 last year, police obtained a search warrant to seize Ms X’s medical records – including those pre-dating the alleged incident – as well as CCTV footage from her private doctor’s clinic without her consent, prompting her to mount a legal challenge.

The magistrate suspended the warrant and granted an anonymity order the next day. The court formally cancelled the warrant on November 28.

Tang said in January that Ms X was under investigation because her claim was inconsistent with video footage from the time of the alleged incident. The move was denounced by lawyers as an effort to diminish her prospects of a successful prosecution.

On April 6, the Department of Justice said her police report would not be taken any further citing contrary evidence, though Ms X has said she has not been provided with an opportunity to refute the claim.

Pastor Who Often Asked Atheists How's That Working Out For You? Dies of Suicide,http://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2020/05/10/pastor-who-often-asked-atheists-hows-that-working-out-for-you-dies-of-suicide/,"Darrin Patrick, a megachurch pastor, author, and speaker, has died of an apparent “self-inflicted gunshot wound,” according to a statement from his church.

In 2016, Patrick… was fired from The Journey [a six-location megachurch in St. Louis he co-founded, TF] for what church officials said was misconduct, including “inappropriate meetings, conversations, and phone calls with two women” and a pattern of sinful conduct, including lying, abuse of power and lack of self-control.

He had a checkered past, says Religion News Service (RNS):

Patrick went through 26 months of “restoration,” which included spiritual and marriage counseling, ultimately resuming his religious work in a new job as a teaching pastor at Seacoast Church, a megachurch in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.

A friend of his, Bob Oesch, told RNS during an impromptu remembrance that

… Patrick would often ask people who “lived without God in their lives”: “How’s that working for you?” “And that was a great way of getting people to see the value of putting God in their lives,” Oesch said. “I still call it ‘the Darrin question.’”

“A great way of getting people to see the value of putting God in their lives.” Well, sorry, I beg to differ. The question, if that’s how Patrick phrased it, has an unmistakable edge of judgment and condescension to it. It’s what you might ask a habitual drug user or someone with a chronic anger problem (if you didn’t mind coming off as a bit disagreeable). It’s not nearly the same as the neutral “What made you choose that path?” or “Tell me about the pros and cons of that.” Instead, “How’s that working out for you” is a tidy little bouquet of mild aggression and superiority, with a top note of amusement.

It wouldn’t be couth or kind to posthumously ask the deceased pastor how being a fervent fan of God has worked out for him, so instead I’ll just point out that the scourge of clinical depression hangs heavily over America’s clergy.

There is no lack of statistics about pastors and depression, burnout, health, low pay, spirituality, relationships and longevity — and none of them are good. According to the Schaeffer Institute, 70 percent of pastors constantly fight depression, and 71 percent are burned out. Meanwhile, 72 percent of pastors say they only study the Bible when they are preparing for sermons; 80 percent believe pastoral ministry has negatively affected their families, and 70 percent say they don’t have a close friend. The Schaeffer Institute also reports that 80 percent of seminary and Bible school graduates will leave the ministry within five years. It’s not clear how many commit suicide, but it is clear that pastors are not immune to it.

More here.

Our hearts go out to Pastor Patrick’s loved ones — and to all people, in any profession and from any background, who struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts.

If that’s you, you don’t have to go it alone. Help is available.

"Hong Kong judge airs sympathy for anti-protest man who stabbed 3 citizens, blames pro-democracy movement",http://hongkongfp.com/2020/04/26/hong-kong-judge-airs-sympathy-for-anti-protest-man-who-stabbed-3-citizens-blames-pro-democracy-movement/,"Activists have urged the public to file complaints after a Hong Kong judge expressed sympathy for a man who was sentenced to 45 months in prison for stabbing three people in front of a pro-democracy message board last August.

Judge Kwok Wai-kin said the defendant, Tony Hung, was a victim of the pro-democracy protests as they affected his livelihood as a tour guide. According to Ming Pao, Kwok said Hung had made an “involuntarily sacrifice” and had suffered a reduced income.

“If there had not been such unusual unrest in Hong Kong, the mishap would not have happened,” Kwok said. He added that protests at the airport targeting mainland visitors had put a nail in the tourism industry’s coffin.

Kwok added that the defendant’s right to work, live and survive had been ruthlessly trampled upon and destroyed by people who claimed to be fighting for freedom. He compared them to terrorists and said it was reasonable to blame the movement.

On August 20 last year, 50-year-old Hung stabbed three citizens in front of a “Lennon Wall” of pro-democracy messages inside a Tseung Kwan O pedestrian subway after hearing their opposing political views.

All three victims were hospitalised, including a 26-year-old journalist who suffered a collapsed lung and remained in a critical condition for some time.

Kwok said he believed that one of the two knives Hung held was used to scrape off posters on the message board, Now TV reported.

Hung pleaded guilty for wounding with intent and was sentenced to 45 months in jail – a reduction from the starting point of six years behind bars.

‘Rule of law is dead’

Pro-democracy activist Ventus Lau shared a post from online forum LIHKG which called for complaints to be lodged against Judge Kwok. “Rule of law is dead. Red judges are in authority… It is time to take action and resist against the unjust judiciary,” Lau’s post read.

Kwok was appointed a District Judge in 2012 and has heard a number of prominent protest-related cases including one involving nine defendants charged with rioting during the Mong Kok unrest in 2016. He also presided over a case relating to an incident where protesters surrounded police headquarters last June.

Protests erupted last June over a now-axed extradition bill. They escalated into sometimes violent displays of dissent against police behaviour, amid calls for democracy and anger over Beijing’s encroachment. Demonstrators demanded an independent probe into the police conduct, amnesty for those arrested and a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots.”",JustBadNews,0
Recording of a call to Larry King bolsters Tara Reade's claim Joe Biden sexually assaulted her,http://rt.com/usa/486862-reade-biden-cnn-video/,"The mainstream media’s dismissal of Tara Reade’s claims she was sexually assaulted by then-Senator Joe Biden just became more awkward after a video emerged of her mother’s 1993 call into CNN’s Larry King Live.

The minute-long clip that surfaced on Friday shows a female called into Larry King Live from San Luis Obispo, California on August 11, 1993, seeking advice about her daughter who just left Washington after having “problems” with “a prominent senator.”

BREAKING: Is this the mother of Joe Biden's accuser talking to CNN in 1993? pic.twitter.com/rF7jw35s2F — MediaResearchCenter (@theMRC) April 24, 2020

“CALLER: Yes, hello. I’m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington? My daughter has just left there, after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him,” says the transcript of the segment, published by Ryan Grim of the Intercept on Friday.

Grim noted that when he interviewed Reade, she mentioned her mother’s call to CNN, but could not remember the exact content of it or the date of the show. Reade’s mother, who passed away in 2016, lived in San Luis Obispo in August 1993. Presented with the recording on Friday, Reade told reporters that the voice in it was in fact her mother’s.

Tara Reade told me this is her mother's voice. https://t.co/7ymN6Pj55m — Holly Otterbein (@hollyotterbein) April 24, 2020

Reade worked as a staffer for then-Senator Joe Biden in the early 1990s, but left Washington abruptly after filing a complaint about sexual harassment. Biden’s documents from that time have been sealed until two years after he retires from public life, but the 77-year-old is currently seeking to challenge President Donald Trump in November as the Democratic Party presidential nominee.

Speaking with journalist Katie Halper last month, Reade described in graphic detail how Senator Biden sexually assaulted her in the hallway of the Russell Senate Office Building sometime in the spring of 1993, as she was bringing him a gym bag.

Also on rt.com Believe all women? New York Times only remembers its journalistic skepticism when it’s Biden in the crosshairs

Mainstream US media outlets have largely ignored Reade’s allegations. When they finally got around to addressing them in mid-April, the New York Times ran a feature-length article dismissing them out of hand. This has been in marked contrast with the attention the Times and other mainstream outlets gave the far more vague and uncorroborated claims by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford last year, during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

"It's hypocritical, it's false, it's a sham: One Bangladesh Factory Owner On Why Brands Can't Turn Their Backs On Garment Workers",http://vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/bangladesh-garment-worker-crisis-factory-owner,"In ‘Get Your Greens’, an ongoing series in line with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, British Vogue explores how the industry is advancing towards a greener future.

If you are struggling to concentrate at home, or feeling a little cooped up, spare a thought for the garment workers in Bangladesh. A country where 4.1 million rely on the garment industry for their livelihoods, the situation, according to one factory owner I spoke to this week, is fast becoming apocalyptic.

Some background: Bangladesh, the country that makes a high percentage of the clothes hanging in our wardrobes and prides itself on the trade links it has built up for decades, was already on a knife edge before the coronavirus hit. Most of the population don’t have enough money to buy more than a day’s food at a time, let alone stock up on groceries during this lockdown. They don’t have time for pandemics. If they don’t work, they starve.

But the cancellation last month of at least $2.8 billion (£2.2 billion) worth of garment orders from many of the brands that populate our British high streets means the garment workers now face destitution and even starvation – and that’s before we get to the public health situation. According to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), of the buyers who cancelled orders, about 72 per cent refused to cover the costs of raw materials the supplier had already purchased. Ninety-one per cent refused to pay the production costs.

Read more: The Garment Worker Crisis In Bangladesh Proves A ‘Buy Less, Buy Better’ Approach Is The Only Way Forward

If you read the excellent Garment Worker Diaries, a research project set up by Microfinance Opportunities in 2016 to record workers’ daily financial outgoings, you will learn first-hand the economic hardships dealt with every day. According to World Bank data, only 15 per cent of Bangladesh’s population makes more than 500 taka (£4.77) a day. That was before Covid-19 struck and the factories closed. Take a moment to think about this: Bangladesh’s entire public health system has 432 ICU beds and 550 ventilators. And that’s for a population of over 160 million.

For factory owner Shafiq Hassan, an already challenging situation has now become impossible. “We fund the entire process, from buying the yarn to buying the fabric. All the raw materials, all the accessories, we buy on behalf of these big boys who place orders with us,” he said. “We are the bankers to the rich, despite being the poorest. And then a calamity happens for everybody – we get it that shops are shut, people are not selling – but we are the weakest link in the supply chain.”

Hassan runs the UK-based Echo Sourcing, which supplies clothing made in Bangladesh to the UK and Europe. He also runs Echotex, a textile mill and garment facility in Bangladesh which was built with the safety and health of the workers in mind. It is the largest LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) platinum-certified unit in the country, employing over 11,000 people.

Ninety Percent is a sustainable womenswear label where 90 per cent of profits from sales go to good causes.

Then there is Ninety Percent, a sustainable contemporary womenswear brand Hassan launched in 2018 as a new business model designed to rebalance an industry that he saw as exploitative, without giving much back. As the name suggests, 90 per cent of profits from sales are redistributed to a range of good causes as well as with the people who make the clothes.

Hassan shut the Echotex factory on 27 March and paid the workers in full for March and for April. But he has lost $570,000 (£459,000) worth of orders after the closure of Debenhams, which filed for bankruptcy on 6 April. Other brands are putting orders on hold or cancelling orders already in progress. He is concerned about how long he can continue to pay his workers while the factory is closed. Among those brands who have not cancelled anything are H&M, Inditex (which owns Zara and Massimo Dutti) and Mango. Primark advised this week that it has pledged to pay for all orders that are ready and would have been shipped by 18 April, accounting for $2m (£1.5m) that will be paid in 180 days. Other household-name retailers have frozen or cancelled orders to the tune of millions of pounds.

Hassan says his business runs on the tightest of margins, just 5 to 10 per cent, meaning he has no reserves. One silver lining is that sales from Ninety Percent’s own e-commerce site have doubled during coronavirus as they have managed to keep deliveries going with appropriate levels of safety at the warehouse. “Ninety Percent should do well,” he said. “We should be a business model that excels.”

But the problem lies with the brands who are shirking their responsibilities. When we spoke on 20 April, his anger at the system, and his fear for the workers, was tangible. We spoke for well over an hour, as Hassan explained the impossible situation for Bangladesh, the fashion factory of the world, as brands which have exploited it as a source of cheap labour are now abandoning their suppliers with more concern for their shareholders than those whose livelihoods are being dismantled overnight. “This is the hypocrisy of the situation and the hypocrisy of these people who have [previously] supported us. Bangladesh and its suppliers have been funding the business. The switch-off, without taking any due care or responsibility of the people who are now cancelling goods, is tragic. It’s hypocritical, it’s false, it’s a sham.”

“Ninety Percent should do well. We should be a business model that excels”

The publication of this week’s Fashion Transparency Index by Fashion Revolution, the campaign that asks #WhoMadeMyClothes, (for which I work as Special Projects Curator) could not be more timely. The campaign was launched after the 2013 Rana Plaza Factory disaster whose victims – over 1,100 of them – will be remembered seven years on, this Friday 24 April. Today, the coronavirus pandemic has pulled into sharp focus why brands need to change the way they pay, make their orders and do business with their suppliers. “This crisis has highlighted just how fragile the fashion system really is,” said Carry Somers, the campaign’s co-founder. “If major brands and retailers are publishing information about their purchasing practices and how they do business with their suppliers, then we can hold them to account in situations like this.”

Business must change post Covid-19, and that includes the way we treat and value the people who make our clothes. “We have seen decades of price reductions and factories operate on impossibly tight margins,” said Somers. “When I was last in Bangladesh, several factory owners told me brands paid three per cent to five per cent less for their clothes every year. Consequently, workers’ wages and workers’ rights have been squeezed. Now, millions of workers have no savings to fall back on, and have been laid off or furloughed without receiving the pay they are entitled to by law. Poverty and hunger could ultimately prove more of a threat to their lives than the virus.”

The system was already broken, but now it must be rebuilt from the bottom up – starting with a living wage and decent working conditions for the workers. “Most of these brands who are delaying and cancelling orders have made billions of dollars in profits every year,” said Somers. “It comes down to a question of priorities: the shareholders or the garment workers.”

Today, the need for citizens to use their voices to hold brands to account is more pressing than ever before. If you want to play your part, there is an email template on the Fashion Revolution website which will send an email directly to a brand. So far, 4,468 people have sent the email template since it was launched on 26 March, and we hope more will follow suit. It’s up to all of us to take our responsibility seriously. The future of the industry depends on us all.

"EU Blasts Trump's WHO Funding Cut, Fears It Worsens Pandemic",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/eu-blasts-trumps-funding-cut-fears-worsens-pandemic-70159142,"WHO, allies lament Trump cut to US funding as virus rages The head of the World Health Organization has lamented a U.S. decision to halt its funding for the U.N. health agency

GENEVA -- The head of the World Health Organization on Wednesday lamented the U.S. decision to halt funding for the U.N. agency, promising a review of its decisions while sidestepping President Donald Trump’s complaints about its alleged mismanagement, cover-up and missteps.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was on the defensive after Trump announced a halt to U.S. funding that has totaled nearly a half-billion dollars annually in recent years. Trump claimed the WHO had parroted Chinese assurances about how the virus is spread, failed to obtain virus samples from China, and made a “disastrous decision” to oppose travel restrictions as the outbreak spread.

Countries and health experts around the world expressed alarm at Trump’s move and warned it could jeopardize efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Philanthropists like Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg joined European and African leaders and health experts who lined up behind the WHO or insisted the U.S. shouldn't cut off funding at such a critical time.

While Trump pointed to a U.S. investigation of the U.N. agency, Tedros stopped short of addressing his complaints directly and said the WHO’s performance in handling the outbreak would be reviewed as part of a “usual process” to ensure transparency and accountability.

“We regret the decision of the president of the United States to order a halt in funding to the World Health Organization,” Tedros said. “WHO is reviewing the impact on our work of any withdrawal of U.S. funding and will work with our partners to fill any financial gaps we face.”

“No doubt, areas for improvement will be identified and there will be lessons for all of us to learn,” he added. “But for now, our focus – my focus – is on stopping this virus and saving lives.”

The exact fallout from a halt in U.S. funding was far from clear.

The WHO runs on biennial budgets, and U.S. funding comes in two main forms — about three-fourths of it through “voluntary” contributions and one-fourth through “assessed” contributions, which are a bit like regular dues. The U.S. already contributed at least $15 million to a $675 million emergency fund set up by the WHO to help pay for the initial coronavirus response through April.

“Trump has a mercurial reputation. So he sort of promises death and destruction and then it doesn’t necessarily happen,” said Gian Luca Burci, a former legal counsel for WHO who now teaches at Geneva’s Graduate Institute. “I think it will become more clear in the next few weeks.”

He noted WHO's tricky task of uniting opposing constituencies: China and the U.S. have been at odds on a number of issues.

“Maybe Tedros went too far,"" he said. ""But you can see also some of the reasons why he wanted to secure China’s cooperation.”

Trump has repeatedly labelled COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” and criticized the agency for being too lenient on China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year.

Outside experts have questioned China’s reported infections and deaths from the virus, calling them way too low and unreliable. An investigation by The Associated Press has found that a six-day delay between when Chinese officials learnt about the virus and when they warned the public allowed the outbreak to blossom into an enormous public health disaster.

The WHO has been particularly effusive in its praise for China, calling on other countries to emulate its approach and repeatedly praising its transparency.

Tedros has also heaped compliments on Trump, praising his “great job” in responding to the outbreak last month.

The European Union on Wednesday said Trump has “no reason” to freeze WHO funding at this critical stage and called for measures to promote unity instead of division.

In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the country is “seriously concerned” about the U.S. decision.

A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who this week emerged from intensive care after contracting the virus, declined to criticize either China or Trump.

“The U.K. has no plans to stop funding the WHO, which has an important role to play in leading the global health response,” James Slack said.

Political fault lines emerged in the U.S., with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, saying the “dangerous, illegal” decision to halt funding “will be swiftly challenged.” Sen. Lindsay Graham, a Republican ally of Trump, insisted that “we cannot afford China apologists running the WHO.”

Aid workers in developing countries worried they might be hit hardest.

“Trump’s decision ... is pulling the rug out from under our feet at a pivotal moment. It will impact the humanitarian community as a whole,” said Tom Peyre-Costa, regional media adviser for Central and West Africa for the Norwegian Refugee Council. “It defies logic at the height of a global pandemic and will lead to many more deaths.”

On Twitter, Bill Gates — whose foundation was the agency's second-largest donor for its latest two-year budget, contributing over $530 million — wrote that stopping funding for the WHO during a world health crisis “is as dangerous as it sounds.”

Worldwide, the pandemic has infected over 2 million people and killed over 128,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Some global health academics said Trump’s attacks might actually strengthen WHO credibility.

“If Trump was making a great success of the pandemic response in the U.S., if there were minimal cases and deaths there, that might be different,” said Sophie Harman, a professor of international politics at Queen Mary University of London. “But things are getting worse and that reinforces the need for WHO.”

McDonalds and other businesses in China refuse service to black people,http://shanghaiist.com/2020/04/13/even-mcdonalds-is-now-turning-away-black-customers-in-guangzhou/,"[UPDATE] McDonald’s China has apologized for the incident

After a massive crackdown of Africans in Guangzhou saw peopleevicted from their apartments and hotel rooms even after they’ve tested negative for Covid-19 or completed 14-day isolation periods, many continue to be caught in a state of limbo, wandering the streets with their personal belongings, sleeping rough at night, and waiting to hear from the consulates of their respective countries.

Apart from having to experience the humiliation of getting unceremoniously thrown out of accommodation that they paid for, they have also had to suffer the indignity of getting turned away from restaurants, convenience stores and other retail shops.

With nowhere to go and nothing to eat, many have had to rely on other members of the foreign community and kind-hearted locals to stay nourished and warm at night.

One man who thought he might be able to buy himself a meal at McDonald’s had to leave hungry. An employee at the Citic Plaza outlet of the fast-food chain handed him a notice that read:

We’ve been informed that from now on black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant. For the sake of your health consciously notify the local police for medical isolation, please understand the inconvenience caused. police TEL:110

"After enduring months of lockdown, Africans in China are being targeted and evicted from apartments",http://qz.com/africa/1836510/africans-in-china-being-evicted-from-homes-after-lockdown-ends/,"Across African capitals, Chinese ambassadors are being hauled over by foreign ministries to explain horrid scenes that have gone viral on social media platforms of African migrants being evicted from apartments and refused entry into hotels.

The videos have enraged governments and citizens back home.

The incidents have sparked a diplomatic race row with the African Union, various African governments and even the United States all putting pressure on Beijing over the reported treatment of black migrants, who are predominantly from African countries. Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda are among those that have asked for explanations from the Chinese government.

“I don’t know where I will sleep tonight,” a man from Ghana says in a nighttime video, luggage strewn on the streets. “We are Nigerians, Ugandans and Ghanaians; we are stranded now.”

In another video, a group of black men can be seen pulling their luggage and being herded through the rainy streets by police officers. “They are chasing us away. We are just walking on the road. They [are not] giving us houses, they [are not] giving us hotels…They don’t want us to stay at one place,” the person filming the video says.

On Saturday, the front page of Kenya’s Nation newspaper read: “Kenyans in China: Rescue us from hell”.

Little Africa

Authorities in China have been relaxing the stringent lockdowns and other restrictions to movements imposed earlier this year because of the coronavirus outbreak. Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus was first detected, lifted a 76-day lockdown this week, allowing residents to leave the city for the first time since Jan. 23.

Even though the worst of the coronavirus is behind it now, authorities fear imported cases could cause a second wave of the outbreak.

While many African students and other migrants were keen to leave China at the start of the outbreak, many others decided to stay and take their chances on the Chinese health authorities being best placed to cope with the outbreak than the underfunded health systems in their countries.

But this week, five Nigerians reportedly tested positive for Covid-19 in the southern city of Guangzhou. According to state media, the men broke quarantine and frequented a restaurant where they infected its owner, who then passed the virus on to her eight-year-old daughter.

These reports seem to be what has sparked the current wave of suspicion and anti-foreigner sentiment in the city. “I’ve been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat… I cannot buy food anywhere, no shops or restaurants will serve me,” a 24-year-old student from Uganda told the AFP news agency.

Even those who have not left China since the outbreak began have also been forcibly tested, moved into quarantine or evicted from their apartments.

A Chinese foreign affairs ministry spokespersontried to play down reports of Africans being singled out and said the government was paying “high attention to the occasional incidents and misunderstandings in this process” of stopping a second wave and urged all foreign nationals to comply with directives by local authorities.

However, according to statistics published by Chinese state media this week, Britons, Americans and Filipinos, not Africans, account for more than half of foreigners living in Guangzhou who have the virus. But there are no indications, they have been subject to evictions.

China’s third-largest city is renown with African business people because it is a trading hub and they can easily access cheap goods to be exported to the continent. This has made Guangzhou the most popular destination for flights emerging from Africa. The trading district of the city is now nicknamed ‘Little Africa’. Over the last decade it has become home to one of the largest African communities in Asia.

While Guangzhou has been the main city for the reports, local media in Ghana have also reported similar accounts of Ghanaians being evicted as far away as Beijing.

Diplomatic row

Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda are among the countries to summon China’s ambassadors, along with the African Union Commission, to register their displeasure about the reports privately and at times very publicly. The US State Department has also ramped up the scrutiny of happenings in Guangzhou with a warning to African Americans to avoid travel to the city.

Beijing can ill afford a diplomatic scandal about its treatment of people of other races especially after it vehemently complained about the racist language surrounding commentary on the coronavirus, which has variously been called “Wuhan virus” or “Chinese virus”.

China will be hoping its “coronavirus diplomacy” of massive donations of equipment and cash would be part of a broader strategy to help deflate some of the blame and divert attention from the origin of the virus.

Instead of the story being about Chinese generosity and its efforts to end a pandemic, it is now hoping to quickly quell anger among some of its most important allies on the African continent.

"China openly discriminating against Africans, Evicting them from hotels, Banning them from public transport, Blaming them for Coronavirus Spread",http://nairobiwire.com/2020/04/kenyans-africans-facing-open-racism-in-china-amidst-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"In a bit of bad irony, the country where this Coronavirus originated is openly discriminating against black Africans, for fear that they will spread the virus to them. This is despite the fact that Africa is the least affected region, with most of its cases imported.

Racism in China is not anything new, and is usually many times worse than what is experienced in America and the West. In its case, the discrimination against blacks is open, vicious and shameless.

Following the Wuhan virus pandemic, the level of discrimination experienced by blacks in China has gone up dramatically with many Kenyans being caught at the centre of it. Some of them are students who got stuck in the country before most international travel was stopped.

For the past few days, they have experienced racism on levels comparable to America in the early 1900s, or apartheid South Africa.

Black people are not allowed to board trains or other public transport. They are not allowed to shop for essentials, including food, and many of them have been evicted from their residences and hotels for merely being black.

“I don’t have food or money. It’s not fair. We are not allowed to use public transport, we are not allowed in the supermarkets, we are not allowed to go outside our houses. They keep saying that Africans are now the ones with the virus. The police are the ones chasing people around the city. Even if you go to them for help, they say they cannot help,” one Kenyan told reporters.

She revealed that some of her friends in Beijing were forced to sleep outside for 3 days after they were denied accommodation everywhere.

While there have not been reported cases of violence, most Chinese citizens are not shy to show open disregard for the black skin. They regularly call police on them for doing nothing wrong.

There are many reports that Africans, some of whom have lived in China for years, are being rounded up and put in mandatory 14 day quarantine. One Kenyan living in Guanghzou who spoke to Citizen TV on condition of anonymity said that she was forced to go into hiding after Chinese nationals came knocking on her doors. “When I heard them coming, I went into hiding. Some of my friends were not so lucky and were forcefully taken away for a 14 day quarantine.”

﻿

The slide into widespread racial discrimination by one of the world’s leading power is a big warning to African countries which have heavily relied on aid and invested from China in recent years.

The fact that in 2020, a whole nation can be this incredibly racist, either with full government backing or deliberate inaction is a big red flag.

Using a disease that originated from your own country under dubious circumstances, to bring out an inherent racism is beyond repulsive.

The world is today in economic chaos because of how China handled the Coronavirus, downplaying it and shutting up anyone who spoke up in the early days.

China may be an economic leader in 2020, but most their thinking and way of life is still as backward as it was centuries ago. Eating everything that moves with the thousands of viruses that come with that, known and unknown. In the process endangering everyone on the planet.

Once this pandemic is over, countries all around the world should start asking tough questions and making tough decisions. Japan has already taken a bold move to fund its firms to shift production out of China, and moving forward this might be the way to go for many other countries.",JustBadNews,0

"More than 1,000 in U.S. die in a single day from coronavirus, doubling the worst daily death toll of the flu",http://usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/01/coronavirus-kills-1-000-single-day-u-s-double-flu/5100905002/,"More than 1,000 in US die in a single day from coronavirus, doubling the worst daily death toll of the flu

Michael James | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption COVID-19 pandemic myths debunked There is a lot of misinformation out there about coronavirus. We sort the facts from falsehoods.

The U.S. topped 1,000 coronavirus deaths in a single day for the first time Wednesday, a daily death toll more than double that of two of America's most deadly illnesses – lung cancer and the flu.

Death counts from the virus are difficult to keep up to date, but the Johns Hopkins coronavirus database – whose sources include the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European CDC and the National Health Commission of China – shows that the U.S. hit 1,040 cases Wednesday at 10:25 p.m. EDT. Since the virus' first appearance in the U.S. in late January, 5,116 people have died and more than 215,000 have been infected.

The previous high mark for a single day in the U.S. was Tuesday, with 504 deaths.

Some researchers say the daily death toll could more than double – to 2,200 or more – by mid-April. That figure would eclipse heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer with about 1,772 deaths per day, according to the CDC.

“Our country is in the midst of a great national trial,” President Donald Trump said in a White House briefing on the virus. “We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks.”

Lung cancer kills 433 people each day in the U.S. – that's the same number of seats on a Boeing 747 airplane, according to the Lung Cancer Foundation of America. Breast cancer kills about 116 Americans a day.

The flu, a chronic killer that the nation has come to expect in yearly cycles – and the reason millions of Americans get flu shots – killed an estimated 508 people per day in the U.S. during the 2017-18 flu season, the nation's worst in the last decade, according to the CDC. This year's flu season has recorded an average of 383 deaths per day, CDC figures show.

While health officials say COVID-19 is considered a flash medical event in that it is unlikely to maintain its deadly hold for more than three or four months, the 1,000 threshold is a significant one because it shows just how potent an unforeseen outbreak can be on the U.S. medical system.

It also raises questions about COVID-19's possible deadly effects over time. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, has cautioned that the virus could become a recurring event, much like the flu. He said that the U.S. needs to get ready for the next cycle, possibly to occur in the fall of 2020.

""We really need to be prepared for another cycle,"" Fauci said.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, emphasized the need to continue developing a vaccine and test it quickly so it will be available ""for that next cycle.""

A University of Washington study updated this week projects that if the entire nation makes an all-out effort to restrict contact, coronavirus deaths will peak in the next two weeks and patients will overwhelm hospitals in most states.

Nationally, the University of Washington model predicts a peak daily death toll of 2,214 in mid-April, and a total of 84,000 Americans dead by the end of summer. That’s more than twice the lives claimed during the 2018-19 flu season, which killed 34,000 people, according to the CDC.

But that figure represents the model’s most likely estimate. The range of scenarios spans from 36,000 COVID-19 deaths to more than 152,000, according to the research team led by Christopher Murray, founder and chair of the University of Washington’s Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation.

As many as 240,000 Americans may die from the new coronavirus according to estimates released by the White House on Tuesday, a grim prediction that influenced Trump's decision to extend social distancing guidelines.

The daily coronavirus death toll likely won’t dip below 100 before June 11, the study predicts.

Coronavirus symptoms can be confused with that of the flu and, indeed, the two viruses have similar effects. Tracking the flu has been equally troublesome for health officials. The CDC says the burden of influenza disease in the United States can vary widely and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses, the timing of the flu season, how well vaccines are working and how many people got vaccinated.

Health experts say the future of the coronavirus depends on such factors as whether humans develop increasing immunity to it and whether an effective vaccine is developed. If neither occurs, the virus will likely continue to circulate and establish itself as a common respiratory virus like the flu.

The CDC estimates that the flu has resulted in 9 million to 45 million illnesses, 140,000 to 810,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.

Chinese 'wet markets' reportedly open back up for business,http://washingtonexaminer.com/news/chinese-wet-markets-reportedly-open-back-up-for-business-ready-to-sell-bats-and-dogs-for-human-consumption,"Chinese “wet markets” have reportedly reopened, selling cats, bats, and dogs for human consumption.

A Mail on Sunday correspondent reported seeing meat markets open back up for business after the Chinese government ordered a ban on the sale of wild animals such as bats following reports they may have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus.

“The markets have gone back to operating in exactly the same way as they did before coronavirus,” said a correspondent in Dongguan. “The only difference is that security guards try to stop anyone taking pictures which would never have happened before.”

The coronavirus was first detected in the city of Wuhan in November, but according to the Daily Mail, Chinese locals view the pandemic as a solved issue in the country and have reportedly gone back to life before the virus.

“Everyone here believes the outbreak is over and there's nothing to worry about anymore. It's just a foreign problem now as far as they are concerned,” said a China-based correspondent who took photographs published by the outlet.

Wet markets have long been criticized for being unhygienic and cruel to animals. Animals such as bats, lizards, and toads are sold as medicine to treat common ailments. Cats and dogs are sold and butchered on the streets.

Scientists have yet to pinpoint what started the coronavirus, but some speculate these markets played a role due to their unsanitary conditions.

“You’ve got live animals, so there’s feces everywhere. There’s blood because of people chopping them up,” Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, which works to protect wildlife and public health from emerging diseases, told the Associated Press last month.

"Trump's campaign is trying to remove a video of him appearing to call the coronavirus a 'hoax,' saying it's misleading",http://businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-remove-video-saying-coronavirus-hoax-2020-3,"President Donald Trump's reelection campaign has issued a cease-and-desist letter to television stations that aired what his campaign called a ""patently false, misleading, and deceptive"" advertisement by a political action committee.

The opening of the video appeared to take Trump's comments out of context, though other remarks in the video did show Trump downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump's reelection campaign has issued a cease-and-desist letter to television stations that aired what the campaign calls a ""patently false, misleading, and deceptive"" advertisement by a political action committee.

A video created by Priorities USA Action, a PAC that has supported Democratic presidential candidates, showed a chart of coronavirus cases that rose as Trump's past comments downplaying the virus played in the background.

The letter took issue in particular with the opening of the video, which stitched together Trump saying the phrases ""the coronavirus"" and ""this is their new hoax.""

""PUSA stitched together fragments from multiple speeches by President Trump to fraudulently and maliciously imply that President Trump called the coronavirus outbreak a 'hoax,'"" the letter said, adding that Trump was ""abundantly clear"" in referring to the ""Democrat's politicization of the coronavirus outbreak"" when making the description.

""Because PUSA's ad's central point is deliberately false and misleading, your station has an obligation to cease and desist from airing it immediately to comply with FCC licensing requirements, to serve the public interest, and to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation,"" the letter added.

The Washington Post previously did a fact-check of an ad by former Vice President Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign that made a similar juxtaposition. It featured clips of Trump at a campaign rally in late February saying ""coronavirus"" and ""this is their new hoax"" that were edited to make it seem as if he said the words together.

The full quote as transcribed by The Post is below (emphasis ours):

""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They're politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs, you say, 'How's President Trump doing?', 'Oh, nothing, nothing.' They have no clue, they don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa, they can't even count. No, they can't. They can't count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, 'Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.' That didn't work out too well. They couldn't do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they've been doing it since he got in. It's all turning, they lost. It's all turning, think of it, think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.""

While that particular juxtaposition appears to be misleading, Trump and his administration did repeatedly downplay the coronavirus and delivered mixed messages about the seriousness of the pandemic before the White House issued its 15-day coronavirus-isolation guidelines. More recently, Trump has said he'd like to reopen businesses by Easter, an idea public-health professionals have warned against.

At least 1,050 people in the US had died from the new coronavirus as of early Thursday morning.

""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,"" Trump tweeted on February 24. ""We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart.""

About 69,000 cases have been reported in all 50 states as well as some US territories and Washington, DC. The federal government's response has also been criticized for not heeding earlier warnings from US officials and for the lack of available equipment around the country for healthcare professionals.",JustBadNews,0
"All the major cruise lines want a US tax payer buy out. They sail under foreign flags, not US flags. We should not allow it.",http://dailykos.com/story/2020/3/23/1930451/-Let-them-die-Foreign-flagged-cruise-lines-have-no-business-asking-for-a-U-S-bailout-now,"x All the major cruise lines are asking for bailouts from the U.S. Government.



Yet, Disney Cruises sails under the Bahamian flag ... Celebrity Cruises under Liberian/Maltese flags & Carnival Cruises under the Panamanian flag - all to avoid U.S. taxes & employment law



Just sayin' — Sabrina McDaniel (@Sabrina_McDa) March 22, 2020

There is a reason that the cruise you may have taken, on the ships of one of these corporations, never directly travels between two U.S. ports. As foreign-flagged ships, they are not allowed to. They must dock somewhere else, even if only for a few hours of ""sightseeing"" that will see few passengers bother to leave the ship, to skirt United States regulations.

The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), provides the main framework for the operation of the international merchant fleet; it dictates minimum standards for ship construction, firefighting and fire prevention, life boats, inspections, and crew. Most nations adhere to these standards, and the United States is vigorous in its own enforcement; a ""flag of convenience"" nation is a nation that does not abide by those conventions. Fly the flag of one of those nations, and you can get away with things that most other countries would not tolerate.

To those companies, then, the advantages of flying a foreign ""flag of convenience"" are numerous. U.S. environmental laws governing ship discharges are nullified. U.S. crews would come with U.S. labor laws; those, too, no longer apply. Taxes are reduced. And both criminal and civil liability when something goes wrong, as recent cruise-goers are now becoming aware, can be minimized.

All of these advantages, however, come down to one thing: money. By reducing costs, cruise lines can make more money. Not enough to save for a rainy day, mind you, but enough to satiate shareholders who do not want American flags flying from those ships if it is going to reduce the value of their own investment.

But that was a choice. It was not a decision with unknown downsides; flying under the flag of a foreign nation is flying under the flag of a foreign nation. Want a taxpayer bailout after a worldwide crisis causes severe harm to your corporation? Ask the Bahamas to bail you out. You've been claiming for decades now that you're not under our purview; you're not our responsibility now.

This should be uncontroversial, but it of course is not. The United States government is targeted keenly at the interests of major corporations over all else; the people hobnobbing with White House officials at Mar-a-Lago, or attending top-dollar fundraisers with members of the House and Senate, are the nation's wealthiest investors and highest-paid corporate officials. It is they who have the ear of government, not their workers. It is they that the treasury secretary and other top officials insist need bailing out regardless of cost, not small business.

The cruise lines are an especially toxic bailout target, however. Even aside from the major lines being deeply damaging to the environment and the health of their own passengers, they are not and cannot possibly be considered an ""essential"" industry. If the major cruise lines shut down tomorrow and forever, their poorly paid workers would suffer—but the world would do without cruises. Easily.

We are fighting over whether Americans can survive on $1,000 for the duration of the pandemic—but we will bailout companies who incorporate overseas, who fly the flags of overseas nations, all to dodge as much of their American responsibilities as possible? No. To be blunt about it, pound sand.

There are several mechanisms for ensuring that what we will call, for the moment, ""pirate"" corporations now seeking U.S. taxpayer bailouts. We could demand that the ships be re-flagged to the United States—but that can be easily undone. Better would be to tie bailout money to corporate taxes. The metric of how much money a corporation ought to be offered in a U.S. bailout program should be directly tied to the amount in taxes that a company did or did not pay in the past ten years or so.

Or we can tell foreign-based companies that they are out of luck, regardless. That was the choice all along, after all: You claimed you were not a United States company. You claimed that was not a United States ship. So go ask your home country for help. Not us.

This cannot be another ""bailout"" of the worst corporate actors as it was in the 2008 Great Recession. This cannot be another shovel-the-money-to-Wall-Street event that sees small businesses in every town close forever while top Wall Street companies that have lived their every modern day seeing what they could get away with get red-carpet treatment from our collected lawmakers and administration officials.

Give the money to the consumers. Give the money to the small businesses, the ones that our towns hinge upon. It will ""trickle up"" to the larger companies in the form of the usual bills and purchases, and we will see which of those behemoths are truly essential and which can be done away with. The free market will do its work, as free market adherents have blustered during every good period while demanding the public provide them with socialism during the bad ones.

Corporate decisions have consequences. If they do not, we are an oligarchy, the wider public useful only insofar as it fattens the rich. Those consequences must therefore be enforced. Let the Bahamas bail out their own ships. Let Liberia pay those bills, or decide not to. Let those corporate officers—and shareholders—who valued small government when collecting the profits abide by small government principles now.

You did not pay for the disaster insurance provided by a strong United States government to its citizens and companies, because you did not want to pay for it. You said so. You insisted. It was your own calculated risk. Now that a disaster has happened, there are no claims to be filed. You have no contract here.",JustBadNews,0
"Senators urge Jeff Bezos to give Amazon warehouse workers sick leave, hazard pay",http://cnbc.com/2020/03/20/senators-to-bezos-give-amazon-warehouse-workers-sick-leave-hazard-pay.html,"Four senators sent a letter to Amazon urging the company to better protect warehouse workers during the coronavirus outbreak.

In a letter sent to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Friday, Sens. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, urged him to provide paid sick leave and time-and-a-half hazard pay for its workers, among other measures.

""Any failure of Amazon to keep its workers safe does not just put their employees at risk, it puts the entire country at risk,"" the senators wrote in the letter. ""Americans who are taking every precaution...might risk getting infected with COVID-19 because of Amazon's decision to prioritize efficiency and profits over the safety and well-being of its workforce.""

The senators included a list of questions for Bezos seeking more information about what steps Amazon is taking to protect its employees from infection, with a deadline for Amazon to respond by March 26.

The letter also asks whether Amazon would consider covering the cost of testing workers for the coronavirus and whether it would ease disciplinary measures and its ""strident efficiency"" to give workers enough time to wash their hands. The senators asked Bezos whether Amazon would consider temporarily shutting down any facility where a worker tests positive for the virus.

The letter comes one day after Amazon temporarily closed a Queens, New York delivery station, known as DBK1, after a worker tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus. The case marked the first known incident of a U.S. Amazon warehouse employee contracting the disease. On Monday, Amazon confirmed that at least five workers at Amazon warehouses in Spain and Italy contracted the disease.

Unlike employees at Amazon's corporate offices, which have been told to work remotely, many fulfillment center employees and delivery drivers cannot carry out their job duties while working from home.

An Amazon spokesperson disputed the accusations laid out in the letter and said the company has taken ""extreme measures"" to keep employees safe, including ""tripling down on deep cleaning,"" offering safety supplies and adjusting processes at warehouses to make sure employees are keeping safe distances.

""Our employees are heroes fighting for their communities and helping people get critical items they need in the crisis,"" the spokesperson said. ""Like all businesses grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it is not easy as supplies are limited, but we are working hard to keep employees safe while serving communities and the most vulnerable.""

Amazon previously told CNBC it implemented ""proactive measures"" to protect fulfillment center employees, including increased cleaning at all facilities and maintaining social distance by suspending team meetings at the beginning of shifts, halting exit screening and staggering shift start times and break times, among other measures.

On March 9, Amazon logistics workers circulated a petition calling for the company to put in place more ""protective measures,"" including giving workers paid leave, to ""ensure the safety of all of its workers and the larger public.""

Amazon recently announced it would provide up to two weeks of pay to all employees diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine. This is in addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the month of March, which CNBC previously reported.

The company moved to address the unique needs of fulfillment centers and delivery by launching a $25 million relief fund. The ""Amazon Relief Fund"" will allow these employees to apply for grants that are equal to or up to two weeks of pay if they're diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.

Amazon is also raising pay for warehouse and delivery workers by $2 per hour in the U.S. through the end of April.",JustBadNews,0
Australia's Bondi Beach to close after hundreds seen ignoring social distancing guidelines,http://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/bondi-beach-to-close-after-hundreds-seen-ignoring-social-distancing-guidelines-c-755849,"Sydney’s most iconic beach will close after thousands of people were seen enjoying the sun and ignoring social distancing guidelines amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Thousands flocked to Bondi Beach on Friday amid temperatures in the high 30s, with pictures of packed beaches going viral online.

Photos of beachgoers ignoring social distancing measures were harshly criticised on social media and by politicians, on the same day the government announced tighter social distancing measures.

NSW Police David Elliott will announce the drastic measure at Bondi Beach on Saturday afternoon.

It came as Waverley mayor Paula Masselos on Saturday issued a public plea for people to stay away from Bondi amid the coronavirus pandemic and away from beaches.

“The public must at all times keep a minimum safe distance from each other in public places and if you don’t need to be out in public, please consider staying at home,” Masselos said.

“We all have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and I am frustrated that people continue to ignore health advice about social distancing as observed yesterday at Bondi Beach.”

Masselos asked for people to heed advice from NSW health including practising social distancing and following hygiene rules.

“No-one is immune to COVID-19 and behaving irresponsibly puts the entire community at risk,” Masselos said.

Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Melbourne that local councils needed to ensure people were observing health and safety measures.

“What happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring,” Hunt said.

“Each of us as individuals, as families, as groups, as councils, as state governments, as a national government has responsibility.

"'Stay home,' urges widow of 51-year-old Ontario man who died of COVID-19 | He was not tested for COVID-19 because he did not fit the criteria at the time, which specified foreign travel to any country with COVID-19 cases as a risk factor. Doctors received the test results ten hours after his death",http://ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/stay-home-urges-widow-of-51-year-old-ontario-man-who-died-of-covid-19-1.4860802,"TORONTO -- As COVID-19 spreads through Canada and infects hundreds of people, the widow of a 51-year-old Ontario man who died of the disease is urging Canadians to listen to health officials to prevent the spread of the virus and whenever possible stay at home.

“I think that people aren’t taking this seriously enough,” Teri Cunnington told CTV News from her home in Milton, Ont.

Sean Cunnington, a salesman, musician and father of three from Milton, Ont., developed flu-like symptoms on March 4 and began experiencing night sweats. Shortly afterward, he developed a cough.

Sean had a form of chronic leukemia, but was otherwise healthy and physically active. He did not rely on any medication.

After two days of struggling at home, Sean was urged by his wife to visit the hospital. He was not tested for COVID-19 because he did not fit the criteria at the time, which specified foreign travel to any country with COVID-19 cases as a risk factor.

“It was basically dismissed because he had not travelled anywhere. He’s not been out of Ontario, he’s not really been out of southern Ontario,” Teri said.

Sean was prescribed antibiotics and sent home, but his condition only got worse. Five days after being sent home, Sean was admitted to hospital in Milton where doctors suspected he might have COVID-19 and tested him.

While doctors awaited the formal results, Sean was moved into an isolated negative pressure room, where he was put on oxygen. Teri says healthcare workers were taking full precautions for COVID-19, wearing gloves and masks.

“He just could not breathe. He could not get a deep breath. Before he was intubated he was taking these very short, little breaths and trying to get a big breath, and that was while being on oxygen,” Teri said.

As he struggled to breathe, he was put on a ventilator, but even a maximum flow of oxygen made little difference.

“They had to keep turning the amount of oxygen that Sean was getting from the ventilator … and then they couldn't turn the machine up anymore,” she said.

In one of their final conversations in the hospital, Sean -- whose lungs were failing due to the disease -- told his wife that he didn’t want to die.

“I think he was really scared and I guess obviously he was scared enough that that’s what he said to me,” she said.

She replied: “Don’t die, our story’s not over yet.”

Sean passed away Wednesday night in hospital. Ten hours after his death, doctors finally received the results of his COVID-19 test. He tested positive.

Officials do not know where he contracted the illness, a sign the illness is spreading within communities.

Sean leaves behind three daughters. He worked in sales and, outside of his job, his passion was music. His band, Elmwood Underground, released their first single in late February.

“He was the most caring, most loving genuine person. He was my everything,” Teri said.

Teri cannot visit the funeral home to plan her husband’s memorial service because she is now in self-isolation until March 25. So far, she said she feels fine. Even if she could plan the arrangements, she said there’s no way she could hold a funeral right now, considering the limits on crowds.

“Sean has an incredible number of people who care about him and love him, and he has touched so many people,” she said.

Teri said Sean’s co-workers have been in touch with public health, and her own workplace has been cleared out as a precaution.

Teri’s final message is a simple one: listen to the experts and stay indoors.

“And everybody just needs to be safe out there. Everybody just needs to be mindful of what they’re doing. Stay home, stay home -- it’s not such a big deal.”

As of Thursday night, 12 Canadians have died of COVID-19 and more than 870 others have been infected.

One of the things she’ll miss the most about her husband, Teri said, is the way he would call “Marco!” when he was trying to find her at home. She would reply, “Polo!”

“So, I won’t have that anymore,” she said. “There are no words. There really are no words. This is something that nobody should ever have to experience.”",JustBadNews,0
"The shortage of face masks is so severe that the CDC is now advising nurses and other health care providers that they can ""use homemade masks"" like a ""bandana"" or ""scarf"" ""as a last resort"" -- even though it admits the effectiveness ""is unknown.""",http://cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html,"Audience: These considerations are intended for use by federal, state, and local public health officials; leaders in occupational health services and infection prevention and control programs; and other leaders in healthcare settings who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of facemasks in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans.

Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden increase in patient volume that would severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of facemasks during the COVID-19 response. To help healthcare facilities plan and optimize the use of facemasks in response to COVID-19, CDC has developed a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve facemask supplies along the continuum of care.

Conventional capacity : measures consisting of engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls that should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings.

measures consisting of engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls that should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings. Contingency capacity : measures that may be used temporarily during periods of expected facemask shortages. Contingency capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional capacity strategies. While current supply may meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate, there may be uncertainty if future supply will be adequate and, therefore, contingency capacity strategies may be needed.

: measures that may be used temporarily during periods of expected facemask shortages. Contingency capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional capacity strategies. While current supply may meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate, there may be uncertainty if future supply will be adequate and, therefore, contingency capacity strategies may be needed. Crisis capacity: strategies that are not commensurate with U.S. standards of care but may need to be considered during periods of known facemask shortages. Crisis capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional and contingency capacity strategies. Facilities can consider crisis capacity strategies when the supply is not able to meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate.

CDC’s optimization strategies for facemask supply offer a continuum of options for use when facemask supplies are stressed, running low, or exhausted. Contingency and then crisis capacity measures augment conventional capacity measures and are meant to be considered and implemented sequentially. As facemask availability returns to normal, healthcare facilities should promptly resume standard practices.

Decisions to implement contingency and crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions:

Facilities understand their facemask inventory and supply chain Facilities understand their facemask utilization rate Facilities are in communication with local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) to identify additional supplies Facilities have already implemented other engineering and administrative control measures including:

Use physical barriers and other engineering controls Limit number of patients going to hospital or outpatient settings Use telemedicine whenever possible Exclude all HCP not directly involved in patient care Limit face-to-face HCP encounters with patients Exclude visitors to patients with known or suspected COVID-19 Cohort patients and/or HCP



Facilities have provided HCP with required education and training, including having them demonstrate competency with donning external icon and doffing, with any PPE ensemble that is used to perform job responsibilities, such as provision of patient care

Conventional Capacity Strategies

Use facemasks according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements.

FDA-cleared surgical masks are designed to protect against splashes and sprays and are prioritized for use when such exposures are anticipated, including surgical procedures.

Facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays.

Contingency Capacity Strategies

Decrease length of stay for medically stable patients with COVID-19.

Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by HCP.

Place facemasks in a secure and monitored site and provide facemasks to symptomatic patients upon check-in at entry points.

Healthcare facilities can consider removing all facemasks from public areas. Facemasks can be available to provide to symptomatic patients upon check in at entry points. All facemasks should be placed in a secure and monitored site. This is especially important in high-traffic areas like emergency departments.

Implement extended use of facemasks.

Extended use of facemasks is the practice of wearing the same facemask for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing the facemask between patient encounters.

The facemask should be removed and discarded if soiled, damaged, or hard to breathe through.

HCP must take care not to touch their facemask. If they touch or adjust their facemask they must immediately perform hand hygiene.

HCP should leave the patient care area if they need to remove the facemask.

Restrict facemasks for use by HCP, rather than asymptomatic patients (who might use cloth masks) for source control.

Have patients with symptoms of respiratory infection use tissues or other barriers to cover their mouth and nose.

Crisis Capacity Strategies

Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by HCP.

Use facemasks beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life during patient care activities.

If there is no date available on the facemask label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. The user should visually inspect the product prior to use and, if there are concerns (such as degraded materials or visible tears), discard the product.

Implement limited re-use of facemasks.

Limited re-use of facemasks is the practice of using the same facemask by one HCP for multiple encounters with different patients but removing it after each encounter. As it is unknown what the potential contribution of contact transmission is for SARS-CoV-2, care should be taken to ensure that HCP do not touch outer surfaces of the mask during care, and that mask removal and replacement be done in a careful and deliberate manner.

The facemask should be removed and discarded if soiled, damaged, or hard to breathe through.

Not all facemasks can be re-used. Facemasks that fasten to the provider via ties may not be able to be undone without tearing and should be considered only for extended use, rather than re-use. Facemasks with elastic ear hooks may be more suitable for re-use.

HCP should leave patient care area if they need to remove the facemask. Facemasks should be carefully folded so that the outer surface is held inward and against itself to reduce contact with the outer surface during storage. The folded mask can be stored between uses in a clean sealable paper bag or breathable container.

Prioritize facemasks for selected activities such as:

For provision of essential surgeries and procedures

During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated

During activities where prolonged face-to-face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable

For performing aerosol generating procedures, if respirators are no longer available

When No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include

Exclude HCP at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.

During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.

Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.

It may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been confirmed.

Use a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face with no facemask.

Consider use of expedient patient isolation rooms for risk reduction.

Portable fan devices with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration that are carefully placed can increase the effective air changes per hour of clean air to the patient room, reducing risk to individuals entering the room without respiratory protection. NIOSH has developed guidance for using portable HEPA filtration systems to create expedient patient isolation rooms. The expedient patient isolation room approach involves establishing a high-ventilation-rate, negative pressure, inner isolation zone that sits within a “clean” larger ventilated zone.

Consider use of ventilated headboards

NIOSH has developed the ventilated headboard that draws exhaled air from a patient in bed into a HEPA filter, decreasing risk of HCP exposure to patient-generated aerosol. This technology consists of lightweight, sturdy, and adjustable aluminum framing with a retractable plastic canopy. The ventilated headboard can be deployed in combination with HEPA fan/filter units to provide surge isolation capacity within a variety of environments, from traditional patient rooms to triage stations, and emergency medical shelters.

HCP use of homemade masks:

In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.",JustBadNews,0
Trump claims coronavirus is under control -- contradicting reality and his own top expert,http://cnn.com/2020/03/16/politics/coronavirus-us-president-donald-trump-fauci-politics/index.html,"(CNN) America's top infectious diseases expert is warning that hundreds of thousands of Americans could die unless every citizen joins an effort to blunt the coronavirus pandemic -- only to be contradicted by President Donald Trump , who insists the virus is under ""tremendous"" control .

The fresh sign of Trump's unwillingness to accept the full, sobering reality of the outbreak came as an anxious America knuckles down to its new self-isolating reality. The country is bracing for the full fury of the virus that is already escalating sharply and is set to subject the foundations of basic life — the nation's health care, economic and political systems — to a fateful test.

Amid calls for a stronger federal response, Trump urged the nation's governors late Monday morning to try to secure additional medical equipment on their own without waiting for the federal government to intervene, though he did say they would try to help.

""We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves,"" Trump said on the call, a person familiar with the call told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. He was discussing what health experts say is a serious need for more respirators and ventilators to deal with the influx of coronavirus patients.

Meanwhile, the number of US infections raced up to at least 3,900, including 70 deaths, up more than 500 cases in a day and up from a caseload of 457 a week ago, showing how the crisis, which may not reach its peak for weeks, is accelerating.

Among his tweets on coronavirus Sunday, Trump suggested that his entire focus was not on the national emergency: He tweeted that he was thinking about a full pardon for his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI.

Earlier that day, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, warned that the US could face a similar crisis as Italy if citizens do not fully embrace self-isolation and social distancing, which are designed to flatten the curve of infections.

Asked whether hundreds of thousands of Americans could die, Fauci said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" : ""It could happen, and it could be worse."" Fauci added that the limits on public life were designed to ""try and make that not happen.""

""If we go about our daily lives and not worry about everything,"" the death toll could be high, Fauci said. ""People sometimes think that I'm overreacting. I like it when people are thinking I'm overreacting because that means we're doing it just right."" Fauci also said he had not ruled out calling for a national lockdown in order to stem the spread of the virus.

The administration is expected to release new guidelines on social distancing -- for instance relating to bars and restaurants -- on Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday recommended not holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. The White House Correspondents Association, which is urging its members to work from home when possible, has instituted a seating arrangement in which every other chair in the briefing room is vacant, and there are mandatory temperature checks for anyone seeking to enter White House grounds.

But serious questions remain over whether Trump's administration -- which was slow to recognize the threat , mischaracterized its impact and seemed most concerned about mitigating political damage -- has now got the federal act together.

Trump flagrantly contradicted Fauci's warnings at a White House briefing Sunday at which he celebrated the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates to 0% to help the shocked economy.

""It's a very contagious virus, it's incredible, but it's something we have tremendous control of,"" the President said.

In a possible indication of how Trump's repeated misinformation is having an impact, a new poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal Sunday showed that while seven in 10 Democrats are worried that they or someone in their family may catch the coronavirus, only 40% of Republicans, who are more likely to believe what they hear from the President and in conservative media, feel the same.

Trump's upbeat predictions about the coronavirus crisis did not just contrast with Fauci's warnings, they also clashed with the conditions being experienced by local officials.

""We have been behind on this disease since day one,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

""I believe on any projection that that flattening of the curve is not going to be enough. I don't see it as a curve. I see it as a wave. And the wave is going to crash on to our hospital system.""

The coronavirus also dominated the opening exchanges of the CNN Democratic presidential debate on Sunday evening -- with former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders standing six feet apart in a Washington studio to comply with government health guidelines -- both arguing they would be far better at handling the pandemic than Trump.

""This is like a war, and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people,"" Biden said.

Sanders was scathing about Trump's handling of the crisis.

""First thing we have got to do, whether or not I'm president, is to shut this President up right now, because he's undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people,"" Sanders said. ""It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with un-factual information, which is confusing the general public.""

Progress on testing logjam

One of the big criticisms of the administration's effort has been that it failed to make millions of coronavirus testing kits available sufficiently quickly.

Vice President Mike Pence announced Sunday that as of this week, more than 2,000 labs would come online nationwide with high-speed testing facilities.

He said that the new system would allow all Americans who need to be tested to go to a community site outside their normal health networks for testing. Officials asked that those at highest risk, the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions be given priority.

Top officials were still unable to give full figures Sunday on how many Americans have now been tested after the disastrously slow roll out of diagnosis kits. The lack of clarity is seriously hampering efforts to keep pace with the disease.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine suggested on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that an estimated 100,000 undiagnosed infections could already have happened in his state alone.

""We have got a lot of people walking around in Ohio who are positive who've not been tested. Some don't know it. Some may never know it,"" the Republican governor said.

Despite his calls for national unity, Trump exploded at the media on Sunday after it emerged that his announcement that Google would quickly open a national virus testing website was at best premature and at worst highly misleading.

""The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these, they are not truthful. Watch for their apology, it won't happen. More importantly, thank you to Google!"" Trump tweeted.

The President, as is his custom, managed to make the story of coronavirus all about him this weekend. A White House reversal led him to get tested for the disease after interacting with several people last weekend who have since been diagnosed with COVID-19. Happily, the President, who shook hands with top CEOs at a press conference on Friday in contravention of his own government's advice, tested negative for the novel coronavirus, according to the White House.

While Trump's response has been marked by chaos and confusion -- The Washington Post on Sunday reported internal power games raging in the White House over the virus -- true leaders have been emerging all over the country. Governors, mayors and local officials have been making timely, high-stakes decisions and providing accurate information that sometimes surpasses that dispensed in White House briefings, which remain filled with self-congratulation and fawning praise for the President.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin solved one of the big questions of the Trump era: will the bitter recriminations between the White House and Congress -- especially in the wake of the impeachment drama -- stop both sides working together in a time of national crisis?

Mnuchin and Pelosi swapped multiple calls late last week brokering an economic stimulus plan that includes money for sick workers and small businesses hurt by the crisis. The Senate is expected to act on the package this week. The Speaker also said an additional plan for economic mitigation was already on the way

And the White House is likely to ask Congress this week for another round of funding specifically for the Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Veterans Affairs, two White House officials told CNN. Administration officials have discussed relying on the VA to supplement the broader health care system by taking care of civilians in the event the coronavirus crisis worsens.

New problems emerged with the federal authorities' response to the crisis over the weekend, which caused fresh tension with local political leaders.

Meanwhile, the massive lines at airports -- with passengers returning from abroad huddled in unhealthy crowds for virus screening -- suggest the government was unprepared for Trump's sudden orders.

""I want to make known my strong concerns and disappointments with the federal government's lack of preparedness in issuing new directives regarding airport screening,"" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that a White House staffer called to yell at him after he complained about the long lines at O'Hare airport.

""They should have increased the Customs and Border Patrol numbers. And they should have increased the number of CDC personnel on the ground doing those checks. They did neither of those,"" the Democratic governor said.

Trump asks Americans not to besiege supermarkets

JUST WATCHED Fauci: 'Might not' be enough ventilators in worst case Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Fauci: 'Might not' be enough ventilators in worst case 01:40

Hospitals and medical staff are awaiting a spike in patients unsure whether they have sufficient breathing machines and intensive care beds for a rush of gravely ill patients.

Fauci said that in the worst case scenario he wants to prevent there may not be sufficient ventilators available for patients who need them.

""That's when you're going to have to make some very tough decisions,"" he told CNN's Brianna Keilar.

Fauci's sobering comments came as the fabric of everyday American life ebbed in the biggest economic and societal shutdown of the modern age.

DeWine suggested schools in his state could be out for the rest of the academic year. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an order outlawing price gouging of items like cleansing and disinfecting supplies that are in high demand.

City authorities in Washington, D.C., introduced new restrictions meant to cut down on the numbers of people in bars and restaurants after large crowds were out celebrating St. Patrick's Day over the weekend.

A trade group representing food and retail companies like Clorox, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo told the State Department and the US Trade Representative they fear other countries cutting off exports to the US , which could exacerbate the public health emergency.

The group is particularly concerned about countries restricting chemicals, ingredients and products they manufacture from getting to the US.

Trump held a call with grocery, food and beverage corporate leaders on Sunday about supply chain concerns.

He urged Americans to stop besieging stores after a weekend in which basic staples like pasta, meat, toilet paper rolls and cleaning products vanished from supermarket shelves.

"Hong Kong online store Jimmy Jungle sends soap, snacks to detained protesters. A ""yellow economy"" of businesses has sprung up in Hong Kong to support anti-government protesters, but online store Jimmy Jungle is zeroing in on young demonstrators stuck in detention.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-protests-volunteers/hong-kong-online-store-jimmy-jungle-sends-soap-snacks-to-detained-protesters-idUKKBN2130U5,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A “yellow economy” of businesses has sprung up in Hong Kong to support anti-government protesters, but online store Jimmy Jungle is zeroing in on young demonstrators stuck in detention.

Michael, 27, set up the business along with three friends, to ease pressure on detainees’ relatives and friends in finding them items of daily use, such as toiletries, packaged to comply with curbs set by authorities worried about security.

“It’s a matter of conscience ... they sacrificed a lot for Hong Kong,” said Michael, who did not want to use his full name for fear of losing suppliers angered at his support for protesters. “We can’t forget them.”

The company was set up after the arrest of a friend during a siege at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University in November, who has been in detention since.

“It has become like a full-time job for my friend’s family to find the snacks and daily necessities,” Michael added.

Rights groups say about 90 people are in custody in the Chinese-ruled territory, from among more than 7,500 arrested since anti-government protests escalated last June.

Hong Kong’s Correctional Services Department (CSD), which furnishes detainees with items such as toothpaste, toothbrushes and toilet paper, said it did not have a figure for those detained over the protests.

Friends and relatives of detainees criticise as too strict the limits fixed on items carried in during visits.

“I understand why they need to standardise the approved items but some are hard to find in the market and not every family can afford to buy from the convenience store nearby,” said Kay, 31, who has a detained relative.

Guidelines specify sizes and brands of toiletries, and, even in some instances, permit only wrappers with Chinese lettering.

But few items in shops meet all the specifications on soap, for example, and some sizes of toothpaste are only available as giveaways with much larger purchases.

The CSD told Reuters it reviewed the guidelines regularly and adjusted them as needed, adding that it had recently widened the choices of handwash and disinfecting wet tissues.

Jimmy Jungle’s founders at first used their own money for purchases sold at cost to inmates’ families and friends. But now it can provide items free, thanks to donations of nearly HK$280,000 (29,177 pounds) within a single week after its February launch.

Nearly 30 detainees have received packages since. They are usually delivered to the offices of district councillors located near detention centres, making it easy for visitors to take them in to detainees.

Michael hopes for eventual amnesty for the demonstrators.

“I hope the protesters won’t need our service one day,” he said. “My friend always told us not to feel desperate, as those in custody depend on us to ignite their hopes.”",JustBadNews,0
"Yes, Torture Is Used in China: A Church of Almighty God Refugee in Spain Speaks Out Brother Zhang Wenbo tells Bitter Winter how he was suspended on a rope, beaten with a steel tube, and burned with cigarettes. His only crime? Preaching a banned religion.",http://bitterwinter.org/a-church-of-almighty-god-refugee-in-spain/,"Brother Zhang Wenbo tells Bitter Winter how he was suspended on a rope, beaten with a steel tube, and burned with cigarettes. His only crime? Preaching a banned religion.

By Ruth Ingram

Pitiless cruelty and wanton destruction

Tens of thousands hounded, over six thousand arrested, many of whom have been tortured, more than a thousand sentenced, and 19 killed, all in one year. But numbers alone do no justice at all to last year’s tally of brutality and sadistic harassment carried out by the Chinese government towards members of The Church of Almighty God (CAG). The vast scale of abuse can be only described as a sustained campaign of pitiless cruelty and wanton destruction of a group of people whose only plea is that they be allowed to practice their beliefs in peace. It defies explanation, motive or logic.

One victim of the persecution who managed to flee China two months ago is Zhang Wenbo, a 50-year-old husband and father from Lingbao City, Henan Province. He spoke to Bitter Winter from exile in Spain, where he is one of 564 CAG asylum seekers who wait there on tenterhooks, separated from loved ones and facing an uncertain future as their fate is debated.

This new Christian religious movement (also known as Eastern Lightning) was established in China in 1991 and believes that Jesus Christ has returned to earth incarnated as a Chinese woman, whom they call “Almighty God.” The CAG was persecuted since its early years but has come under special scrutiny and attack in the last few years, since Xi Jinping stepped up his sinicization drive, and has been singled out for intense persecution. Draconian new regulations on religious affairs have been imposed on every religion, with the ultimate aim to accelerate and promote the demise of religion and to establish China as a zone of atheism.

According to incomplete statistics included in CAG’s recently released yearly report on persecution, between 2011 and the end of 2019, more than 400,000 CAG members were arrested by the Chinese authorities, and the number of believers who have died as a result of persecution since the Church’s establishment has reached 146.

The story of Zhang Wenbo

Zhang Wenbo’s story started 21 years ago after a relative told him about the new CAG movement and their belief in Almighty God. Until this time, he had been a traditional Christian lead to faith as a young boy by an uncle who was a preacher in a local house church. From his earliest days, he remembers persecution from the authorities being central to their lives as believers. His uncle was arrested in 1978 and tortured for his faith and missionary work, and his family became key targets for government surveillance.

After joining the CAG in 1998, he determined to be a missionary and set about his new calling with enthusiasm. On one hand, he worked in the family business selling furniture, and on the other he spent as much time as he could sharing his new faith. For four years he travelled locally, talking with anyone who would listen, and narrowly escaped several arrests. But things took a turn for the worse in 2003, when after a long-term surveillance operation and stake out to monitor Mr. Zhang’s activities, one day more than a dozen police officers suddenly surrounded the building where he was meeting with four church members.

“Five or six of them broke into the room and escorted us to the town police station, where I was tortured to force me to give up the church leaders,” he said. In an attempt to break him, he was ordered to stand bending forward with his fingertips on the ground and then to maintain a half-squat position for a considerable period of time. A 1000-watt spotlight was shone into his face, causing extreme headaches and eye pain. He was beaten mercilessly if he tried to sleep at any time throughout the night. “I really couldn’t understand why they inflicted such harsh torment,” he said. “I had committed no crime. I just practiced my faith and preached the gospel.”

He was finally released on bail the next day with the help of friends, but this was followed by such relentless harassment by the local police, visits to his factory, ceaseless questioning, demands to abandon his faith, and summons to the police station, that he was left with no choice but to go on the run.

Between 2003 and 2012, he travelled, staying with CAG members or renting apartments, working wherever he could, and taking every opportunity to spread his message and preach to those who would listen. Some he preached to were receptive and others chased him away. Some harbored him but others betrayed him, forcing him to flee again.

Fear hounded him. Life was spent looking over his shoulders, listening for footsteps on the stairs, the knock at the door. He had many narrow escapes and was always ready to run. But time ran out in 2012 whilst on a preaching mission to Guizhou province.

Brutally tortured in Tongren City

“On December 17, I was meeting with four church members in a building which, we learned later, was being closely monitored by the CCP,” he recalls. “The director of Tongren City Public Security Bureau, together with over a dozen police officers broke into the room and took us to the Bijiang District Police Station of Tongren City, where they grilled me about the church leaders.”

Refusing to give anything away his face was slapped, he was punched and beaten. He was assaulted to the point of almost losing consciousness and covered in bruises.

From there, he was dragged into the basement where he was subjected to the “swing.” “I was handcuffed to the top of a door frame without my feet touching the ground,” he said. “They then tied my feet with a rope, which they used to swing me back and forth. As the handcuffs were clamped tightly to the flesh, I felt such excruciating pain in my wrists that I shrieked in agony.” He described how the other end of the rope was tied to a window frame causing his body to hang in a sloping position for half an hour, rendering his hands numb.

Worse was to come.

“They saw that I had no intention of confessing, so they laid me on the ground, turned off the surveillance camera in the corner, and started to hit my back, waist, shoulders with a 70 cm long by 3 cm diameter steel tube. My chest ached so much,” he said. Subsequent medical examinations revealed that one of his ribs had been severely damaged by this treatment.

Continuing their brutality, the police officers forced him to kneel on the ground, pressing the steel tube down hard and rolling it over his calves, causing unbearable pain as if his knees and ankles had been crushed. “In the face of their savagery all I could do was unceasingly call on God to protect me from betraying Him,” he said, remembering, he says, the suffering of Jesus which had kept him going.

“They tortured me in this way for some time and then handcuffed my hands onto the wall, one of them fixed above my head, and the other below my waist in a slanted cross shape. I could neither stand up nor squat down, but only hold this painful position by having one foot touching the ground. They also forced me to smoke two packs of cigarettes, blew smoke into my nostrils, burned my beard, kicked and punched me, and even applied an unknown liquid to my face. This liquid formed a mask, which made me itch so much that I couldn’t help but twist my body. Meanwhile my wrists were pulled so hard that a piercing pain shot through me. I only wished the time would go faster,” he recalled, before recounting the final humiliation and degradation he experienced during those dark hours.

“Then they stripped off my underwear, lit a cigarette, and used it to burn the pubic hair around my anus,” he said bitterly. “They started to insert the burning cigarettes into my anus one after another. I kept struggling and screaming out in great pain while the officers burst into wicked laughter from time to time.” He described these insults and humiliations as more painful than the physical torment itself.

“At that time, I wished I had died,” he said, longing to rebuke them and ask why they derived such pleasure inflicting the torment. “Are they demons from hell?” He asked describing the traumatizing effect of the torture which never leave him. Every time he uses the toilet, the scene replays in his mind. He can’t get rid of it. Severe colitis has been one of the lasting consequences of the ordeal which is with him to this day.

Beaten and insulted by other prisoners

On December 18, 2012, he was transferred to Bijiang District Detention Center in Tongren City. He was kicked to the ground on several occasions. He remembers the escorting officers laughing hysterically and saying to each other, “He is a believer in God, a political prisoner. Even if we beat him to death, we’d go unpunished in the court.”

During the detention, he was fed the minimum. Other prisoners took great pleasure in beating and insulting him, at the behest of the guards. Despite everything he endured, however, he considered it divine intervention that he was firstly put into a Detention Centre with a maximum stay of one month, rather than directly put into a Detention House which would have been a prelude to trial and sentencing. This administrative “fluke” allowed family and CAG friends to use their connections and get him released on bail. His freedom was bought with 16,000 RBM ($ 2,290), although the release fee was registered for only 3,000 RBM ($ 430). The rest was pocketed by the police.

After his release, he returned home only to find he had been placed under long-term surveillance. He was frequently interrogated; his phone monitored 24/7, and had to report every month. He was told he faced five years in prison if he continued with his beliefs. Refusing to abandon his faith and not wanting trouble to come to his wife and daughter he was again faced with no alternative but to go on the run.

After more narrow escapes while preaching in Sanmenxia City, Henan Province, in 2013, he resumed his pattern of moving from place to place.

Between 2013 and 2018, he almost did not contact his wife or daughter. “It was just too dangerous for us all,” he said. Hearing in 2016 that the police had stepped up their search for him, relatives sent urgent messages telling him not to return home or contact them. In 2018, severe colitis brought him to breaking point and he took refuge with an aunt where he was able to see his parents for the last time. The last straw came after hearing that the police had informed his parents that a body needed identifying in the morgue which required a DNA sample from everyone in the household. Realizing it was a trap, Mr. Zhang escaped again, but determined that somehow, he would have to leave the country.

Finally, he managed with great difficulty to obtain a visa in December 2019 and travel to Spain with a tourist visa. There, he contacted other CAG members and has applied for asylum. The agony of separation from his wife and daughter, the mental scars of torture and years of being hounded by police are with him daily. He is forever looking over his shoulder knowing that Beijing is determined to trawl back every last member of the CAG into its clutches, and his only dream is to get through the next day. It is not easy to contemplate a future without his wife by his side.

Hoping for asylum in Europe

Trying to explain the CCP’s relentless and vicious pursuit of CAG members at home and around the world is futile. A CAG exile in Britain I also interviewed has tried to explain the victimization through a Chinese proverb, Sha yi jing bai (杀一儆百) meaning killing one as a warning to a hundred. Heather, a CAG member living in Britain, and Emily, who also fled persecution and was granted asylum in the UK in 2019 suspect the CCP hopes its iron fist will deter others.

“But they don’t realize that persecution is actually what makes us grow,” Heather said. “They think that if they eliminate the leaders and take all our funds, they will succeed. Actually, they do not really understand what makes us grow. We are more than 4 million believers after only 30 years. They can take our money and kill our leaders, but we will continue to flourish,” she said.

Meanwhile, Zhang Wenbo waits in suspense for his asylum hearing. He pins his hopes on Spanish democracy and remembers it issued an international arrest warrant in 2014 against the former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, after an eight-year investigation into human rights abuses in Tibet.

He feels he has enough evidence for his appeal but is throwing himself on the mercy of the Spanish government. “This is why I came to Spain,” he said. “I know they are not afraid of China and I will be treated justly.”",JustBadNews,0

Makeshift camps for thousands of migrants have sprung up around the border since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week that his country would no longer stop refugees from trying to leave the country.

Turkey's decision to open the border came after 34 Turkish soldiers were killed by Syrian government forces in Idlib, northwestern Syria last week.

The Turkish soldiers were stationed there to protect local civilians under a 2018 deal with Russia which prohibits acts of aggression in the region.

Turkey already hosts nearly four million Syrian migrants, more than any country in the world. Officials say the country cannot handle another refugee wave.

Ankara has repeatedly complained that Europe has failed to keep its promises under the 2016 EU-Turkey refugee deal to help migrants and stem further migrant waves.

"China's coronavirus recovery is 'all fake,' whistleblowers and residents claim",http://theweek.com/speedreads/900488/chinas-coronavirus-recovery-all-fake-whistleblowers-residents-claim,"China's claims of how it's handling coronavirus recovery should be taken with more than a few grains of salt.

Even before COVID-19 became a global crisis, Chinese leaders had been criticized for their handling of the situation and lack of transparency about the disease's progression. Things now look like they're on the upswing, and businesses even appear to be headed back to work — but whistleblowers and local officials tell Caixin that's just a carefully crafted ruse.

Beijing has spent much of the outbreak pushing districts to carry on business as usual, with some local governments subsidizing electricity costs and even installing mandatory productivity quotas. Zhejiang, a province east of the epicenter city of Wuhan, claimed as of Feb. 24 it had restored 98.6 percent of its pre-coronavirus work capacity.

But civil servants tell Caixin that businesses are actually faking these numbers. Beijing had started checking Zhejiang businesses' electricity consumption levels, so district officials ordered the companies to start leaving their lights and machinery on all day to drive the numbers up, one civil servant said. Businesses have reportedly falsified staff attendance logs as well — they ""would rather waste a small amount of money on power than irritate local officials,"" Caixin writes.

In Wuhan, officials have tried to make it appear that recovery efforts are going smoothly. But when ""central leaders"" personally survey disinfecting regimens and food delivery, local officials ""make a special effort"" for them and them alone, one resident told Caixin. And in a video circulating on social media, residents can be seen shouting at visiting leaders from the apartments where they're being quarantined — ""Fake, it's all fake."" Read more at Caixin.

President Trump disputes WHO's coronavirus fatality rate: '3.4% is really a false number. Now this is just my hunch.',http://marketwatch.com/story/president-trump-disputes-whos-coronavirus-fatality-rate-34-is-really-a-false-number-now-this-is-just-my-hunch-2020-03-05,"President Trump, based on what he called a “hunch,” suggested Wednesday that the World Health Organization’s coronavirus fatality rate was incorrect, but also erroneously said that he believed that there had been a coronavirus-related death in New York.

“I think 3.4% is really a false number,” he told Sean Hannity on his Fox News show. “This is just my hunch, but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this and it’s very mild. They get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor. You never even hear about those people so you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this coronavirus flu, or virus. You just can’t do that.”

“So if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that just get better just by sitting around, or even going to work — some of them go to work — but they get better and then when you do have a death, like you had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California, I believe you had one in New York, you know, all of a sudden it seems like 3% or 4%, which seems like a very high number, as opposed to a fraction of 1%,” he added. “But, again, they don’t know about the easy cases.”

As of Thursday, no one in New York had died from the coronavirus. In the U.S., 11 people have died — 10 in Washington State and one in California. There are around 165 confirmed cases. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced Wednesday that he is following in Washington state’s footsteps by declaring a state of emergency. Coronavirus has an incubation period, during which people may be asymptomatic, of up to two weeks.

“ ‘I think 3.4% is really a false number. This is just my hunch, but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this because a lot of people will have this and it’s very mild. They get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor.’ ” — President Trump, on Fox News

The current WHO fatality rate estimate could be related to officials underestimating the number of actual cases. If coronavirus infections are actually higher globally, the fatality rate would obviously fall. The more time asymptomatic people spend going about their daily lives, the more people can become infected. Writing in Slate, Jeremy Samuel Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, said, “These frightening numbers are unlikely to hold.”

“The true case fatality rate, known as CFR, of this virus is likely to be far lower than current reports suggest,” he added. “Even some lower estimates, such as the 1% death rate recently mentioned by the directors of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, likely substantially overstate the case. We shouldn’t be surprised that the numbers are inflated. In past epidemics, initial CFRs were floridly exaggerated. For example, in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic some early estimates were 10 times greater than the eventual CFR, of 1.28%.”

By Thursday morning, Trump’s Twitter account was stating defiantly that the president had “NEVER” suggested those potentially ill with COVID-19 continue going to work:

As COVID-19 spreads, scientists are learning more about the disease’s fatality rate. “Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said at a press briefing in Geneva this week. That’s higher than previous estimates of around 2% and the influenza fatality rate of less than 1%. Tedros previously said the fatality rate in Wuhan, China, considered the epicenter of the outbreak, was between 2% and 4%.

The fatality rate of the novel coronavirus so far appears to be a fraction of that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (9.6%) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (34.4%). “The incubation period for SARS was typically 2 to 7 days, although in some cases it may be as long as 10 days,” the CDC said at the time; most SARS cases occurred between November 2002 and July 2003. “In a very small proportion of cases, incubation periods of up to 14 days have been reported,” the CDC added.

Worldwide, there were 97,750 COVID-19 cases and at least 3,346 deaths as of Thursday; about 53,783 people worldwide have recovered, according to data published by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The medical journal JAMA released this paper analyzing Chinese data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and said the sample’s overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%.

My son was lynched by his Muslim friends: Mother of 14-year-old cries for justice,http://indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/lynching-delhi-muslims-hindu-boy-lynched-shahadra-delhi-police-1024543-2017-07-16,"A mysterious case of the murder of a 14-year-old boy has surfaced in the national Capital, with his mother alleging that he was held hostage and lynched by some Muslim friends.

The victim, identified as Yogesh Kumar, was found dead under mysterious circumstances near New Delhi Railway Station last month. Multiple injury marks were found all over his face and the body indicated that he was battered to death, doctors said. However, police remain tight-lipped over the cause of death considering it a communally sensitive matter.

Yogesh (14) was found in a pool of blood near the New Delhi Railway Station with blunt injuries on his face, back and neck. Yogesh (14) was found in a pool of blood near the New Delhi Railway Station with blunt injuries on his face, back and neck.

Yogesh's body was brought to the Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) by police for the postmortem examination on June 23. Doctors who conducted autopsy said the injuries on his body were clear signs of his being attacked with a sharp object. Victim's mother, Seema alleged it was case of lynching by his Muslim friends, who had demanded money from her while keeping Yogesh hostage. She even claimed that they made her hear Yogesh's voice for once who was trembling with fear.

HIS MUSLIMS FRIENDS LYNCHED HIM

Recalling the horrifying incident to Mail Today, she said, ""On June 23, Yogesh left home after he got a call from his friend Arif. He, along with other friends, including a girl Fatima, first kidnapped my son, later demanding Rs 10,000 from me. I was told that if money was not given on time, they will kill my son."" ""The very next morning, I was told that my son was killed and thrown somewhere along the railway track near New Delhi station,"" Seema said. Yogesh's family lives in Shahadra's Meet Nagar. Despite being very young, he had been working to fetch money for his mother's treatment.

His mother works as a domestic help. Doctors, on the condition of anonymity told Mail Today, ""The body was hit brutally and had severe injuries on face, skull and back. It seemed that deceased was beaten up repeatedly with some objects like stone or a bottle. We could smell a case of lynching."" An FIR was lodged in the case the next day which stated that the body was lying in a pool of blood. Broken pieces of glass bottles, a stone and few bricks were also reportedly found with traces of blood on it.

Panic and rumours show how Hong Kong gov't lost credibility long before the coronavirus arrived | Hong Kong Free Press HKFP,http://hongkongfp.com/2020/03/01/panics-rumours-show-hong-kong-govt-lost-credibility-long-coronavirus-arrived/,"By Ocean Salazar and Marcos Moschovidis

Widespread “fake news” about the recent coronavirus outbreak, ranging from reports about escaped Chinese bioweapons to mass cremations in Wuhan, are becoming increasingly rampant. Unverified videos, origin-free photos, and other misleading media sources are quickly believed by a wide portion of the public and create an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear, as shown by irrational panic purchases of goods such as toilet paper in Hong Kong.

Are Hong Kong’s citizens to blame for believing unconfirmed theories about the coronavirus, though? In short, no. They have merely become accustomed to doubting the official government narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as well as Hong Kong’s narrative.

File photo: Tom Grundy/HKFP.

Both have fostered a climate of distrust with a long record of cherry-picking convenient truths, discrediting facts that contradict their policies and suppression of free speech. As the coronavirus grows closer to becoming a global pandemic — with over 4,000 international cases, 92 of them in Hong Kong — this atmosphere of distrust in two highly opaque governments is starting to pose a serious threat to global public health.

The root cause of this problem can be found long before the recent virus outbreak. In fact, there have been countless times when the local government and the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) have violated public trust in order to validate their narrative. The following three examples all happened long before anybody knew about the virus:

First, the Hong Kong government has insisted on the notion that protesters are a minority of “rioters” and peaceful accomplices; Carrie Lam has described them as the “enemy of the people”, stressing the fallacy of a silent, pro-government majority. However, this silent majority was nowhere to be seen when pro-democratic incumbents won a landslide victory in the 2019 District Council Elections. The district councils are the only governmental bodies in Hong Kong chosen by full universal suffrage.

Second, the local government, in concert with the police force, has stressed that “there is no police brutality”. To most Hongkongers and foreign observers, excessive police force is a reality and just the tip of the iceberg. International human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called for an independent inquiry into police use of force.

Rumours have flourished that police were in collusion with armed thugs who attacked unarmed protesters on July 21st, and also involved in the mysterious death of HKUST student Alex Chow Tsz-lok. In both cases, the police changed their message when new photographic and video evidence, contradicting their first narrative, started circulating.

After the 7/21 attacks, images of police walking away from Yuen Long station and conversing with white-shirted thugs were widely spread on social media. Police claimed that “a group of people had led some protesters to Yuen Long.” This claim has now been refuted by photos and videos of the armed mob patrolling and attacking civilians before Lam Cheuk-ting arrived in Yuen Long.

Photo: Screenshot.

In the case of Alex Chow Tsz-lok’s death, police had claimed they had not entered the car park where Chow was found until 1:05 am. The police later changed their statement when videos surfaced of them leaving the car park at 11:28pm.

Finally, the Hong Kong government’s continued regurgitation of Chinese state-media theories on the protests has validated the notion that the government serves Beijing, and not its citizens. Carrie Lam and her administration have long stuck to the theory that the Hong Kong protests are caused by “deep-rooted”, non-political issues, such as the economy and foreign influences.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Carrie Lam and her administration embarked on a charm offensive to try to restore credibility in the city’s freedoms, rule of law, and government. To do so, she once again blamed foreign interference for the Hong Kong protests, but acknowledged “there hasn’t been any conclusive evidence”.

Now with the coronavirus epidemic, the people of Hong Kong do not trust their government to provide truthful information, due to its continuous presentation of “alternative facts” and ignorance of standards for transparency and accountability. Informed Hongkongers have had to live with the assumption that their government will contradict what they have seen with their own eyes.

This reality transforms posts found on social media into a game of truth or tale for internet users, as numerous published reports are either immediately censored, at least partly confirmed at a later stage, or outrageously wrong.

For example, videos from Hubei province showing life under lockdown have been immediately censored on Weibo. Yet, people have been saving and reposting them on different platforms to spread awareness about the current situation. Another example is the surfacing of unverified photos of CSI masks for apparent personal use by police officers. Shortly after their publication, one of the photos was found to be from 2018.

Photo: GovHk.

However, Apple Daily recently also revealed that the HKPF’s protective equipment supplies from the government were magnitudes higher than those of other government sectors. For example, the police received nearly 14,000 N95 masks when the Department of Health only got 256. So, although inaccurate, the rumours regarding the CSI masks have some truth to them, which leaves citizens doubtful about what to trust and what not.

The most bizarre of recent coronavirus “reports” regarded the toilet paper supply in Hong Kong. Online rumours stated that supplies from toilet paper manufacturers in mainland China were compromised because of the coronavirus shutdowns. The result was mass buying, hoarding, and even armed robbery of toilet paper in Hong Kong supermarkets. Although some shops said they were unsure about toilet paper supply, there was no genuine shortage — until panic created it. Shelves were emptied of basic goods such as toilet paper and cleaning supplies.

Panic and misinformation are not the fault of citizens. These are the effects of a climate of distrust created by poor political decision-making of the local government and Beijing. If the Hong Kong authorities want to restore trust with the public and maintain the city’s image as a modern centre of commerce, it needs to hold itself to a new level of transparency and accountability.

This would entail full, fact-checked information about the coronavirus response measures, influence from the CCP on decision making, and about the recent response to the protest movement. Sadly, this is extremely unlikely and presumably too late. For now, Hong Kong citizens will have to continue to rely on independent fact-checking, news organisations, and most importantly each other to stay informed and ready about the virus.

"Trump says Russia leak meant to hurt Sanders, calls for probe: They leaked it, Adam Schiff and his group, they leaked it to the papers and - as usual - they ought to investigate Adam Schiff for leaking that information, Trump said, without providing any evidence to back up his claims.",http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/trump-says-russia-leak-meant-to-hurt-sanders-calls-for-probe-idUSKCN20H0H8,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Sunday accused Representative Adam Schiff of leaking classified information on Russian interference in the 2020 U.S. election to hurt Democratic presidential front-runner Bernie Sanders.

Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for a trip to India, Trump said he had not been briefed on intelligence that Russia was aiming to boost the campaign of Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, and he called for a probe into Schiff for the leak. Schiff, a Democrat, denied the allegation.

A congressional source told Reuters on Friday that intelligence officials had told lawmakers Russia appears to be engaging in disinformation and propaganda campaigns to help both Sanders and Trump, who is seeking re-election.

“I read where Russia is helping Bernie Sanders. Nobody said it to me at all. Nobody briefed me about that at all,” Trump said.

“They leaked it, Adam Schiff and his group. They leaked it to the papers and - as usual - they ought to investigate Adam Schiff for leaking that information,” Trump said, without providing any evidence to back up his claims.

Schiff, who served as the lead prosecutor in Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate, said Trump was seeking to turn attention away from his own actions with the comments.

“Nice deflection, Mr. President. But your false claims fool no one,” he wrote in a tweet. “You welcomed Russian help in 2016, tried to coerce Ukraine’s help in 2019, and won’t protect our elections in 2020. Now you fired your intel chief for briefing Congress about it. You’ve betrayed America. Again.”

Trump changed out his acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire and replaced him with U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell last week, reportedly after being annoyed by the briefing to lawmakers about Russian interference.

The president has repeatedly cast doubt on U.S. intelligence findings that Russia intervened to help him in the 2016 presidential election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state.

By raising questions about the latest findings, Trump appears to be seeking to boost Sanders, who is now the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. As a self-described democratic socialist, Sanders is a candidate Trump would like to take on in a general election to bolster his argument that Democrats are pushing a socialist agenda.

Trump has long argued that the Democratic Party favored Clinton unfairly over Sanders in the 2016 primary race, an issue that still divides the Democratic base.

“I think what it could be is, you know, the Democrats are treating Bernie Sanders very unfairly and it sounds to me like a leak from Adam Schiff because they don’t want Bernie Sanders to represent them. It sounds like it’s (2016) all over again for Bernie Sanders,” Trump said.

Other administration officials have cast doubt on reports that Russia was trying to help Trump again this year.

“I haven’t seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump re-elected,” White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien told ABC’s “This Week.”",JustBadNews,0

The gunman, later identified as a 43-year-old man, fatally shot nine people at two locations in Hanau on Wednesday night. The police found him dead, alongside his mother, 73, at his home early Thursday.

In the 24-page manifesto, the attacker accused Trump of stealing slogans like ""America First."" He also said he avoided sex over a fear of state surveillance.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

The man accused of fatally shooting nine people in the central German city of Hanau on Wednesday night published a racist manifesto in which he identified as an incel, called for the extermination of nonwhites, and accused US President Donald Trump of stealing his ideas.

The attacker, named in the German media as Tobias Rathjen, first opened fired at the Midnight hookah bar in Hanau at 10 p.m.

He then drove 1.5 miles west to the Arena Bar & Cafe, proceeding to shoot dead five people before returning home, according to local media and the Hessen State Police.

Police officers later found Rathjen and his 73-year-old mother dead at their home. Authorities have said they are not seeking any other suspects.

Before the attack, the 43-year-old posted a 24-page manifesto to his website in which he sought to justify his beliefs.

The manifesto, reviewed by Insider, details a deep-set hatred of nonwhites.

The man calls for the people of a large number of North African, Asian, and Middle Eastern countries to be ""completely destroyed"" on the baseless idea that they are biologically inferior.

The author, who wrote in German, also claimed Trump stole some of his ideas.

""A billionaire in the USA is implementing my policy recommendation (even some slogans I developed like 'America First, Buy American and Hire American'),"" the manifesto says.

The author also criticized other ""races and cultures"" as ""destructive,"" singling out Islam.

The man also wrote that he was an incel — a term describing those who involuntarily refrain from sex.

He said he had not had a relationship with a woman in 18 years out of a fear of the state surveilling him.

Much of the manifesto is obtuse and rambling, and does not have the ring of being written by a person in a sound mental state.

""Initial analysis of the webpage of the suspect indicate a xenophobic motivation,"" Peter Beuth, the interior minister for the state of Hesse, said, according to the Associated Press.

The nine victims are believed to be mainly Turkish and Kurdish, according to local media.

Later, Aamir learned that they had spent the previous half-hour assaulting a gathering of teachers and students down the road. Their faces were masked, but some were still recognisable as members of a Hindu nationalist student group that has become increasingly powerful over the past few years.

The group, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidya Parishad (ABVP), is the youth wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Founded 94 years ago by men who were besotted with Mussolini’s fascists, the RSS is the holding company of Hindu supremacism: of Hindutva, as it’s called. Given its role and its size, it is difficult to find an analogue for the RSS anywhere in the world. In nearly every faith, the source of conservative theology is its hierarchical, centrally organised clergy; that theology is recast into a project of religious statecraft elsewhere, by other parties. Hinduism, though, has no principal church, no single pontiff, nobody to ordain or rule. The RSS has appointed itself as both the arbiter of theological meaning and the architect of a Hindu nation-state. It has at least 4 million volunteers, who swear oaths of allegiance and take part in quasi-military drills.

The word often used to describe the RSS is “paramilitary”. In its near-century of existence, it has been accused of plotting assassinations, stoking riots against minorities and acts of terrorism. (Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead in 1948 by an RSS man, although the RSS claims he had left the organisation by then.) The RSS doesn’t, by itself, engage in electoral politics. But among its affiliated groups is the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the party that has governed India for the past six years, and that has, under the prime minister Narendra Modi, been remaking India into an authoritarian, Hindu nationalist state.

It was nearly 7pm when Aamir saw the approaching mob. At that time in mid-winter, the campus of JNU, perhaps India’s most influential state-run university, is unnervingly dark. It spreads over more than 400 hectares of wooded land, sealed off by a wall from the rest of south Delhi. Residence halls sit in groves of acacia and borage. To get anywhere from the gate requires a bicycle, an auto rickshaw or a long walk. The university’s 8,000 students appear to occupy a remote world unto themselves. Since its founding in 1969, though, JNU has functioned as a microcosm of national politics. The ideologies of its students and faculty – exhibited in its hyperactive student politics – have traditionally been liberal, leftist and secular. Through its academics, JNU frequently moulded government policy; its graduates went into the media, major non-profits, the law or leftist parties. Over the years, JNU has stood for much of what the conservative, ethnocentric BJP has resented about the country it governs today. The university has been like a stone in the boot of the BJP, hobbling the party with every step.

When he spotted the mob, Aamir ran into the dorms, up the stairs and into his friend’s room. They locked the door, then hid on the balcony. They heard the attackers shattering panes of glass, barging into rooms and beating students. Aamir silenced his phone. “I was sure they’d break my arms and legs if they caught me,” he said. The mob had come with clear intent, targeting students and faculty who had been critical of the BJP: a Muslim student from Kashmir, teachers with ties to the political left, members of groups that championed underprivileged castes. The president of the JNU student union, Aishe Ghosh, received a deep gash to her head and her arm was broken. The rooms of ABVP allies, though, were spared.

Later, it emerged that the university’s own cadre of ABVP had been bolstered by students from other universities – and perhaps by people who weren’t students at all, people who were just RSS muscle. Rohit Azad, who has spent two decades at the university, first as a student and then a professor of economics, told me that although he had seen his share of violence between student groups, “this thing – this act of bringing in attackers from outside – that was unprecedented”. It was as if the Young Republicans had invited some alt-right thugs to join them in running amok through Berkeley, beating up black and Hispanic students, Young Democrats and anyone who’d expressed support for Bernie Sanders.

Videos of the attacks leaked out through social media in real time. The police were called, but they didn’t move to stop the violence. Instead, a posse of policemen installed itself at JNU’s gate, allowing no one in. Yogendra Yadav, a political activist, arrived at the gate at 9pm. Ninety minutes later, the attackers emerged, still masked and armed. Even then, the police detained no one. Instead, they were permitted to walk away as if nothing had happened. When Yadav’s colleague took photos, Yadav was set upon by a knot of men, knocked down and kicked in the face. The police did nothing. Later, from a video, Yadav identified a local ABVP official among those who had hit him. In a statement, the ABVP blamed the attacks on “leftist goons,” but on television members admitted that the masked, armed men and women on campus were part of the ABVP. Still, the Delhi police pressed no charges. “The police gave the goons cover, gave them free rein on campus,” Yadav said. A JNU professor went further, claiming that: “The police are complicit.”

The onslaught on JNU marked the middle of a season of nationwide protest, provoked by a new law. The Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by parliament on 11 December 2019, provides a fast track to citizenship for refugees fleeing into India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Refugees of every south Asian faith are eligible – every faith, that is, except Islam. It is a policy that fits neatly with the RSS and the BJP’s demonisation of Muslims, India’s largest religious minority. To votaries of Hindutva, the country is best served if it is expunged of Islam. The act was both a loud signal of that ambition and a handy tool to help achieve it.

Since December, millions of Indians have turned out on to the streets to object to this vision of their country. The government has fought them by banning gatherings, shutting off mobile internet services, detaining people arbitrarily, or worse. After protests flared at Jamia Millia Islamia, an Islamic university in Delhi, cops fired teargas and live rounds, assaulted students and trashed the library. As demonstrations spread across the state of Uttar Pradesh, police raided and vandalised Muslim homes by way of reprisal. Detainees in custody were beaten; one man reported hearing screams in a police station all night long. (In various statements, the police claimed to be acting in self defence, or to prevent violence, or to root out conspiracy.) At least 20 protesters died of bullet wounds. Police officials denied firing at the crowds, even though the police carried the only visible guns at these rallies.

Still, the protests have persisted well into February. At Shaheen Bagh, a neighbourhood in south-eastern Delhi, hundreds of thousands of people have turned up over nine weeks to take part in an indefinite sit-in. The BJP has taken a ruthless view of all this dissent. On one occasion, Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu cleric who is chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, said: “If they won’t understand words, they’ll understand bullets.” One of Modi’s ministers used “Shoot the traitors to the nation!” as a call-and-response at a rally – the same slogan the ABVP had raised in JNU.

In its 72 years as a free country, India has never faced a more serious crisis. Already its institutions – its courts, much of its media, its investigative agencies, its election commission – have been pressured to fall in line with Modi’s policies. The political opposition is withered and infirm. More is in the offing: the idea of Hindutva, in its fullest expression, will ultimately involve undoing the constitution and unravelling the fabric of liberal democracy. It will have to; constitutional niceties aren’t compatible with the BJP’s blueprint for a country in which people are graded and assessed according to their faith. The ferment gripping India since the passage of the citizenship act – the fever of the protests, the brutality of the police, the viciousness of the politics – has only reflected how existentially high the stakes have become.

The RSS and the BJP’s success, over the past six years, is owed in part to its adept poisoning of the public discourse. Politicians, indoctrinated media outlets and squadrons of social media trolls lie, polarise and demonise all day long. Among their stratagems is the invention of categories of abuse for their opponents, to convey with a single label why such people should not be trusted to have India’s interests at heart. “Presstitute” is one, applied to liberal journalists to accuse them of selling their coverage for money or influence. “Sickular” is another, born of the RSS’s opinion that Indian secularism is a demented version of minority appeasement.

The term “JNU type” refers to leftists of every stripe – from Maoists yearning for the revolution, to moderates who abhor Hindutva. Traditionally, JNU has specialised in the humanities, so “JNU types” also came to be scorned for their soft humanism – for their opposition to capital punishment, to the army’s human-rights abuses, or to the state’s repressions in Kashmir. All while studying for years and years on the government’s dime, the BJP’s supporters complain. It’s enough to slot JNU types into the mother category: “anti-national”.

In its earliest years, JNU soaked up the ideology of the man it was named after – Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister – and of his party, the Congress. It was still only a generation since independence, and Nehru and the Congress, having led the freedom struggle, exerted enormous moral authority. The university’s ethos and its very curriculum were built on Nehru’s values, says Rakesh Batabyal, the author of JNU: The Making of a University. It was secular in its worldview, left of centre in its economics and technocratic in its thinking on policy. “Students came from all over the country,” Batabyal told me. “There was a pluralism to the university that Nehru wanted for India.”

Over the next few decades, the locus of power in student politics migrated further leftwards, into groups that allied themselves with national communist parties. The ABVP, which opposed all these -isms – secularism, pluralism, socialism, communism – remained on the margins, just like its counterparts in national politics. The Hindu right had done nothing of note during the freedom struggle; in fact, the RSS didn’t take part in the mass movements that forced the British out of India. For almost half a century after independence, the political parties backed by the RSS remained in the political wilderness. “They used to say that, back in the 1980s, if you were a supporter at an ABVP event, you went to it with a blanket covering your face,” Azad, the JNU professor, told me. “That was how embarrassing it was considered to be.”

Then a mosque was destroyed, and India changed. For years, the RSS had claimed that the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque in the town of Ayodhya, stood on the very spot where the Hindu deity Ram was born. The location warranted a temple, the RSS declared, not a mosque built by an invading Muslim king. Late in 1990, a BJP leader toured India’s heartland for two months, in an air-conditioned Toyota mocked up to resemble a chariot, to rouse Hindus to demand that a temple replace the mosque. (The man who sat in the Toyota’s cabin, serving as the rally’s logistician, was Narendra Modi.) In December 1992, a crowd of men from the RSS and BJP razed the mosque, watched but unhindered by the police. In the following weeks, religious riots erupted across India, particularly in Mumbai. Two thousand people were killed. The BJP’s obsession with the Babri mosque was bloody and divisive, but it also earned them new political capital. In 1996, the BJP came to power for the first time.

On the campus of JNU, in tidy parallel, the fortunes of the ABVP bloomed: it won its first seat in the student union in 1992, three key union posts in 1996, and in 2000, the presidency of the union itself. The man who won that plum post, Sandeep Mahapatra, entered JNU in 1997 – a time, he told me, when the ABVP’s supporters were proud and vocal about their allegiances. No one wrapped blankets around their faces any more. Part of the reason for the ABVP’s rise, Mahapatra said, was fatigue with leftist ideas. “The Soviet Union had disintegrated. Even there, the left had been defeated,” Mahapatra, now a lawyer in Delhi, said. “The students thought there was some space for nationalist thought.”

The 90s were a decade of disillusionment with socialism and communism, and so too in JNU. Mahapatra’s opponents, he said, “were always talking about abstract things – what Mao had said, or what Marx had said”. The ABVP, for its part, mined the same faultlines on campus that the BJP exploited in Indian society. “We talked about Kashmir, about the Ram temple, about the Hindu nation.” These were all crucial items on the RSS wishlist: to take full possession of the disputed region of Kashmir, defeating Pakistan in the process; to build the temple in Ayodhya; to give Hindus primacy in India. Dust-ups and brawls between student parties, Mahapatra said, were common. Once, while speaking on a stage, he was injured by stones hurled at him by his opponents.

In the 21st century, the tracks of India’s politics and JNU’s politics diverged somewhat. Across the country, the old communist parties fell out of favour. In West Bengal, a citadel of the left, the communists were voted out of the state government in 2011, having held it for 34 years. The Congress, run as a family shop by Nehru’s dynasty, turned complacent and highly corrupt. In the 2014 parliamentary elections, it won just 44 seats – a historic low. The slide was swift and brutal. On campus, the leftist student groups splintered; new caste-based factions arose. But they all decided, Mahapatra said, to band together against the ABVP. Its numbers grew, but its electoral triumphs stalled. There hasn’t been an ABVP union president since Mahapatra, but the group’s power and authority have expanded in ways that tracked the havoc let loose by the Hindu right under Modi.

When Modi won his first term as prime minister in 2014, it was difficult to know how to read the result. Were those who voted for the BJP frustrated with the alternatives, or did they believe Modi to be the economic miracle-worker he claimed to be? Had they simply chosen to disregard the fact that he had allowed mobs of Hindu fanatics to murder hundreds of Muslims in riots during his chief ministership of Gujarat in 2002, or did they actively approve of this overt anti-Muslim agenda?

Only after Modi settled into power did many BJP voters begin to clearly voice their sympathies for Hindutva. These revelations felt sudden and shocking, to the point that you wondered if these voters had silently longed for a pure Hindu nation well before Modi. Relationships ruptured the way they did after Trump’s election or the Brexit referendum. Families bickered on WhatsApp groups, and friends fell out. “Before 2014, you’d have found a pro-ABVP student and a pro-left student who were friends with each other,” Cheri Che, a PhD student in history, told me. “After 2014, that was increasingly difficult.”

At JNU, the ABVP’s influence swelled. Che claimed that faculty and administration positions were filled with people who had RSS or ABVP connections. At one point, he said, the “wardens” – or supervisors – of nearly every residence hall were shunted out and replaced with ABVP sympathisers. Beyond the campus, Hindu nationalists felt so empowered that they formed gangs to lynch Muslims and lower-caste Hindus, on flimsy suspicions that their victims were smuggling cows or in possession of beef. (In Hinduism, the cow is revered as sacred.) Since 2014, at least 44 people have been murdered and 280 injured. The gangs acted with impunity, sometimes filming themselves, as if they’d never be prosecuted – and they were proven correct. In one Uttar Pradesh town, a Muslim man, beaten so badly that he would eventually die, was dragged injured along the ground. A photo showed a policeman clearing a path through the crowd as the mob hauled the body behind him.

On the JNU campus, Muslim students felt more and more anxious. On the day in 2017 when Yogi Adityanath, the Hindutva hardliner, was elected chief minister, a Kashmiri Muslim student was walking to a canteen. It was close to midnight. “I saw a guy, a hardcore ABVP supporter,” said the student, who asked not to be named. “As soon as he saw me, he said: ‘Now that Yogi’s here, we’ll cut down and devour the Muslims.’ He said it openly. There were a lot of people standing around. You wouldn’t have heard anything like that earlier.”

In February 2016, Kanhaiya Kumar, a communist who was then the student union’s president, was part of a campus protest against the hanging of a Kashmiri man dubiously convicted of terrorism. The ABVP called in news crews from pro-BJP channels. Over the next few days, these channels aired footage that seemed to show Kumar and others yelling slogans calling for the break-up of India. For viewers, the videos confirmed what they already suspected: that JNU was a hothouse of treason. A few weeks later, the videos were found to have been doctored.

Regardless, the BJP’s leaders kept referring to JNU’s students – and to anyone who supported them – as “anti-nationals” and traitors. The Delhi police arrested Kumar and charged him under a century-old sedition law. When the police took him to the courthouse for his hearing, they encountered a mob of dozens of lawyers and at least one BJP legislator hollering slogans. “Shoot him!” they shouted. Then, inside the courthouse, while the police stood by, the mob beat Kumar up. Afterwards, a news report said, one of the attackers claimed with satisfaction: “Our job is done.”

After the February 2016 protest, the Kashmiri JNU student learned that police had visited his home in Srinagar, in Kashmir, and taken down a host of details about him and his family. He hadn’t even been at the protest, he said. Then he discovered that every Kashmiri student he knew in JNU had a similar story to tell. It shook him. “We decided – a group of us – that we’d just stay out of things having to do with politics,” he said. “We’re vulnerable here.” A little over a year ago, when he was going to the campus library one morning, he saw a big truck filled with people shouting slogans about the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Out of a set of loudspeakers on the truck, music from the Hindutva songbook poured out. Accompanying the truck, he said, were “people on bikes, people on foot – and they were outsiders, not students,” he said. “I thought: ‘The goons have come inside.’”

In 2016, Modi’s government installed at the head of JNU an engineering professor named M Jagadesh Kumar. The students and the press described Kumar as an RSS loyalist – part of the government’s wider campaign to seed universities and cultural institutions with RSS appointees. Kumar denied any links with the RSS.

On the evening of 5 January, as the attacks on campus escalated, Kumar messaged the police via WhatsApp, according to a police enquiry report. Instead of requesting help in curbing the mob, though, he asked for police to be stationed outside the gate. (Later, to a reporter, he said that he’d wanted campus security to tackle the assaults, which he called “unfortunate.”) Only at 7.45pm did a JNU official ask the police into the campus to intervene, but by then the violence had ended. The attackers were still on the premises hours later, but the university and the police let them leave, as if they’d dropped by for a visit and were now hurrying to catch the last bus home.

Even before the ABVP attacks, JNU had been seething. For weeks, the student union had been aggressively opposing a fee hike, boycotting registrations and forcing classes to be suspended. When the nationwide demonstrations against the citizenship act began, that was folded into the mobilisations on campus. To many students, the JNU administration, the RSS and the BJP were part of the same machine.

By itself, the new law defies India’s constitution, which is a long document steeped in the resolve to treat castes and religions with scrupulous equality. Written between 1946 and 1949, it was an exercise in nation-making – in gluing together a giant modern state from fragmented communities living across the land. To effect this, one of its chief promises was that citizenship would bear no connection to religion. The citizenship act’s exclusion of Muslims violates that promise.

But the act is most menacing when read in tandem with other recent government measures, which in totality aim to redefine who does and does not belong on Indian soil. These measures can be perplexing, even for Indians. For one, some of their functions seem to overlap. For another, they’re constantly referred to by the kind of abbreviations that are unavoidable in Indian life. The Citizenship Amendment Act is the CAA; the National Register of Citizens is the NRC; the National Population Register is the NPR. On Twitter, hashtags about the #CAA-NPR-NRC issue devolve into a thick alphabet soup.

The government started to create a register of citizens five years ago, in the north-eastern state of Assam. The riverine deltas and paddy fields of Assam lie across a porous border with Bangladesh, and migrants have crossed in both directions for decades. The arrival of Bangladeshis – many of them Muslims – became a heated political issue in Assam through the 70s and 80s. The migrants were blamed for taking jobs, usurping land and signing up for welfare benefits despite being ineligible for them.

Previous governments, as well as India’s supreme court, had agreed that a citizens’ register was necessary to distinguish migrants from locals. Citizenship isn’t always simple to prove in India; in a country of more than 1 billion people, fewer than 100 million hold passports, while other documents, issued at local levels by corrupt or inefficient officers, can be unreliable. For the BJP, the idea of a citizen’s register served as both a profitable electoral tactic and a religious wedge. In a stump speech in 2014, Modi told an audience in Assam that while Hindu migrants would be accommodated, other “infiltrators” would be sent back to Bangladesh. In April 2019, Amit Shah, now Modi’s home minister, said that Bangladeshi immigrants were “eating the grain that should go to the poor”. They were “termites”, Shah added. The BJP would pick them up, one by one, and “throw them into the Bay of Bengal”.

To get into the register, people had to prove first that an ancestor lived in Assam before 1971 and then that they were related to that ancestor. In a country of spotty electoral rolls and property deeds, of inconsistent name spellings and patchy documentation, this was always going to be difficult. When the registration of citizens began in 2015, Assam scrambled for its papers. Poor families, worried about being rendered stateless, spent their money on lawyers and documents. Some committed suicide. The so-called foreigners’ tribunals, set up to hear appeals, were incentivised to strike people off the register; the more foreigners you identified, the better your chances of staying on the tribunal.

In 2019, a Vice News examination of five of these tribunals found that nine out of 10 cases involved Muslims. Of the Muslims who appealed, 90% were declared illegal immigrants; for Hindus, the figure was 40%. The government plans to round up all these “foreigners” and transport them to fill nearly a dozen internment camps in the state. (One is already being built: a 28,000 sq metre, double-walled complex for 3,000 people, not far from the border with Bhutan. The centre has six watchtowers and a 100-metre-high light tower.) The BJP is so pleased with this process that it wants to compile a pan-Indian register of citizens, extending the exclusionary power of the process across a population of 1.3 billion.

Assam’s register was made public last August, and 1.9 million people, finding themselves omitted, had to hurry to file appeals. Four months later, the government passed the citizenship act. In this grand mechanism to determine “Indianness”, there will be one further component: a population register, hoovering up demographic data on the “usual residents” of India. But even this seemingly passive count of the population can transmute into yet another sieve for citizenship. After the population register is updated in September, lists of residents will be posted in each locality. Then anyone in the locality – officials, neighbours, vigilantes, RSS informers – can lodge an objection to your name’s inclusion. In such cases, you will be marked out as a “doubtful” citizen – a “D-voter” – with the prospect of being interned endlessly or thrown out of India. In this fug of paranoia, anyone might theoretically find themselves tagged “doubtful”: Muslims, dissidents, journalists and opposition political workers. The BJP knows its priorities. “No Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian or Parsi,” a new BJP booklet assures readers, “will find their name in the D-voter list.” Muslims, again, are conspicuous by their absence.

The end game isn’t to rinse 180 million Muslims out of India. It can’t be, for practical reasons. Where would they go? Even those speculatively identified as illegal Bangladeshi immigrants cannot be sent back home unless Bangladesh accepts them. What the BJP is aiming for is what its founders have always wanted: a country that is Hindu before anything else. In the 1940s, both Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and Vinayak Savarkar, a leading RSS ideologue, were proponents of a two-nation theory. “The only difference,” says Niraja Jayal, a political scientist who studies Indian democracy, “was that Jinnah wanted the territory of undivided India to be cut into two, with one part for Muslims. Whereas Savarkar wanted Hindus and Muslims in the same land, but with the Muslim living in a subordinate position to the Hindu.” That unequal citizenship was what the RSS considered – and still considers – right and proper, Jayal said. “So you get a graded citizenship, a citizenship with hierarchies. You don’t need genocide, you don’t need ethnic cleansing. This does the job well enough.”

Modi’s first and second terms have now come to feel distinctly different. After 2014, the BJP consolidated its success by winning a series of state elections. The government began its citizenship registry in Assam, but its other prominent policies affected every Indian uniformly: a new tax on goods and services, chaotically implemented; a cancellation of high-value currency notes, intended to curb corruption but melting the economy down instead; and an Orwellian biometric identification scheme. The worst acts of rightwing violence – the beef lynchings – were committed by vigilantes emboldened by the BJP’s rise, and often supported by party leaders. (Two years ago, after eight convicted lynchers were released on bail, one of Modi’s ministers invited them to his house and draped floral garlands on them.) But the lynchings were not directly ascribable to the government in the way that events since Modi’s re-election last year have been.

In August 2019, three months into its second term, the government suspended a constitutional provision that has long granted special autonomies to the disputed border state of Jammu and Kashmir. Further, the state was split in two, and the halves brought under federal control. To forestall resistance, troops poured into the already heavily militarised Kashmir valley, and internet services across the state were shut down. They haven’t yet been properly restored; each passing day sets a new record for the longest shutdown of the internet by a government anywhere in the world. Kashmir’s leading opposition politicians were arrested; they haven’t been heard from since. Justifying a draconian detention order, the government argued that one of these politicians deserved to be held because of his ability “to convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers”.

The RSS got the solution it wanted in Ayodhya as well. Since 1992, a legal battle has raged to determine what should be done with the site of the flattened mosque. In November, the supreme court – which appears increasingly pliant to the government’s needs – ruled that the mosque had been destroyed illegally, but that the land should nevertheless host a temple. It was as if a burglar, having been dressed down, was then invited to move into the house he’d robbed. The citizenship act was passed in December. Within half a year, with a speed and brazenness that left India dazed, the government had fulfilled some of the chief items on the RSS wishlist.

Given the ferocity and stamina of the anti-government protests since December, it seems bewildering that no similar mobilisations met any of the government’s previous moves. From the 2019 election onwards, for several months, it seemed as if most Indians were implicitly in favour of this galloping onset of Hindutva. Why was it the citizenship act that electrified the public into protest? It may have partly been “the straw that broke the camel’s back”, Jayal said, but it also induced a broader, more primal kind of insecurity.

“With Kashmir, large segments of India have been persuaded over time that it’s a troubled region – which is an unfair stereotype, but maybe that made it harder for people to respond to its change in status,” she said. “With the Babri Masjid, it was fatigue over an issue that has dragged on for decades.” The citizenship act, though, “promises a whole range of unpleasant possibilities”. Despite the government’s assurances to Hindus and other non-Muslims, “everyone is anxious to be told they have to search for papers, although of course it’s worse for Muslims”, she said. “There’s the prospect of harassment. There’s the fear of being declared illegal. There’s the fear of the unknown.”

This sense of personal peril is matched by a sense of national peril. India can appear to be inured to injustices – the miscarriages of law, the iniquities of wealth and caste, the venality, the wounds and bruises to the body politic. What it still resists is any attempt to claw into the body and rearrange its very bones – its constitution. Nehru, Ambedkar and the other framers of India’s constitution engineered the country to be a liberal, secular democracy. Until recently, that idea had come to seem so impossible to dislodge that even patently unsecular politicians feel compelled to pay lip service to it. “Secularism is an article of faith for us,” Modi said during his 2014 campaign. By then, as an RSS member, he’d already been committed to the concept of a Hindu nation for 43 years.

When governments have threatened to split away from this constitutional foundation, they’ve met widespread popular opposition. After the prime minister Indira Gandhi suspended civic freedoms – of speech, of assembly, of due process – in 1975, she had to suppress waves of protest for the next 18 months, until she called off her declared state of emergency. The recent agitations against the citizenship act are similar: defiance of a law that meddles with the fundamental design of India.

For the first time since 1947, when the subcontinent went through its bloody partition into India and Pakistan, a politics is being constructed entirely around the premise of exclusion – of deciding who can’t be Indian, or calibrating how Indian anyone can be. The rabid focus on identity is a piece of a global pattern, of course, but it is especially dangerous in a country that is as tenuous a construct as India. This is still, as it was in 1947, a land teeming with so many identities – plotted multi-dimensionally along the axes of caste, gender, class, religion, language and ethnicity – that the only way to make it work is to accept that everyone belongs equally to India.

This egalitarian principle, therefore, has not been just an ideal; it has been a compact necessary for India’s survival. When a government starts to make the case for some to be considered less Indian than others, subtracting first one identity and then another as if they were Jenga blocks, the structure turns unsteady. Either the union dissolves, or it is kept together only by an iron-fisted, authoritarian regime – the kind that unleashes violence through the police, as in Uttar Pradesh, or through party auxiliaries under police protection, as at JNU. The danger posed by the BJP is that it is both preparing itself to be that regime and guiding India into an instability from which it may never recover.

Outcry as Indian students forced to remove underwear to prove they weren't on their period,http://sbs.com.au/news/outcry-as-indian-students-forced-to-remove-underwear-to-prove-they-weren-t-on-their-period,"Scores of women students staged a protest outside an Indian college saying they were forced to strip to check if they were menstruating.

The students were told to undress after a used sanitary napkin was found in a garden outside Sahjanand Girls Institute, where they are banned from the hostel when they are having their periods.

NCW Inquiry Team led by Member Dr. Rajul L. Desai, along with Advocate Malshree Gadhvi (DLSA) visited the Sahjanand Girls Institute at Bhuj today to discuss the incident of 'Strip Test'. Three Females held responsible are suspended by the Administration. pic.twitter.com/NtWi9OIO8m — NCW (@NCWIndia) February 16, 2020

""There are no words to describe the humiliation that we faced,"" said one of the students protesting outside the college in Bhuj, in the western state of Gujarat.

Deep-rooted social taboos remain in India around menstruating women. In some rural areas, women are made to sleep separately during periods. They are banned from entering some temples.

College authorities lined up 68 students in the washroom and ordered them to undress one by one, the students told reporters.

The college is run by the conservative Hindu sect Swaminarayan. The sect runs lavish temples around the world, including in London.

Its rules bar students from staying in the hostel during their periods.

Menstruating women students must stay in an isolated basement area and keep away from the kitchen and the place of worship.

They also have to sit at the back of the classroom during lectures.

The college said it had set up an inquiry and indicated action could be taken against the staff behind the checks.

College trustee Pravin Pindoria said: ""The girls were informed about the hostel rules before they took admission.

""I have called a meeting of the administrative committee which will take action against the responsible persons.""",JustBadNews,0

China's censors tried to control the narrative on a hero doctor's death. It backfired terribly,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/07/asia/china-doctor-death-censorship-intl-hnk/index.html,"James Griffiths is a Senior Producer for CNN International and author of "" The Great Firewall of China: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet .""

Hong Kong (CNN) Speaking to state media in late December, one of China's top medical officials hailed eight residents of Wuhan who had attempted to blow the whistle on the coronavirus outbreak now devastating the country .

""In retrospect, we should highly praise them,"" said Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC). ""They were wise before the outbreak.""

One of those whistleblowers, punished for spreading ""rumors"" as the city's government continued to downplay the dangers of the virus, was Li Wenliang. A young doctor in one of Wuhan's main hospitals, Li posted in a private group chat about the spread of a ""SARS-like"" virus.

""I only wanted to remind my university classmates to be careful,"" he told CNN this week

Li was speaking from his hospital bed, having succumbed to the virus himself. In the early hours of Friday morning, his condition worsened, and the 34-year-old died, becoming one of hundreds of fatalities from an outbreak that has spread well beyond Wuhan, affecting all of China and dozens of countries around the world.

If Li's initial arrest was an embarrassment for the authorities, his death is a disaster.

Censorship crisis

The reaction on the Chinese internet as news of Li's death spread was immediate -- and almost unprecedented.

""Countless young people will mature overnight after today: the world is not as beautiful as we imagined,"" one commenter wrote. ""Are you angry? If any of us here is fortunate enough to speak up for the public in the future, please make sure you remember tonight's anger.""

As the grief and rage poured out, those in charge of China's vast censorship apparatus, the Great Firewall, seemed at a loss over what to do. Topics relating to censorship itself, usually absolutely verboten, trended for several hours before being deleted, rare evidence of indecision and confusion

On Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, two hashtags -- ""The Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech"" -- attracted tens of thousands of views, before being deleted. Another hashtag, ""I want freedom of speech,"" drew more than 1.8 million views in the early hours of Friday morning, before it too was censored.

The anger over Li's death was made worse by an apparent clumsy attempt to control the narrative, one that was highly reminiscent of the overreaction that led to his initial arrest.

Multiple state media outlets reported Li's death late Thursday night, citing friends and doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital, only to subsequently delete them without explanation. The hospital claimed efforts to resuscitate Li were underway, but later issued a statement that he had died.

While it is possible that this was a mistake -- and Chinese media wouldn't be the first to misreport someone's death -- the suggestion that the censors' hands were involved was enough to spark fury online.

""A doctor had to die twice,"" wrote one user on the popular social media app WeChat. ""That is national humiliation.""

Others pointed to the timing of the eventual confirmation, suggesting the authorities had tried to push the announcement until most people would be in bed so they could better control the reaction.

""I knew you would post this in the middle of the night,"" wrote one user. ""You think we've all gone to sleep? No. We haven't.""

The fury and the pushback against the censorship apparatus itself has not been seen to this extent since the Wenzhou train crash in 2011 , when authorities rushed to cover up the causes of a high-speed rail collision, even abandoning the search for survivors while many were still alive.

That incident became a lightning rod for frustrations about poor safety standards in China and the uncaring attitudes of the authorities, just as it appears Li's death will be a conduit for anger over a host of issues beyond the virus.

Social stability

Li's death and the authorities' clumsy handling of it has exacerbated a crisis that is already shaking the very foundations of the Chinese state.

Since the transition from socialism to state capitalism and the brutal suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen Movement, China's government has based its legitimacy on its ability to grow the economy, keeping its people safe and successful.

The Wuhan conronavirus threatens this social contract in two ways. The utter failure to contain the outbreak has put hundreds of millions at risk of a potentially deadly virus; while at the same time, the outbreak and efforts to tackle it have delivered yet another hit to an economy already struggling with structural issues and the US-China trade war.

Making matters worse is the evidence that it was the Communist Party system itself, which does not reward speaking out or risk taking, that likely led Wuhan city officials to initially downplay the virus and attempt to control the narrative.

Revelations about how Wuhan government functionaries handled the early weeks of the outbreak -- especially the news that Li and other whistleblowers had been silenced -- led to considerable anger, but the central authorities were largely able to keep this focused on local officials by allowing a rare amount of transparency and giving Chinese media a relatively free hand in covering the outbreak

In the past week or so, however, the central authorities have tightened their grip on the flow of information, as increasingly draconian methods of control are put in place nationwide to stop the virus' spread. Most of the country is on voluntary or mandatory quarantine, and the economic toll of such measures is starting to bite.

In response, state media has been emphasizing positive stories of resilience and heroism, and it seemed like Li might have fit into this new narrative, fulfilling a role similar to that of Jiang Yanyong , a retired military doctor and whistleblower during the 2003 SARS pandemic. Perhaps Li could have been reframed as someone fighting the ""pointless formalities and bureaucratism"" that state media has been inveighing against all week.

Li's death has thrown this out of the window, and in doing so has exposed the cold reality at the heart of the Chinese social contract: when it comes down to it, individuals are absolutely expendable if the stability of the Party is at stake. Chinese authorities make a big point out of the country being a collective that pulls together in a crisis, unlike the individual-focused societies of the West, but ultimately people know that it is the Party, not the country, that comes first.

China's censorship apparatus is built on this principle. Anything that threatens the Party, from open dissent to simply organizing outside of official structures -- no matter how innocuous the topic -- is not tolerated and must be erased.

The need to maintain stability is what will dominate the response to Li's death. An outpouring of grief is fine, even some anger is acceptable, provided it can be focused on individuals and not the system at large, and some scalps may be offered to help this along. What the authorities cannot allow is for the Party or the central government to become a target, even when the Wuhan crisis and Li's death have exposed their many shortcomings.

Whether they will be successful in doing so remains to be seen. Li's sheer normality makes his death resonate all the more with the public. He was not some Party cadre or police officer of the type lauded in state media, noble and personality free, but a relatable and ordinary person, who posted on social media about loving fried chicken and ice cream, complained about work, and commented on pop culture.

He is every person who's felt unloved by the Chinese bureaucracy, and he's infinitely more sympathetic than the steely-eyed men and women trying to control the narrative around his death.",JustBadNews,0
Chinese citizens are furious at the death of the whistleblower doctor censored for talking about the coronavirus. His mother said she couldn't even say goodbye.,http://businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang-death-anger-china-2020-2,"The death of a doctor who was censored for sounding the alarm about the coronavirus has enraged Chinese citizens.

Chinese social media was filled with outpourings of grief and anger after Li Wenliang's death early Friday. Many posts featured the hashtag ""We want freedom of speech.""

Li had warned his peers about the coronavirus on December 30, shortly before the government formally acknowledged the outbreak. The police in Wuhan, where he lived, had him sign a letter admitting to ""making false comments.""

Li's mother defended her son, telling a Chinese news outlet on Friday: ""He had so much potential, so much talent. He's not the kind of person who would lie.""

She also said she was not able to say goodbye to her son before he was cremated.

China has punished people who tried to spread information about the coronavirus in its early days, and health services in Wuhan have become overwhelmed.

Chinese citizens are furious after the death of Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor who was censored for warning about the beginning of the coronavirus, and his mother said she wasn't able to say goodbye.

Li died of the coronavirus at 2:58 a.m. local time on Friday, the Wuhan Central Hospital, where he also worked, said in a statement on the microblogging site Weibo.

""During the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at our hospital, was infected. Efforts to save him were ineffective. He died at 2:58 a.m. on Feb. 7. We deeply regret and mourn his death,"" the post said.

Li had warned some of his medical-school colleagues about the virus on December 30, about three weeks after the outbreak started but shortly before the government officially acknowledged it. The virus has now killed more than 630 people, mostly in China, and spread to more than 20 countries.

Li had said that some patients at his hospital were quarantined with a respiratory illness that seemed like SARS. But he was reprimanded and silenced by the police in Wuhan, made to sign a letter that said he was ""making false comments.""

People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's Communist Party, reported that he said on social media before his death: ""After I recover from the disease, I will work on the front line of the battle. The virus is still spreading, and I don't want to be a deserter.""

Li is now being hailed as a hero in China, with posts seeking justice for him and calling for freedom of speech trending on Weibo. Many were removed from the site, which often complies with government demands to censor politically sensitive content.

The top two trending hashtags on Weibo on Friday were ""Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech,"" the BBC reported. It said that hours later those hashtags had been removed and ""hundreds of thousands of comments had been wiped.""

According to the BBC, one comment on Weibo said: ""This is not the death of a whistleblower. This is the death of a hero.""

Li's death was the most-read topic on Weibo on Friday, with more than 1.5 billion views, The Guardian reported.

Li's death was also widely discussed in private messaging groups on WeChat, the instant-messaging sister app to Weibo, The Guardian said.

CNN called the response ""overwhelming, near-universal public fury.""

One image shared on Weibo showed that someone had carved ""farewell Li Wenliang"" into the snow in Beijing.

People's Daily wrote on Friday: ""At present, China has entered a critical stage of epidemic prevention and control work. The country needs solidarity more than ever to jointly win a battle that it cannot lose, so that its people can be protected against disaster and patients around the country can return to health.

""No one can make an accurate prediction about when the battle will end, but everyone knows that only with sufficient confidence can the people win the battle against the novel coronavirus.""

His parents 'never, never, never saw' him

In a heartbreaking interview with the Chinese news site Pear Video on Friday after Li's death, Li's mother said she never got to say goodbye to her son in his final days.

She said the hospital sent a car to pick up her and Li's father, ""then they sent his body to the crematorium.""

She said they ""never, never, never saw"" him for the last time.

""Thirty-four years old. He had so much potential, so much talent. He's not the kind of person who would lie,"" she said, alluding to Li's reprimand by the police in Wuhan.

Li had a wife, who is pregnant, and a 5-year-old son, his mother said. Shortly after the outbreak, Li sent them to Xiangyang, a city about 200 miles from Wuhan.

The Chinese government has been accused of covering up the virus

Chinese authorities have been criticized as responding slowly to the virus. Officials have arrested citizens accused of spreading rumors online and detained journalists covering the virus.

The announcement of Li's death also came amid conflicting statements in which state media reported that he had died, then that he was still alive, and then again that he had died.

China's Communist Party has sent investigators to Wuhan to do ""a comprehensive investigation into the problems reported by the public concerning Dr. Li Wenliang,"" state media reported Friday.

Earlier this month, the Chinese government issued a rare statement acknowledging that its response to the virus had ""shortcomings and deficiencies.""

The World Health Organization has largely defended China's response, saying it has been much more open with the world about this virus than it was in the early 2000s with the SARS outbreak, which it tried to cover up.

President Donald Trump also tweeted his support for Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, calling him ""strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus.""

Many other doctors have caught the virus in Wuhan, where the health system has become overwhelmed and supplies are running low.

He has since been under police surveillance. Government sources latter admitted that there had been concerns about his behaviour but they had been powerless to keep him behind bars. Up to 180 convicted Islamist terrorists have been released early from jail in the past two decades, a London Telegraph analysis shows, and the newspaper had warned that Amman was due for release in the wake of the London Bridge attack in September. In his trial, it was revealed that Amman, then aged 18, had advised his girlfriend to kill her ""kuffar"" parents. Amman told her: ""If you can't make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack the tourists [crusaders], police and soldiers of taghut, or Western embassies in every country you are in this planet."" Amman was also found with a bomb-making manual.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson planned to announce ""fundamental changes"" on Monday to how Britain deals with convicted terrorists. He made a similar pledge after the stabbing attack near London Bridge. ""If you are convicted of a serious terrorist offence, there should be a mandatory minimum sentence of 14 years - and some should never be released,"" he said.

""Further, for all terrorism and extremist offences, the sentence announced by the judge must be the time actually served - these criminals must serve every day of their sentence, with no exceptions."" Student Gulled Bulhan said the shooting happened in front of a pharmacy on Streatham High Road. ""I was crossing the road when I saw a man with a machete and silver canisters on his chest being chased by what I assume was an undercover police officer as they were in civilian clothing,"" the 19-year-old told the PA news agency.

A woman in her 50s has been discharged from hospital. Another woman in her 20s who had minor injuries caused by flying glass from police fire was still being treated. Deputy assistant police commissioner Stephen Roberts said police were looking to search the suspect's home and seize any computer-based evidence that could provide clues to a motive. Investigators were researching the man's background to learn more about the attack and any possible co-conspirators, Roberts said. He said that if evidence suggested the stabbings were carried out by a ""self-starter"", it meant that any city in the country was vulnerable at any time to a similar ""low-tech"" attack.

A video posted on social media shows a policeman attempting to evacuate a nearby shop, although cafe staff appear initially reluctant to leave. The staff and customers eventually follow the police officer's instructions after he explains the suspected terrorist is believed to be wearing an explosive device. ""Terrorist seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life [but] here in London we will never let them succeed,"" the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, said in a statement. The UK's terror alert level remains at ""substantial"", which means an attack is likely. Ministers were braced to face immediate demands for all terrorists who have been released early to be recalled, the sources said, amid growing fears over public safety following two attacks by terrorists on parole within just over two months.

Confirmation of a terrorist motive would make this incident the third terror attack in the United Kingdom in two months. British police shot a man dead on London Bridge following a stabbing rampage that killed two people and wounded three others in late November. The attacker, 28-year-old Usman Khan, had been previously convicted of terrorism offences and released from prison in 2018. Khan was free on parole, with an electronic tracking device on his ankle, when he entered a conference focused on the rehabilitation of violent offenders and terrorists. Khan slashed at his victims with knives and wore a fake suicide vest. He had been previously convicted of conspiring to bomb London landmarks. In early January, two inmates wearing fake suicide belts attacked and seriously wounded a guard at the Whitemoor maximum security prison in Cambridgeshire. In a June 2017 attack, three Islamic State sympathisers were shot and killed after ramming pedestrians with a van near London Bridge and stabbing eight bystanders to death in nearby Borough Market.

California Cops Handcuff 16-year-old Boy Suffering Seizure for Not Complying,http://newsmaven.io/pinacnews/cops-gone-rogue/california-cops-handcuff-16-year-old-boy-suffering-seizure-for-not-complying-lnyndtYQjkK7E6kpy0rrQA,"Fresno cops were insistent on taking him to jail until the boy's mother showed them paperwork proving he is autistic.

A 16-year-old autistic boy suffering a seizure inside a bathroom of a fast food restaurant Thursday night ended up handcuffed by police who determined he was somehow breaking the law.

The boy's mother told her daughter to call 911 after she found her son on the bathroom of a El Pollo Loco restaurant suffering a seizure.

But Fresno police officer Rodney Zumkehr arrived and shoved him hard against the wall and began punching him, thinking he was on drugs – a man trained only in escalating altercations.

""We called paramedics for help, we did not call police,"" the boy's mother, Lourdes Ponce, told ABC 7. ""He was not hurting anybody, he was having a seizure.""

Ponce tried to tell Zumkehr her son is autistic but continued arresting her son.

""He saw that my son was throwing up and instead of helping him so that he wouldn't choke on his vomit, they had him on the ground in handcuffs,"" she said.

It was only when she ran to her car to get paperwork proving he is autistic that police released him. But only after making her sign a ""certificate of release.""

Paramedics were then able to transport him to the hospital as originally intended where the boy is still being treated.

Ponce said she had taken him to a doctor earlier that day because of his seizures. She said they were at El Pollo Loco when she heard him fall.

""I stood outside the door, I heard him hit the floor, I tried to open the door but it was locked, that's when I asked for help,"" she said.

Employees unlocked the door and her daughter called 911, expecting paramedics to arrive.

But Fresno police arrived with nothing but their training and IQs to guide them, putting everybody else's lives in danger.

Fresno police issued the following statement:

""This case is currently under Administrative Review. The review will include the examination of all the information pertaining to the officer's contact including Body Worn Cameras.""

Ponce told ABC 7 the police officers need more training but they are behaving exactly as they are trained which is to control people, not help them. Below is a screenshot of Ponce's Facebook post along with a screenshot from Transparent California. Watch the video above.

Thailand admits it is 'unable to stop the spread' of China's deadly coronavirus as health minister warns more cases are coming,http://dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7938887/Thailand-admits-unable-stop-spread-Chinas-deadly-coronavirus.html,"What is the coronavirus?

A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.

The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2.

Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it.

The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.

Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals.

'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).

'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.'

The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31.

By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.

The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.

Where does the virus come from?

According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively.

The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation.

Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat.

A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats.

However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.

Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China.

'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.'

So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?

Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.

It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19.

Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold.

Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.

'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.'

If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.

'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.

'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'

How does the virus spread?

The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms.

It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.

Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person.

What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?

Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time.

If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.

In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.

Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why.

What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?

Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world.

This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.

Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread.

However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people.

This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it.

More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately.

How dangerous is the virus?

The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people.

Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is.

However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.

Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.

Can the virus be cured?

The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.

Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money.

No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.

The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.

Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.

People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public.

And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).

However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.

Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?

The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'.

Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.",JustBadNews,0

China closed Shanghai Disneyland and part of the Great Wall and suspended public transportation in 10 cities as it rushed to contain the virus, stranding millions of people at the start of the country’s Lunar New Year holiday.

France reported two cases on Friday evening, the first ones discovered in Europe. More were likely, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said.

Wuhan, a city of 11 million where the virus was first identified, is in virtual lockdown. Nearly all flights at Wuhan’s airport have been canceled and checkpoints block the main roads leading out of town.

As the city slides into isolation, pharmacies have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been flooded with nervous residents. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday, state media said.

Despite the lockdown, the virus is already spreading further afield.

The vast majority of the cases and all of the deaths have been in China, but it has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the new virus.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday it had 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases, both in people who had traveled to Wuhan.

Following a congressional briefing by health officials, Republican U.S. Senator John Barrasso, a former physician, said people in the United States with the virus may have been infected up to 14 days ago in China.

“We want to try to stop and prevent people from coming to the United States if they have it,” Barrasso told reporters, without providing details of how that might be accomplished.

Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China.

The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.

It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.

Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing medical conditions, the World Health Organization said.

As of Thursday, China’s National Health Commission said there were 830 confirmed cases and 26 deaths.

‘SENSE OF URGENCY’

Most cases have been in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife.

As China scrambles to contain the outbreak, it has suspended transportation in 10 cities in the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located, the Hubei Daily reported.

The country will take further, more targeted measures, state television reported, citing a State Council meeting on Friday. It did not give further details.

“Local authorities should take more responsibility and have a stronger sense of urgency,” state broadcaster CCTV said.

Week-long celebrations to welcome the Year of the Rat began on Friday, raising fears that the infection rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of people travel to see family at home and abroad.

In Wuhan, a handful of people got off a high-speed train that pulled into the city’s station on Friday but nobody boarded.

“What choice do I have? It’s Chinese New Year. We have to see our family,” said a man getting off the train who gave his family name Hu.

As part of the restrictions, some sections of the Great Wall near Beijing will be closed from Saturday, state media said.

Beijing’s Lama Temple, where people traditionally make offerings for the new year, has closed, as have some other temples and the Forbidden City, the capital’s most famous tourist attraction.

Shanghai Disneyland will close starting on Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last year’s new year holiday.

Film premieres have been postponed and McDonald’s suspended business in five cities in Hubei province.

“There’s so much news, so much data, every 10 minutes there’s an update, it’s frightening, especially for people like us in a severely hit area,” Lily Jin, 30, a resident of Wuhan, told Reuters by phone.

VACCINE QUEST

The WHO said on Thursday it was a “bit too early” to designate the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, which would require countries to step up their response.

That decision could well be reassessed in coming days as the situation evolves, said Anthony Fauci, the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s top infectious disease official, adding that it was “open to question” whether shutting down travel would have a major effect.

“The mass involuntary quarantine in Wuhan and its neighboring cities is counterproductive,” added Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. “A lockdown of Wuhan will drive the epidemic underground, provoking fear and panic.”

Some experts believe the virus is not as dangerous as the one that caused the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also began in China and killed nearly 800 people, or the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 700 people since 2012.

Three international research teams - using different approaches - have begun work on vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said.

China Keeps Arresting Hong Kong Protesters for 'Soliciting Prostitution',http://vice.com/en_us/article/epgx8w/china-keeps-arresting-hong-kong-protesters-for-soliciting-prostitution,"Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.

A Hong Kong student who organized medical support for the city’s pro-democracy protests is missing after being arrested in Mainland China nine days ago, sparking fears that he’s being held for political reasons.

Kwok Chun-fung has not been seen or heard from since he was arrested on Jan. 8 in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on charges of “soliciting prostitution,” according to reports.

That’s the same charge that was laid against a British consulate employee who was detained during a business trip to the Mainland city of Shenzhen in August. Simon Cheng, a 29-year-old Hong Kong citizen, said after his release that Chinese secret police had tortured him during his 15 days in detention, accusing him of being a British spy and of fomenting protests in the city.

The similarities between the cases have prompted concerns that Chinese security agents could be using the solicitation charges as a pretext, and that the true purpose of Kwok’s detention is to interrogate him about his support for the protests.

Findcmed, the volunteer medic group that Kwok co-founded to support injured pro-democracy protesters, told Hong Kong media Thursday that the solicitation charges represented an “old tactic,” and that “the truth” would eventually come out. The group said it couldn’t comment further while the proceedings against Kwok were ongoing.

Kwok is a 20-something Hong Konger who studies at the Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine and Findcmed, which formed on the messaging app Telegram, organizes volunteers to provide medical support for protesters injured in pro-democracy demonstrations, which have frequently involved violent confrontations between police and protesters.

The police have been accused of brutality for their use of tear gas, batons, rubber bullets, water cannons, and bean bag rounds, while Amnesty International has documented more extreme cases of police violence, resulting in injuries ranging from head wounds to broken arms.

Another of the group’s administrators, who uses the pseudonym Little Cow, said in a post on the online forum LIHKG that he was in the middle of a phone call with Kwok, who was in his university dorm room in Guangzhou, when his friend disappeared.

According to Little Cow, Kwok had gone to open the door when the phone dropped to the floor and the line went dead. Little Cow said he had subsequently been told by Kwok’s roommate that his friend was under administrative arrest.

AFP reported Thursday that Kwok’s classmates at the Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine had been briefed by school officials about his disappearance, telling students that he had been arrested for soliciting a prostitute in a hotel.

The offence is punishable by up to 15 days in administrative detention.

Cheng, the staffer at the British consulate, was held for 15 days before he was released to return to Hong Kong in August. In November, having fled to an undisclosed third country for his safety, he spoke out about his ordeal, saying he had been beaten, blindfolded, chained to a cross, and held in stress positions for hours during his detention.

Cheng, who said he supported the protests in a personal capacity and had monitored them as part of his job, said his interrogators accused him of being a British spy, and pressed him to admit that the British government was behind the pro-democracy protests roiling the city. He said they recorded him reading two letters of apology, one for soliciting prostitution, and the other for betraying the motherland.

Officials in the semi-autonomous Chinese city have failed to halt the youth-led pro-democracy protests that have upended Hong Kong since June, resulting in more than 7,000 arrests. A survey commissioned by Reuters last month found 59 percent of Hong Kongers supported the protests, and more than a third of respondents had attended a demonstration.",JustBadNews,0
Outrage after Jeopardy! host rules Bethlehem not in Palestine,http://aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/jeopardy-episode-palestine-question-uproar-200111165110124.html,"Contestant on popular US quiz show was told she was wrong for identifying Jesus’s birthplace as Palestine.

Popular American game show Jeopardy! has been plunged into controversy after a contestant was told she had the wrong answer after identifying Jesus’s place of birth, the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem, as being in Palestine.

The incident took place in round one of the game broadcast on Friday, when contestant Katie Needle was given the clue: “Built in the 300s A.D., the Church of the Nativity”, under the category “Where’s that Church?”.

Needle, a retail supervisor from Brooklyn, responded it was in Palestine but was told her answer was wrong.

One of the other two contestants, Jack McGuire, then buzzed in with the reply “Israel”, which host Alex Trebek accepted as correct.

Apparently @Jeopardy had a question today on The Church of the Nativity and when the contestant answered “Palestine,” it was deemed incorrect and the next contestant said “Israel” and it was counted as correct. @Jeopardy please explain. — Deanna ديانا (@deannaothman) January 10, 2020

The Church of Nativity, a World Heritage Site, is located in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, which is internationally recognised as part of Palestine.

Israel occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 War, in a move the international community never recognised.

Christian pilgrims and tourists from across the globe visit Bethlehem throughout the year, especially for religious festivals such as Christmas.

Sony Pictures Television, producer of Jeopardy!, admitted the mistake and clarified that an uncorrected version of the game was broadcast due to a “human error in post-production”.

“We regret the error and we will make every effort to ensure this never happens again,” it said in a statement released on Monday.

Needle, who visited Bethlehem last year, on Friday wrote on Twitter: “Palestine should be free.”

‘Inexcusable’

The incident had been picked up by people on social media with many criticising the show’s producers and host, and demanding they apologise.

Unacceptable!! Bethlehem is in the Palestinian territories which Israel illegally occupies (Katie Needle got the correct answer & was robbed). @Jeopardy owes an apology for endorsing Israel's universally-condemned illegal takeover of Palestinian lands.pic.twitter.com/Ym99YziM4k — Omar Baddar (@OmarBaddar) January 11, 2020

Omar Ghraieb, a Palestinian writer based in Gaza, told Al Jazeera: “What happened is inexcusable. Jeopardy! should apologise and give a clear explanation. This shouldn’t just pass calmly and be forgotten.”

James Zogby of Zogby Analytics, who is also a US public opinion pollster, said the incident was “an insult to history, reality, the thousands of oppressed Palestinians of Bethlehem”.

This is outrageous. If “Israel” had been the answer, it would have been bad enough. But the fact that she gave “Palestine” as the thought answer and was told it was wrong makes this an outrage & an insult to history, reality, the thousands of oppressed Palestinians of Bethlehem — James J. Zogby (@jjz1600) January 11, 2020

Zogby recently wrote: “Suffering under Israeli military occupation since 1967, Bethlehem has slowly been strangled. It has lost most of its land to settlement construction. It is hemmed in by a 30-foot-high concrete wall, stripped of its resources, and denied access to external markets.”

The United Nations says Israeli settlements in Bethlehem and other parts of the West Bank are illegal, and has called them a “flagrant violation” of international law.

‘Ahistorical propaganda’

Imraan Siddiqi, executive director of Council of American Islamic Relations Arizona chapter, said the incident highlights how pervasive the erasure of Palestinian history is.

“This just shows how normalised the occupation and cleansing of the Palestinian people from the historical record has become,” he told Al Jazeera.

Tamara Nassar, associate editor at Electronic Intifada, told Al Jazeera the Jeopardy! incident contributes to the “settler-colonial ideal of erasing Palestinians from their own cultural and religious sites – both in consciousness and in physical fact”.

“While the audience is fed ahistorical propaganda, Israel often bars Palestinian Christians from Gaza from worshipping at Bethlehem’s Church of the Nativity,” Nassar added.

Christians in Gaza who plan to travel to the West Bank for Christmas or Easter have to apply for a temporary single-use permit to Israel from its Coordinator of the Government Activities in the Territories, which often arbitrarily denies many seeking the permit.

“Perhaps nothing resembles this engineered absence from the American public imagination more poetically than the way contestants are bound to form their responses as questions: What is Palestine?” Nassar said.",JustBadNews,0
Australia is burning. The Arctic is melting. Yet Trump keeps gutting climate change regulations.,http://cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/trump-climate-change-environmental-policy-rollbacks/index.html,"(CNN) Editor's Note: A version of this story first published in September 2019. The story has been updated with additional administration actions.

An impeachment trial looms and a major Middle East crisis is unfolding with Iran.

Still, the Trump administration has remained steadfast in pursuit of one of its signature policy goals : the gutting of environmental regulations, which include those aimed at curbing climate change.

The world is already feeling the dangerous impacts of climate change, and has been for some time.

A massive cloud of smoke rises from wildfires burning in East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia.

For years now, the world's top climate scientists have warned that waiting any longer to drastically cut global emissions of planet-warming gases risks exposing millions more to the worst consequences of the climate crisis -- more frequent droughts, wildfires and even food shortages

""He is locking in permanent, irreversible damage to our environment through his irresponsible environmental policies, including his efforts to block progress on climate change,"" said Dr. Michael E. Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University and the director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, said of Trump policies. ""Once we go beyond key tipping points -- the melting of the major ice sheets -- there is no going back.""

Here's a look at some of the most consequential climate policy rollbacks:

Overhauling a landmark law requiring environmental assessments

The changes announced to how the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act is enforced would apply to projects like pipelines, highways and mines, which had been required to undergo in-depth environmental impact assessments.

Miles of pipe for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline sit in a lot in October 2014.

According to The New York Times, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt called the changes the administration's most impactful deregulatory move yet

The proposed changes have outraged many environmental groups, and are all but guaranteed to face legal challenges.

Weakening fuel economy standards

If the proposed change goes into effect, it could have profound consequences for the planet: Transportation emits more greenhouse gases than any other sector of the US economy, according to the Environmental Protection Agency

Replacing the Clean Power Plan

In a boost to electrical utilities and the struggling coal industry, Trump's move to replace Obama's Clean Power Plan could have serious consequences for the health of humans and the planet.

The Clean Power Plan placed flexible limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and, according to analysis by Obama's EPA, would have reduced CO2 emissions from power generators by 32% compared with 2005 levels by 2030.

A coal plant near Baltimore spews emissions.

Trump's replacement for the Clean Power Plan is called the Affordable Clean Energy rule and allows states to set their own emissions standards for coal-fueled power plants. Last year, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler touted the plan, saying it gives power companies ""the regulatory certainty they need to continue to reduce emissions and provide affordable and reliable energy for all Americans.""

But the new rule could cost American lives. By EPA's own analysis, Trump's rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than under the Clean Power Plan. Many states and cities are also suing to block the new regulations from going into effect.

Opening public lands and waters offshore to oil and gas drilling

Many scientists warn that keeping fossil fuels in the ground is critical to tackling the climate crisis. But the Trump administration has moved the US in the opposite direction, opening vast stretches of land and water offshore to oil and gas drilling.

In 2017, the administration shrank two of Utah's national monuments -- Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument and Bear's Ears -- by 51% and 85%, respectively. The moves took land areas spanning twice the size of Rhode Island out of protected status and were part of the largest reduction of public lands in US history , according to a study published in the journal Science. The changes open the areas removed from the national monuments to oil and gas development, but both decisions face challenges in court.

The vast wilderness of the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is seen from a plane.

""The pipeline projects potentially lock in long-term extraction of natural gas and petroleum, and therefore have a very long legacy that will extend beyond the next administration,"" Mann said.

Pulling out of the Paris climate agreement

The decision sent a message to the rest of the world that the US -- which can't officially leave the agreement until the day after this year's presidential election -- would not be leading the global fight against climate change. And studies have shown the decision has had global implications: A report last year found that Trump's decision has made it easier for other countries to renege on their climate commitments

Loosening restrictions on methane emissions

Delaying ratification of a treaty on hydrofluorocarbons

The treaty is called the Kigali Amendment, and it deals with a little-known but highly potent class of greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) , which are used in refrigerators and air conditioners. The gases are sometimes called ""super greenhouse gases"" because of their capacity to trap huge amounts of heat in the atmosphere; they have more than 1,000 times greater warming potential than carbon dioxide",JustBadNews,0

The whole thing sounds creepy.,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/12/tic-tac-ufo-video-q-and-a-with-navy-pilot-chad-underwood.html,"Photo: Chad Underwood

In the 15 years since Chad Underwood recorded a bizarre and erratic UFO — now called “the Tic Tac,” a name Underwood himself came up with — from the infrared camera on the left wing of his F/A-18 Super Hornet, he’s become a flight instructor, a civilian employee in the aerospace industry, and a father. But he has not yet spoken publicly about what he saw that day, even now, two years after his video made the front page of the New York Times. As he explained before speaking with Intelligencer, Underwood has mostly wanted to avoid having his name “attached to the ‘little green men’ crazies that are out there.”

The story of the Tic Tac begins around November 10, 2004, when radar operator Kevin Day first reported seeing odd and slow-moving objects flying in groups of five to ten off of San Clemente Island, west of the San Diego coast. At an elevation of 28,000 feet, moving at a speed of approximately 120 knots (about 138 miles per hour), the clusters were too high to be birds, too slow to be conventional aircraft, and were not traveling on any established flight path, at least according to Day.

In a military report made public by KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, another crew member with 17 years of experience on similar cruisers would later observe that the objects “exhibited ballistic-missile characteristics” as they zoomed from 60,000 feet to 50 feet above the Pacific Ocean, alarmingly without producing sonic booms. All told, radar operators with the Princeton spent about two weeks attempting to figure out what the objects were, a process that included having the ship’s radar system shut down and recalibrated to make sure that the mysterious radar returns were not not false positives, or “ghost tracks.”

Eventually, David Fravor, commanding officer of the Black Aces, made visual confirmation of one of the objects midair during a flight-training exercise. An hour later, Underwood made his infrared recording on a second flight. “That day,” Underwood recalls, “Dave Fravor was like, ‘Hey, dude. BOLO.’ Like, be on the lookout for just something weird. I can’t remember the exact terms that he used. I didn’t really think much about it at the time. But once I was able to acquire it on the radar and on the FLIR [forward-looking infrared camera], that’s kind of where things — I wouldn’t say ‘went sideways’ — but things were just different.”

Photo: Department of Defense/Department of Defense

The footage appears to depict what Fravor had identified as a 40-foot-long, white, oblong shape (hence “Tic Tac”), hovering somewhere between 15,000 and 24,000 feet in midair and exhibiting no notable exhaust from conventional propulsion sources, even as it makes a surprising dart leftward in the video’s final moments. Of the three UFO incidents captured by U.S. Navy airmen via infrared gun-camera pods, Underwood’s footage remains unique for its lack of cross talk between the pilots — a fact that has led to some speculation about its authenticity. But “there wasn’t anything on it that was protected,” Underwood’s retired former commanding officer Dave Fravor told Intelligencer. The missing audio, he says, “just didn’t make the copy that was taken from the storage drive.”

A former fighter pilot who served on the Nimitz in 2004, who spoke to Intelligencer on condition of anonymity, recalled an exhilarating group screening of the FLIR1 video inside the Nimitz’s Carrier Vehicle Intelligence Center (CVIC): “Debriefs were usually pro forma in the CVIC, but this one in particular was so odd,” the former pilot said. “There weren’t really a lot of skeptics in that room.” Years later, Fravor told ABC News that he didn’t know what the Tic Tac was, but that “it was really impressive, really fast, and I would like to fly it.” In the CVIC that day, the anonymous pilot told Intelligencer, “We all had that. We all wanted to fly it.”

Of the many people to have spotted or recorded the objects, a handful, like Fravor or Princeton’s (retired) Chief Master-at-Arms Sean Cahill, who reported seeing what appeared to be another grouping of the objects from the missile cruiser’s deck, have spoken to journalists or documentarians. Others have not: Lieutenant Colonel “Cheeks” Kurth, a Marine Hornet squadron commanding officer who was also asked to intercept the Tic Tac, still has not done an on-the-record interview. (Three years after the sighting, however, Kurth did take a job as a program manager at Bigelow Advanced Aerospace Space Studies in Las Vegas, whose owner Robert Bigelow has been a well-known private funder of UFO and paranormal research for decades. It was during this same period that Bigelow became a military contractor working on the Pentagon’s once-secret UFO investigation program, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.)

Underwood now joins Fravor, Cahill, and others, in speaking about his experience with the Tic Tac. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

What did you think of Dave Fravor’s appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience?

I’m glad Dave went on Joe’s show. He nailed every detail. At the time of the incident, he was essentially my boss, my commanding officer. I was just a pilot in his squadron. Are you familiar at all with how aircraft-carrier air operations work?

Probably not.

So, usually, we fly for about an hour, hour and a half, and then land. Then there’s the next wave of folks that take off and do their mission, blah, blah, blah. That day, Dave Fravor was landing at the same time I was getting my gear on, and we crossed paths just after he’d seen it. I really don’t want to get into what Dave saw, specifically, because I didn’t see it with my own eyeballs. But I told him, “The Princeton” — again, which has got a really good sophisticated radar — “is reporting that there’s an object out there that they wanted us to see if we could find and, if we’re able, track.”

So, we go out to where our designated training area is. We’re not necessarily looking for something, but the Princeton had a specific object that they wanted us to hunt, for lack of a better word. And all of a sudden, I got this blip on my radar.

The “Tic Tac.”

The term “Tic Tac,” I actually coined that. So, any time you heard the term, “It looked like a ‘Tic Tac’ out there in the sky,” I was the one that kind of coined that.

Was that named based on what you saw with your own eyes, or from looking at the screen on the camera?

No. I was more concentrated on looking at the FLIR. It was inside of 20 miles. You’re not going to see it with your own eyes until probably 10 miles, and then you’re not going to be able to visually track it until you’re probably inside of five miles, which is where Dave Fravor said that he saw it. So, at that point I didn’t see anything with my eyeballs. I was more concerned with tracking it, making sure that the videotape was on so that I could bring something back to the ship, so that the intel folks could dissect whatever it is that I captured.

The thing that stood out to me the most was how erratic it was behaving. And what I mean by “erratic” is that its changes in altitude, air speed, and aspect were just unlike things that I’ve ever encountered before flying against other air targets. It was just behaving in ways that aren’t physically normal. That’s what caught my eye. Because, aircraft, whether they’re manned or unmanned, still have to obey the laws of physics. They have to have some source of lift, some source of propulsion. The Tic Tac was not doing that. It was going from like 50,000 feet to, you know, a hundred feet in like seconds, which is not possible.

And it was doing that during your engagement too?

Yes. That was the thing that was the most interesting to me: how erratic this thing was. If it was obeying physics like a normal object that you would encounter in the sky — an aircraft, or a cruise missile, or some sort of special project that the government didn’t tell you about — that would have made more sense to me. The part that drew our attention was how it wasn’t behaving within the normal laws of physics. You’re up there flying, like, “Okay. It’s not behaving in a manner that’s predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move.”

From looking at the video at the time and more recently, do you get a sense as to how much heat this thing was giving off?

Well, normally, you would see engines emitting a heat plume. This object was not doing that. The video shows a source of heat, but the normal signatures of an exhaust plume were not there. There was no sign of propulsion. You could not see the thing that the ATFLIR pod should pick up 100 percent of the time: the source of heat and exhaust that a normal object flying would give you. Does that make sense?

Yeah, it does.

Like, no method of propulsion or exhaust — and the exhaust part of it was the thing that kind of made me raise my eyebrows and be like, “Okay, this is interesting.”

Were you approaching the Tic Tac head-on? Some people have suggested that the Tic Tac’s rapid leftward movement toward the end of the video was actually the result of your F/A-18 banking to the right and dragging the camera along with it.

We were pointed nose-on to it. Maybe 10 to 20 degrees of azimuth, either left or right.

Ergo, when the object kind of darts away to the left—

I was not aggressively maneuvering the aircraft in the manner that would make the FLIR pod would do that. But look: At that point, I did not actually see the object aggressively accelerate to the left, as the video shows, to actually prove that.

Because you were at a distance where you couldn’t make visual contact with your own eyes—

Right.

And so what’s happening in the video is a little ambiguous as a result.

Right. Yeah. And that part kind of sucks, because I can’t confirm that the object aggressively accelerated that way. But I have my feelings, based off of my experience with my equipment — and also just logic, when it comes to, you know, physics.

I want to ask you some questions based on theories that America’s armchair skeptics have put forward — like whether it was birds, or whether it was some sort of thermal weather event. I mean, I’m sure you have had enough flight time that you’ve seen birds.

Yup. Birds normally fly close to the surface of the ground. So, for example, you’re not going to see birds flying at 5,000 feet. You’re going to see them more down at like 2,000 feet and below, like down to the surface. That’s just kind of how birds normally operate. And they’re typically not alone. So you can you can physically see them, in a flock or whatever. You don’t see birds at 5,000 or 10,000 or 20,000 feet. That’s just not how birds operate. So birds are out of the question.

And just so that I anticipate your next question: There are weather balloons that people launch, but this was not a weather balloon — because a balloon, it just ascends and floats from low to high altitude; it doesn’t behave erratically. I mean, it’s just a damn balloon. So that was out of the question.

It wasn’t — to the best of my knowledge — a cruise missile or any other kind of test aircraft that we possibly may have not known about, just because of the way it was behaving. Like I said, it was just very erratic. It would go from like 50 feet off the ground, which when you’re out in the open ocean, you know, off the coast of San Diego, it looked like it was just hovering over the water. But there was no method of propulsion that was keeping it airborne: no wings, no heat, keeping it airborne or aloft.

Have you ever seen a weather event on an ATFLIR?

I would say if I captured this object on my sensors independently, like I was the only one that saw it or tracked it, I might have blown it off as something like a weather event. But the amount of people and sensors from other independent sources who found it — given the time period Dave Fravor saw it, and an hour and a half later I went out and saw it, and we captured basically an object with the same description — leads me to believe that a weather event would be unlikely.

Did it surprise you or provide any kind of relief seeing the Navy officially declare the Tic Tac video genuine and a genuine UAP when that happened in the Washington Post last September?

No, not surprised. Validation for sure.

This might be a good time to talk about what the mood was on the Nimitz after all of this.

Once I landed, I saw one of my buddies from my sister squadron. He said, “Hey, did you see something out there too?,” in a very jokey manner. And I was like, “Actually, MFer, because I know you want to make fun of me, I got it here on video.” Although, I didn’t say “MFer.” I said the actual term. He’s a good friend of mine, so it was in jest. We pop the tapes into the playback machine. I’m like, “Here, this is where it is.” Those little video cuts — that you see of my FLIR recording — were taken there at the intelligence center. What they do with it from there, I don’t have a whole lot to deal with.

When I was still in my flight gear, so probably within about 20 minutes or so, I spoke to someone that I assume was from NORAD. I described it exactly as I just told you. I didn’t get debriefed. The interesting thing was, normally, if you see something out in the middle of the ocean that’s a test project, we would get debriefed on it, one-on-one, in a dark room. Whether it’s from the folks at Edwards test site or something like that. “Hey, yes, we were testing a project. This is what you saw.” Without going into great detail, it will be like, “Yes. This is project ‘Umptysquat’” and, basically, “This is what you saw. Don’t talk about it.” That never happened, which leads me to think that it was not a government project.

Or, at least, not one—

Not one that they wanted to give any acknowledgment of. And, you know, I’ve got top-secret clearance with a ton of special-project clearances. So, it’s not like I wasn’t cleared to know. But, as I’m sure you’ve found in your research, to have clearance to know something, you have to have both the clearance that it’s elevated to and you have to have the “need to know” it. And, clearly, whatever it was, if it was a government project, I did not need to know.

Yeah. Understood. Here’s something I’m curious about, because of this NORAD aspect: Did it come up that this telephone debriefing was maybe involved with something called an Operations Event Incident Report or NORAD’s OPREP-3 reporting system?

Honestly, Matt, I have no idea. Like like what level up to who I was talking to. I just wanted to answer them. I was just basically handed a telephone and said, “Hey. Answer these questions.”

Fair enough. So, Between talking to the NORAD guy and Fravor going public, there’s a several-year period where this is just like a thing that happened in your life. Did it come up very often at all?

There would be associations. I would be sitting at lunch five years later with some of my colleagues. Rumors tend to have legs. “Hey, you were out on the Nimitz in ’04. Someone told me about some alien spacecraft.” And I’m like, “Well, (1) the video that you see is my video. And no, I’ve never said that this is what I think it was or speculate as to what I think it was. That’s not my job. But I saw something. And it was also seen, via eyeballs, by both my commanding officer, Dave Fravor, and the Marine Corps Hornet squadron commanding officer who was out there as well.

When did you find out Fravor was going to go public? Did a lot of people approach you during that reporting or afterward?

It’s funny, seeing your boss’s name and face on the news, given what he was putting out there. You know, obviously, our encounter happened in 2004 — so a while back — but everything that Dave has put out there in the interviews is absolutely, 100 percent, exactly what happened on that day. And we’re still good friends to this day, so I started texting him. We had about a two-hour-long phone call and I’d be like, “Dude. Like what made this pop up?” Like, “Where was this like, you know, 12, 14 years ago?” Now it’s 15 years ago. And, I guess, that was when the Pentagon released — whatever project they called it. I can’t even remember it.

AATIP.

Yeah. AATIP.

Did the New York Times reach out to you? Ask for background just to confirm anything?

No.

Interesting.

Not that I really care. At no point did I want to speculate as to what I thought this thing was — or be associated with, you know, “alien beings” and “alien aircraft” and all that stuff. I’m like, “No. I do not want to be part of that community.” It is just what we call a UFO. I couldn’t identify it. It was flying. And it was an object. It’s as simple as that.

Yeah.

I’ll let the nerds, like, do the math on what it was likely to be. I just happened to be the person that brought back the video.

This story originally identified the man who quoted in the military’s report as reporting that the objects “exhibited ballistic-missile characteristics” as Kevin Day. The identity of this man has not yet been publicly reported. We regret the error.

Hong Kong police freezes HK$70M (US$9M) fund which raises money for protesters in difficulties for 'money laundering',http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1498589-20191219.htm?spTabChangeable=0,"HK$70mn protest fund frozen over 'money laundering'

Acting senior superintendent Chan Wai-kei says police think the fund could have been used to reward teenagers for joining the city's protest movement. Photo: RTHK

Jimmy Choi reports

Police on Thursday said they had arrested four people on suspicion of money laundering, freezing HK$70 million in donations that the force claimed could have been spent on paying youngsters to join the city's anti-government protests.



Those arrested, aged between 17 and 50, were members of Spark Alliance HK, which has been raising money to support protesters who get into difficulties.



The group said the donations would go towards paying legal and medical fees, as well as food for protesters.



But acting senior superintendent Chan Wai-kei said police had found some ""pretty suspicious"" financial activity linked to the group.



""Our police action today was based on suspicious financial transactions conducted by a shell company. In the past six months, we found there were large cash deposits. Pretty suspicious deposits into this shell company which were incommensurate with its business nature,"" Chan said.



""Furthermore we found that a large amount of money has been used to purchase personal insurance products of which an individual was the beneficiary. Again, it is incommensurate with his personal income.""



Chan said that during their operation, the police confiscated HK$130,000 in cash and found receipts for supermarket coupons worth HK$165,000.



""We seized receipts mentioning that 3,300 coupons had been purchased. We also seized some arrows, some weapons. We do not exclude the possibility that the fund was used as a reward to encourage teenagers to come out and join in the civil unrest,"" he said.



Last month, local media reported that HSBC was to close a corporate account the group was using to collect the donations, because its activities did not match the business purposes stated by the client.",JustBadNews,0
House impeaches Trump for abuse of power,http://thehill.com/homenews/house/475217-house-impeaches-trump-for-abuse-of-power,"Editor's note: House Democrats have also passed a second article of impeachment against President Trump Donald John TrumpHillary Clinton responds to Chrissy Teigen tweet: 'I love you back' Police called after Florida moms refuse to wear face masks at school board meeting about mask policy Supreme Court rejects Trump effort to shorten North Carolina mail-ballot deadline MORE, accusing him of obstructing Congress. Click here to read the updated story.

House Democrats on Wednesday impeached President Trump for abusing his power, the first of two impeachment articles the lower chamber is poised to adopt in historic votes alleging the president is unfit for office.

Lawmakers voted 230-197 to impeach Trump for abusing his power, with two Democrats, Reps.

Republicans, meanwhile, remained unified in their defense of the president, describing the impeachment inquiry as a purely partisan pursuit spearheaded by Democrats still embittered by the results of the 2016 election.

The House is poised to soon take up a second article of impeachment charging Trump with obstruction of Congress, which is also expected to pass easily in a similar party-line vote. Aside from Peterson and Van Drew, Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) has also said he’ll oppose the obstruction charge despite supporting the abuse-of-power article.

The historic vote makes Trump just the third president to be impeached in the nation’s history — and the first to suffer that indignity in his first term.

The vote marked the culmination of the Democrats’ months-long investigation into Trump’s handling of foreign policy in Kyiv, triggered in September by a government whistleblower's allegation that the president had abused his powers in withholding military aid and the promise of a White House meeting to press Ukrainian leaders to launch anti-corruption investigations that might have helped his reelection in 2020.

“If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty,” Pelosi said.

“It is tragic that the president’s reckless actions make impeachment necessary,” she added. “He gave us no choice.”

Republicans countered with equal vigor, defending their White House ally with accusations that Democrats had orchestrated a discriminatory process that exaggerated the gathered evidence and denied Trump a fair defense.

(Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images)

Hong Kong Police Caught on Video Torturing and Humiliating Detained Protesters

Shortly after police arrested more than 1,000 protesters at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the nearby area, netizens posted videos and photos online, showing that police abused protesters inhumanely as if they were “war criminals.”

Many local residents were among the arrested for trying to rescue the students trapped in the university campus.

The detained protesters also suffered inhumane humiliation, such as being forced to strip naked in front of others, as revealed in a court trial.

Physical Abuses and Intimidation During Detention

In one of the videos released by police to tout their victory, a group of protesters had their arms tied back and were ordered to lie down on their stomachs, with their faces touching the ground. A netizen explained that the location was on top of a flat roof of a big building at Tsim Sha Tsui.

Another photo taken at Yau Ma Tei showed that the police ordered the detained protesters to kneel down facing a wall, each one had their hands tied behind their backs. According to various reports by local media, police arrested nearly 70 people in Yau Ma Tei. They were forced to remain kneeling on the ground for about an hour. Moreover, medical staff of the Polytechnic University who worked as first-aid volunteers were also taken away by the police, and were mistreated in the same manner as the protesters.

Many netizens posted comments to express their anger at the police, saying these pictures and videos look like “wartime scenes” and protesters were treated as “war criminals.”

Some medical volunteers were forced to leave PolyU. One female volunteer described the situation to the media.

She said that during the chaos on campus, a student protester broke his wrist after someone stomped on it. Medical staff on the site immediately tried to provide treatment for him, but riot police chased them away by pepper spray.

She felt very bad for the injured people, and tears kept rolling down her face as she spoke.

A Hong Kong resident with a Canadian citizenship shared his experience on Twitter about being detained, saying that an undercover police arrested him and took him to Yau Tsim Mong Police Station.

“The police beat me, and then forced me to sit on a chair. They pointed a very bright flashlight at my eyes as a means of torture,” he wrote.

During the detention, he was given a sandwich filled with spicy mustard or a rice ball covered with dust at meal time. The police forced him to swallow the food and would not allow him to drink water.

“We were detained in a basement. We were blindfolded, with our hands tied behind our backs. Police fired unloaded guns as if they were simulating executions. Inside the interrogation room, we saw body bags that police placed there to threaten us. That is the behavior of Hong Kong police under the communist rule,” he wrote, adding that because he has a British National Overseas passport and Canadian citizenship, the torture he suffered was much less severe compared to the other protesters.

Inhumane Humiliation

On Nov. 18, the second day of Polytechnic University under siege, police arrested 60 people on the charge of “rioting.” Eight of them, aged from 19 to 25, were seriously injured during the detention and were later sent to hospitals. They were prosecuted at Kowloon City court on Nov. 21, but their attorney took the opportunity to expose how they were tortured and humiliated during the court hearing, according to Hong Kong-based Stand News.

According to the attorney, one of the eight protesters sustained injuries on his left shoulder when a policeman hit him twice with a baton. The injured protester requested the police to send him to a hospital multiple times, but police delayed his treatment until 18 hours later. At the hospital, he was found to have fractured bones on his left shoulder. The attorney also revealed that police verbally abused the protester at the police department, calling him “roach” and saying, “Trash of the new era, you must plead guilty.” Furthermore, the police forced him to take off all his clothes, including his underwear, in front of an air-conditioner vent, and ordered him to perform embarrassing movements which made him feel uncomfortable.

Another defendant’s face got injured on the right side and was covered with gauze. His eyes were red and seriously swollen. He said police slammed his head harshly even though he made no attempt to resist the beatings and blows.

The third defendant said police struck his head from the back and also hit his thighs with strong force. When he was sent to the hospital, he had to get his head stitched up.

The fourth defendant sustained injuries on his left eye as a result of police deliberately punching his eye.

The attorney also pointed out that one of accusations against the eight protesters was “possessing dangerous items,” but none of them were found to carry any of these items. “I suspected that it was a groundless charge,” he said.",JustBadNews,0
23 dead as violent unrest in Chile enters fifth week,http://thehindu.com/news/international/23-dead-as-violent-unrest-in-chile-enters-fifth-week/article30058561.ece,"Furious Chileans have since October 18 been protesting social and economic inequality, and against an entrenched political elite that comes from a small number of the wealthiest families in the country, among other issues.

The death toll from violent unrest in Chile rose to 23 on Friday as the country entered its fifth week of social unrest.

Looting and demonstrations took place in cities across the South American nation, and an agreement on a political roadmap that will see Chile draft a new constitution has halted neither the anger, nor the bloodshed.

Furious Chileans have since October 18 been protesting social and economic inequality, and against an entrenched political elite that comes from a small number of the wealthiest families in the country, among other issues.

The crisis is the worst in three decades of Chilean democracy and has led to around 2,000 injuries, including some 280 people who suffered eye damage from shotgun pellets.

The latest death was a 13-year-old boy who an interior ministry official said was run over by a van during protests in Arica, about 1,300 miles (2,100 km) north of the capital Santiago.

Thousands of people gathered again on Friday in Plaza Italia, the center of the demonstrations in Santiago and the site of weekly rallies that have seen massive turnout since the social upheaval broke out.

""We cannot ease up. We have to keep expressing ourselves because we have not achieved anything, because the repression continues and also (the government) keeps signing fake agreements, like the peace deal,"" Claudia Ortolani, a young protester, told AFP.

Nearby, hooded men were squaring off against police, who broke up the crowd with tear gas and water cannons.

Meanwhile, about a hundred people protested outside the Costanera Center, the largest mall in South America, as around twenty riot police guarded the entrance to the building.

Violence rages

While protests earlier in the week not been huge, the outbursts of violence multiplied in the capital's metro area on Thursday and Friday.

The anger in the streets had eased after last week's agreement by Congress to draft a new Constitution.

But with people back on the streets in force again, President Sebastian Pinera's government again appealed for calm.

Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel issued a ""deep and sincere call to all political forces"" to end the unrest.

But in Quilicura, north of Santiago, a shopping center was set on fire and looted by a crowd while in Puente Alto, another working-class area, a gas station, a police headquarters and businesses were attacked.

In the northern city of Antofagasta, a motorist injured five people when he ran down protesters, while a supermarket was ransacked.

Looting, barricades and fires were also recorded in the port of Valparaiso and the city of Vina del Mar, and in Concepcion in the south.

""This situation ... affects our offer to take charge,"" said police general Enrique Basseletti, after complaints from people irate that they had not seen police on their streets.

Blumel said that 2,500 trainee police officers would be put on the streets early to bolster the force.

On Thursday, authorities arrested 700 people in the unrest. That followed the police decision to suspend the use of birdshot against protesters, following an outcry over eye injury victims.",JustBadNews,0
Grace Millane's killer Jesse Kempson lied to women to get sex,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7714279/Grace-Millanes-killer-Jesse-Kempson-tissue-lies-fuel-sex-obsession.html,"Advertisement

Grace Millane's killer Jesse Kempson is described as an 'oddball' by former friends

Grace Millane's killer was a serial fantasist who made up a tissue of lies to feed his obsession of having violent sex with young women, Mail Online can reveal.

Jesse Kempson told would-be sexual partners that he had cancer, his parents were dead and his cousin was an All Black rugby star in bizarre attempts to seduce them.

But in reality the 'creepy' 27-year-old was just a failed salesman who was sacked shortly before he murdered Ms Millane - a former student from Wickford, Essex, on a gap year - in an Auckland hotel room after a Tinder date last December.

Described by teammates on the amateur softball side he played for as an 'oddball' and 'loner', the good-looking sportsman said he has a law degree and was a successful businessman.

Indeed Kempson's family describe him as a 'complex character' who had fallen out with his father two years ago and doesn't speak to most of his other relatives.

His grandmother says that he was 'a very confused young man' and paints a picture of his chaotic life after his parents split up.

His grandfather said that he 'loved his sport' but in more recent times he'd been 'at a bit of a loose end'.

'He was a nice kid but he sort of fell out with everybody, which is what happens with broken up marriages,' he said.

He added that the killer, who had a child with a woman in Australia, was estranged from his father because of 'a difference in opinion on life'.

A former teammate told Mail Online: 'He was creepy towards girls. His life revolved around girls, taking to girls.

Ms Millane, from Wickford, in Essex, the daughter of a builder, was murdered in a New Zealand hotel room last December by a man she had met just a few hours before

Kempson - a salesman who was sacked from his job on the day he began talking to her on Tinder - was found guilty of murdering her today in Auckland after a three-week trial

Ms Millane's father David touches his eye outside at Auckland High Court after the jury retired to consider their verdicts - then came back five hours later to find his daughter's killer guilty

'He was always trying to get with younger girls... he was very quiet around the boys.'

The source said that he and some other men had intervened once when he tried to spark a relationship with a woman, warning her off spending time with him.

Because he made up so many lies, it's difficult to unpick the truth about his life.





What is known is that Kempson was born in 1992 and grew up around Wellington on New Zealand's north island.





His parents relationship did not last and they separated when he was nine. His mother moved overseas and has little contact with her son since.





His father continued to raise him and when he met a new girlfriend, who had her own children, they merged their families together.





While living with his father and stepmother Kempson worked as a barman and a building labourer, before moving to Australia in 2013.





He left the family home because of arguments about him lying and allegedly stealing from relatives. He was apparently given an ultimatum; get help or get out and choose to leave for Australia where he met the mother of his young child.





When he separated from the mother, Kempson moved back to New Zealand and found himself working as a salesman in Auckland.





Just weeks before he strangled Ms Millane to death, he posted what seemed to be a soul-searching confession to deep personal flaws on Facebook.





Ms Millane (pictured), the daughter of an Essex-based builder, was on a round-the-world trip when she died on the eve of her 22nd birthday last December

Harrowing CCTV shows smiling Grace entering the hotel holding the hand of her killer Kempson where he would take her life in his apartment

'I just want anyone who I've hurt, let down, to know I'm truly sorry from my heart,' wrote the then-26-year-old as he owned up to 'arrogance and selfishness' that had damaged his close relationships.

'But with that being said,' he wrote, 'we can change how we treat each other and over time I've learnt how much compassion we all have as people.

'When we grow up, we make mistakes. That's how we improve.'

Online, at least, his efforts to turn his life around appeared convincing.

But in real life, he was on the brink, compulsively turning to Tinder and weaving fantastic tales of wealth and success to lure girls to motels or his £190-a-week studio apartment in an inner city hotel.

They headed into the Bluestone Room where the accused had earlier been drinking beer alone. They kiss 9.41pm: CCTV shows the couple entering the hotel where the killer was living. They enter the lift and head to the killer's apartment. In the hours that followed she was brutally murdered, possibly in the early hours of December 2, her birthday. Advertisement

Kempson had moved there after a fallout with female housemates, increasingly concerned about his mood swings, attempted womanising and threatening behaviour.

He boasted of being a businessman and of plans to buy a glamorous restaurant on Auckland's waterfront.

It was all lies, and, in fact, what was not revealed in court was that he had been sacked from his job as a salesman the very day he and Grace began messaging each other on Tinder; Friday, November 30.

The reasons remain unknown, but may well have affected the killer's frame of mind the next day when he set out to meet Grace with a hug beside the Christmas tree at the SkyCity casino.

Disturbingly, just 11 minutes before she was last seen alive, the killer again used social media to call his date 'beautiful' and 'radiant'.

He was then seen on CCTV rooting through her handbag while she went to the toilet as they drank cocktails together on the date.

Certainly, there was no compassion for the young graduate as he squeezed the life out of her during sex, took appalling pictures of her body, watched horrific porn and crammed her into a suitcase which he buried in the woods.

Kempson used the three-week murder trial to tell poisonous lies about Grace dying accidentally during rough sex he falsely claimed she had enjoyed and even encouraged because she was a fan of the 50 Shades of Grey films.

In fact he had choked her to death for his own sexual pleasure on the eve of her 22nd birthday on December 2, watched porn afterwards and stuffed her body in a suitcase.

The pervert even left Grace in his blood-soaked room to go on another date before he decided to bury her in a muddy hole a New Zealand forest. He will be sentenced in February.

Last night, his own stepbrother said the family were divided over the verdict and he doubted whether the powerfully built man set out to kill.

Ms Millane's killer played for an amateur softball team in Auckland. He told would-be sexual partners that his cousin was a rugby star for the All Blacks and that he was suffering cancer

Friends of the 'oddball', seen on CCTV with Ms Millane going back to his hotel room, say he had an obsession with having violent sex with young women and pursued them on social media

Family of the killer, seen here taking a suitcase containing her body out of the hotel in a lift, say he was a 'complicated young man' who lived with his grandparents when his parents split

'It's in the moment,' he told TVNZ. 'He had the opportunity and he kept going and he took Grace's life. I don't think it was a violence thing, to me I think it was power. It was in a split moment he enjoyed the power and kept going.

But the man unequivocally condemned his stepbrother as a 'pathological liar that lies over pointless things and continues to lie until the point where he has got no out, absolutely no out, and then he just breaks down and cries and runs away.

'But he can't do that any more thankfully. It's just absolutely terrible that a life had to be lost because of that.'

The killer's tears in a police interview in which he lied over and over again about how Grace had died were 'more tears for himself.'

And the family, he said, wanted Grace's loved ones to know how deeply they felt for them. 'I'm just so incredibly sorry for their loss, to know it's one of our family members, even though it's not our actions, it's very difficult and I can't imagine the pain and hurt and what they have had to go through in court to hear all the stuff about BDSM and all the actions (the killer) took.

'It's all because he does not have any shred of a decent human being inside of him and could not just confess to the fact that he murdered her.'

Meanwhile Ms Millane's parents David and Gill, who had flown 11,000 miles from their home in Essex to watch Kempson be convicted of their daughter's murder.

Mr Millane, who runs a building company with his two sons in the UK, sobbed as he hit out at the man who 'ripped their lives apart' when he throttled her to death.

Held by his wife, the father broke down on the steps of Auckland High Court as he paid tribute to his 'beautiful, talented, loving daughter'.

'Grace was a beautiful, talented, loving daughter. Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever,' he said.

'She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way. Grace was taken away from us in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives and family have been ripped apart. This will be with us for the rest of our lives'.

He added: 'The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace. It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year'.

Grace's parents sat through the entire three-week trial where their daughter's killer told lie after lie, which the jury saw through

Mr Millane thanked the police and prosecutors, who he said had 'never flinched away from the more intimate details of the case' and were 'compassionate and thoughtful' to the family.

'Last but not least we would like to thank the people of New Zealand.

'They have opened their hearts to Grace and our family. I cannot express our gratitude enough for all the offers of gifts and kindness that we have received over the last year.

'Finally, we must return home to try and pick up the pieces of our lives day-to-day without our beloved Grace. Thank you.'

The guilty verdict brought to an end an 11-month saga of pain for the close-knit family, who waved goodbye to their daughter in October last year as she set out on a world tour after graduating from Lincoln University.

After spending time in Peru, she arrived in New Zealand in mid-November and arranged her fateful Tinder for the night of December 1, planning to celebrate her 22nd birthday the next day.

She greeted her killer with a hug, standing beside a Christmas tree in the courtyard of the SkyCity casino. They toured several bars, drinking cocktails and, as she told one of her best friends in a text message, she was clearly impressed.

'I click with him so well,' she wrote to her friend Ameena Ashcroft. 'I will let you know what happens tomorrow.'

By the morning, however, she was lying dead in the third-floor apartment at the CityLife hotel in central where Kempson lived.

According to Kempson, she had been strangled during sex and the killer had taken a series of intimate photographs of her naked body before watching hardcore pornography through the early hours.

The man began her 22nd birthday, by buying a suitcase to transport her body to a shallow grave in remote bushland.

But even before he did so, he was arranging another Tinder date for that afternoon, in which he told a woman a bogus story about a supposed friend who had killed a woman during sex.

A video of the killer's (left) interview with police was played to jurors at Auckland High Court in New Zealand today. A photograph of Grace lay on the table in front of him

He was first snared by a message he left on Ms Millane's Facebook profile page the night before, as he waited to leave the Bluestone Room bar around the corner.

Contacted by police, he wove an elaborate web of lies, at first claiming he and his date had parted as friends, planning to meet the next day.

Trapped by CCTV showing him buying the suitcase, however, he changed his story, claiming his victim had told him she had learned BDSM sex games with a former boyfriend and had asked him to choke her during intercourse.

He said they had each taken photographs of each other's private parts on their cellphones and that after sex he had fallen asleep, drunk, under the shower without suspecting the gap-year student was in danger.

His lies were exposed by data recovered from his mobile phone which showed he had searched for 'Waitakere Ranges', the hills where he later buried Ms Millane, and 'hottest fire', minutes before taking the photos of her.

That, the verdict confirmed, was proof that, as Crown prosecutor Brian Dickey had told the jury, he had 'eroticised her death.'

'It's not safe sex play that killed Grace Millane, it's strangulation,' said Mr Dickey. 'At some point of which she lost consciousness and would have become limp and lifeless and he had to carry on.

'And if that's not reckless murder someone will have to explain to me what is.'

How marketing graduate Grace Millane's last act of kindness was to cut off her flowing locks and send them to a charity that makes wigs for sick children before she set off on year-long trip around the world

British backpacker Grace Millane was a young woman with the world at her feet.

She dedicated her spare time to helping charities close to her heart, and had saved her money to pay for a round-the-world trip after studying hard for three years and graduating from the University of Lincoln with a Bachelor's degree.

But she was killed on the eve of her 22nd birthday, by failed salesman and amateur softball player, Kempson.

Grace Emmie Rose Millane, from Wickford in Essex, had graduated with a degree in advertising and marketing, and waved goodbye to her family as she embarked on a world tour.

She was just six weeks into it when her life was cruelly cut short.

Before she travelled abroad, she cut off her long hair and donated it to the Little Princess Trust, which makes wigs for children who have lost their hair because of cancer.

As they laid her to rest, Ms Millane's family asked for any donations to be made to charities close to her heart - The Little Princess Trust, White Ribbon UK, Mutts in Distress and Smile Train.

Grace had spent six weeks in South America and Peru, arriving in New Zealand on 20 November 2018 and travelling around the upper North Island.

She arrived in Auckland on 30 November - two days before she was killed.

She had also been planning a second long-haul trip to Asia.

Grace's mother Gillian is recovering from a breast cancer operation, which stopped her from flying to New Zealand to join the search for her daughter's body. Grace posted this heartwrenching picture of her in September 2011, captioning it, 'Me and Mummy Millane'

Her father David, 60, said in an interview that he hoped his daughter's death would 'not deter even one person from venturing out into the world'

Grace's parents sat through the entire three-week trial where their daughter's killer told lie after lie, which the jury saw through

She leaves behind her mother and father Gillian and David, and big brothers Michael, 29, and Declan, 26.

Her family said the 'beautiful' 22-year-old had a 'passion to see the world' and even had a trip to the Far East planned.

Her mother Gillian is currently recovering from a breast cancer operation and was unable to join the hunt for their daughter's body in New Zealand because of the procedure.

Her father David, 60, said in an interview that he hoped his daughter's death would 'not deter even one person from venturing out into the world'.

Mr Millane added: 'We all fly the nest. Her death should not deter any man or woman from following their dreams.'

Mr Millane runs a family construction business with Miss Millane's brothers, Michael and Declan.

In an emotional tribute after her death, Grace's big brother Declan posted a heartfelt note to his sister, quoting the words of a famous 1940 song by Jimmie Davis.

'You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.'

Grace Emmie Rose Millane, from Wickford in Essex, had a 'passion to see the world'

Speaking outside court, his voice breaking with emotion, David Millane broke down as he remembered Grace as a 'beautiful, loving, talented daughter'

In October, Grace's family and friends filled donated handbags with essential and luxury items and gave them to homeless women in refuges in a bid to help victims of domestic abuse.

Her cousin Hannah O'Callaghan said the family had wanted to do something in her name to 'give her a legacy'.

She said the idea started out when they saw a social media post about filling a handbag with items for homeless women.

Mrs O'Callaghan, 37, said: 'We thought it was a great idea and thought 'how could we do something similar in Grace's name?' It helps that Grace loved a handbag.'

More than 500 bags were donated to the campaign, called Love Grace x, exceeding the family's initial target of 50.

Mrs O'Callaghan said: 'It has been extremely difficult as a family and doing something like this is helping us get together, giving us something to focus on and it is helping others, which is all we can hope to achieve out of what we have been through.'

The appeal continues to be inundated with donations and there are four collection points for Love Grace x across Essex at Club Kingswood in Basildon, The Fox and Hounds Pub in Ramsden Heath, The Pyramid Centre in Thurrock and Hemming Too Stores in Ramsden Bellhouse.",JustBadNews,0
"Child murder, torture and sexual abuse by British troops covered up by government, report alleges",http://independent.co.uk/news/government-army-child-murder-sexual-abuse-british-troops-afghanistan-iraq-a9206056.html,"The government and army have been accused of covering up torture, sexual abuse and child killings by troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.

A year-long investigation by BBC Panorama​ and The Sunday Times is claimed to have uncovered evidence of murder by an SAS soldier, as well as deaths in custody, beatings, torture and sexual abuse of detainees by members of Scottish regiment the Black Watch.

A senior SAS commander was also referred to prosecutors for attempting to pervert the course of justice, according to leaked documents that had been kept secret by the government.

The investigation exposed new evidence from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British soldiers in Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which looked into war crimes in Afghanistan.

The government closed both inquiries in 2017 after Phil Shiner, a solicitor who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off from practising law amid allegations he had paid people in Iraq to find clients.

However, some former investigators said Mr Shiner’s actions were used as an excuse to shut down the inquiries.

No case investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor has led to a prosecution.

An IHAT detective told Panorama: “The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn’t wriggle their way out of it.”

Another former investigator described the alleged cover-up as “disgusting”, adding: “I feel for the families [of victims] because... they’re not getting justice. How can you hold your head up as a British person?”

An episode of the documentary series to be broadcast on BBC One on Monday night will allege dozens of innocent civilians died during kill or capture operations involving British special forces in Afghanistan.

On one night raid in Helmand that was looked at by Operation Northmoor, a special forces soldier killed four youngsters believed to be aged 20, 17, 14 and 12 in the guest room of a family home in Loy Bagh village.​

The soldier claimed he acted in self-defence but the victims’ families said all four had been sitting on the floor drinking tea when they were shot dead at close range. Photographs showed bullet holes in the mud wall of the guest house had hit about two feet off the ground, supporting the family’s version of events. Detectives believed the soldier should be charged with four counts of murder and referred the case to the Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA). They also wanted to prosecute the officer who commanded the raid for falsifying a report, along with his superior, for perverting the course of justice. Investigators believed some of the most senior officers in the UK’s special forces had covered up the killings, but military prosecutors decided not to bring charges. Panorama also uncovered new information about the killing of Iraqi detainees in 2003. IHAT detectives say they found evidence of widespread abuse at Camp Stephen, a British army base in Basra run by the Black Watch and used as an unofficial detention centre. One of the detectives told the programme the abuse of prisoners was “endemic” at the base, where two innocent civilians died within a week in May 2003 after allegedly being tortured. A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson told The Independent: “Allegations that the MoD interfered with investigations or prosecution decisions relating to the conduct of UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are untrue.

“Throughout the process the decisions of prosecutors and the investigators have been independent of the MoD and involved external oversight and legal advice.”

The MoD said cases were referred to the independent SPA as a result of investigations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

“Cases from Iraq were referred as a result of historic investigations. It is untrue to claim cases investigated under Operation Northmoor in Afghanistan were not acted upon. After careful investigation, overseen by a former chief constable, no Northmoor cases were referred to prosecutors,” the spokesperson added.

The MoD also said Service Police undertook extensive investigations into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the SPA decided not to prosecute any of the cases referred to it.

The spokesperson said: “Our military served with great courage and professionalism in Iraq and Afghanistan and we hold them to the highest standards. It is government policy that military operations are conducted in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict and where allegations are raised, they are investigated.

“The Sunday Times’ claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations.”",JustBadNews,0
"Hong Kong universities become 'battlefields' as citywide violence spreads | Police in HK battled pro-democracy protesters at several university campuses in sometimes savage clashes; Hundreds of masked protesters, many of them students, hurled back petrol bombs, rocks and bricks",http://reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests/hong-kong-universities-become-battlefields-as-citywide-violence-spreads-idUSKBN1XM00X?utm_source=reddit.com,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Police in Hong Kong battled pro-democracy protesters at several university campuses in sometimes savage clashes, as parts of the city were paralyzed including Hong Kong’s Central financial district that was tear-gassed for a second day running.

The flare-ups occurred a day after police shot an unarmed protester at close range and a man was doused with petrol and set on fire in some of the worst violence since the protests began nearly five months ago in the China-ruled city.

At the rural Chinese University near Tai Po, some of the fiercest fighting broke out at night as riot police stormed the campus where hundreds of protesters congregated, firing a barrage of tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.

Hundreds of masked protesters, many of them students, hurled back petrol bombs, rocks and bricks, some launched with catapults. After the clashes, dozens of the injured lay sprawled on the ground at a nearby sports pitch.

The chaotic night scenes of explosions, smoke plumes, yelling and sustained gunfire, which left scores of injured students sprawled on the ground, stoked a sense of dread among some who recalled the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown by Chinese troops on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.

“The fear among the students is so strong,” said Wing Long, a 25-year-old theology student. “That’s why we’ve gathered today to stop it from happening.”

The police, however, said protesters in the campus had thrown debris and petrol bombs onto a nearby highway linking the Northern New Territories with Kowloon, bringing traffic to a standstill in a haze of tear gas smoke.

The city’s 24 pro-democracy lawmakers condemned the police in a joint statement, saying the nonstop firing of tear gas had turned the campus into a “battlefield,” while urging the international community to speak out for Hong Kong’s youngsters to “prevent the recurrence of the tragedy of 1989.”

Medics on the scene told Reuters that at least 60 people were injured.

At City University, students in hard hats and gas masks had spent much of the day barricading the campus, making home-made shields, and stockpiled bricks and petrol bombs on bridges and other approaches.

They overran the campus and smashed up glass panels in the adjacent Festival Walk shopping mall and set fire to a giant Christmas tree.

CENTRAL PROTEST

Earlier in the day, more than 1,000 protesters, many wearing office clothes and face masks, rallied in Central for a second day during lunch hour, blocking roads below some of the city’s tallest skyscrapers and most expensive real estate.

After they had dispersed, police fired tear gas at the remaining protesters on old, narrow Pedder Street. Police made more than a dozen arrests, many pinned up on the pavement against the wall of luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co.

Police said masked “rioters” had committed “insane” acts, throwing trash, bicycles and other debris on to metro tracks and overhead power lines, paralyzing transport in the former British colony. TV footage showed activists dropping heavy objects from overpasses on to traffic below, just missing a motorcyclist.

“Our society has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown,” Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung told reporters.

The demonstrators have been protesting since June against what they believe to be meddling by Beijing in the freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place when the territory returned to China from British rule in 1997. Tough police tactics in response to the unrest have also fueled anger.

China denies interfering and has blamed Western countries including Britain and the United States for stirring up trouble.

Protests and road blockages ran late into the night in multiple districts including Mong Kok, Tin Shui Wai and Tai Po, where a truck was set on fire.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said protesters were being selfish and she hoped that universities and schools would urge students not to take part in the demonstrations.

Most universities, and some schools, said they would close again on Wednesday. The Hong Kong Jockey Club said all off-course betting centers would also be closed ahead of Wednesday’s racing at Happy Valley as a safety precaution.

DEADLY FORCE

The United States on Monday condemned “unjustified use of deadly force” in Hong Kong and urged police and civilians alike to de-escalate the situation.

In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged Britain and the United States not to intrude, saying: “Hong Kong affairs are purely China’s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference.”

Yang Guang, spokesman for China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said China condemned the dousing of the man with petrol and setting him on fire. He demanded that the person responsible be arrested as soon as possible.",JustBadNews,0
Hong Kong protest organiser Jimmy Sham assaulted by men wielding hammers,http://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hong-kong-protest-organiser-jimmy-sham-assaulted-by-men-wielding-hammers,"HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - A prominent Hong Kong activist and convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), which has organised many of the city's largest peaceful protests, was assaulted on Wednesday evening (Oct 16), the group's spokesman said.

Mr Jimmy Sham was attacked by four to five men wielding hammers while on his way to a meeting in the Mong Kok area of Kowloon, CHRF spokesman Rayne Yuen said in a statement.

Mr Sham was bleeding from the head but was conscious when seeking treatment at the hospital. It is the second assault on him; he was also attacked in August.

""The Civil Human Rights Front strongly condemns the acts of the perpetrators,"" it said in a statement. ""It is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights.""

A spokesman for the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch said it had received a report about a person who was attacked and injured in Mong Kok, and was investigating, but did not disclose the identity of the person.

Unrest in Hong Kong has been going on for more than four months, with the police force using tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, while protesters lobbed Molotov cocktails and, this week, set off a home-made bomb.

Protests have grown increasingly violent since Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam invoked an emergency law earlier this month to ban protesters from wearing face masks.

Mr Sham, who is planning to join the district council elections in November, was attacked in August by two masked men with a baseball bat and knife. Prior to the latest incident, the CHRF had planned a protest this Sunday in Kowloon.",JustBadNews,0

In a 2-1 ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a lower court ruling saying the firm must turn over eight years of accounting records.

The court specifically weighed in on this idea, writing it has ""no authority"" to require the House to take a full vote in support of a subpoena to investigate the President, citing the Constitution.

""The courts lack the power to invalidate a duly authorized congressional subpoena merely because it might have been 'better [if]...the full House' had specifically authorized or issued it,"" the court wrote. ""Unless and until Congress adopts a rule that offends the Constitution, the courts get no vote in how each chamber chooses to run its internal affairs.""

Apple removes Hong Kong map app (again) after Chinese criticism,http://news.yahoo.com/apple-removes-hong-kong-map-050542728.html,"HONG KONG (AP) — Under pressure from China, Apple has removed a smartphone app that enabled Hong Kong protesters to track police. It has cut off access in mainland China to a news app that extensively covered the anti-government demonstrations. And it has made it harder to find an emoji representing the Taiwanese national flag.

The tech company's latest acts of capitulation to China's ruling Communist Party have alienated some Hong Kong consumers and angered democracy activists around the world. But the truth is, few U.S. companies have as much of their business tethered to China as Apple.

""That's the price you pay if you want to be in the market,"" said Matt Schrader, a China analyst for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund. ""You have to abide by demands to censor information: anything that paints the party or its history, or its top leaders, in an unflattering light, or disagrees with their preferred portrayal of China as a country.""

Apple relies on Chinese factories to assemble iPhones, which generate most of the company's profits. Apple has also cultivated a loyal following in the country. China has emerged as the company's third-largest market behind the U.S. and Europe, accounting for 20% of its sales during its past fiscal year.

President Donald Trump's trade war with China has already complicated things for Apple, raising fears that Beijing will impose measures to hurt Apple in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese products and sanctions against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment giant.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has spent much of the past year walking a thin line, trying to prod a truce between the U.S. and China while also trying to protect his company's interests.

His efforts so far have largely paid off, helping to shield the iPhone from being hit by tariffs in either the U.S. or China. But that could change in mid-December, when the Trump administration has promised to expand import duties on more consumer electronics.

Story continues

With the specter of those tariffs, Apple has even more of an incentive to placate China's government and avoid provoking Beijing.

In a worst-case scenario, analysts have estimated retaliatory action from China could cut Apple's profit 10% to 20%. That would translate into a loss of $6 billion to $12 billion in a single year, based on Apple's profits last year.

Apple defended its decision Thursday to pull the police-tracking HKmap.live from its online app store. For some people in Hong Kong, the app was a handy tool that helped steer them away from possible baton charges, volleys of tear gas and police ID checks.

But the company said the app ""has been used to target and ambush police"" and ""threaten public safety.""

""Criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,"" Apple said. ""This app violates our guidelines and local laws.""

Thursday's move followed pressure from various channels, including the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, which asked: ""Is Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?""

Hong Kong's crisis has put pressure on those doing business with China to take sides. The protests were triggered by a now-abandoned government plan to allow criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts in mainland China. It has escalated into a broader battle over Beijing's efforts to curb the Western-style civil liberties and autonomy promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997.

Beijing's criticism of Apple followed government attacks last weekend on the NBA over a tweet by the general manager of the Houston Rockets in support of the protesters. China's state TV canceled broadcasts of NBA games.

One of the police-tracking app's users, Hong Kong office worker Acko Wong, 26, scoffed at the suggestion that the app helped give free rein to criminals.

""How do you ambush a group of police with equipment and gear like helmets and shields?"" he asked.

Sharing the skepticism were U.S. politicians like Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who tweeted criticism of the company Thursday: ""Who is really running Apple? Tim Cook or Beijing?""

Apple didn't reply to emailed requests to explain other recent measures criticized as caving in to China.

The company cut off mainland access to the news website Quartz, which has covered the Hong Kong protests. CEO Zach Seward denounced ""this kind of government censorship of the internet."" The news app was still available in Hong Kong.

Apple also recently removed an emoji representing the Taiwanese flag — which China doesn't recognize — from the virtual keyboard of its smartphone operating system in Hong Kong and Macau. The emoji could still be found if users searched for it.

The latest moves are on top of Beijing's previous demands that Apple remove virtual private network apps from its online store in China. China has sought to tighten control over VPNs, which create encrypted links between computers and can be used to see blocked websites that the government has deemed subversive.

A Russian navy boat was attacked and sunk by a walrus in the Arctic,http://businessinsider.co.za/russian-navy-boat-attacked-and-sunk-by-walruses-in-arctic-2019-9,"iStock

Scientists aboard a Russian navy boat had a rough run-in with a walrus in the Arctic.

The Russian Geographical Society said the small boat sank, but its passengers were able to get to shore.

Visit BusinessInsider.co.za for more stories.

In a kind of odd man-versus-nature moment, a Russian navy boat was attacked and sunk by a walrus during an expedition in the Arctic, the Barents Observer reported Monday.

The Altai, a tugboat of the Russian navy's Northern Fleet, sailed to the Franz Josef Land archipelago in the Arctic carrying researchers from the Russian Geographical Society.

""The polar latitudes are fraught with many dangers,"" the research group posted in a recent press update.

One of those dangers is apparently walruses, a monstrously large animal that can weigh up to a few thousand pounds and can be quite ferocious when threatened.

To get ashore from the Altai, the researchers and other expedition participants had to rely on smaller landing craft.

During one landing, the ""group of researchers had to flee from a female walrus, which, while protecting its cubs, attacked an expedition boat,"" the Northern Fleet said.

The navy added that ""serious troubles were avoided thanks to the clear and well-coordinated actions of the Northern Fleet servicemembers, who were able to take the boat away from the animals without harming them.""

The Barents Observer reports that a drone was being operated in close proximity to the walruses. It is unclear if this is what triggered the aggression.

While the Russian military makes no mention of any equipment losses, the Geographical Society had a bit more to say on what happened.

""Walruses attacked the participating boat,"" the research group explained. ""The boat sank, but the tragedy was avoided thanks to the clear actions of the squad leader. All the landing participants safely reached the shore.""

This wasn't the Russian navy's first run-in with walruses.

This past May, photos believed to be from 2006 surfaced online of a large walrus napping on top of a Russian submarine.

China's organ transplant crimes delivered to UN Human Rights Council,http://healtheuropa.eu/chinas-organ-crimes-human-rights/93544/,"Today, China’s forced organ harvesting crimes were announced at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the first time in the Council’s history.

Organ transplant crimes in China are no longer going unnoticed. Forced organ harvesting is a form of organ trafficking in which people are killed specifically for the extraction of their organs. The transplant recipients in China include Chinese nationals as well as substantial numbers of international ‘transplant tourists’ who travel to China in order to receive an organ at a substantial cost, but with a greatly reduced waiting time.

Recipients from the US, Europe and Asia are generally thought not to be aware that the source of their transplant has been via the murder of an innocent ‘donor’ held in detention centres, prisons and black jails, whose organs are matched and extracted to order.

Making history

Today’s historic moment saw Hamid Sabi, Counsel to the China Tribunal, declare that it is now the “legal obligation” of United Nations (UN) member states to address forced organ harvesting in China. The speech comes after the China Tribunal, an independent people’s tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, announced in June 2019 that China’s “wicked” organ harvesting crimes amounted to crimes against humanity.

Mr Sabi informed the UNHRC of the Tribunal’s damning findings that innocent victims, primarily Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for their organs. He said: “For years throughout China on a significant scale, and that it continues today.”

The speech is the latest and highest level call for international action against China’s state-backed forced organ harvesting, as global pressure mounts on China to stop the murder of innocent people for their organs, in a scandalous industry estimated to earn the People’s Republic of China over $1 (~€0.91bn) billion per annum.

Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, China Tribunal Chair, also stated today at a separate UN event: “Governments, UN bodies and ruling bodies of medical associations dealing with transplant surgery can no longer avoid what it is inconvenient for them to admit. Crimes revealed in the China Tribunal judgment require immediate action.

“The UN and the International Transplant Society should face up to what is revealed in the China Tribunal judgment and act. The time of convenient ‘uncertainty’, when all these entities could say the case against the PRC was not proved, is past.”

Susie Hughes, executive director of ETAC, the international coalition who initiated the China Tribunal, also announced that in a recent joint letter, human trafficking, legal, human rights and anti-slavery organisations are calling for a UN Commission of Inquiry into forced organ harvesting in China.

Organ transplant crimes

The China Tribunal’s Final Judgement has propelled an international outcry to put an end to this barbaric trade and has triggered worldwide action, with many recognising that “wilful blindness” is no longer an option.

In the first official statement from a major U.S political party on China’s organ crimes, the US Republican National Committee (RNC) unanimously passed a resolution condemning “China’s involuntary organ harvesting as a major human rights violation” in August 2019.

In the UK, the House of Lords are pressing for the World Health Organisation (WHO) to look closely at the China Tribunal’s findings. The WHO, who had previously advised the UK Foreign Commonwealth Office that China’s transplant practices were ethical, has now acknowledged that the information they had based their advice on was in fact “based on the self-assessment made by the country that is a signatory, and in this case that is China.”

In the UK, a private members bill to stop unethical organ tourism will be tabled in October, and in Canada an organ trafficking bill recently received unanimous support from both the House of Commons and the Senate.

A joint letter to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN Secretary-General and UN Member States, signed by 18 international organisations is calling for a UN Commission of Inquiry into forced organ harvesting in China.

Human Rights Council

The United Nations Human Rights Council has now been informed of the Tribunal’s damning judgement on the issue of forced organ harvesting in China. The inter-governmental body is made up of 47 states responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights across the globe. The UNHRC has the power to establish a formal Commission of Inquiry into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience In China to expose perpetrators and bring them to justice.

International Lawyer, and Counsel to the China Tribunal, Hamid Sabi said: “It is our duty to have brought China’s organ crimes to the attention of the United Nations and the Human Rights Council, who have long served as protectors of human rights for all people in the world. I sincerely hope that action will be taken to ensure these crimes can no longer continue.”

The victims

The primary victims of organ transplant crimes in China are people who practice Falun Gong.

Falun Gong is a peaceful spiritual practice of the Buddha School tradition that involves meditation, qi gong exercises and striving to live by the principles of truthfulness, compassion and forbearance.

With 80 to 100 million people freely practicing Falun Gong in China, the Chinese Communist Party outlawed the practice in 1999 with hundreds of thousands of people detained, tortured and killed from extraction of their organs.

Evidence also indicates that Uyghurs, House Church Christians and Tibetans are also killed for their organs.",JustBadNews,0
"Ben Stokes describes Sun story about family as 'immoral and heartless'. England batsman Ben Stokes says a newspaper's front-page story about his family is ""utterly disgusting"" and the ""lowest form of journalism"".",https://bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/49726913,"Stokes played a key part as England won the World Cup and then drew 2-2 with Australia in the Ashes

England cricketer Ben Stokes says the Sun newspaper's front-page story about his family is ""utterly disgusting"" and the ""lowest form of journalism"".

Stokes said the newspaper article deals with ""deeply personal and traumatic events"" that affected his New Zealand-based family more than 30 years ago.

Stokes, 28, who starred as England won the World Cup this summer, called the article ""immoral and heartless"".

The Sun told the BBC it had received the co-operation of a family member.

It added that the events described were ""a matter of public record"" and ""the subject of extensive front-page publicity in New Zealand at the time"".

Stokes was born in New Zealand and moved to Cumbria with his family aged 12.

In a statement external-link , Stokes said the story concerned ""events in the private lives of my family, going back more than 31 years"" and had ""serious inaccuracies which has compounded the damage caused"".

""The decision to publish these details has grave and lifelong consequences for my mum in particular,"" he said.

The Durham and England all-rounder added: ""To use my name as an excuse to shatter the privacy and private lives of - in particular - my parents is utterly disgusting.

""It is hard to find words that adequately describe such low and despicable behaviour, disguised as journalism.

""I cannot conceive of anything more immoral, heartless or contemptuous to the feelings and circumstances of my family.""

Stokes produced the match-winning innings as England's men won their first Cricket World Cup at Lord's in July before an incredible 135 not out in the third Ashes Test against Australia at Headingley last month saw England stay in contention in a series they eventually drew 2-2.

He added: ""I am aware that my public profile brings with it consequences for me that I accept entirely.

""But I will not allow my public profile to be used as an excuse to invade the rights of my parents, my wife, my children or other family members. They are entitled to a private life of their own.

""For more than three decades, my family has worked hard to deal with the private trauma inevitably associated with these events and has taken great care to keep private what were deeply personal and traumatic events.

""On Saturday the Sun sent a 'reporter' to my parents' home in New Zealand to question them, out of the blue, on this incredibly upsetting topic. If that wasn't bad enough, the Sun think it is acceptable to sensationalise our personal tragedy for their front page.

""This is the lowest form of journalism, focused only on chasing sales with absolutely no regard for the devastation caused to lives as a consequence. It is totally out of order.""

A spokesperson for the Sun said: ""The Sun has the utmost sympathy for Ben Stokes and his mother but it is only right to point out the story was told with the co-operation of a family member who supplied details, provided photographs and posed for pictures.

""The tragedy is also a matter of public record and was the subject of extensive front page publicity in New Zealand at the time.

""The Sun has huge admiration for Ben Stokes and we were delighted to celebrate his sporting heroics this summer. He was contacted prior to publication and at no stage did he or his representatives ask us not to publish the story.""

Tom Harrison, chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), said he was ""disgusted and appalled at the actions taken in revealing the tragic events from Ben's past"".

""We are saddened that an intrusion of this magnitude was deemed necessary in order to sell newspapers or secure clicks,"" he added.

""Ben's exploits at Lord's and Headingley cemented his place in cricket history this summer - we are sure the whole sport, and the country, stands behind him in support.""",JustBadNews,0

Sure, smog is bad in the Western Hemisphere’s largest city, where traffic jams can stretch for dozens of miles. But not this bad. What was going on? Was the end near? — The Washington Post

A combination of meteorological events paired with smoke that had traveled hundreds of miles from intense forest fires in remote parts of the Amazon caused a period of sudden midday darkness in the most populous city in the Western Hemisphere on Monday, reports The Washington Post.

Meanwhile on Twitter, #PrayforAmazonia emerged as a trending hashtag, channeling the global outrage over the lack of media coverage and political action towards the vast forest fires which have been raging in the drought-stricken Amazon rainforest region of Brazil for more than two weeks now.

Fires are burning across central South America. Yesterday #NOAA20's OMPS instrument detected the aerosol index - an index that detects the presence of particles like soot and dust in the atmosphere - in the vicinity of the fires. This can help inform air quality forecasts. https://t.co/lCMwTqWxtA

Much of the blame for the lack of disaster response is geared towards Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an outspoken proponent of increased logging activity and economic development in the Amazon.



According to the BBC, Bolsonaro, when presented with the data from Brazil's National Space Research Institute that showed the accelerated rate of Amazon deforestation since assuming office on January 1st, he responded ""by saying the data 'doesn't relate to the reality' and accused them of smearing the country's reputation abroad.""

Republicans side with Deomcrats to block Trump's billions of dollars worth of arm sales to Saudi Arabia,http://nyti.ms/2Xp0Lsc?smid=nytcore-ios-share,"This is the scene of an airstrike in 2016 in Yemen, on a busy hospital in a small city called Abs. Nineteen people were killed and dozens were injured. The pilot missed clear warning signs and ignored safety measures, like a no-strike list of protected buildings. Found in the debris, the remains of a U.S.-made weapon. America isn’t officially involved here. The fight is between a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi rebel group. But it’s very much a U.S.-supported war. The fighter jets, the bombs, the training and intelligence — much of it is supplied to the Saudis by the U.S. It’s a brutal war. The Houthis have killed hundreds of Yemenis. The Saudi air campaign has been even more lethal. Over four years, coalition airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians and bombed well over 100 medical facilities, a Times assessment found. “If U.S. fighter pilots were doing this directly with U.S. bombs, would there be a change in behavior?” “If we were hitting hospitals, over and over, like what we’re seeing? Absolutely, there would be a change.” Which begs the question: What obligation does the U.S. have when it sells weapons to foreign militaries? U.S. officials claim their ally is doing everything possible to protect civilians. But this is simply not true, according to Larry Lewis, a former State Department official, who saw firsthand how the Saudi coalition failed to protect civilians and how the U.S. chose to look the other way. “Yemen has exposed a fundamental problem in the way we provide arms and the way we support partners. So we need to change the way we do business.” Lewis spent years working with the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan to try to reduce civilian casualties. He wrote a book on protecting civilians that’s issued to every U.S. soldier in Afghanistan. And in 2015, the Obama administration sent him to work with the Saudi coalition in Riyadh. “There were some fundamental problems with how some of the targeting was being done that really needed to be fixed.” During his time there, he reviewed the Abs hospital strike with an investigations team he helped the Saudi coalition to create. “What did you learn from reviewing that airstrike with the Saudis?” “You look at the level of destruction in the nearby buildings and go, the pilot got it way wrong.” Let’s take a look at what happened there. Coalition warplanes attacked a Houthi checkpoint a few miles north of Abs. Medics say that a car transported casualties to the Abs hospital from the strike. The Saudi coalition tracked the car, believing a Houthi leader was inside. For some reason, they didn’t strike it on the open road. Instead, they waited until the car pulled into the hospital. It parked by the emergency room and was hit without warning. Three major failings were evident in the Abs strike, Lewis says, and these were repeated throughout the Saudi-led air campaign. “Doctors Without Borders say that they provided the hospital coordinates to the Saudi coalition.” “That’s right.” “So why did they still hit it?” “That information didn’t get to the cockpit.” The Saudi coalition is often praised by the U.S. for creating a no-strike list, a map of protected sites like schools, refugee camps and hospitals. The list is used to vet targets when airstrikes are preplanned. But that doesn’t happen for the vast majority of strikes, which are on-the-fly bombings or so-called dynamic strikes. “What can be done to limit the number of dynamic strikes, or at least force them to check the no-strike list?” “Mhm. This is not rocket science. It’s not hard to make a requirement for pilots to call back to higher headquarters and say, check the no-strike list and tell me if this object is on the no-strike list, or if there’s something that’s close by. It would take a minute or two.” Another problem? Over and over, Lewis says, pilots seem to ignore large roof signs that identified hospitals, including the one in Abs. We can see six of them in this satellite image taken before the strike. “So the pilot could have seen this marking and recognized, hey, this is a protected facility.” On top of all this, a major issue is a lack of common sense among pilots and spotters on the ground. “You have a pilot that’s not really so experienced, and then you have a person, who’s not even a military person, agreeing on what they think is a valid target, and then engaging that target. So, it’s really fraught with peril.” In Abs, a teacher named Hamza Ahmed Absi saw that peril firsthand. He rushed to the hospital from a nearby school. Muhammad Darm was badly injured in the attack. He’s an X-ray technician, who was helping patients near the hospital’s entrance when the bomb exploded. Muhammad was lucky to survive. He recently returned to work in the hospital. Once a sanctuary in a time of war, he says it no longer feels safe. For years, officials in both the Obama and Trump administrations have said they’re working directly with the Saudis to stem civilian casualties. “I think every Yemeni that is killed — any innocent person is killed — it affects all of us. And there are many steps that are being taken, and have been taken, to try to minimize that.” “The training that we have given them, we know has paid off.” “We are co-located with them in their operation centers to help them develop the techniques and tactics that will allow them to conduct strikes while mitigating civilian casualties.” But one problem with U.S. oversight, Lewis says: The U.S. wasn’t tracking how the American weapons it sold were being used by a Saudi military with little experience in war. In 2018, three years into the conflict, the head of U.S. Central Command said as much. “Is CENTCOM able to tell whether U.S. fuel or U.S. munitions were used as part of that strike?” “Senator, I don’t believe we are.” Lewis says they did have access to that information. They just weren’t using it. “Every flight by the Saudi-led coalition where they were doing airstrikes, that pilot would then make a report that talked about what target was it, what kind of weapons did they use and just information about the strike. They would file it and then that would go to populate this Excel spreadsheet that had every single strike in the campaign.” “And the U.S. and U.K. had access to that database? “They did.” “So if the U.S. wanted to know if American bombs were bombing hospitals, they could have done so?” “Yes.” A year later, after reporters disclosed the database, General Votel changed his tune. “Today, we do have that. We do have a database that does have that information and we have the ability to see that.” Lewis says the database could be a tool to increase U.S. oversight in reviewing foreign weapons sales. A State Department official told us this kind of data could be incorporated into its monitoring, but vetting it can be onerous, and it may be of little use to policymakers. After a Saudi coalition airstrike on a funeral home killed over 150 people in late 2016, the Obama administration, having brokered $100 billion in weapons sales, now sought to distance the U.S. from the coalition. “And their response was, clearly, the Saudis aren’t learning.” It paused sales of precision weapons, and pulled the plug on Lewis’s advising mission. “The U.S. said this is up to the Saudis to do their thing and investigate themselves.” When President Trump took office, the U.S. doubled down on weapons sales. “So we make the best equipment in the world. There’s nobody even close. And Saudi Arabia’s buying a lot of this equipment.” In Yemen, things for civilians continue to get worse. In 2018, the rate of civilian casualties caused by the Saudi-led coalition soared, Lewis says, to almost 50 per week. And in Abs, history repeated itself. Yet another medical facility was attacked in June of that year. The airstrike destroyed a vital cholera treatment center built by Doctors Without Borders to handle the worst outbreak of the disease in modern history. The Saudi coalition tried to shift blame to Doctors Without Borders, saying its buildings weren’t marked. But again, satellite images from before the strike show large red crescents were visible, even from space. And Doctors Without Borders say they shared the center’s coordinates at least 12 times. The Saudis deny this. The U.S. sells weapons to over 100 countries, but in Yemen, the scale of the devastation has become the story. And for the people living there, it’s the new normal.",JustBadNews,0
'Hong Kong' searches surge behind China's Great Firewall.

Reports and images of clashes this week between Hong Kong police and demonstrators protesting against an extradition law with mainland China have circulated world wide.

At the same time, Beijing has been working to keep the news away from people on the mainland or at least filter the content.

“People are very curious, and there is a lot of discussion on this event,” said one person who works as a content censor at Weibo Corp, which operates the Weibo platform.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s Wechat, the country’s most popular social media app, showed searches for “Hong Kong” peaked at 32.4 million on Wednesday, up from roughly 12 million a week before.

Freeweibo.com, which tracks censored posts on the Weibo platform, said “Hong Kong” was the most searched topic in the past few days.

Other hashtags such as “oppose China extradition” and “go Hong Kong!” were also among the top 10 most-searched topics.

Searches for “Hong Kong” on Baidu, China’s top search engine, more than tripled over the weekend, a sharp rise in interest despite strict rules that bar access to foreign social media and news outlets.

Tests conducted by Reuters on Wednesday showed some mainland Wechat users could not receive images of the Hong Kong protests, including demonstrators amid tear gas. Similar images posted to popular social media sites were removed within minutes.

The censorship, while broadly effective, is not complete.

Some content posted on individual accounts that showed this week’s protests was not immediately removed, though censors say popular images and posts in group chats are quickly flagged.

China’s state media made virtually no mention of the protests until Hong Kong authorities denounced Wednesday’s violence.

CHAIN REACTION

The Weibo censor, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said images of Sunday’s protests were not permitted on the platform, but images from official sources were allowed.

On Thursday, searches for “Hong Kong” on Weibo showed only statements from the city’s chief executive condemning the protests. Other items showed photos of pro-Beijing protesters calling for an end to American interference.

Photos of clashes between police and protesters were accompanied by captions that accused “Hong Kong separatists” of organising attacks on police.

Weibo, Tencent and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the government body responsible for enforcing censorship guidelines, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Beijing has tightened censorship in a wider “rectification” effort that has ensnared foreign media websites and thousands of domestic news accounts on social media.

“They are afraid it will trigger a chain reaction,” said political commentator Zhang Lifan, noting the sensitivity around the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown and China’s tensions over trade and Taiwan with the United States.

“If the flame of the Hong Kong spreads to the mainland, then it will be very bad for them,” he said.",JustBadNews,0

Inside Etowah County jail: 'Nightmare' conditions may have helped sheriff buy beach house,http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/03/inside_etowah_county_jail_nigh.html,"Joseph Estrade spent just three nights in the Etowah County Detention Center, but the 29-year-old New Orleans man considers that long weekend in April 2016 one of the worst experiences he has ever endured.

He describes the county jail as a ""nightmare"" plagued by a host of problems including poor food, unsanitary conditions and severe overcrowding that made him feel like he was ""going insane"" within a few hours of his booking into the Gadsden facility.

""That jail is like a prison; it's not a common jail. You walk in and it's very surreal how intense it is inside,"" Estrade, who was held in the detention center after being arrested by the Etowah County Sheriff's Office on marijuana charges two weeks before his wedding, said in a Friday phone interview.

""I know jail is not supposed to be Disneyland, I get that. It's a punishment place - great. But people still need to be treated like human beings.""

'The worst food I've ever had'

Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin has come under scrutiny for the way he manages the jail following an AL.com report last week that revealed that he personally pocketed more than $750,000 in public funds allocated to feed its prisoners.

""In regards to feeding of inmates, we utilize a registered dietitian to ensure adequate meals are provided daily,"" he said via email earlier this month.

On Wednesday Entrekin declined to answer detailed questions about how he feeds the inmates, complaints about the food, or how he manages the inmate-feeding funds. He instead stated via email that ""[a]ll questions concerning the feeding of inmates will be answered at a news conference on Friday for you and your media colleagues.""

A litany of current and former inmates, civil rights advocates and lawyers have repeatedly alleged over the past five years that the food served in the facility - known as either the Etowah County Detention Center or simply the Etowah County jail - is subpar, portions are inadequate and the conditions in the facility are inhumane.

Even an inspection report drafted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of Detention Oversight following a three-day tour of the facility in December 2016 identified deficiencies in a range of areas including food service, health care and environmental health and safety.

As of 2016, an average of about 300 ICE detainees were incarcerated in the Etowah County facility at any given time under a federal contract that allows ICE to house detainees there in exchange for a per diem of $45 per inmate per day.

""Seventeen (17) detainees stated the food was bland and the portion sizes are too small. Some also stated they are frequently served the same food,"" the inspection report states.

That's in keeping with years of testimonials by inmates, some of whom claim that they lost weight, suffered repeated bouts of food poisoning, and often went hungry while incarcerated in the detention center.

In November 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published a study called ""Shadow Prisons: Immigrant Detention in the South"" that includes insights gleaned from conversations with 67 immigrant inmates in the Etowah County Detention Center.

""This investigation found evidence of significant problems with the quality and quantity of food served to detainees,"" the report states. ""Detainees reported very small portion sizes. Many detainees have lost weight during their time at the detention center. One man reported losing 25 pounds since his arrival at Etowah.""

For about three months in 2015, Suzanne Riley was incarcerated in the jail, where her son is currently locked up. The 51-year-old Selma resident said the detention center served ""outdated cereal from local stores"" for dessert, that she got severe food poisoning after eating a particularly bad dinner, and that she lost more than 20 pounds over the relatively short period she was incarcerated.

""It was bad. The salads were made with rotten lettuce, we had beans every day and noodles with no taste,"" she said Tuesday. ""Same s**t over and over.""

Estrade described the provisions in the jail as woefully inadequate, with a typical dinner consisting of unseasoned beans and vegetables, a bland cookie and Kool-Aid powder mixed with water but no sugar.

""It was the worst food I've ever had in my life,"" he said. ""Imagine the food version of old, warm water. It was tasteless but it had kind of like a musky taste. It was really, really bad.""

A perverse incentive

For years, inmate rights advocates, legal experts and other observers have made the case that allowing Alabama sheriffs to personally keep ""excess"" funds allocated to feed inmates establishes a perverse incentive.

The question is whether a system that allows sheriffs to line their pockets with any inmate-feeding funds they do not use for that purpose leads to people incarcerated in county jails being fed lower-quality and less plentiful food.

The SPLC report explicitly considers that question as it pertains to the jail overseen by Entrekin.

""It is worth noting that under Alabama law, sheriffs can keep as personal income any money not used by jail kitchens,"" the report states. ""While it is not clear why the food portions are so small at the Etowah County Detention Center, researchers for this report are concerned about the law's potential to create an incentive for sheriffs to skimp on meals and cut corners.""

But the SPLC is far from the only outfit raising such questions. An assemblage of more than 10 civil rights, social justice and immigrant advocacy groups have joined forces in support of a campaign called Shut Down Etowah. Founded in 2015, the effort is aimed at exposing alleged abuses inside the Etowah County Detention Center and eventually getting the facility shuttered.

Last week, Lucia Hermo, public advocacy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama - a Shut Down Etowah campaign member - called for a federal investigation into the way inmate-feeding funds are used in Etowah County.

Hermo said the campaign has ""received countless reports from people detained by ICE in Etowah about meager, rotten, expired and insect-infested food"" that serve as anecdotal evidence that Entrekin may be saving money at the expense of properly feeding inmates.

""Given these deeply troubling, unethical and possibly illegal actions by Sheriff Entrekin, we call on the Department of Homeland Security to terminate its contract with Etowah County and launch an investigation into how the county has misspent these funds and violated detained people's human rights,"" Hermo said.

'I was going insane'

When Estrade thinks back to his stint in the Etowah County jail, bad food is not the first thing that comes to mind. Numerous unnerving stories from his time there are burned into his memory.

There's his recollection that when the detention center is overcrowded, some inmates are forced to sleep in hard-plastic sleeves referred to as ""boats"" on the floors of the tiny, windowless cells he describes as far too small even for the two people that usually occupy them. There are the sleepless nights spent listening to the loud freestyle rap battles of two inmates in a neighboring cell.

And then there's the pure, maddening boredom.

""You can't expect a consciousness to sit in a cell with no windows, no books, no music, with no form of experience whatsoever other than staring at a wall,"" Estrade said. ""I was going nuts, man. I can't explain the way it was the first night I was there. I was going insane. I didn't know if the sun was going up yet or what.""

The SPLC study provides further evidence of the dire state of the jail lamented by Estrade, Riley and many other current and former inmates.

""At Etowah County Detention Center in Alabama, detainees go months - even years - without feeling the sun on their skin because the detention center lacks an outdoor recreation area,"" the study states.

Entrekin said via email that ""[t]he ECDC meets all criteria concerning recreation space according to federal detention standards and our accreditation through the American Correctional Association.""

Riley said ""they freeze you to death"" night after night in the jail, and that inmates are often denied so much as a blanket to insulate them from the cold. She said the water in her cell was undrinkable and that she yearned for a glimpse of the outside world.

She also remembers the unsanitary condition of her cell, which she shared with three other inmates.

""My toilet stopped up for days and was full of s**t from four people,"" she said. ""They wouldn't let us out to use the toilet in the rec room so we had to keep using ours. They finally fixed it after constantly complaining.""

Asked about such sanitation issues, Entrekin said via email that ""[a]ll inmates have access to clean drinking water at all times. Maintenance workers are in the detention center on a daily basis repairing items that are broken to ensure a safe and sanitary condition for all.""

Back to a cell

In July 2015, a national advocacy group called Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement (CIVIC) - which has since changed its name to Freedom for Immigrants - filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights & Civil Liberties. The complaint, filed on behalf of 20 then-current and former ICE detainees in the Etowah County Detention Center, details a string of abuses that allegedly took place in the facility.

A particularly striking section of the complaint states that the facility's staff and ICE officers there ""routinely violate medical and mental health care standards, and failed to appropriately respond to an extreme medical emergency.""

The SPLC report and ICE's own inspection of the facility also detail a range of serious concerns about access to medical care in the Etowah County Detention Center, sometimes referred to as the ECDC.

The 2015 CIVIC complaint recounts the plight of an ICE detainee named Miguel Williamson.

""Mr. Williamson was in the custody of ICE at ECDC and his repeated requests for medical attention were dismissed, misdiagnosed, and denied,"" the complaint states.

Entrekin said via email that the complaint's claims about Williamson's treatment ""were never substantiated. The case has been resolved.""

According to the complaint, after being repeatedly denied medical care, Williamson had a massive heart attack inside the detention center in May 2014 that led to both of his kidneys failing. At the hospital, the complaint says, he went into septic shock caused by a staph infection that had gone ""undiagnosed and untreated"" at the jail.

Though doctors predicted he would die, Williamson managed to pull through in the end, only to be sent from the hospital straight back to a cell in the Etowah County Detention Center.",JustBadNews,0

Trump administration scrambles to convince congress not to halt the war in Yemen.,https://news.antiwar.com/2018/03/18/trump-administration-scrambles-to-convince-congress-not-to-halt-yemen-war/,"With the Saudi crown prince set to visit the US this week, the Trump Administration is scrambling to kill off a Senate bill that would end America’s involvement in the Saudi invasion of Yemen. This marks a rare serious challenge to an unauthorized war.

SJ Res 54 notes that the war is unauthorized, something administration officials have readily conceded, and demands that US end military involvement. A high-profile classified briefing was held, with Pentagon and State Dept officials warning the senators not to enforce the law.

The argument is two-hold. Firstly, officials argue the US involvement is “non-combat,” which is beside the point from the perspective of the War Powers Act. The more serious argument, however, is that if the US stops backing the war, US-Saudi relations would be greatly harmed.

While the US presents its involvement as minor, the Saudis are heavily dependent on the US selling them arms and offering in-air refueling services to Saudi bombers to keep them pounding northern Yemen. The Saudis seem to be operating under the assumption that this would continue.

SJ Res 54 still doesn’t have an exact time for its vote, but there is hope it would happen early in the week. The Senate leadership is hoping to delay the vote, but how long they can delay such a vote is unclear, as the bill’s sponsors don’t appear willing to let it go to a committee to quietly die.

Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, is eager to defend the war, spinning it as a conflict against Iran and al-Qaeda. He downplayed the thousands of civilians killed in US-facilitated Saudi airstrikes as part of the rebels trying to make Saudi Arabia look bad.",JustBadNews,0
"To find suspects, police quietly turn to Google- Um WHAT?- Cordon off area and request warrants for every cellphone that pinged",http://www.wral.com/to-find-suspects-police-quietly-turn-to-google/17377435/,"Posted 5:05 a.m., March 15, 2018

RALEIGH, N.C. — In the many months since Adrian Pugh was shot and killed at his home on Saint Albans Drive, Raleigh police had managed to piece together a few important details of his final moments.

In the early morning hours of June 1, 2015, witnesses heard Pugh in an argument. They heard multiple gunshots. And they saw a figure illuminate the ground with a cell phone flashlight before fleeing the scene as the sun rose over north Raleigh.

A year and a half later across town, a taxi driver named Nwabu Efobi was gunned down in front of the Universal Cab Company. Security camera video caught Efobi in some kind of confrontation with the shooter before the unknown man opened fire. The day before, cameras caught the same guy several times walking around the building with what appeared to be a cell phone at his ear.

Raleigh police say the cases are unrelated. But in March 2017, months after investigations began into both shootings, separate detectives on each case, one day apart, employed an innovative strategy in criminal investigations.

On a satellite image, they drew shapes around the crime scenes, marking the coordinates on the map. Then they convinced a Wake County judge they had enough probable cause to order Google to hand over account identifiers on every single cell phone that crossed the digital cordon during certain times.

In at least four investigations last year – cases of murder, sexual battery and even possible arson at the massive downtown fire in March 2017 – Raleigh police used search warrants to demand Google accounts not of specific suspects, but from any mobile devices that veered too close to the scene of a crime, according to a WRAL News review of court records. These warrants often prevent the technology giant for months from disclosing information about the searches not just to potential suspects, but to any users swept up in the search.

City and county officials say the practice is a natural evolution of criminal investigative techniques. They point out that, by seeking search warrants, they're carefully balancing civil rights with public safety.

Defense attorneys and privacy advocates, both locally and nationally, aren't so sure.

They're mixed on how law enforcement turns to Google's massive cache of user data, especially without a clear target in mind. And they're concerned about the potential to snag innocent users, many of whom might not know just how closely the company tracks their every move.

""We are willingly sharing an awful lot of our lives with Google,"" said Jonathan Jones, a former Durham prosecutor who directs the North Carolina Open Government Coalition at Elon University. ""But do people understand that in sharing that information with Google, they're also potentially sharing it with law enforcement?""

Most modern phones, tablets and laptops have built-in location tracking that pings some combination of GPS, Wi-Fi and mobile networks to determine the device's position.

That should come as no surprise to users of apps like Google Maps, Yelp and other software that becomes more helpful with the addition of accurate location data.

This data is immensely valuable to Google, one of the reasons the company collects and stores the information on users of both its Android operating system and, in some cases, mobile apps such as Gmail.

""From an average smartphone user's perspective, it's a little surprising once you start to learn the full scope of information about our locations and whereabouts and activities that companies like Google hold,"" said Nathan Freed Wessler, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project.

Users can switch location tracking off to prevent the device from pinging GPS satellites. But if it's on a cellular network or connected to Wi-Fi, the device is still transmitting its coordinates to third parties, even if they're far less accurate than GPS.

In the past, at least, turning off that technology has been no guarantee of privacy.

Business and technology news site Quartz discovered late last year that Google continued to track devices even when all GPS, Wi-Fi and cell networks were supposedly disabled. The tech giant says it has updated its software to stop the practice.

For its part, law enforcement makes frequent use of cellular network data to build cases.

""We certainly, for a number of years, have seen cell phone data specific to an individual that might be used in a case to try to build part of a story,"" Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said. ""It's one piece in a larger story and one investigative tool of many.""

Wessler, who recently argued before the Supreme Court in a major cell tower case, said ""reverse searches"" have been used to obtain dumps of device information from cell towers of a broad area when a suspect is unknown.

But he hasn't yet seen the tactic applied to more precise GPS data maintained by Google.

""In many ways, it is the same general tactic with different technology,"" Wessler said. ""But the differences in technology can matter.""

At least 19 search warrants issued by law enforcement in Wake County since 2015 targeted specific Google accounts of known suspects, court documents show.

But the March search warrants in the two homicide cases are after something different.

The demands Raleigh police issued for Google data described a 17-acre area that included both homes and businesses. In the Efobi homicide case, the cordon included dozens of units in the Washington Terrace complex near St. Augustine's University.

The account IDs aren't limited to electronics running Android. The warrant includes any device running location-enabled Google apps, according to Raleigh Police Department spokeswoman Laura Hourigan.

""At the end of the day, this tactic unavoidably risks getting information about totally innocent people,"" Wessler said. ""Location information is really revealing and private about people's habits and activities and what they're doing.""

Raleigh police declined to make anyone at the department available for an interview for this story

Answering questions via email, Hourigan said Raleigh police began applying the tactic after learning about a similar search warrant the State Bureau of Investigation obtained in Orange County in 2017.

An SBI spokesperson did not return calls seeking comment.

Hourigan said Raleigh police investigators use these search warrants on a case-by-case basis and consider Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure.

""This technique is used in extraordinary circumstances because the department is aware of the privacy issues that the tactic raises,"" she said in an email March 9.

Since the murder investigations of Pugh and Efobi, extraordinary circumstances emerged two more times in 2017. And these cases, privacy advocates and lawyers who spoke with WRAL News said, are more problematic.

On March 16, 2017, a five-alarm fire ripped through the unfinished Metropolitan apartment building on West Jones Street. The massive blaze was the largest in Raleigh in at least a century. It melted the sides of nearby buildings, toppled a construction crane and closed down adjacent streets for a year.

About two months later, Raleigh police obtained a search warrant for Google account IDs that showed up near the block of the Metropolitan between 7:30 and 10 p.m. the night of the fire. The area just east of Glenwood Avenue is close to heavily trafficked bars, restaurants and apartments.

In addition to anonymized numerical identifiers, the warrant calls on Google to release time stamped location coordinates for every device that passed through the area. Detectives wrote that they'd narrow down that list and send it back to the company, demanding ""contextual data points with points of travel outside of the geographical area"" during an expanded timeframe. Another review would further cull the list, which police would use to request user names, birth dates and other identifying information of the phones' owners.

In August and again in October, Raleigh police took reports about a man who attacked women near Wakefield High School. As part of the sexual battery investigation, detectives obtained a search warrant nearly identical to the arson investigation for any Google account IDs that appeared in either area within the timeframe of the crimes.

Warrant in the sexual battery investigation is returned. The inventory of items seized notes only that detectives received ""electronic data.""

Freeman, the Wake County district attorney, said police are following best practices by targeting narrow areas and specific time windows. She points out that data investigators receive from Google contain only anonymized account numbers without any content included.

""We're not getting text messages or emails or phone calls without having to go through a different process and having additional information that might lead us to a specific individual,"" Freeman said.

After five years as a Wake County prosecutor, Raleigh defense attorney Steven Saad said he's familiar with police demands for Google account data or cell tower records on a named suspect. But these area-based search warrants were new to him.

""This is almost the opposite technique, where they get a search warrant in the hopes of finding somebody later to follow or investigate,"" Saad said. ""It's really hard to say that complies with most of the search warrant or probable cause rules that we've got around the country.""

Jones, the Elon professor and former Durham prosecutor, expressed similar concerns after reviewing the warrants. In particular, the fire and sexual battery cases didn't present evidence that the arsonist or the attacker had a cell phone, he said.

""In those cases, the evidence provided to establish probable cause seems very thin to me,"" Jones said. ""These amount to fishing expeditions that could potentially snare anyone in the vicinity with a cell phone, whether they were involved in the crime or not.""

To Stephanie Lacambra, criminal defense staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, all of the search warrants she reviewed are ""deficient.""

""I don't think with real scrutiny that they would hold up,"" Lacambra said.

She also singled out the possible arson and sexual battery warrants, pointing out that the affidavits fail to link devices with the crimes.

""To just say, 'Criminals commit crimes, and we know that most people have cell phones,' that should not be enough to get the geo-location on anyone that happened to be in the vicinity of a particular incident during a particular time,"" Lacambra said.

Without that probable cause, she said, the department is ""trying to use technology as a hack for their job.""

Hourigan did not respond to questions about criticism of the warrants. But Freeman said that, based on her review of case law, she was confident the warrants would stand up to legal challenges.

""I think there are steps being put in place to try to protect people's Fourth Amendment rights while still allowing law enforcement access to information that is very helpful during the course of the investigation,"" Freeman said.

While it's important for law enforcement to remain sensitive to privacy rights, she said, warrants like these aren't so different than more established techniques.

""For years, we've pulled surveillance videos, for example, of convenience stores where there may have been an armed robbery,"" Freeman said. ""In looking through that surveillance video, it's very possible that people are in and out of that store who had nothing to do with the crime.""

It's important that investigators use such techniques when appropriate to solve crimes, she said.

That's not how Saad sees it. He said requests like these might make sense if there's a named suspect. But as it stands, he's worried about the potential erosion of constitutional protections that guard against search and seizure ""based on a hunch or theory.""

""If you know a crime was committed in an area and you have no information on a suspect, would you allow for them to go through every house in the neighborhood?"" Saad said. ""Of course not.""

The ACLU's Wessler notes that, in all of these investigations, Raleigh police are seeking the highest bar of court review by obtaining a search warrant – the ""gold standard"" in such cases, he said.

The broad scope of the search does raise important questions about privacy, but he said case law still needs to catch up with technology to decide how Fourth Amendment protections will apply.

""That is a concern here, but we just don't have good guidance from the courts about how you should apply the warrant requirement to this kind of reverse search,"" Wessler said.

There's evidence of that uncertainty in the warrants themselves.

A footnote in every one of the documents notes that North Carolina officials disagree with Google's position that search warrants are necessary to demand the account data. But law enforcement are seeking the warrants anyway.

""Google is really standing up for its customers' privacy rights here in demanding law enforcement get a search warrant instead of one of these less protective orders,"" Wessler said. ""That's a good thing.""

The search warrants indicate that not all of the requests have resulted in the seizure of data. Google spokesman Aaron Stein declined to comment on specific cases or to clarify whether the company has pushed back against requests from Raleigh investigators specifically.

""We have a long-established process that determines how law enforcement may request data about our users,"" Stein said in a statement. ""We carefully review each request and always push back when they are overly broad.""

Google's most recent transparency report shows that there were about 5,200 search warrants requesting user information in the U.S. in the first half of 2017, an all-time high. User information requested through subpoenas and other court orders accounted for more than twice that number. The company produced at least some data in response to requests in the first of half of 2017 about 81 percent of the time.

Google declined to say whether it released data in any of the Raleigh cases, and it's unclear from the search warrants exactly what information was seized or whether it's been effective in moving the investigations forward.

Of the four cases, only one has resulted in an arrest.

Tyron D. Cooper was charged Oct. 13 with the murder of Efobi, the taxi driver gunned down in east Raleigh. But the related search warrant shows data wasn't received from Google until months later.

Cooper's attorney, Christian Dysart, declined to comment on the case.

But that delay poses another problem.

Search warrants are typically executed within 48 hours and returned to the courthouse for filing. Until then, they're off limits to the public.

The long wait time on these reverse search warrants to Google, coupled with a judicial order not to disclose the request for data to any affected users, means the documents remain secret for months.

As a result, it's difficult to say exactly how many times Raleigh police and other law enforcement agencies have employed the tactic – or how many more may be in the works.

For people who are never criminally charged, Wessler said, the lack of notification is particularly troubling.

""There's a risk that they will never learn about the search if there's not notice provided by the government, or at least by the company after they're allowed to do so,"" Wessler said.

While she maintains reverse searches have a lot in common with other investigative techniques, Freeman acknowledged that consumers aren't always aware of how their digital choices are effectively mapping where they've been and what they've done. Like debit card transactions and other digital fingerprints, she said, this data can be valuable to law enforcement when properly obtained.

""All of us who are living in this age of technological advances have to grapple with this issue of what are we giving up in exchange for convenience,"" Freeman said.

The EFF's Lacambra says it's important for users to educate themselves and advocate for policies that protect their privacy. But she argues that staying connected shouldn't mean consent to constant monitoring.

""It does not have to be that we have to give up our privacy rights in order to participate in the digital revolution,"" Lacambra said.

Rabbi complains Israel flooded with gay culture,https://www.timesofisrael.com/right-wing-rabbi-says-israel-flooded-with-gay-culture/,"A prominent national religious Israeli rabbi sparked an outcry on Tuesday when he said that the country has become an “LGBT-stan” inundated with gay culture and urged his followers to “wage war” for traditional family values.

Speaking at a right-wing religious conference, Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira, who heads the Ramat Gan Yeshiva, said that so-called homosexual culture was “an illness that was spreading.”

The conference called for opposition to same-sex marriages. Stressing that neither he nor his followers were homophobic, Shapira said that Israeli culture had branded anyone who opposes homosexuality an “extremist.”

“Anyone who says something about a healthy and faith-based family is considered to have phobias, to be someone who is an extremist,” he said. “Why? Because he expressed an opinion that has been the basis of all humanity and the entire Torah!”

Shapira, who also teaches at Bar-Ilan University, said there was nothing homophobic or extremist in wanting traditional Jewish values in family life.

“I have invested many hours in helping those who have difficulty in this area [of homosexuality],” he said. “But there is an illness that is spreading and taking over. We’re becoming a country that looks more and more like LGBT-stan.”

Rejecting calls from within the national religious camp for a more moderate approach to the issue, Shapira said, “We are now attacked for this platform [of opposing homosexuality] as if we had left [the national religious camp] and become ultra-Orthodox. They hate us for our sanity.”

Shapira’s yeshiva is part of the Hesder system, which combines Torah study with army service. It is recognized by the government and receives public funding.

His words sparked an outcry.

Zehava Galon, head of the left-wing Meretz party, took to Twitter to accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of hypocrisy in funding Shapira’s yeshiva.

“Netanyahu can speak until tomorrow in the United States about integrating the gay community, but as long as the state continues to finance this rabbi, he represents [the country] more than another AIPAC speech,” she said.

Activists organized a protest via Facebook to be held outside the Ramat Gan Yeshiva next week.

Shapira was one of dozens of rabbis who signed a letter sent in July to Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked opposing adoption by gay couples.

“These days voices are being raised seeking to change the custom of the state, in a way that is contrary to the human morality that emanates from our holy Torah,” the rabbis wrote, referring to the central text and derived teachings of Judaism.

“Our holy Torah is a beacon and moral compass to the Jewish people and the whole world. Therefore, it is fitting that in Israel we be on guard to strengthen family values and preserve a public space that respects the values ​​of human morality and Judaism,” they said. “We support all the public representatives who act in this way.”

"Total ban on the world's most widely used insecticides likely after major new EU analysis: The EU found that Neonicotinoids cause a wide range of harm to bees, making it highly likely that the pesticides will be banned from all fields across the EU when members vote on the issue next month",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/28/total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides-likely-after-major-new-eu-analysis,"The world’s most widely used insecticides pose a serious danger to both honeybees and wild bees, according to a major new assessment from the European Union’s scientific risk assessors.

The conclusion, based on analysis of more than 1,500 studies, makes it highly likely that the neonicotinoid pesticides will be banned from all fields across the EU when nations vote on the issue next month.

The report from the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa), published on Wednesday, found that the risk to bees varied depending on the crop and exposure route, but that “for all the outdoor uses, there was at least one aspect of the assessment indicating a high risk.” Neonicotinoids, which are nerve agents, have been shown to cause a wide range of harm to bees, such as damaging memory and reducing queen numbers.

Jose Tarazona, head of Efsa’s pesticides unit, said: “The availability of such a substantial amount of data has enabled us to produce very detailed conclusions. There is variability in the conclusions [and] some low risks have been identified, but overall the risk to the three types of bees we have assessed is confirmed.”

The Efsa assessment includes bumblebees and solitary bees for the first time. It also identified that high risk to bees comes not from neonicotinoid use on non-flowering crops such as wheat, but from wider contamination of the soil and water which leads to the pesticides appearing in wildflowers or succeeding crops. A recent study of honey samples revealed global contamination by neonicotinoids.

The assessment was welcomed by many scientists and environmentalists. “This is an important announcement that most uses of neonicotinoids are a risk to all bee species,” said Prof Christopher Connolly, at the University of Dundee, UK. “The greatest risk to bees is from chronic exposure due to its persistence.” Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex, said: “This report certainly strengthens the case for further restrictions on neonicotinoid use across Europe”.

“We have been playing Russian roulette with the future of our bees for far too long,” said Sandra Bell at Friends of the Earth. “EU countries must now back a tougher ban.” Several nations had been waiting for the Efsa report before deciding their position.

However, a spokesman for Syngenta, a neonicotinoid manufacturer, said: “Efsa sadly continues to rely on a [bee risk guidance] document that is overly conservative, extremely impractical and would lead to a ban of most if not all insecticides, including organic products.”

Matt Shardlow, at charity Buglife, said the risk guidance document should be urgently implemented to prevent another pesticide “blunder”. He said: “It is a tragedy that our bees, moths, butterflies and flies have been hammered by these toxins for over 15 years.”

In March 2017, the Guardian revealed draft regulations from the European commission which would ban neonicotinoids from all fields across Europe, citing “high acute risks to bees”. The chemicals could still be used in closed greenhouses.

Efsa’s first assessment in January 2013 found “unacceptable” risks to bees from neonicotinoids and paved the way for the partial EU ban which was passed in April 2013. It banned the use of the three main neonicotinoids on flowering crops, principally oilseed rape, as they were seen as most attractive to bees.

Bees and other insects are vital for global food production as they pollinate three-quarters of all crops. The plummeting numbers of pollinators in recent years has been blamed on disease, destruction of flower-rich habitat and, increasingly, the widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides.

Pesticides damage survival of bee colonies, landmark study shows Read more

There has been strong evidence that neonicotinoids harm individual bees for some years but this has strengthened in the last year recently to show damage to colonies of bees. Other research has also revealed that 75% of all flying insects have disappeared in Germany and probably much further afield, prompting warnings of “ecological armageddon”.

In November, environment secretary Michael Gove overturned the UK’s previous opposition to tougher restrictions on neonicotinoids. “The weight of evidence now shows the risks neonicotinoids pose to our environment, particularly to the bees and other pollinators which play such a key part in our £100bn food industry, is greater than previously understood,” Gove told the Guardian. “I believe this justifies further restrictions on their use. We cannot afford to put our pollinator populations at risk.”

The environment department’s chief scientist, Prof Ian Boyd, warned in September that the assumption by regulators around the world that it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes is false.

"China drowns out critics of lifetime Xi Jinping presidency, as 'disagree' among words censored online",https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/02/27/china-drowns-critics-lifetime-xi-jinping-presidency-disagree-among-words-censored-online/,"China’s propaganda machine kicked into overdrive Tuesday to defend the Communist Party’s move to scrap term limits for President Xi Jinping as critics on social media again defied censorship attempts.

The country has shocked many observers by proposing a constitutional amendment to end the two-term limit for presidents, giving Xi a clear path to rule the world’s second largest economy for life.

The rubber-stamp National People’s Congress (NPC) is certain to endorse the move next week, meaning that Xi — already China’s most powerful leader in decades — can stay as president beyond 2023.

Li Datong, a former editor at the state-run China Youth Daily, posted a draft letter urging legislators to vote against the move — which would abolish term limits set in 1982 under Deng Xiaoping to prevent a return to the decades of chaos under Mao Zedong.

“It was the highest and most effective legal restriction meant to prevent autocracy or putting individuals above the party and the state,” said the letter. It was not sent to legislators but shared with hundreds of people in a private group on China’s WeChat phone messaging app.

“Lifting the term limits of national leaders will be ridiculed by civilised nations all over the world and also sow the seeds of chaos for China,” said the text posted on Monday.

WeChat users trying to share screenshots of the letter saw their posts blocked.

Censors have scrambled to delete all dissenting comments on social media — even the word “disagree” is blocked — but users of the Twitter-like Weibo website kept speaking out Tuesday, two days after the party Central Committee announcement.

“So pathetic, we have 1.3 billion people, no one can resist,” wrote one user.

Another lamented the lack of political reform: “I once believed that I could see a president elected by one man, one vote in my lifetime.”

Scores of terms have been blocked, according to a list of dozens of words compiled by US-based internet tracker China Digital Times — including “my emperor”, “ascend the throne”, “I oppose”, “lifelong”, and “Winnie the Pooh” — the portly cartoon bear to which Xi has been compared.

‘Happier lives’

The NPC, at its annual full session starting Monday, will also formally approve a second five-year presidential term for Xi, who is Communist Party chief and head of the armed forces in addition to being head of state.

State media defended the amendment in editorials that lavished praise on the communist party’s overall leadership.

The English-language China Daily said the lifting of the presidential term limit “has been necessitated by the need to perfect the Party and the State leadership system”.

The party has always proposed amendments that “have injected new ideas and concepts about where the country will go and how it will achieve its goal of rejuvenation and ensure people live happier lives,” it said.

The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, was even more profuse in its praise of the amendment in an editorial entitled “Constitution change responds to new era”.

Since Xi took power, it wrote, “the new ruling team has not just been muddling along under the leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping. Instead, it quickly started to deepen reforms in a comprehensive and magnificent way.”

The newspaper took a shot at the political systems of the United States and Europe.

“It has shaped and affected quite a few Chinese people’s mindsets. But some key parts of the Western value system are collapsing. Democracy, which has been explored and practised by Western societies for hundreds of years, is ulcerating,” it said.

“China cannot stop and take a break… our country must not be disturbed by the outside world or lose our confidence as the West grows increasingly vigilant toward China.”

The administration of President Donald Trump, who has called Xi a friend but regularly clashes with Beijing over trade, had a guarded reaction to the Communist Party’s move.

“The president has talked about term limits in a number of capacities during the campaign and something that he supports here in the United States, but that’s a decision that’s up to China,” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.

"San Francisco Spends $30 Million Cleaning Feces, Needles",https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Diseased-Streets-472430013.html,"How dirty is San Francisco? An NBC Bay Area Investigation reveals a dangerous mix of drug needles, garbage, and feces throughout downtown San Francisco. The Investigative Unit surveyed 153 blocks of the city – the more than 20-mile stretch includes popular tourist spots like Union Square and major hotel chains. The area – bordered by Van Ness Avenue, Market Street, Post Street and Grant Avenue – is also home to City Hall, schools, playgrounds, and a police station.

The NBC Bay Area Investigative Unit surveyed a section of downtown San Francisco to determine the amount of feces, hypodermic needles, and garbage littering the heart of the city. The results reveal a disgusting and potentially deadly mix of contamination that experts now believe could exceed some of the dirtiest slums in the world. Investigative reporter Bigad Shaban reports on a story that first aired Feb. 18, 2018.

As the Investigative Unit photographed nearly a dozen hypodermic needles scattered across one block, a group of preschool students happened to walk by on their way to an afternoon field trip to city hall.

“We see poop, we see pee, we see needles, and we see trash,” said teacher Adelita Orellana. “Sometimes they ask what is it, and that’s a conversation that’s a little difficult to have with a 2-year old, but we just let them know that those things are full of germs, that they are dangerous, and they should never be touched.”

In light of the dangerous conditions, part of Orellana’s responsibilities now include teaching young children how to avoid the contamination.

'There’s Poop in There'

“The floor is dirty,” said A’Nylah Reed, a 3-year-old student at the preschool, who irately explained having to navigate dirty conditions on her walks to school.

“There is poop in there,” she exclaimed. “That makes me angry.”

Kim Davenport, A’nyla’s mother, often walks her daughter to the Compass preschool on Leavenworth Street in San Francisco. She said she often has to pull her daughter out of the way in order to keep her from stepping on needles and human waste. “I just had to do that this morning!”

NBC Bay Area

The Investigate Unit spent three days assessing conditions on the streets of downtown San Francisco and discovered trash on each of the 153 blocks surveyed. While some streets were littered with items as small as a candy wrapper, the vast majority of trash found included large heaps of garbage, food, and discarded junk. The investigation also found 100 drug needles and more than 300 piles of feces throughout downtown.

Dried Feces can Lead to Airborne Viruses

“If you do get stuck with these disposed needles you can get HIV, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, and a variety of other viral diseases,” said Dr. Lee Riley, an infectious disease expert at University of California, Berkeley. He warned that once fecal matter dries, it can become airborne, releasing potentially dangerous viruses, such as the rotavirus. “If you happen to inhale that, it can also go into your intestine,” he said. The results can prove fatal, especially in children.

Riley has researched conditions across the poorest slums of the world. His book titled, “Slum Health,” examines health problems that are created by extreme poverty.

San Francisco Compared to Some of the Dirtiest Slums in the World

Based on the findings of the Investigative Unit survey, Riley believes parts of the city may be even dirtier than slums in some developing countries.

“The contamination is … much greater than communities in Brazil or Kenya or India,” he said. He notes that in those countries, slum dwellings are often long-term homes for families and so there is an attempt to make the surroundings more livable. Homeless communities in San Francisco, however, are often kicked out from one part of town and forced to relocate to another. The result is extreme contamination, according to Riley.

'We Aren’t Addressing the Root Cause'

“Unacceptable. Absolutely unacceptable,” said Supervisor Hillary Ronen. “We're losing tourists. We're losing conventions in San Francisco. All of this is happening because we aren't addressing the root cause, which is we need more temporary beds for street homelessness.”

Ronen believes San Francisco has been too focused on permanent housing for the homeless and that the city has neglected to provide enough temporary shelter, which can provide the homeless a respite from the streets. The city currently has about 2,000 temporary beds. Ronen, however, believes an additional 1,000 are needed, at a cost of about $25 million.

“We need to find a source of revenue,” said Ronen. “Whether that's putting something on the ballot to raise business taxes or taking a look at our general fund and re-allocating money towards that purpose and taking it away from something else in the city.”

San Francisco Spends $30 Million Cleaning Feces, Drug Needles

Until the problem is fixed, Mohammed Nuru, the Director of the Public Works Department, is charged with the towering task of cleaning the streets, over and over again. “Yes, we can clean, he said, “and then go back a few hours later, and it looks as if it was never cleaned. So is that how you want to spend your money?”

The 2016-2017 budget for San Francisco Public Works includes $60.1 million for “Street Environmental Services.” The budget has nearly doubled over the past five years. Originally, that money, was intended to clean streets, not sidewalks. According to city ordinances, sidewalks are the responsibility of property owners. However, due to the severity of the contamination in San Francisco, Public Works has inherited the problem of washing sidewalks. Nuru estimates that half of his street cleaning budget – about $30 million – goes towards cleaning up feces and needles from homeless encampments and sidewalks.

'Human Tragedy' in San Francisco

A single pile of human waste, said Nuru, takes at least 30 minutes for one of his staffers to clean. “The steamer has to come. He has to park the steamer. He's got to come out with his steamer, disinfect, steam clean, roll up and go.”

Asked if he’d be willing to give up part of his budget and allocate it to more directly addressing the homeless problem – which would likely alleviate his cleaning problem – Nuru said, “The Board of Supervisors, the mayor – those are decisions that they need to make."" He added, “I want to continue cleaning and I want to be able to continue to provide services. The Public Works Department provides services seven days a week, 24 hours a day.”

Ronen acknowledges that finding the money to provide 1,000 additional beds for the homeless may very well take years. The city is planning on opening three new Navigation Centers for homeless people by the summer, but two centers will also be closing.

“We're not going to make a huge dent in this problem unless we deal with some underlying major social problems and issues,” she said. “There's a human tragedy happening in San Francisco.”

Mother admits murdering seven-week-old son after poisoning him with anti-depressant,https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mother-admits-murdering-seven-week-14313065,"Get the biggest stories sent straight to your inbox Sign up for regular updates and breaking news from WalesOnline Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email

A woman has admitted murdering her eight-week-old son.

Hannah Turtle, from Shotton in Flintshire, had denied murdering her baby son James Hughes but changed her plea to guilty on Tuesday.

Turtle, 22, was on trial at Mold Crown Court after James' death in June last year.

She also admitted two counts of poisoning her son with an anti-depressant and three counts of ill treating her son.

Turtle put her own anti-depressant drug in James’ milk bottle.

She also stopped him breathing on three occasions over a 10-day period - the last of which resulted in the baby boy's death.

Turtle had originally denied murder, saying she did not intend to kill her son or to cause him really serious harm, the Daily Post reports.

The trial had heard how Turtle claimed she heard voices telling her she was a bad mother and had confessed to a health worker ""I am a murderer, I killed my baby.""

The court heard she told the health professional that “I put my hand over his mouth ... I killed him”.

The admission is alleged to have followed a letter she wrote to the police in which she was said to have confessed to being responsible for James' death.

In a further police interview, Turtle was said to have told officers she did not know why she had done what she did, but that she may have done it initially to seek attention and support.

Turtle was remanded in custody and will return to court on Thursday where she will be sentenced.

Mr Justice Lewis said there has to be a life sentence for murder but he has to fix a minimum term and take into account Turtle's culpability and her mental state.

The court was told that although the evidence was not presented, both doctors who were due to give evidence prior to Turtle’s guilty plea, diagnosed Turtle with a personality disorder.

Commenting after the hearing, an NSPCC Wales spokesman said: ""While it is not yet known why Turtle carried out this appalling murder it is clear that her role as a parent was to protect her child from harm. Instead, she killed her defenceless baby son and it is right that she is now facing justice for her despicable actions.

""James’s life was tragically cut short and it is a sad reality that cases of abuse and neglect most often involve people close to the victims. Babies and young children are entirely dependent on those who care for them and we all have a duty to look out for their welfare.""

NSPCC Wales says if an adult is worried about a child, they can call the NSPCC 24/7 on 0808 800 5000 in confidence.

Malaysia newspaper publishes 'how to spot gays' list,https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/blog/2018/2/14/malaysia-newspaper-publishes-how-to-spot-gays-list,"A leading Malaysian newspaper has come under fire by activists and on social media after they published an article last week describing ""how to spot a gay person"".

According to the article in Sinar Harian, gay men are ""fond of growing facial hair and wearing branded clothes"".

Other distinctive qualities include a love of going to the gym – not for exercise, but to check out other men. Their eyes light up when they see handsome men, the article said.

Lesbians on the other hand, ""despised and belittled men, preferred to be alone, tend to hug each other and hold hands when walking,"" the article went on to add.

People took to social media platforms in outrage, calling out the publication.

Some mocked the ludicrous idea of such 'signs'

Most agreed the list was 'disturbing'

Arwind Kumar, a social media activist, hit back at the article in an angry video mocking the so-called signs, describing it as dangerous enough to ""take away lives"".

""If you really want to help society, educate them on the traits of a depressed individual,"" he tweeted. ""With an article, we could have saved many lives. With an article like this, you're only going to take away lives.""

The video has been viewed more than 55,000 times since its release, prompting a conversation on Malaysia's stance on LGBTQ+ rights.

Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia, where laws criminalising 'sodomy' can result in imprisonment, corporal punishment and fines. Last year, Disney indefinitely postponed the opening of its film Beauty and the Beast in Malaysia after censors in the Muslim-majority nation reportedly cut out a 'gay moment' in the movie.

That same year, the country's Health Ministry launched a contest titled 'The National Creative Video Competition on Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health' with an aim to 'prevent' homosexuality and transgenderism.

Another article on the health ministry's website titled, ""Why would a person be lesbian?"" outlined the reason women are gay is based on their decision to pursue their careers and their belief that only women would understand their choices.

Neighbouring country Indonesia, also finds itself in the midst of rising anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. As part of a sweeping criminal law overhaul, Indonesian parliament is pushing forward a clamp down on gay and pre-marital sex.

Officials have been using the country's strict anti-pornography laws in a string of raids against the LGBT community, and last month, Google pulled one of the world's largest gay dating apps from the Indonesian version of its online store in response to government demands.

Indonesian police hit the headlines after they forcibly cut the hair of a group of transgender women, forced them to wear male clothes and told them to speak in a masculine voice.",JustBadNews,0
ISIS claims attack on Shiite militia in Iraq; 27 dead,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/19/middleeast/iraq-kirkuk-isis/index.html,"(CNN) ISIS claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on a Shiite militia group near the Iraqi city of Hawija over the weekend, an ambush that left more than two dozen slain.

It was the deadliest attack against Iraq's Shiite-led Popular Mobilization Units since the country's forces wrested Hawija from the terror group in October.

At least 27 PMU fighters died in the Sunday night assault, southwest of Kirkuk, according to a statement released by the group on Monday.

Dozens of ISIS militants attacked several PMU military checkpoints on a highway near the town of Hawija, security officials in Kirkuk said.

The PMU, an independent military force of about 110,000 fighters, has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS in Iraq. The group said it plans to ""respond with determination to end the presence of ISIS criminal organization completely in the country.""

"UK millennials suffer worst falls in incomes of any nationality apart from Greece, report reveals",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-millennials-income-fall-worst-nationality-greece-earnings-report-resolution-foundation-a8217676.html,"UK millennials have suffered the second-worst falls in their earnings of any of the dozen advanced economies surveyed by a think tank over the past decade.

In a new report, the Resolution Foundation calculates that average real hourly earnings for under-30s in Britain fell 13 per cent between 2007 and 2014.

Only Greece, where real earnings slumped by 25 per cent over the same period as the eurozone country plunged into depression, saw a worst performance for this age group among the dozen advanced economies Resolution analysed in the latest research from its Intergenerational Commission.

British millennials experienced bigger earnings falls than other crisis-hit southern eurozone states such as Portugal and Italy, where they fell 12 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.

Average earnings for Spanish millennials fell by only around 2 per cent.

Resolution also found that the gap between the pay performance of UK millennials and workers aged between 50 and 59 was particularly pronounced, with older UK workers seeing their pay fall by around half the extent of the younger group.

In Italy and France the declines were roughly in line. In Germany, Spain and Italy the older group of workers saw larger pay declines than millennials.

“The pay squeeze has been deeper in the UK than in most other places, and more focused on young people in particular,” said Resolution.

However, the jobs market for UK millennials was, in other respects, much healthier than in other countries.

The under-30 unemployment rate rose by only around 2 percentage points over the period. In Portugal it shot up by 12 percentage points and in Italy by 16 percentage points.

In Spain and Greece the millennial jobless rate jumped by around 26 percentage points.

“The UK has traded off more pay growth for younger workers than other countries with similar youth unemployment experiences,” said the think tank.

Another major finding from the study is that millennials in the UK, relative to younger people in other high-income countries, have experienced a pronounced “bust” in rising living standards, following a long “boom” of generation-on-generation advancement in previous decades.",JustBadNews,0
Student flushes emotional support hamster down toilet after airline refuses to allow rodent on flight,http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/student-hamster-flush-toilet-emotional-support-animal-killed-spirit-airline-flight-miami-baltimore-a8200911.html,"A college student flushed her emotional support hamster down a toilet after airline employees refused to let her board the plane with it - and is now contemplating a lawsuit against the airline.

Before Belen Aldecosea, 21, was set to fly home from college to Miami on November 21, she called Spirit Airlines twice to confirm she could bring her pet dwarf hamster, Pebbles, on the flight.

According to Aldecosea, the airline told her it would be no problem. But once she arrived the day of her flight, Aldecosea claims the airline told her a different story.

Despite a doctor’s letter certifying the rodent as a comfort animal, a Spirit Airlines employee chased Aldecosea to the gate, screaming rodents were not allowed on board.

With no one to come pick up the tiny hamster and no rental cars available, Aldecosea and Pebbles were stuck at the airport - until, Aldecosea claims, an airline employee suggested letting Pebbles go or flushing her, a claim the airline has denied.

After rebooking her flight for a later one, and sitting for hours in the airport, Aldecosea said she finally decided to flush Pebbles.

She told the Miami Herald: “She was scared. I was scared. It was horrifying trying to put her in the toilet. I was emotional. I was crying. I sat there for a good 10 minutes crying in the stall.”

Aldecosea said she cried for 10 minutes after flushing the hamster

But with no other options, Aldecosea said she felt it was more humane to end her life that way, rather than letting her go and risking her getting hit by a car.

So Aldecosea eventually flushed Pebbles - a support hamster she had gotten after a cancer scare the previous year.

After the incident, Aldecosea said she emailed Spirit Airlines to complain and the airline offered her a free flight - which she declined.

Pebbles was a support hamster she had gotten after a cancer scare the previous year

Now, the student has hired attorney Adam Goodman to fight the airline on behalf of Pebbles.

Goodman told the Herald: “This wasn’t a giant peacock that could pose a danger to other passengers. This was a tiny cute harmless hamster that could fit in the palm of her hand.”

Dwarf hamsters usually weigh less than two ounces - and the US Transportation Safety Administration has no rules against carry-on hamsters.

She claims a member of airline staff told her to flush the hamster

However, it is up to individual airlines to decide whether they allow the rodents on board.

A representative for Spirit Airlines admitted they mistakenly told Aldecosea that Pebbles would be allowed - but that no employee ever recommended disposing of the hamster in a toilet.

The airline told The Independent: ""Our reservation representative, unfortunately, did misinform the guest that a hamster was permitted to fly as an emotional support animal on Spirit Airlines.

Russia is Trying to Bury This Video?And They Might Shut Down YouTube to Do It,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/02/russia-is-trying-to-bury-this-video-and-they-might-shut-down-youtube-to-do-it/,"For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis, the election, and more, subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter.

Last week, a 25-minute video published by Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny alleging a new link between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign made headlines around the world. Now the Russian government wants it scrubbed from the internet—so much so that it is taking steps that could block millions of its own citizens from using YouTube or Instagram.

The video was released last Thursday and accused Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Prikhodko—a top foreign policy official—of having been a conduit between the Kremlin and Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch linked to the Trump campaign. In making his case, Navalny mined the autobiography and Instagram feeds of Nastya Rybka, a Russian model and escort who claims to be Deripaska’s mistress. Drawing on video and audio Rybka posted that captured her, Deripaska, and Prikhodko relaxing on a yacht while the two men discuss US-Russia relations, Navalny’s video alleges that Deripaska hosted Prikhodko for a secret meeting at sea in the company of several female escorts. Deripaska immediately denied the claim and threatened to sue media outlets reporting on it, assailing the video as a “planned campaign aiming to damage my reputation.”

The day after the video’s publication, Deripaska won a court injunction requiring it—along with six other videos and 14 Instagram posts—to be taken down. The court, in Deripaska’s native Krasnodar region, found that the posts violated his right to privacy and ordered that they must come down.

As a result, Roskomnadzor—Russia’s communications regulator—added the YouTube videos and Instagram posts to its list of prohibited websites, giving internet providers until Wednesday to blacklist the URLs. But, as Russian news startup the Bell explains, many Russian internet providers don’t have the technical ability to selectively block particular URLs. To comply with the Roskomnadzor order, they’ll instead have to block access to YouTube and Instagram entirely—unless the owners of the offending posts opt to delete them independently.

“It’s impossible for internet providers to block certain pages on Instagram and YouTube,” Karen Kazaryan, chief analyst at the Russian Association for Electronic Communications, an internet lobby group, told Bloomberg on Monday.

Neither Google (which owns YouTube) nor Facebook (which owns Instagram) immediately responded to requests for comment.

A number of media outlets in Russia have already received notices from Roskomnadzor requiring them to remove references to the offending posts. Rybka has not yet taken down the posts she made that are targeted by the court’s order. Instead, she posted a video polling her more than 80,000 followers: Should she remove the videos, or leave them up and risk the country’s YouTube and Instagram access?

Navalny, for his part, also doesn’t show any plans to remove the content himself. “There’s one way to respond—spreading [the video]” he wrote on his website.

Update (2/13/18): Oksana Baulina, a Navalny aide responsible for his YouTube channel, has released an email she says she received from YouTube, which appears to encourage Navalny to delete the video. If he opts not to remove it, “Google may be forced to block the content,” the email notes. Google, which owns YouTube, has not responded to multiple requests for comment.",JustBadNews,0
"The consumer goods multinational Unilever is threatening to withdraw its advertising from online platforms such as Facebook and Google if they fail to protect children, promote hate or create division in society.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/12/marmite-unilever-ads-facebook-google,"One of world’s biggest advertisers says it will avoid platforms that ‘create division’

This article is more than 2 years old

Unilever has threatened to withdraw its advertising from online platforms such as Facebook and Google if they fail to eradicate content which “create division in society and promote anger and hate” .



Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of the sprawling multinational, whose brands include Dove, Magnum, Persil and Marmite, said that online platforms were sometimes “little better than a swamp”. He told major advertising, media and tech firms gathered at a conference in California: “As one of the largest advertisers in the world, we cannot have an environment where our consumers don’t trust what they see online.”

He added: “We cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain – one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers – which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency.

“It is in the digital media industry’s interest to listen and act on this. Before viewers stop viewing, advertisers stop advertising and publishers stop publishing.” According to the analysts Pivotal, together Google and Facebook account for nearly three-quarters of all digital advertising in the US. In the UK the two have more than 60% of digital advertising and 90% of all new digital spending.

Unilever’s ultimatum comes as tech and social media firms are facing mounting criticism for failing to protect children and to erase fake news, hate speech and extremism. Last year Procter & Gamble, the owner of brands including Pantene and Pampers, issued a similar warningbefore cutting $100m (£72m) of digital ad spend without any negative impact on sales .

Weed said: “Fake news, racism, sexism, terrorists spreading messages of hate, toxic content directed at children – parts of the internet we have ended up with is a million miles from where we thought it would take us.”

Unilever is the world’s second biggest marketing spender, after P&G, and spent €7.7bn (£6.8bn) last year advertising its brands, which also include PG Tips, Vaseline and Bertolli.

Weed compared cleaning up the digital supply chain with efforts made by Unilever to find sustainable sources for its food ingredients and other raw materials and said the Anglo-Dutch business would no longer “invest in platforms or environments that do not protect our children or which create division in society, and promote anger or hate.”

He added: “We will prioritise investing only in responsible platforms that are committed to creating a positive impact in society.”

The company has trimmed its ad production as part of a cost-saving drive; it is making fewer TV ads and has halved the number of ad agencies it uses to 1,500.

Ian Whittaker and Annick Maas, analysts at Liberum, said online advertising platforms such as Facebook and YouTube faced “increasing difficulties in persuading advertisers that their product offers a brand safe environment”.

“Moreover, given the number of videos uploaded, there will always be an element of videos slipping through the net, which is likely to fuel further negative publicity. We therefore do not see this problem going away for the online platforms.”

They added: “It is clear advertisers are becoming increasingly wary of online’s quality and so are unlikely to shift money aggressively from TV to online as these concerns mount.”

The Liberum analysts said advertisers’ growing unease about tech companies’ lack of content control could provide an opportunity for broadcasters to take a bigger slice of the online video advertising market.

ITV has a 45% share of the UK TV ad market but only 6.5% of British online video advertising, where ad rates are much higher than in TV. Online could be a big driver of future profit growth for UK and European broadcasters, they said.

Fake doctor in India infects dozens with HIV using contaminated needles,https://news.sky.com/story/fake-doctor-in-india-infects-dozens-with-hiv-using-contaminated-needles-11239013,"Thirty-three people have been infected with HIV after a fake doctor allegedly injected them with contaminated needles and syringes.

All of those testing positive are from the north Indian town of Bangarmau, where the unlicensed practitioner was working.

The suspect, Rajendra Kumar, is alleged to have used the same syringes as those he had previously used to treat flu, fever and body ache.

Dr Sushil Choudhary, the district's chief medical officer, told Sky News: ""The quack was operating in this rural area and only charged 10 rupees (11p) for an injection.

""He used the same syringe and many poor people went to him for cheaper treatment.

""We have screened 566 persons so far and 38 have been reactive, of these 33 are HIV positive. They have all been sent to the Kanpur Medical Hospital where they are under anti-retroviral therapy and drugs are being administered to stop any progression.""

The incident came to light when a government-run health camp was held in the town in November, finding a high number of HIV cases.

India's health department then launched an investigation and set up three screening camps for the town's residents.

Image: India marks World AIDS Day every December, with the country home to 2.1 million people who live with HIV

According to locals, the fake doctor is a resident of a neighbouring village and was claiming to cure people of common illnesses. Because he charged less money, the villagers went to him instead of the government clinic.

Dr Choudhary continued: ""We have lodged a police case against the quack and have started a crackdown on illegal practitioners who are playing with the lives of people.""

Health minister Sidharth Nath Singh added: ""Action will be taken against culprits and those who practice without a licence.

""Since it's a transit point, HIV carriers are likely to come there. So we're mapping truck drivers who come there and offer treatment to them.""

According to 2017 UNAIDS data, India has 2.1 million people living with HIV, which is about 0.26% of its population. Of those, 9,100 were children under the age of 15.

New HIV infections in the country have decreased by 46% since 2010 and the number of AIDS-related deaths has come down by 22% in the same period.

India spends only about 1% of its GDP on public health, leaving millions of citizens no choice but to pursue expensive private treatment.

A disease with expensive treatment costs could easily push a family into poverty, making cheaper cures all the more attractive to the country's most vulnerable.",JustBadNews,0
Amazon patents new technology that uses a wristband for workers to track and correct worker movements in its warehouses.,https://www.inverse.com/article/40869-amazon-wireless-wristband-tracker,"If there was ever a question as to which side Amazon stands in the fight between efficiency vs. privacy, its new patent for a buzzing wireless wristband for its warehouse workers might give us an answer.

Last week, the tech giant’s new patents were published, as Geekwire first reported, covering wristbands that can track the location of hands and movement relative to inventory bins via radio transmissions and ultrasonic sound pulses.

Basically, system sensors would triangulate signals from the wristband to determine the location of a worker’s hand, and then software would match the worker’s hand position with the inventory item that they are supposed to be working on. The system could also send signals back to the wristband, sending “haptic feedback” — like a small buzz — to confirm or correct where workers are going.

This is what Amazon's inventory system, with wrist tracking, would look like. Amazon

Ever since the patent applications were first made last fall, critics brought up concerns about the dark side of such technology and the control that this would give to managers. And such interpretations are not uncalled for, given Amazon’s reportedly “bruising” culture for white collar and warehouse employees.

Here’s what’ Amazon said about the technology to the AFP press service (emphasis ours):

The speculation about this patent is misguided. Every day at companies around the world, employees use handheld scanners to check inventory and fulfill orders. This idea, if implemented in the future, would improve the process for our fulfillment associates. By moving equipment to associates’ wrists, we could free up their hands from scanners and their eyes from computer screens.

Like most companies, we have performance expectations for every Amazon employee and we measure actual performance against those expectations, and they are not designed to track employees or limit their abilities to take breaks.

Of course, Amazon’s patent application did not mention worker surveillance. Instead, it was all about “inventory management systems.” As the patent put it, “improved approaches for keeping track of where an inventory item is stored are of interest.”

Here’s the patent application’s pertinent explainer:

“Keeping track of where inventory items are stored … may require the inventory system worker to perform time consuming acts beyond placing the inventory item into an inventory bin and retrieving the inventory… such as pushing a button associated with the inventory bin or scanning a barcode associated with the inventory bin.”

It’s worth noting that companies often register for patents that they do not end up using, so just because the patent has been filed does not mean that it will start appearing in Amazon warehouses anytime soon. Other recent Amazon patents that have yet to make it into the real world include underwater storage facilities as well as floating blimp warehouses.

Of course, this is all likely just a stopgap measure until robot workers completely take over.",JustBadNews,0
Trump claims pro-NHS marches show universal healthcare doesn't work,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/05/trump-pro-nhs-marches-universal-healthcare-farage-fox-friends,"This article is more than 2 years old

This article is more than 2 years old

Theresa May has rebuked Donald Trump over his claim the NHS is failing, publicly backing her health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, after he tweeted disagreement with the US president’s view.

The response from May – who generally seeks to avoid criticising Trump – came after the president condemned Democrat plans for a universal healthcare system by noting in a tweet Saturday’s protest march in London demanding more NHS funding.

Here’s what Americans need to know about the UK’s health system | James Ball Read more

“The Democrats are pushing for universal healthcare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working,” he said.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!

Hunt responded via Twitter by saying that while he disagreed with the opinions of some of Saturday’s marchers, “not ONE of them wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover”, a reference to the US situation.

He added: “NHS may have challenges but I’m proud to be from the country that invented universal coverage – where all get care no matter the size of their bank balance.”

Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) I may disagree with claims made on that march but not ONE of them wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover. NHS may have challenges but I’m proud to be from the country that invented universal coverage - where all get care no matter the size of their bank balance https://t.co/YJsKBAHsw7

Asked whether May backed Hunt’s opinion, her spokesman said: “The prime minister is proud of having an NHS which is free at the point of delivery.

“NHS funding is at a record high, and was prioritised in the budget with an extra £2.8bn. In the recent Commonwealth Fund international survey the NHS was rated the best in the world for a second time.”



Asked whether No 10 backed Hunt’s specific tweet, the spokesman said: “Jeremy Hunt is the health secretary and of course he speaks for the government on these matters.”

The spokesman declined to say whether the PM was annoyed at another leader expressing opinions on UK domestic policy. But asked if May had ever commented on the US healthcare system he said: “I can’t recall her having done so.”

The public disagreement runs counter to a general policy within Downing Street of seeking to maintain strong ties with Trump, which involved May visiting him soon after his inauguration last year, and inviting the president for a state visit.

That trip has been delayed, seemingly because of Trump’s worries he could face mass protests. After a planned lower-key visit to open the new US embassy in London was also called off, officials are now planning a working visit for later this year.

Jeremy Corbyn also denounced Trump’s view. The Labour leader wrote: “Wrong. People were marching because we love our NHS and hate what the Tories are doing to it. Healthcare is a human right.”

Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, told the Public Accounts Committee on Monday: “Unfortunately, respectfully, we suggest that tweet got the wrong end of the stick and in fact people in this country don’t want to ditch our NHS.”

After his tweet mentioning the NHS, Trump praised the coverage of Fox News for “exposing the truth”.

The channel’s morning show had featured the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage discussing the pro-NHS marches. Asked why people were protesting, Farage claimed pressure on the NHS was caused by immigration.

“Well the big problem we’ve got is a population crisis caused by government policy on immigration,” Farage said.

“We have a population of 65 million but it’s increasing by half a million people a year. We just haven’t got enough hospitals, we haven’t got enough doctors, we haven’t got enough facilities.”

Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Obama-era legislation which expanded access to health insurance, failed in Congress last year.

The Republican tax cut which was passed in December included a repeal of the ACA’s individual mandate, a move which led Trump to claim – erroneously – that he had “essentially repealed Obamacare”.

Polling has recorded increased support for single-payer, government-run healthcare in the US, although it remains a contentious issue largely opposed by Republicans and supported by Democrats.

"Whale and shark species at increasing risk from microplastic pollution: Large filter feeders, such as baleen whales and basking sharks, could be particularly at risk from ingesting the tiny plastic particles, say scientists.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/05/whale-and-shark-species-at-increasing-risk-from-microplastic-pollution-study,"Large filter feeders, such as baleen whales and basking sharks, could be particularly at risk from ingesting the tiny plastic particles, say scientists





Whales, some sharks and other marine species such as rays are increasingly at risk from microplastics in the oceans, a new study suggests.

Species such as baleen whales and basking sharks, which feed through filtering seawater for plankton, are ingesting the tiny particles of indigestible plastic which now appear to permeate oceans throughout the world. Some of these species have evolved to swallow hundreds or even thousands of cubic metres of seawater a day, but taking in microplastic can block their ability to absorb nutrients, and may have toxic side-effects.

The new study, published in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution, advises more research on the megafauna of the oceans, as the effects of microplastics on them is currently not well understood. Scientists have found, for instance through examining the bodies of beached whales, large pieces of plastic in the guts of such creatures, but the effect of microplastics, though less obvious, may be just as harmful.

Elitza Germanov, a researcher at the Marine Megafauna Foundation and co-author the study, said: “Despite the growing research on microplastics in the marine environment, there are only a few studies that examine the effects on large filter feeders. We are still trying to understand the magnitude of the issue. It has become clear, though, that microplastic contamination has the potential to further reduce the population numbers of these species, many of which are long-lived and have few offspring throughout their lives.”

Many species of whale, filter-feeding shark and rays are already under threat from other problems, such as overfishing and pollution. The added stress from microplastics could push some species further towards extinction, the authors of the study warned.

One possibility is that the microplastics will convey toxins to the bodies of the megafauna, though this process is currently poorly understood.

Maria Cristina Fossi, a professor at the University of Siena and co-author of the study, told the Guardian that although there was no evidence currently that microplastics alone could kill filter-feeders, they could produce “sub-lethal effects” which would endanger their health.

She said research on whale sharks and fin whales had confirmed that filter-feeding species were exposed to toxic chemicals, perhaps through the breakdown of microplastics in their digestive systems. “Exposure to these plastic-associated toxins pose a major threat to the health of these animals since it can alter the hormones,” she said.",JustBadNews,0
China Tells World: It's Us or The United States,http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/china-tells-world-its-us-or-the-united-states-ahead-of-president-trumps-davos-speech/news-story/b8cf52702b85dd66a68c0acdd6bd2bbf,"What to Expect From Trump's Speech in Davos

What to Expect From Trump's Speech in Davos

CHINA has given the world a blunt choice by asking global leaders to choose between Xi Jinping’s global outlook and that of US President Donald Trump.

In a strongly worded editorial by the state’s news agency, Beijing said the world needed to choose between “two fundamentally different outlooks” which included the Chinese President’s shared future and Mr Trump’s America First policy.

The commentary, by Xinhua, comes as global leaders and policy makers gather in the Swiss town of Davos for the World Economic Forum which draws to a close on Friday.

Mr Trump has already attended a gala reception and dinner with European business chiefs.

The US President is due to address the forum on its closing day at the end of a week that saw his administration announce a new package of trade tariffs targeting China and South Korea, and spark upheaval on the currency markets.

The glitzy annual gathering at a Swiss Alpine resort has drawn politicians, CEOs and celebrities to ponder public policy and global co-operation for more than 50 years.

Mr Xi last year delivered the first address by a Chinese leader at the forum where he took up the torch of global trade to the delight of the well-heeled audience then anxious about Mr Trump’s inauguration.

He was absent from this year’s forum, but that didn’t stop China from delivering its own message to the world.

Xinhua said the world can either choose between China’s vision or Mr Trump’s “self-centred America First policy (which) has led his country away from multiple multilateral pacts and infused anxiety into both allies and the broader world”.

“Although what he is about to say at the globalist brainstorming feast on Friday remains guesswork, few believe this particular pulpit would be able to make him turn his back on the poster boy of a rising isolationist tendency that many fear is fragmenting the world,” the editorial reads.

It goes on to say the “Xi-style collaborative approach” is the only way forward because of “the interests of different countries have become so closely intertwined that mankind has no future but a shared one”.

China and the US have had a testing relationship in recent months with tensions increasing over Mr Trump’s push for China to do more over North Korea.

During the US election campaign, Mr Trump was outspoken about his opposition to Beijing’s global trade policy.

In 2016 he told a rally in Indiana the country was responsible for “the greatest trade theft in the history of the world”.

“We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what we’re doing,” he told the crowd.

Beijing has made no secret of its ambitious plans for global growth in the past.

In a 3 ½ hour speech given while opening a five-yearly national congress in October last year, Mr Xi set out his country’s ambitious plans to become the world’s biggest superpower within the next 30 years.

The Chinese President spelt out his time frame for the country to become a “global leader” with international influence and said “it was time for his nation to transform itself into a mighty force” that could lead the entire world on political, economic, military and environmental issues.

US OPEN FOR BUSINESS

Earlier this week White House officials said the President was going to the World Economic Forum to promote his economic policies.

Top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn said the President was going to Davos to “tell the world that America is open for business”.

Administration aides say he will use his maiden appearance to play salesman-in-chief, making the case for investment in a revitalised America.

“(This trip) is about an America First agenda but America First does mean working with the rest of the world,” US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.

“It just means that President Trump is looking out for American interests, no different than other leaders look out for their own.”

Mr Trump’s business-friendly tax cuts and a record-breaking bull run on Wall Street have wowed many in the Davos crowd.

But the decision by Mr Trump — the self-styled anti-globalist president — to attend the world’s most notable gathering of globalists, and at an exclusive Swiss ski resort no less, has left some scratching their heads.

Mr Trump has criticised global pacts, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on trade, demanding changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement and announcing his intent to exit the Paris climate accord.

However, in a an interview with CNBC to be broadcast in full on Friday US time, Mr Trump suggested he was open to the United States joining the TPP, which he had rejected only a year ago.

China’s stinging editorial also comes after Mr Trump imposed tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines last week in a blow to China’s export market.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross conceded that China could slap retaliatory tariffs on US products following the decision this week to impose tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines.

Mr Ross said there’s “always potential for retribution and retaliation and that’s up to the Chinese to decide”.

Venezuela's Oil Output Crumbles,http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2018/01/18/venezuelas-oil-output-crumbles.html,"CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela's oil output is collapsing, making it unlikely the South American country can benefit from rising global prices for oil and increasing the chances of a debt default this year that could turn its economic crisis into a humanitarian disaster.

Production fell 440,000 barrels a day to 1.8 million barrels in the 12 months to November, according to official statistics. The nearly 20% decline so far ranks among the deepest in the industry's history. Russia's output slid 23% during the fall of the Soviet Union and Iraq's output dropped by the same share after the 2003 U.S. invasion, according to data from OPEC and BP Statistical Review.

Continue Reading Below

The collapse has been triggered by a deep economic crisis and widespread corruption and mismanagement, compounded by a purge of state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA by President Nicolás Maduro that has paralyzed the oil giant. U.S. sanctions have scared off some of the last remaining investors.

""In Venezuela there is no war, nor strike, but what's left of the oil industry is crumbling on its own,"" said Evanán Romero, a former PdVSA director.

Since the country exports little else, Venezuela's centrally planned economy relies on oil exports for 95% of its hard currency, according to the latest official data. That means the output decline will add more pressure to the government, which has drastically cut back on imports of everything from machinery to food and medicines to make ends meet. The economy has shrunk an estimated 40% in the past four years. Malnutrition is spreading among the young and elderly while health officials report a resurgence of illnesses ranging from malaria to diphtheria.

Venezuela is also entering the world's first episode of hyperinflation in a decade. Prices rose an estimated 2,600% last year, the country's National Assembly estimates. Nearly one in four factories didn't reopen after Christmas, according to the local industry association. And at least four people have died in looting outbreaks across the country in recent weeks.

This week, the state oil company's new chief, National Guard Gen. Manuel Quevedo, blamed the downturn on sabotage and terrorist attacks by the opposition, without providing any evidence. He said production has stabilized and will grow to 2.5 million barrels per day this year.

Most analysts, however, expect Venezuela's production to continue falling, adding to the country's economic woes.

""The only discussion right now is how much is it going to decline by. There is no talk of a turnaround,"" said Luisa Palacios, analyst at consultancy Medley Global Advisors in New York.

The output decline means Venezuela has been the only major oil producer to not benefit from rising crude oil prices. The value of the Venezuelan oil export basket rose 25% last year on the back of stronger global demand and shrinking inventories. But this windfall was wiped out by lower output and the rising cost of oil products imported by PdVSA to aid its operations.

Brokerage Torino Capital forecasts that the value of Venezuelan oil exports will fall about three billion this year to $26.5 billion. As recently as 2012 the country earned $93 billion from oil exports.

The country has already been struggling to pay interest and principal on its $60-billion foreign debt. A full-blown default would deepen the country's woes, potentially putting oil sales at risk.

PdVSA and the central government are in default on more than $700 million of bond payments. The state oil company hasn't made any interest payments for a month, raising fears that creditors could start seizing oil shipments as compensation.

Last week, a tanker carrying Venezuelan crude was detained in the Caribbean island of Curaçao at the request of an unidentified group of investors seeking $30 million in back payments from Venezuela, according to diplomats familiar with the matter

""If Venezuela's oil shipments become a target, that would be the worst possible scenario for the country's oil industry,"" said Artyom Tchen, an Oslo-based oil analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy.

The crisis has created a vicious cycle of underinvestment and falling output, which cripples the economy further. PdVSA's operational spending has fallen two thirds from 2014 to 2016, according to the latest official data.

The cash crunch comes as Mr. Maduro faces elections sometime this year. As oil production falls, it will become increasingly difficult for the president to maintain handouts of imported food to supporters, which has kept his ruling party in power amid an economic meltdown, said Siobhan Morden, strategist at Nomura Securities.

Part of the problem is that some 1.3 million barrels a day of Venezuelan oil is already spoken for between the domestic market and pre-paid supply and debt deals with allies Russia, China and Cuba, said Mr. Monaldi. That leaves precious little to sell in the open market.

Making matters worse, Mr. Maduro's government jailed almost 70 senior managers on graft allegations in the past three months, appointing half a dozen generals with no industry experience to run the firm.

Philippines not taking down statue of WW II sex slave despite Japan's objection,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/manila-comfort-women-statue-japan-1.4482388,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will not act on an objection by Japan to a new statue in Manila that commemorates the Filipino ""comfort women"" who worked in Japanese military brothels during the Second World War, his spokesman said on Thursday.

Relations between the two countries remain ""very strong,"" Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque told reporters, playing down concern that the statue could hurt relations with Japan, a major source of aid and investment.

About 1,000 Philippine women were forced into prostitution by Japanese troops during the war — they are known by the Japanese euphemism ""comfort women"" — a sensitive issue that had prompted some survivors to demand an apology as well as compensation from Tokyo.

Roque said the statue was not an issue for Duterte to get involved in.

""It's up to the people who erected the statue to do anything they want with it,"" he said. ""I don't think it is really a diplomatic issue, no.""

The National Historical Commission of the Philippines, a government agency, allowed a foundation to erect the bronze statue in a Manila tourist spot last month. It was built with donations from Chinese-Filipino groups and individuals.

Roque declined to comment on Japanese Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Seiko Noda expressing regret about the statue when she met Duterte on Tuesday. In comments posted on the ministry's website, Noda said: ""I spoke frankly to the president and I believe he understood.""

Duterte and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe get along well and have visited each others' family homes. Duterte has lauded Japan for its ""pre-eminent and peerless role"" as a big investor and development partner.

A spokeswoman from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was ""extremely regrettable"" that comfort women statues including the one in the Philippines had been erected.

Last year, Japan temporarily recalled its ambassador to South Korea over a statue commemorating Korean women forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War Two.

South Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean victims.

A Philippine women's group called Gabriela said Japan aimed ""to erase any trace of their country's brutality to the world and we should not allow them to have their way on historical revisionism.""

""It is an added insult to the comfort women in the country and the families of those who died during the Japanese occupation if this administration allows Japan to have the say in the comfort women monument issue,"" it said in a statement.",JustBadNews,0
Woman who made up gang rape story sent to prison after escape attempt,http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2018/01/woman_who_made_up_gang_rape_st.html,"MUSKEGON COUNTY, MI - The woman who made up a harrowing-yet-false story of kidnapping and gang rape is now headed for prison after she tried to escape the custody of jail officers.

Leiha Ann-Sue Artman, 27, of Montague was sentenced Jan. 4 to 13 months to four years in the Michigan Department of Corrections after she pleaded to a charge of resisting and obstructing police.

Artman told Muskegon County Circuit Judge Annette Smedley that addiction has been the reason for her lawlessness, which has included multiple probation violations.

""I don't want to die before I reach 30,"" she told Smedley on her sentencing date, which was Artman's 27th birthday.

In March 2016, Artman told authorities that four men abducted her from the driveway of her home, threw her in the trunk of their car and then beat and sexually assaulted her. She later admitted making up the story and was sent to a residential jail alternative program.

Following repeated parole violations, Artman was sent to jail, and on Oct. 10, jail corrections officers took Artman to Mercy Health's Hackley Campus. It was alleged that she ran out of the emergency room, chased by officers who quickly detained her.

""Ms. Leiha Ann-Sue Artman was transported from the Muskegon County Jail to Hackley Hospital based upon information provided by her indicating that she may have been sexually assaulted prior to arriving at the jail,"" Muskegon County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Timothy Maat said in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from MLive/Muskegon Chronicle.

Artman told Smedley that her life had ""completely spiraled out of control,"" and said she needs ""professional help.""

""Ms. Artman, I sure hope this is the last time,"" Smedley told Artman after sentencing her.

Artman had gone AWOL from the KPEP residential program for probationers on Oct. 1 and an arrest warrant was issued Oct. 2. She was arrested and returned to jail, court records show.

She previously had been in the ""swift and sure"" intensive probation program, but repeatedly violated rules, court records show.

Arrest warrants were issued June 20 after Artman used alcohol and cocaine on two separate occasions, on July 18 for failing to submit to substance abuse testing and Sept. 7 for use of cocaine, records show.

In March 2016, Artman told authorities that four men abducted her from the driveway of her home, threw her in the trunk of their car and then beat and sexually assaulted her at an unknown location, according to court documents.

Artman's boyfriend reported to investigating Michigan State Police troopers that two days later he had received text messages demanding money for Artman's release, documents show. The text messages, which the boyfriend showed troopers, also included photos of Artman gagged and bleeding from her head, according to the documents.

Artman reported that she later was able to call her boyfriend and he picked her up at a location near her home where her abductors dropped her off, according to the documents.",JustBadNews,0

Facebook is declining to say why it appears to be picking and choosing political leaders to censor at the request of the US government after it deleted the social media accounts of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.

The Silicon Valley technology company deleted Kadyrov’s Instagram and Facebook profiles after the United States imposed travel and economic sanctions on him over allegations of human rights abuses. Facebook told the New York Times that it had a “legal obligation” to disable his accounts once they confirmed they were run by someone on a US sanctions list.

Russia calls for answers after Chechen leader's Instagram is blocked Read more

That legal obligation did not appear to extend to other key individuals on US sanctions lists, including the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, and Guatemalan congressman Julio Antonio Juárez.

Facebook declined to explain why it had deleted some accounts but not others under US sanctions law. A company spokeswoman told the Guardian: “We operate under the constraints of US laws, which vary by circumstance.”

“We will continue to work with appropriate government authorities to ensure we meet our legal obligations and to explore options for complying with the law in a way that maximises free expression on our platform and keeps people safe.”

The case has raised concern among civil liberties groups, who worry that economic sanctions imposed by the US, in service of Washington’s foreign policy, are being used to censor political speech.

US economic sanctions are enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and are typically applied to individuals who pose a threat to America’s national security, whether that’s for alleged human rights abuses, involvement in drug trafficking, illegal arms dealing or terrorism.

American companies and individuals are prohibited from providing goods, technology or services to people on these sanction lists and people who intentionally violate the law face fines and imprisonment.

It seems as though Facebook is picking and choosing compliance, which suggests there is government involvement Jillian York, Electronic Frontier Foundation

“The law is clearly targeted at economic activity and is being applied to an entirely different category to suppress speech,” said Jennifer Granick, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.

The fact Facebook has left accounts of other sanctioned individuals untouched suggests the social network may be subject to US government pressure behind the scenes. The company, which has a real name policy on its platform, could easily use screening software to ensure that it doesn’t do business with people or companies on OFAC’s sanctions lists.

“It’s compliance 101,” said one lawyer who specialises in economic sanctions. “Whenever we bring a new client in we screen them against the [sanctions] list. If DC lawyers are capable of doing this, then one of the leading global technology companies would certainly be capable of doing this.”

“It really does seem as though Facebook is picking and choosing compliance, which suggests there is government involvement,” added Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Kadyrov is an ally of Vladimir Putin and was added to the sanctions list with four other Russians in December. He has been accused of extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses. Once the list was published, he posted a sarcastic video to Instagram mocking the United States government.

However, Facebook’s inability to clearly explain why his account was deleted is a reminder of the power the platform wields in its moderation decisions, which can have a chilling effect on free speech.

Following meetings with the Israeli government last September, Facebook has suspended the accounts of many Palestinian activists and journalists after Israeli officials reported them for “incitement”. Accounts that use similarly violent language against Palestinians remain largely untouched, according to the Intercept.

In Myanmar, Facebook has been accused of censoring documentation of human rights abuses against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority, a population that has been persecuted by the military to the point where the UN warned that genocide may be taking place.



In Lebanon, Hezbollah members have won seats in parliament. However, because Facebook uses the US state department’s categorisation of terrorist organisation it blocks these politicians from having a presence on its platforms.

Sarah T Roberts, assistant professor of information studies at UCLA, who studies commercial content moderation, said: “Once again we’re contending with a lack of transparency and uneven application of the rules.”

Apple Being Sued for 'Purposefully Slowing Down Older iPhone Models',https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/21/apple-lawsuit-slowing-down-old-iphone-models/,"Apple yesterday confirmed that it has implemented power management features in older iPhones to improve performance and prevent unexpected shutdowns as the battery in the devices starts to degrade, and this admission has now led to a class action lawsuit, which was first noticed by TMZ.

Los Angeles residents Stefan Bogdanovich and Dakota Speas, represented by Wilshire Law Firm, this morning filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California accusing Apple of slowing down their older iPhone models when new models come out.

Defendant breached the implied contracts it made with Plaintiffs and Class Members by purposefully slowing down older iPhone models when new models come out and by failing to properly disclose that at the time of that the parties entered into an agreement.

According to the lawsuit, Bogdanovich and Speas have owned the iPhone 7 and several older iPhone models and have noticed that their ""older iPhone models slows (sic) down when new models come out."" The two say they did not consent to have Apple slow down their devices, nor were they able to ""choose whether they preferred to have their iPhones slower than normal.""

They're seeking both California and Nationwide class action certification, which would cover all persons residing in the United States who have owned iPhone models older than the iPhone 8.

Apple yesterday addressed speculation that it throttles the performance of older iPhones with degraded batteries, confirming that there are power management features in place to attempt to prolong the life of the iPhone and its battery. Apple implemented these features last year in iOS 10.2.1.

When an iPhone's battery health starts to decline, the battery is not capable of supplying enough power to the iPhone in times of peak processor usage, which can lead to shutdowns, Apple says.

""Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components. Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We've now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.""

The lawsuit seemingly misrepresents Apple's original statement and suggests the plaintiffs and their lawyers do not understand Apple's explanation for how iPhone power management features work and why they were implemented, given the lawsuit's suggestion that it's tied to the release of new devices. As explained by Apple, when certain iPhone models hit a peak of processor power, a degraded battery is sometimes unable to provide enough juice, leading to a shutdown. Apple says it ""smooths out"" these peaks by limiting the power draw from the battery or by spreading power requests over several cycles.

Lithium-ion batteries degrade over time by nature, and this eventual wearing out addressed by the power management features is unrelated to the release of new iPhone models.

Apple does not deny that iPhones with older batteries can sometimes see slower performance, but power management is a feature that Apple says has been implemented to improve overall performance by preventing an iPhone from shutting down completely rather than a feature that's been implemented to force users to upgrade by deliberately slowing devices.

As many people have suggested, Apple has done a poor job of explaining why it has implemented these power management features and how the state of the battery ultimately affects iPhone performance. More transparent information about battery health should be provided, and customers should be better informed when their batteries start to degrade so they can choose whether or not to pay for a replacement. Apple may also need to relax its policies on when customers can pay for a battery replacement, as currently, a battery can't be replaced unless in-store equipment registers it as near failing.

An iPhone's battery is designed to retain 80 percent of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles. A defective battery that does not meet those parameters can be replaced for free for customers who have AppleCare+ or who have devices still under warranty.

For out of warranty customers, Apple offers a battery replacement service, which costs $79 plus $6.95 for shipping.

The lawsuit is demanding the replacement of the old iPhone and compensation for loss of use, loss of value, the purchase of new batteries, ascertainable losses in the form of the deprivation of the value of the iPhone, and overpayments because Plaintiffs and Class Members ""did not receive what they paid for"" when Apple interfered with the usage of their iPhones.

Additional class action lawsuits have been filed against Apple in Chicago, New York, and Northern California. All three lawsuits allege that Apple slowed down iPhones in an effort to get customers to upgrade to new devices.",JustBadNews,0
Hundreds protest in Sweden after police told women to 'stay inside or walk in pairs' after series of violent gang rapes of teenage girls,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5197675/Hundreds-protest-Sweden-series-gang-rapes.html,"Hundreds took to the streets of Malmo in southern Sweden to protest after three teenage girls were brutally gang raped - and police told women to stay indoors.

The most recent incident involved a 17-year-old girl who was raped by an unknown number of assailants in a children's playground in the early hours of Saturday.

The following day, Malmo police issued a warning to local women not to go outside alone at night, and to walk in pairs or use taxis.

Anger: Hundreds marched through Malmo in southern Sweden on Tuesday to protest against the police response to three violent gang rapes of teenage girls

The first rape took place on November 4, and saw a young woman raped by several assailants after a party in Segevång, north Malmo.

Just over a week later, a woman was attacked and raped by a number of men at a bus stop in Södervärn, central Malmo.

Saturday's rape took place just a few streets away in Sofielund, and saw the 17-year-old attacked by a group of men in a playground.

'This is a horrible, particularly severe crime with exceedingly brutal violence,' Andy Roberts, head of area police in North Malmo told Helsinborg's Dagblad.

He would not give the newspaper details of the violence the victim was subjected to, but added: 'There are limits, even for me, as an old experienced police officer.'

Fighting back: Protesters demanded that the government take action against rapists and that police do more to protect women in Sweden

Anger: A protester holds up a placard during the demonstration in central Malmo yesterday

Wave: Three young women have been gang raped in Malmo in less than three weeks by 'young men unknown to them'

A local newspaper reports that the victims in all three cases were teenagers.

Police say that while there is no obvious connection between the rapes, it cannot be ruled out as investigations are still ongoing.

All three incidents took place between midnight and 3am and assailants were all young men unknown to the victims, Sydsvenskan reports.

Yesterday's protest, filmed by a participant, saw demonstrators demand police protection, tougher punishment and that the government step in and push through proposed legislation on consent.

Bearing placards with messages such as 'no rapists on our streets' and 'Stefan Lofven, take your responsibility', directed at the country's Prime Minister, hundreds of protesters gathered in Malmo on Tuesday evening.

'I never thought I would be scared to walk around in my hometown,' one of the speakers Sara Wettergren said according to Kvallsposten.

Upset: A local newspaper reports that the victims in all three cases were teenagers

Referring to the famous gang rape of a young student in Delhi in 2012, she added; 'In India the perpetrators were convicted. In Sweden they walk free.'

In the wake of the #MeToo debate and the recent gang rapes, the issue of sexual violence against women is going to be a key issue ahead of next year's general election in Sweden.

The protesters in Malmo outlined a series of demands on the Swedish government: tougher punishment for rapes, a Minster of Justice with competence in sexual violence issues and a National Police Commissioner 'who cares about women'.

The demonstrators were also protesting police advice that women stay indoors, which was issued on Sunday.

'It's about common sense. We are not warning people not to be outside, but to think twice and maybe not walk alone late at night and instead go with others or take a taxi,' said Anders Nilsson of Malmo police who is leading the preliminary investigation.

After a national backlash, Malmo police retracted their statement come Monday, with Mr Nilsson saying he had been 'clumsy' choosing his words. .",JustBadNews,0
"Comcast Hikes Prices, Increases Sneaky Fees for 2018",http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Comcast-Hikes-Prices-Increases-Sneaky-Fees-for-2018-140907,"Comcast Hikes Prices, Increases Sneaky Fees for 2018 Comcast is joining Dish, Cox and DirecTV in informing customers that they'll be paying significantly more money for the same service in the new year. Users in our Comcast Xfinity forum say they're being told that the company is preparing monthly price hikes of $1 to $5 for most of the company's pay TV services. Comcast's is also jacking up the price it charges for premium channels, as well as its monthly ""Regional Sports fee"" from $5 to $6.75 per month.

Users are also being informed that Comcast is bumping its misleading ""Broadcast TV fee"" from $7 per month to $8. The broadcast TV fee simply takes a portion of Comcast's programming costs and buries it below the line, resulting in users facing bill shock when they realize they'll be paying more than they signed up for. That fee was just $1.50 when introduced in 2013, and provides a wonderful way for Comcast to falsely advertise a lower rate. Comcast is facing several lawsuits over the misleading nature of both the broadcast TV and its regional sports fees. Even Comcast's streaming TV service Instant TV, barely a year old, is seeing price hikes. Users that subscribe to this service can expect to pay $3 to $3.50 more per month in the new year. And in case you were about to blame all of these hikes on broadcasters (which Comcast NBC Universal already is anyway), Comcast will be raising prices on most of the company's hardware rental fees as well. These hikes come after Comcast fought tooth and nail to scuttle an FCC effort to bring greater competition to the cable box. Modem rental fees will be bumped $1 to $11 per month, while missed payment fees are also being increased fifty cents to $10. This This full thread in our forum has a breakdown of all the looming changes.

Belzoni, MS 18 recommendations stephend2 Member Noone is talking about what the programmers are doing to cable providers... I'll give my perspective as a small cable operator...



This year on my retransmission consent renewals for locals, I had a 350-400% increase across the board and they would not negotiate very far. I know big corporations are getting better deals on programming and such, but in my case, it really hurts. I had to increase expanded basic rate $20 per month to stay in business another 3 years. Now with that said, I'll probably not have to raise rates in 2019 but what happens when the 3 yr contract runs out, what are they going to try to do to me at the end of 2020 ? At this time, I have a bunch of angry customers, but our price is still better than Dish/Direct even with their promotions for a similar package. I get that they are overcharging but there is no love for the small guys around here. We have a thriving business, and we save our customers by bundling voice and data with video. I see the big corporations charging more and more for internet access...its crazy...even at my scale of operation, bandwidth gets cheaper every contract renewal. I'm turning up a 10 gig pipe in January for less money than I'm paying ATT for 1 gig now.



I think people are just conditioned to hate cable. I mean I catch it all the time, ""you're a small local company, you should charge less"" Noone realizes that we pay more for programming than any larger operator. Yet we will offer a nice channel lineup for $85 out the door, with some channels in HD and a lot more coming soon, including 4 HD set tops as we're phasing in digital service now.



It just angers me a little that all the press does is bash the big guys, noone thinks about rural america and the little guys that make things happen there. We may not offer gigabit to the home (yet) but I think 100/25 for $70 in a rural market is more than fair, and so do my customers. What does Comcast charge for a triple play bundle by the time you add all the fees and such? I can tell you here it's $130/month out the door, no BS, nothing below the line, what you see is what you get.

@coasttelephone.com 10 recommendations Anond8d80 Anon Comcast ""traffic shaping"" SIP traffic!!! Before NN was put into place during the Obama Admin. Comcast would play this sneaky little game with my VOIP customers. They would traffic shape (block) port 5060-5070 randomly on modems through my service area. After realizing there was trouble, I would change the port numbers of the customers devices to a non SIP range and they could use their phones again. Within a week, someone would call or visit the location from Comcast Sales and attempt to sell them on Comcast Voice services. This had happened over and over again. I have already educated my customers using COMCAST as their connection that this SCAM is something to expect after NN is repealed. They have all been offered 2 month of free service IF they are contacted by comcast and they can supply me with the contact name and information that was provided about the visit/call. As of today I am here to report that COMCAST is back at it again. This time they are shaking it up a little bit different and they are MUCH faster with their SCAM. I have had THREE of my custom all report this week they were contacted. BY THE SAME SALES PERSON! Exactly three days AFTER the contact, these same customers experienced disruptions in their VOIP services. The nature of the marketing attempt was digging in to find out what these people were using and the benefits over my service. One of which is choppy audio and intermittent downtime as a result of it being an ""INTERNET"" connected VOIP solution and that Comcast was NOT VOIP but LANDLINE. I have also educated my customers that these connections STILL operate on Comcast over a SIP based network as my service is, with the only difference that their connection travels on a private MPLS type service and is subject the same choppy and intermittent downtime.



NOW my customers are reporting CHOPPY AUDIO and INTERMITTENT DOWNTIME. After changing the port numbers to something outside of the 5060-5070 range, services returned back to normal and the choppy audio ended.



I have ordered VPN routers for all of my customers using COMCAST and will implement measures so that COMCAST can no longer MONITOR traffic to or from my networks.



This is the same ANT-COMPETITIVE behavior these scum bag corporate pricks have played in the past, and I lost customers and hundreds of thousands in future revenue due to the tricks these asshats have played in the past. NOT AGAIN! I have already sent out an education e-mail to each customers as I mentioned above, and I am offering the free upgrades to our protected VPN connection or offering alternative delivery methods that are NOT COMCAST!



Isn't that COMCASTIC?

"Forcing kid to masturbate for cops in sexting case was wrong, court finds",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/forcing-kid-to-masturbate-for-cops-in-sexting-case-was-wrong-court-finds/,"A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday in favor of a Virginia man who, as a teen, was once ordered by a lower court to be photographed while masturbating in the presence of armed police officers.

That warrant was ostensibly part of an ongoing sexting investigation into the then-teen, Trey Sims, who had exchanged explicit messages with his then-15-year-old girlfriend. Her mother reported the incident to the Manassas City Police Department in January 2014.

Eventually, the detective assigned to the case, David Abbott, obtained a signed warrant to take photographs of Sims' naked body—including ""the suspect’s erect penis""—so that he could compare them to Sims' explicit messages.

When this bizarre effort was unsuccessfully attempted, Abbott then obtained a second warrant authorizing police to escort Sims to a hospital for an ""erection-inducing injection."" This injection ultimately never took place after massive public outcry.

Abbott committed suicide in December 2015 when officers came to arrest him on separate charges relating to pedophilia.

Ultimately, Sims served one year of probation. By early 2016, Sims sued Abbott's estate, alleging violations of the Fourth Amendment, among other accusations.

Lawyers representing the Abbott estate argued that their client was shielded by "" qualified immunity ,"" the notion in American law that generally protects law enforcement officers in gray-area situations from legal liability.

In a 2-1 majority opinion, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals found Tuesday that the initial warrant against Sims was an ""obvious, unconstitutional violation.""

The 4th Circuit ruled that Sims' lawsuit against the estate of the now-deceased officer who had led the sexting investigation, David Abbott, could move forward. ""We cannot perceive any circumstance that would justify a police search requiring an individual to masturbate in the presence of others,"" two of the 4th Circuit judges wrote. ""Sexually invasive searches require that the search bear some discernible relationship with safety concerns, suspected hidden contraband, or evidentiary need.""

The case will now be sent back down to a federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia.",JustBadNews,0
"China spying through 42 apps, delete them: Indian Intelligence Bureau to soldiers",http://zeenews.india.com/india/china-spying-through-42-apps-delete-them-intelligence-bureau-to-soldiers-2061277.html,"NEW DELHI: In a fresh advisory issued to the troops posted at the international border, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) has warned that China could be collecting vital information about the Indian security installations through its popular mobile phone apps and devices.

According to reports, the advisory issued by the DIG (Intelligence) has directed the troops posted along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to either delete a number of mobile applications from their smartphones or reformat the devices altogether to guard against online espionage attempts from across the border.

The IB advisory contains a list of about 42 popular Chinese apps, including WeChat, Truecaller, Weibo, UC Browser and UC News, which pose a grave threat to India's security.

There is a possibility of these apps transmitting sensitive personal data to the Chinese authorities, which could be a major security disaster, the advisory states.

The fresh advisory comes at a time when the troops from both sides continue to maintain high alertness levels along the LAC after the resolution of a bitter border stand-off over Doklam.

Based on inputs received from the intelligence agencies, the armed forces regularly warn its officers and other ranks to avoid using Chinese apps in a bid to thwart the possible leak of vital info to the hostile neighbouring country via China-made mobile devices.

The Army, as well as the central armed police forces like the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, are deployed along the 4,057km LAC, which stretches from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.

The IAF, for instance, had earlier asked all its officers and airmen as well as their families to avoid using Chinese Xiaomi smartphones and notebooks on the ground that they could transfer user data to remote servers located in China.

The note comes at a time when several Indian cybersecurity experts have raised concerns about the possible espionage attempts by the Chinese hackers and various military intelligence agencies of China.

Comcast quietly drops promise not to charge tolls for Internet fast lanes,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/comcast-quietly-drops-promise-not-to-charge-tolls-for-internet-fast-lanes/,"For years, Comcast has been promising that it won't violate the principles of net neutrality, regardless of whether the government imposes any net neutrality rules. That meant that Comcast wouldn't block or throttle lawful Internet traffic and that it wouldn't create fast lanes in order to collect tolls from Web companies that want priority access over the Comcast network.

This was one of the ways in which Comcast argued that the Federal Communications Commission should not reclassify broadband providers as common carriers, a designation that forces ISPs to treat customers fairly in other ways. The Title II common carrier classification that makes net neutrality rules enforceable isn't necessary because ISPs won't violate net neutrality principles anyway, Comcast and other ISPs have claimed.

But with Republican Ajit Pai now in charge at the Federal Communications Commission, Comcast's stance has changed. While the company still says it won't block or throttle Internet content, it has dropped its promise about not instituting paid prioritization.

Instead, Comcast now vaguely says that it won't ""discriminate against lawful content"" or impose ""anti-competitive paid prioritization."" The change in wording suggests that Comcast may offer paid fast lanes to websites or other online services, such as video streaming providers, after Pai's FCC eliminates the net neutrality rules next month.

With no FCC rules against paid fast lanes, it would be up to Comcast to decide whether any specific prioritization deal is ""anti-competitive"" before implementing it. Pai argues that the Federal Trade Commission and other antitrust authorities would take over regulation in this area, and the FTC could attempt to stop specific deals after they are put into place. But the FTC's enforcement powers are limited.

We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content. We will continue to make sure that our policies are clear and transparent for consumers, and we will not change our commitment to these principles. pic.twitter.com/19PFCPJ3TY — Comcast (@comcast) November 22, 2017

“Comcast has never offered paid prioritization”

Comcast is the largest home Internet provider in the US, with more than 23.5 million residential Internet subscribers. In May 2014, Comcast Senior Executive VP David Cohen wrote the following:

To be clear, Comcast has never offered paid prioritization, we are not offering it today, and we're not considering entering into any paid prioritization creating fast lane deals with content owners.

Six months later, Comcast made the promise again, saying, ""We don't prioritize Internet traffic or have paid fast lanes, and have no plans to do so."" Comcast said that it agreed with then-President Obama's stance that there should be ""no paid prioritization.""

The circumstances in 2014 were different than they are today. Back then, the FCC clearly intended to impose at least some restrictions on paid prioritization, and ISPs were trying to avoid the Title II classification. Comcast had also agreed to some limitations on paid prioritization as a condition on its 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal.

But the NBCUniversal conditions expire in September 2018, and Pai's proposal would undo the Title II classification and get rid of the net neutrality rules entirely. Both legally and politically, Comcast now has an opening to retreat at least partially from its net neutrality promises.

Comcast's change in strategy was evident in July of this year when Comcast urged the FCC to overturn the Title II order.

""[W]e do not and will not block, slow down, or discriminate against lawful content,"" Comcast wrote at the time, omitting its previous promise to avoid paid prioritization.

The FCC, Comcast said, could remove the Title II classification while still having ""clearly defined net neutrality principles—no blocking, no throttling, no anti-competitive paid prioritization, and full transparency.""

As it turned out, Pai's final plan that will be voted on December 14 doesn't even ban blocking or throttling. Comcast could thus pull back even further from its net neutrality promises, but as of last week it was still promising that it won't block or throttle lawful Internet traffic.

The cable lobby group NCTA similarly promised this year that its members will not ""block, throttle or otherwise impair your online activity,"" but it made no promises about paid prioritization. In 2014, the NCTA said that ""no ISPs offer"" paid prioritization.

Comcast’s future fast lanes

The remaining question is how Comcast's paid fast lanes would be implemented.

We contacted Comcast today to ask how it defines ""anti-competitive paid prioritization."" A spokesperson did not answer that question but referred us back to previous Comcast statements on the topic.

Comcast's promise not to ""discriminate"" suggests that its paid prioritization would be available to anyone who wants it and can afford it. Offering paid fast lanes to anyone at similar rates could help prevent the Federal Trade Commission from stepping in to block unfair trade practices.

Comcast's July 2017 filing with the FCC offers some hints on how the ISP will implement paid prioritization:

[T]he Commission also should bear in mind that a more flexible approach to prioritization may be warranted and may be beneficial to the public. For example, a telepresence service tailored for the hearing impaired requires high-definition video that is of sufficiently reliable quality to permit users ""to perceive subtle hand and finger motions"" in real time. And paid prioritization may have other compelling applications in telemedicine. Likewise, for autonomous vehicles that may require instantaneous data transmission, black letter prohibitions on paid prioritization may actually stifle innovation instead of encouraging it. Commercial arrangements that entail prioritizing such traffic could ensure the low latency levels needed to achieve the high level of data quality necessary for such services to thrive.

Comcast stood by its 2014 statement in support of a rebuttable presumption against ""exclusive [paid prioritization] arrangements and arrangements that prioritize a broadband provider's own affiliated content vis-à-vis unaffiliated content.""

Though Comcast says paid prioritization would benefit telemedicine applications, the existing rules already allow ISPs to provide isolated network capacity for telemedicine , as we've previously written. VoIP phone offerings, heart monitors, and energy consumption sensors are also allowed under this exception to the net neutrality rules.

The net neutrality rules also don't outlaw the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) that optimize delivery of Internet content to the edge of an ISP's network. Comcast itself debuted a CDN service in 2014 that places video content closer to customers' homes. But Pai's plan to eliminate the rules will let ISPs offer higher speeds over the network's so-called ""last mile"" that leads directly into consumers' homes and will offer the fast lanes to any type of online business.

Proponents of net neutrality rules say this will harm companies that can't afford to pay tolls to Comcast and other ISPs.

""Without these rules, Internet service providers will be able to favor certain websites and e-businesses... over others by putting the ones that can pay in fast lanes and slowing down or even blocking others,"" over 200 business and trade organizations wrote in a letter to Pai Monday.

"Donald Trump running the most dishonest White House ever, says historian. 'This is the kind of thing you see when you're dealing with a malignant narcissist'.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-white-house-liar-us-president-dishonest-history-richard-nixon-robert-dallek-oval-offic-a8073036.html,"Donald Trump’s lies have created an administration “comfortable with corruption”, a historian who studies past presidencies has said.

Robert Dallek, who has written a number of books including Franklin Roosevelt: A Political Life, believes the current administration ranks as one of the most corrupt in US history.

“Trump is the head of government, and people know they can get away with things,” he said in an interview with Vox.

Donald Trump says 'Im the only one who matters'

“Like Nixon, Trump has created a culture in his administration in which people feel comfortable with corruption.”

Asked whether the Trump administration was the most dishonest he had ever seen or studied, he replied: ""Yes. Politicians lie, but this is different.""

Listing examples of corruption in the White House - including the indictment of Mr Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s failure to disclose $1 billion in loans connected to his real estate company - Mr Dallek said the President’s habit of lying was to blame.

“Again, Trump’s lying is a big facilitator of all this corruption. This is a guy who will look right into the camera and lie without any hesitation at all.

“It’s hard to overstate what kind of tone that sets in an administration; it makes everyone more comfortable when they lie, when they deceive, when they cover things up,” he said.

Mr Dallek went on to describe the President as a “pathological” liar.

“This is the kind of thing you see when you’re dealing with a malignant narcissist, someone who believes everything revolves around him,” he said.

Trump-Russia investigation: who has been charged in the Mueller probe

Scandals have rocked the White House throughout history, the historian said, making reference to former president Richard Nixon and Watergate and pointing out that Bill Clinton lied “shamelessly” during his presidency.

But Mr Trump’s administration is still a “low point in our history”, Mr Dallek said.

F.C.C. Announces Plan to Repeal Net Neutrality,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html,"The Federal Communications Commission released a plan on Tuesday to dismantle landmark regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites.

The proposal, made by the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, is a sweeping repeal of rules put in place by the Obama administration. The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services.

The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points.

“Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,” Mr. Pai said in a statement. “Instead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them.”",JustBadNews,0
Google collects Android users' locations even when location services are disabled,https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/,"Many people realize that smartphones track their locations. But what if you actively turn off location services, haven’t used any apps, and haven’t even inserted a carrier SIM card?

Even if you take all of those precautions, phones running Android software gather data about your location and send it back to Google when they’re connected to the internet, a Quartz investigation has revealed.

Since the beginning of 2017, Android phones have been collecting the addresses of nearby cellular towers—even when location services are disabled—and sending that data back to Google. The result is that Google, the unit of Alphabet behind Android, has access to data about individuals’ locations and their movements that go far beyond a reasonable consumer expectation of privacy.

Quartz observed the data collection occur and contacted Google, which confirmed the practice.

The cell tower addresses have been included in information sent to the system Google uses to manage push notifications and messages on Android phones for the past 11 months, according to a Google spokesperson. They were never used or stored, the spokesperson said, and the company is now taking steps to end the practice after being contacted by Quartz. By the end of November, the company said, Android phones will no longer send cell-tower location data to Google, at least as part of this particular service, which consumers cannot disable.

“In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery,” the Google spokesperson said in an email. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.”

Obtained by Quartz A cell-tower location sent to Google from an Android device.

It is not clear how cell-tower addresses, transmitted as a data string that identifies a specific cell tower, could have been used to improve message delivery. But the privacy implications of the covert location-sharing practice are plain. While information about a single cell tower can only offer an approximation of where a mobile device actually is, multiple towers can be used to triangulate its location to within about a quarter-mile radius, or to a more exact pinpoint in urban areas, where cell towers are closer together.

The practice is troubling for people who’d prefer they weren’t tracked, especially for those such as law-enforcement officials or victims of domestic abuse who turn off location services thinking they’re fully concealing their whereabouts. Although the data sent to Google is encrypted, it could potentially be sent to a third party if the phone had been compromised with spyware or other methods of hacking. Each phone has a unique ID number, with which the location data can be associated.

The revelation comes as Google and other internet companies are under fire from lawmakers and regulators, including for the extent to which they vacuum up data about users. Such personal data, ranging from users’ political views to their purchase histories to their locations, are foundational to the business successes of companies like Facebook and Alphabet, built on targeted advertising and personalization and together valued at over $1.2 trillion by investors.

Obtained by Quartz Cell-tower locations collected and sent to Google from an Android phone with location services turned off and carried in Washington, DC.

The location-sharing practice does not appear to be limited to any particular type of Android phone or tablet; Google was apparently collecting cell tower data from all modern Android devices before being contacted by Quartz. A source familiar with the matter said the cell tower addresses were being sent to Google after a change in early 2017 to the Firebase Cloud Messaging service, which is owned by Google and runs on Android phones by default.

Even devices that had been reset to factory default settings and apps, with location services disabled, were observed by Quartz sending nearby cell-tower addresses to Google. Devices with a cellular data or WiFi connection appear to send the data to Google each time they come within range of a new cell tower. When Android devices are connected to a WiFi network, they will send the tower addresses to Google even if they don’t have SIM cards installed.

“It has pretty concerning implications,” said Bill Budington, a software engineer who works for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization that advocates for digital privacy. “You can kind of envision any number of circumstances where that could be extremely sensitive information that puts a person at risk.”

The section of Google’s privacy policy that covers location sharing says the company will collect location information from devices that use its services, but does not indicate whether it will collect data from Android devices when location services are disabled:

When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.

According to the Google spokesperson, the company’s system that controls its push notifications and messages is “distinctly separate from Location Services, which provide a device’s location to apps.” Android devices never offered consumers a way to opt out of the collection of cell tower data.

“It is really a mystery as to why this is not optional,” said Matthew Hickey, a security expert and researcher at Hacker House, a security firm based in London. “It seems quite intrusive for Google to be collecting such information that is only relevant to carrier networks when there are no SIM card or enabled services.”

While Google says it doesn’t use the location data it collects using this service, its does allow advertisers to target consumers using location data, an approach that has obvious commercial value. The company can tell using precise location tracking, for example, whether an individual with an Android phone or running Google apps has set foot in a specific store, and use that to target the advertising a user subsequently sees.",JustBadNews,0
"If you tax the rich, they won't leave: US data contradicts millionaires' threats",https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/20/if-you-tax-the-rich-they-wont-leave-us-data-contradicts-millionaires-threats,"Does raising taxes on the rich really trigger their migration to more obliging states or countries? This study of every million-dollar earner in the US shows otherwise

In the classic Ayn Rand novel Atlas Shrugged, the rich go “on strike” – withdrawing their services and disappearing from society in protest against taxes and regulation. Weary of carrying an ungrateful world on their shoulders, business leaders and other top income earners finally shrug, and leave the world without them.

The book’s metaphor inspires political rhetoric to this day: if you tax the rich, they will leave. Variations on the threat are issued by well-off individuals all over the world – not least in the United States, where each state sets its own tax policies, and periodic warnings are issued that taxes on the rich will lead to millionaire migration to more obliging US states.

When Oregon voters passed a millionaire tax at the start of this decade, for example, the state’s richest resident, Nike CEO Phil Knight, warned the tax would set off a “death spiral … in which thousands of our most successful residents will leave”. As California considered similar taxes, policymakers cautioned “nothing is more mobile than a millionaire and his money”. In New Jersey, governor Chris Christie simply stated: “Ladies and Gentlemen, if you tax them, they will leave.”

But does this rhetoric stand up to statistical scrutiny? To better understand elite migration across state lines, I analysed tax return data from every million-dollar income-earner in the United States. The dataset includes 3.7 million top-earning individuals, who collectively filed more than 45 million tax returns over more than a dozen years – showing where millionaires live and where they move to.

And it turns out that place still matters for the rich – much more so than we might think.

Only about 2.4% of US-based millionaires change their state of residence in a given year. Interstate migration is actually more common among the US middle class, and almost twice as common among its poorest residents, who have an annual interstate migration rate of 4.5%.

While travel may be a classic “luxury good”, migration is not. Moving one’s home, life and family to a different place is mostly about people who have a poor economic fit with where they live, earn below-market incomes, and are struggling to find a livelihood. Higher income earners show low migration levels because they are not searching for economic success – they’ve already found it.

When millionaires do move, they admittedly tend to favour lower-tax states over higher-tax ones – but only marginally so. Around 15% of interstate millionaire migrations bring a net tax advantage. The other 85% have no net tax impact for the movers.

Furthermore, almost all of the tax-migration moves are to just one low-tax state: Florida – where low-income taxes comingle with sun, sand and palm trees. Other low-tax states such as Texas, Tennessee and Nevada do not pick up any net tax-migration. So while some millionaires have moved to lower tax states over the years 1999-2011, the flows have been too small to change the geography of the economic elite in America.

The world view

The Forbes list of the world’s billionaires offers an international look at elite migration, and takes us higher up the food chain to the greatest corners of wealth.

Analysis of this list shows most of the world’s billionaires – about 84% – still live in their country of birth. And among those who do live abroad, most moved to their current country of residence long before they became wealthy – either as children with their parents, or as students going abroad to study (and then staying).

The world’s billionaires largely live where they were born or where they began their careers

Only about 5% of world billionaires moved abroad after they became successful. These individuals readily fit the stereotype of a “transnational capitalist class” – unplugged from their nation state, travelling the world for some combination of tax avoidance and cosmopolitan lifestyle.

Many of them can be found in London claiming “non-dom” status to avoid the tax laws of both their homeland and those that apply to British citizens. Others are located in tropical tax havens – such as Sir Richard Branson, who moved to the British Virgin Islands after becoming a billionaire.

These jet-setting billionaires generate a lot of headlines and cynicism about tax flight. But they are anecdotal exceptions. The world’s billionaires largely live where they were born or where they began their careers. The British elite live in Britain, the Chinese elite live in China, and the American elite live in America. After making it on to the Forbes billionaire list, elites are actually more likely to die than to move to a different country.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Source: American Community Survey (2005-14)

Why do the rich have such low migration rates? And why is common intuition about elite migration so wrong? It turns out that education is a big part of the remaining puzzle.

People with high levels of education have very high mobility – but only for a short period after finishing their education. If you know people who have been geographically mobile, the chances are they have a higher-level education. However, once they have made a solid start to their career, the chances are also that they will not move again.

Millionaire tax revenues could be used to invest in things that matter to young people starting out

Migration is a young person’s game, and moving overwhelmingly occurs when people are starting their careers. By the time people hit their early forties, PhDs, college grads and high school drop-outs all show the same low rate of migration.

Typically, millionaires are society’s highly educated at an advanced career stage. They are typically the late-career working rich: established professionals in management, finance, consulting, medicine, law and similar fields. And they have low migration because they are both socially and economically embedded in place.

In the US tax data, while most of the millionaires’ incomes come from wages and salaries, a quarter of them also own a business. Almost all of them are married, and most have children at home. For all these reasons, places are sticky – it is hard to move after making a career and family in a place.

If millionaires were mostly college-going twentysomethings not yet tied to place by career or family responsibilities, place-based income tax systems would face serious challenges. We would be trying to tax the rich exactly when they are most mobile. But this is not the case. Typically, people make decisions about where to live almost two decades before they hit their peak earnings.

This shows a kind of unexpected genius behind taxes on the very highest incomes. A tax on million-dollar income serves as an intergenerational transfer, since those who pay it are the late-career working rich: socially and economically embedded in the place.

The Inequality Project: the Guardian's in-depth look at our unequal world Read more

In contrast, most of the people who are mobile – early career professionals – do not really care about the “millionaire tax”, because if they ever pay it, it will be decades in the future, and only if they are wildly successful.

Millionaire tax revenues could be used to invest in things that matter to young people starting out: education, infrastructure, public services, urban amenities, quality of life. And this would help to attract and retain a pipeline of future top-earners, creating a virtuous tax circle.

This is why places with highly progressive income taxes – such as New York and California – still thrive as centres for talent and elite economic success. Their policies focus on the pipeline of future top earners. They invest in what attracts mobile young professionals – quality of life – and only send them the bill if and when they achieve their highest aspirations.",JustBadNews,0
Ivanka's signature real estate deals were disasters linked to drug cartels and money laundering: The president's daughter has been at the center of a pair of the presidential projects tied most closely to grand corruption.,https://thinkprogress.org/ivankas-real-estate-deals-corruption-33f65f778d0f/,"Before her father became president, Ivanka Trump tied herself more closely to two of her father’s international projects than any others.

One, in Panama, was the current president’s first international foray — a building, according to the developer, that Donald Trump wanted to be Ivanka’s “baby.” The other, in Azerbaijan, was a project Ivanka herself claimed she “oversaw” — one for which, according to an Azeri lawyer involved with the project, the president’s daughter “personally approved everything.”

Neither project succeeded, at least from the Trumps’ point of view. The board of directors of Panama’s Trump Ocean Club eventually fired Trump’s management company, citing budget over-runs and improper bonuses. Meanwhile, the development of Trump Tower Baku was so poorly managed — thanks to shoddy construction and missing payments — that The New Yorker dubbed the building “Trump’s worst deal.” Both remain marked blots on the president’s supposed business chops — and on the record of his daughter, who remains a special adviser to the president.

But a pair of recent, in-depth investigations reveal the bungled buildings point to far more concerning missteps than mistimed bonuses or poor designs. The president and his daughter appear to have been, at best, unwitting accomplices to money laundering and grand corruption on a significant scale.

The project in Azerbaijan has been tied to allegations of money laundering from the Azeri dictatorship and those close to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard; the project in Panama has been tied to allegations of money laundering from South American drug cartels. In both instances, the Trumps apparently ignored clear signs of the corruption and money laundering drenching Ivanka’s pet projects.

“Trump’s current wealth has depended in part on securing significant infusions of untraceable foreign funds.”

“Trump’s business approach,” wrote anti-corruption group Global Witness in a recent report, “has been to lease his name and for him and his family to drum up sales in some of the world’s dirty money hotspots, in some instances aided — knowingly or unwittingly — by networks of money launderers. The result is that Trump’s current wealth has depended in part on securing significant infusions of untraceable foreign funds.”

While neither the president nor his daughter appear willing to comment on their dealings in Panama or Azerbaijan, a series of reports over the past few months have helped highlight how Trump and his daughter missed even the most basic red flags when it came to these buildings.

Panamanian Paper

The president’s and his daughter’s Panamanian construct, Trump Ocean Beach, was once described by Ivanka as her family’s “largest project in all of the Americas.”

In a report published last week, Global Witness details how the building to which Trump leased his name helped launder “proceeds from Colombian cartels’ narcotics trafficking.” And as Global Witness found, Donald Trump himself “was one of the beneficiaries” of such laundering practices. Information available from a bonds sales prospectus revealed that the Trump Organization would see revenue from every unit sold at Trump Ocean Club.

Even if Trump and Ivanka were somehow unaware that the building served as a spigot for laundering cartel cash, it would have been difficult to miss the signs that Trump Ocean Club — set up during the years that Panama came into its own as an offshore haven — was being used for money laundering on a massive scale.

There were several obvious signs that Trump Ocean Club was laundering cash:

Many of the units were purchased in cash, an easy means of obscuring payments. According to the lawyer for a convicted fraudster — a criminal who acted as a “key player” in laundering drug money at Trump Ocean Club, per Global Witness — the cash that purchased the Trump Ocean Club units found its way to Panama via “mules” crossing the border from Colombia. Numerous units were purchased in bulk, a common practice behind money laundering. Numerous units were purchased via anonymous, untraceable shell companies, dozens of which contained “Trump” in their names. Anonymous shell companies, as real estate brokers from Seattle to New York to London can attest, remain one of the most popular means of laundering ill-gotten gains. Some purchases were even conducted via “bearer shares,” according to sources. “Bearer shares,” in which the holder of a certain piece of paper is the literal holder of the related share, remain so notoriously linked to money laundering that they’ve been outlawed in jurisdictions like the Bahamas, the United Kingdom, and — as of 2013, after the bulk sales at Trump Ocean Club — Panama.

“When I was in Panama I was regularly laundering money for more than a dozen companies.”

As with other assorted Trump properties, including those in South Florida, many of the clientele in Panama were among the wealthiest actors from Russia — a reality that may have piqued the interest of special prosecutor Robert Mueller. Some of the buyers, according to those interviewed by Global Witness, were connected to Russia’s mafia underworld, a type of client familiar to Trump.

But if these glaring signs weren’t enough, a Reuters investigation also found that Alexandre Henrique Ventura Nogueira, the building’s primary broker, admitted that he offered money laundering among his services. “When I was in Panama I was regularly laundering money for more than a dozen companies,” said Ventura Nogueira, who was arrested in Panama a few years ago on charges of forgery and fraud.

According to Reuters, Ventura Nogueira worked closely with Ivanka on the Panamanian project, meeting with her at least 10 times. Ventura Nogueira told the publication that Ivanka was “ultimately responsible for all aspects of the [Trump Ocean Club] licensing deal for the Trump Organization.” The building, added Global Witness, came with Ivanka’s “personal touch.”

The president’s daughter has remained mum publicly on the project, despite singing its praises in its early days. “Some people say it resembles a giant ‘D,’” she said a few years ago, laughing.

According to information available, the president looked to profit handsomely from the building: “Trump stood to gain $75.4 million from the [Trump Ocean Club] by the fall of 2010,” according to Global Witness, pointing out that the building was “one of Trump’s most lucrative licensing deals to date.” Moreover, Global Witness added, the Trumps “likely continue to profit from the Trump Ocean Club” — a likelihood the president, and his daughter, continue to avoid addressing, ignoring questions from multiple reporters about the Panama property.

The Azeri Laundromat

While the Trumps’ involvement in Panama netted them a fine profit, their work in Azerbaijan didn’t reach nearly the same level of revenue. As an in-depth look from The New Yorker’s Adam Davidson earlier this year found, the Trump Tower Baku project attempted to capitalize on the country’s oil boom, which coincided with the country’s slide into kleptocracy. The project was effectively taken over by Ivanka — and began floundering almost as quickly.

Not only was Ivanka the most senior Trump Organization official attached to the project, but, as she said, she also “oversaw” the building’s construction nearly from the get-go.

“Corruption warning signs are rarely more obvious.”

At the beginning, Ivanka wasn’t shy about pushing the project to her international audience. On her website, Ivanka claimed that the “new Trump Tower will join a wave of modern architecture in the city and will make for an exciting addition to the Trump Organization’s expanding portfolio.” Elsewhere, on her Instagram, Ivanka lavished praise on the building’s host city, saying the building would open in 2015.

But then, things started to go wrong. The building’s location, for some reason, saw the tower placed in one of city’s lesser-developed neighborhoods, rather than the heart of Baku. The Trumps also opted to work with close relatives of Azerbaijan’s then-transportation minister, Ziya Mammadov — an oligarch described by U.S. diplomats as “notoriously corrupt even for Azerbaijan.”

The red flags for the project in Azerbaijan, a country that remains a stalwart of international kleptocracy, were impossible to miss.

As an assistant dean at George Washington University Law School told Davidson, “The entire Baku deal is a giant red flag — the direct involvement of foreign government officials and their relatives in Azerbaijan with ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Corruption warning signs are rarely more obvious.”

According to Davidson’s research, the construction of the building, which may well have been used to launder funds from those tied to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, put the Trumps in possible violation of the U.S.’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA, originally passed in 1977, remains one of the U.S.’s primary tools in combating foreign corruption, prohibiting American individuals and companies from bribing foreign officials. Indeed, the FCPA was, as Southern Illinois University Law Professor Mike Koehler wrote a few years ago, the “first law in the world governing domestic business conduct with foreign government officials in foreign market.”

For good measure, the Iranian government maintains an outsized track record of using shell companies — especially American shell companies — to hide its financing, including, in one notable instance, holding a New York skyscraper to draw revenue and skirt sanctions.

Trump has made his opposition to the FCPA known in the past, describing it once as a “horrible law.” But even the president, and his daughter alongside, isn’t immune from laws he may dislike. The allegations of the Trumps’ dealings in Azerbaijan were significant enough that multiple senators in Washington called for an inquiry into the president’s and his daughter’s work in Baku.

At some point earlier this year, Ivanka removed all information about the Azerbaijan project from her website, although it remains available via Internet Archive.

A screenshot from Ivanka's website, since taken down, praising her project in Azerbaijan - a project later described as ""Trump's worst deal.""

And the building, as anyone who’s visited Baku recently will note, stands as a shell – stripped of its promise and Trump’s name alike.

American kleptocrats

The Trumps have distanced themselves from the projects once shepherded by Ivanka in both Panama and Azerbaijan – but not before both projects attracted allegations of massive money laundering, and not after the president and his daughter decided to ignore some of the clearest signs of grand corruption that exist.

It remains unclear if the Trumps were aware of the direct sources of cartel-linked funds in Panama, or of how gleefully Azerbaijan’s dictatorship or Iran’s Revolutionary Guard viewed the Trumps’ Baku project. As Global Witness wrote, “This narrative of plausible deniability re-occurs across Trump’s projects.”

But as the FCPA makes clear, even a willful blindness isn’t a sufficient defense against allegations of international bribery and money laundering. Neither, in Ivanka’s case, is scrubbing your website of references to a building tied to kleptocrats’ funds — nor ignoring the most glaring signs of drug cartel money laundering, plain for the rest of us to see, from voters to special prosecutors alike.",JustBadNews,0
"'It's OK To Be White' Flyers Posted At UC Davis, Other Campuses",http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/11/11/its-ok-to-be-white-flyers-posted-at-uc-davis/,"DAVIS (CBS SF) — Flyers with “It’s okay to be white” messages were found all over the University of California, Davis campus last week.

The flyers were on sandwich boards, underneath bridges and on garbage cans. The signs went up in campus cultural safe zones, too.

“There was also one next to the Chicano Latino Resource Center, as well,” said student Ales Lee. “Are you insinuating that people of color are saying it’s bad to be white?”

Lee is on the UC Davis Black Leadership Council. The group called a town hall meeting Friday to discuss the issue and discuss racial tension on campus.

“Whoever is posting these photos, I don’t think they’re realizing how triggering these posters are for people,” says Lee.

"Bangladesh: Mob of 20,000 torches Hindu village for 'insulting' Prophet Mohammed; 1 dead, 5 injured",http://www.ibtimes.co.in/bangladesh-mob-20000-torches-hindu-village-insulting-prophet-mohammed-1-dead-5-injured-749170,"Social media may be an entertaining place with tons of images to look through and thousands of pieces to read, but it comes with its own set of drawbacks, some so serious that it could lead to deaths. In a heart-rending incident, a Hindu village in Bangladesh was burned down by a mob of Muslims on Friday, November 10, after rumours spread that a local had insulted Prophet Mohammed on Facebook.

One person was killed and about five others were injured after 20,000 Muslims attacked Hindu homes in Thakurbari village, about 300 kilometres away from Dhaka. The angry mob also set fire to about 30 Hindu houses in the village and looted and vandalised numerous other residences, reported the Dhaka Tribune.

The mob comprised residents of surrounding villages including Mominpur, Paglapeer, and Horialkuthi and they also clashed with the police, when the latter tried to control the situation. Later, the police resorted to firing rubber bullets and tear gas.

While the police managed to bring the violence under control, the angry mob lashed out at the police for its response to the incident and blocked the Rangpur-Dinajpur highway in protest. Kotwali police station Officer-in-Charge Moktarul Islam said that as the tension hadn't completely died down, a large number of police personnel had been deployed in the area, in case of an emergency.

The district administration is also investigating the incident and has promised to help the residents of the Hindu village. Meanwhile, External Affair Minister Sushma Swaraj took up the matter with Bangladesh, which in turn has also assured India that the villagers would be provided with assistance as well as compensation. Dhaka has also said that it would help the villagers to rebuild their houses, which were torched during the violence.

""We have received a detailed report of Indian high commission in Dhaka. Bangladesh authorities have assured him that compensation will be paid to affected persons to rebuild their houses and adequate security will be provided,"" she tweeted.",JustBadNews,0
"Protesters offer $150K to preserve Yellowwood, DNR sells to logging company for less",https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/11/09/dnr-receives-150-k-offer-preserve-yellowwood-sells-logging-company-less/845631001/,"Protesters offer $150K to preserve Yellowwood, DNR sells to logging company for less

Show Caption Hide Caption 200 protesters watch as state forest timber is sold 200 protesters gathered outside the Yellowwood State Forest Office to voice their dissent of logging in the state’s back country area. Despite their efforts, the Department of Natural Resources proceeded with the sale.

With about 200 protesters looking on, timber buyers submitted their bids Thursday to the Department of Natural Resources for their chance to log parts of the Yellowwood Back Country Area. The bids started as low as $70,160 while the winning bid, entered by Sullivan County-based Hamilton Logging, Inc., came in at $108,785.

But there was one intriguing — and more lucrative — offer that wasn't considered.

That offer was delivered by Daniel Antes, founder of Distinctive Hardwood Floors in Brown County. According to a letter read by Antes, hardwood executive Bobby R. Bartlet was willing to pay the DNR $150,000 — not to cut down the trees, but to preserve them for 100 years.

""We want to preserve this public legacy,"" Antes told IndyStar after the sale. ""Our goal was to get the sale to stop and give DNR the funding they're looking for and (they) actually got substantially less than we offered.""

The state would not comment on the $150,000 offer. According to Division of Forestry rules, only licensed timber buyers are permitted to bid on timber sales. Antes said the group would discuss if a similar offer could sway the winning bidder.

If that doesn't happen, those who want to to save the trees will have lost their battle. Because the state would not comment on Bartlet's offer, it's not clear whether the state could have called off the auction or otherwise taken advantage of what turned out to be an additional $40,000 above the winning bid.

The delivery of Bartlet's offer coincided with a protest of this morning's timber sale during which the couple hundred Hoosiers urged DNR to stop the sale and preserve the forest. About 1,730 trees were included in the sale, which amounts to 447,644 board feet, according to the timber sale notice.

Among the protesters were Brown County residents, environmentalists, representatives of the local hardwood industry, and members of the Indiana Forest Alliance.

The Division of Forestry is tasked with maintaining Indiana's state forests for multiple uses, including recreation, ecology and forest health, part of which includes logging.

John Seifert, state forester and director of the Division of Forestry, declined to comment on the sale, specifically, but said that the DNR uses a number of scientifically approved methods to manage Indiana's forests.

""We have to look at this as an ecosystem,"" Seifert told IndyStar. ""We have to use the best science, and that's what we're doing.""

Several concerns were raised at the protest, including the scarcity of old growth forests in the state, the endangered or threatened species that reside in this section of forest, and the issue of who, exactly, benefits from the sale.

Following the sale, the timber buyers in attendance quickly left the area and were not available for comment. Attempts to reach Hamilton Logging, Inc. after the sale were not returned.

Leslie Bishop, a retired biologist and Brown County resident, was in attendance. Last week, she delivered a letter signed by 228 scientists from across Indiana pleading with Gov. Eric Holcomb to intervene in the timber sale.

""They just sold these trees at $68 a tree,"" Bishop said. ""I mean that is not a profit.""

IndyStar confirmed that number based on the bid and the timber sale notice.

""I'm still hopeful. Holcomb could stop this right now, and all he has to do is make a phone call,"" she continued. ""I want to know where is he right now? The people have spoken, scientists have spoken, there's so many reasons why this matters.""

Bishop's letter piggybacked dozens of phone calls and public comments submitted to both the governor's office and DNR. Still, Gov. Holcomb, via a spokesperson, reiterated his support for DNR and its management plans to IndyStar on Thursday

Several Indiana timber buyers had told the IndyStar that they did not plan to bid on the sale because of the opposition to and controversy around the logging of Yellowwood. While they believed the timber to be logged would bring in ""significant monetary value,"" they said it would not be worth it.

How significant? Based on the timber sale notice, the winning bid works out to about 24 cents per board foot. According to a recent DNR analysis of timber prices, some species set to be logged could fetch as much as a dollar per board foot on the market.

This sale will be the first time this particular section of the forest has been logged since the area was designated as ""back country"" in 1981. The area is meant to offer visitors a forest experience “much the same as it may have appeared a century and a half ago,” according to a DNR article from that same year.

As part of that designation, department officials have said, single selection cutting is allowed.

The Yellowwood backcountry area is just a few decades away from looking like an old growth forest, according to David Leblanc, a professor of biology at Ball State University who specializes in forest ecology and who signed the letter. This is a stage that is characterized by a mix of tree ages, large fallen trees and some old, wide trees — unique features that develop generally without significant disturbance.

Also among the main concerns are closures to the Tecumseh and Low Gap trails that run through these parts of Yellowwood, especially for nearby tourism officials. The Tecumseh, for example, has been closed or rerouted several times due to logging in recent years.

""As one of Indiana's most forested areas, we value the natural beauty that surrounds us, as well as understand the importance it has upon our local economy,"" wrote Jane Ellis, executive director of the Brown County Convention and Visitors Bureau in an October letter to Holcomb.

She said that millions of people visit the county every year to explore and enjoy its state forests and natural resources. However, her agency has started to hear some negative feedback from visitors to the Yellowwood State Forest.

""Not only is this [logging] hindering interest and visitation to Yellowwood,"" she wrote in the letter, ""but if it continues, it could possibly negatively impact Brown County's notoriety as a premier outdoor destination, as well as revenue generated by tourism.""

After the close of the sale, many of the protesters dispersed, with a plan to meet at a home nearby and discuss future actions. Although many hoped to stop the timber sale altogether, they said they remain hopeful that they might still be able to prevent the actual harvesting.

Hamilton Logging has 14 days before it is required to pay a percentage of its bid, and the Forest Alliance said it will encourage the company to back out of the contract and accept Barlet's offer. The group and others in opposition also plan to continue pressuring the governor to consider the people of Indiana and their calls to protect the forest.

It is unclear when logging could begin on Yellowwood should the contract hold, but the logging season runs into the beginning of next year.

"Trump, Once Critical From Afar, Gives China a Pass in Trade War",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-says-he-doesn-t-blame-china-taking-advantage-u-n819221,"BEIJING — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he does not blame China for its economic success at the expense of the United States, what he called a ""one sided"" trade relationship.

""I don’t blame China,"" he said at a business event joined by Chinese President Xi Jinping. ""After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens? I give China great credit.""

The comments are a remarkable shift in tone by Trump, who campaigned on a hard-line promise to take China to task over its trade practices with the United States only to soften his language toward Beijing as president.

""I think what [Trump is] saying is that China is pursuing its own national interests,"" U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad told reporters, including NBC News, before Trump and Xi made joint remarks. ""You can’t blame any country for doing that. We just have to do a better job of doing that for the United States.""

Later, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump's comments were ""a little bit of tongue in cheek"" while also having ""a little truth"" in them.

""Look, we are where we are because previous administrations — whether through benign neglect...or for whatever reasons — allowed this to happen and allowed it to get so out of balance that now it's not an easy thing to rebalance,"" Tillerson said, giving Trump credit for telling the Chinese that it was necessary to ""change the paradigm"" on trade.

In a separate bilateral meeting earlier Thursday morning, Trump had blamed the U.S.-China trade imbalance — the Commerce Department reported a $29.9 billion trade deficit with China in September — on past administrations.

""It’s too bad that past administrations allowed it to get so far out of kilter,"" Trump said of the trade relationship. ""But we’ll make it fair and it’ll be tremendous to both of us.""

In joint remarks with Xi, Trump stressed the need to re-calibrate the relationship and said an agreement the two presidents signed Thursday morning for two-way commercial investments marked ""a very, very good start.""

Though Trump celebrated these investments — totaling over $200 billion — Tillerson told reporters in an off-camera briefing Thursday night that Chinese efforts on trade so far have been ""in the grand scheme of things...pretty small.""

""The Chinese acknowledge much more has to be done,"" the secretary of state said, adding that Trump's objectives on trade with Beijing have yet to be met.

The leaders exited after making joint remarks without taking questions — a break with precedent of former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who have pressed their Chinese counterparts to allow exchanges with reporters.

As Trump exited, a shouted question from an American reporter — ""Do you still believe China is raping the United States, Mister President?"" — went unanswered but underscored the yawning gap between the president's language on China as a candidate and as president.",JustBadNews,0

Texas City Tells People No Hurricane Harvey Aid Unless They Promise Not to Boycott Israel,https://www.aclu.org/news/texas-city-tells-people-no-hurricane-harvey-aid-unless-they-promise-not-boycott-israel,"HOUSTON — The city of Dickinson, Texas, is requiring applicants for Hurricane Harvey rebuilding funds to certify in writing that they will not take part in a boycott of Israel. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the city’s condition as a violation of free speech rights.

“The First Amendment protects Americans’ right to boycott, and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression,” said ACLU of Texas Legal Director Andre Segura. “Dickinson’s requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of ‘subversive’ activity.”

The city’s website says that it is accepting applications from individuals and businesses for grants from money donated for hurricane relief. The application says that by signing it, “the Applicant verifies that the Applicant: (1) does not boycott Israel; and (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement.”

The city appears to be enforcing a recently passed Texas law that requires all state contractors to certify that they are not participating in boycotts of Israel. While the ACLU does not take a position on boycotts of foreign countries, the organization has long supported the right to participate in political boycotts and has voiced opposition to laws and bills that infringe on the right to boycott.



The Supreme Court ruled decades ago that political boycotts are protected by the First Amendment, and other decisions have established that the government may not require individuals to sign a certification regarding their political expression in order to obtain employment, contracts, or other benefits.

On October 11, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit challenging a Kansas law on behalf of a high school math teacher who is being required by the state to certify that she won’t boycott Israel if she wants to take part in a teacher training program.

In July, the ACLU sent a letter to members of Congress opposing a bill that would make it a felony to support certain boycotts of companies doing business in Israel and its settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. As a result, Senate sponsors of the bill are considering changes.",JustBadNews,0
Judge shocked to learn NYPD's evidence database has no backup,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/nypd-database-that-tracks-seized-evidence-and-cash-has-no-backup/,"As part of an ongoing legal battle to get the New York City Police Department to track money police have grabbed in cash forfeitures, an attorney for the city told a Manhattan judge on October 17 that part of the reason the NYPD can't comply with such requests is that the department's evidence database has no backup. If the database servers that power NYPD's Property and Evidence Tracking System (PETS)—designed and installed by Capgemini under a $25.5 million contract between 2009 and 2012—were to fail, all data on stored evidence would simply cease to exist.

Courthouse News reported that Manhattan Supreme Court judge Arlene Bluth responded repeatedly to the city's attorney with the same phrase: “That’s insane.”

Last year, NYPD’s Assistant Deputy Commissioner Robert Messner told the City Council's public safety committee that “attempts to perform the types of searches envisioned in the bill will lead to system crashes and significant delays during the intake and release process.” The claim was key to the department’s refusal to provide the data accounting for the approximately $6 million seized in cash and property every year. As of 2013, according to the nonprofit group Bronx Defenders, the NYPD was carrying a balance sheet of more than $68 million in cash seized.

City attorney Neil Giovanatti continued that line of argument. He claimed that the NYPD doesn’t have the technical capability to pull an audit report from its forfeiture database—because the system wasn’t designed to do that.

But an expert witness for Bronx Defenders, which is suing for access to the data, undercut claims that the system could not produce a report on the cash. Robert Pesner, former chief enterprise architect for New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, told the court, “Based on the information I have reviewed about the technical specifications of PETS’s hardware and software, it is my opinion that it is technologically feasible to retrieve much of the data sought from PETS by running queries directly on the underlying [IBM] DB2 database.”

When it was activated in 2012, Capgemini vaunted PETS—which was built using SAP’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) software platform as well as IBM DB2 databases—as a flagship public sector project. The company went as far as submitting PETS as a nominee for the 2012 Computerworld Honors awards. But the system was apparently designed without any sort of data warehouse to perform analytics on the data.

When told by Giovanatti that the police department’s IT department did not keep backups and only knew that the database “is in IBM,"" Judge Bluth responded, “Do you want the Daily News to be reporting that you have no copy of the data?... That deserves an exposé in the New York Times.”

Update, 1:10 PM ET 10/19/2017:

Ars received the following statement from Meryl Holt, Assistant Corporation Counsel for New York City's Law Department, attempting to clarify Giovanatti's statement:

Neil tells me our whole argument is that the NYPD's database is not an IBM database so he definitely didn't say that NYPD personnel said ""the database is in IBM."" He says he was referring the Petitioner's expert, not any NYPD personnel. The ""He"" would be Robert Pesner, the Petitioner's expert, not NYPD personnel.

So, to clarify, it's the contention of the city that the system architecture spelled out by Pesner (and by Capgemini in various descriptions of the project) does not describe how data on cash forfeitures is stored. But there's still no backup of the data.

Update, 3:15 PM ET 10/19/2017:

In a statement e-mailed to Ars, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Stephen Davis made it clear that PETS itself is backed up:

Contrary to some published reports suggesting that NYPD does not electronically back up the data in its Property and Evidence Tracking System (PETS), all such data is backed up continuously in multiple data centers.

That would be consistent with the architecture described by Capgemini. But those backups are live versions of the database, based on the affadavit submitted by the city in this case.

Davis did not expound on how this connected with the statements in court that no backups were kept of cash forfeiture data—other than that data residing in a separate system from PETS entirely. Ars reached out for further clarification, but was told by a NYPD public relations officer that further information could not be provided because of ongoing litigation.",JustBadNews,0
Sperm-damaging Lead in Alex Jones Infowars Supplements,http://www.ceh.org/news-events/press-releases/content/sperm-damaging-lead-alex-jones-supplements/,"By Alexander Nazaryan ON 10/17/17 AT 1:41 PM

“If we want to defeat the globalists,” says Alex Jones in an Infowars video published last year, “we have to understand they’re using medical tyranny against us. But to get us into that globalist-controlled system, they want to make us unhealthy.” He cites fluoridated water, modified crops and cancers deployed as a form of government control.

“We are all under attack,” Jones says, so seriously that one might actually believe him.

Jones may be just the latest in a long line of snake oil salesmen in American history, a carnival barker with magic tonic to sell. His ingenuity lies in combining anti-government conspiracy theory with a robust supplement-selling operation. The Infowars store—“a one-stop shop for the modern conspiracy theorist,” as Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed once called it—is sort of like the Vitamin Shoppe remodeled by someone who, well, listens a little too closely to Alex Jones. You can find Wake Up America! Coffee (“Patriot Blend”) for the decidedly non-populist price of $17.95 per pound and organic frankincense oil ($19.95), whose “warm and spicy smell” is sure to fend off the New World Order.

But not all of Jones’s offerings are quite as harmless as essential oils or arabica beans. In fact, new research commissioned by the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) has determined that two products sold by Jones contain potentially dangerous levels of the heavy metal lead, which is universally known to be harmful to the body.

“The chemical was found in the Infowars Caveman Paleo Formula and the Info Wars Myco-ZX supplements. People who take the daily recommended dose of the Formula product would ingest more than twice the daily limit for lead under California law. People who take the Myco-ZX product would ingest more than six times the daily limit for lead under California law,” a CEH release said.

Caveman Paleo Formula is a “bone broth drink mix” that “harnesses the power of ancient supernutrients with cutting edge nutraceutical science.” It contains bee pollen and turmeric root.

Myco-ZX is “an all-natural blend of potent herbs and enzymes that support the body’s healthy detoxification of yeast and undesirable fungal organisms.” It contains licorice root and anise seed.

CEH has announced that it has filed “legal notice” against Infowars for violation of California’s law governing public exposure to toxic chemicals. That law, passed in 1986, is known as Proposition 65. It “requires businesses to notify Californians about significant amounts of chemicals in the products they purchase, in their homes or workplaces, or that are released into the environment,” according to the state’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. OEHHA lists lead as potentially causing cancer, developmental toxicity, male reproductive toxicity and female reproductive toxicity.

“These products are supposed to enhance human health and performance, not lead to increased risk of heart attacks and sperm damage,” says Michael Green, the CEH’s CEO. (Infowars did not reply to Newsweek’s requests for comment made by email and telephone.)

The warning about male virility is especially notable because many of Jones’s products are geared toward men.

BuzzFeed had previously sent six Infowars products for laboratory testing. The results confirmed that the products “don’t contain significantly more or less of a particular ingredient than listed on the bottles, and there are no surprise ingredients. They’re also reasonably safe, meaning they passed heavy metal contaminant screenings and tested free of stimulants, depressants, and other prohibited drugs.”

Myco-ZX and Caveman Paleo Formula were not among the products tested by BuzzFeed.

Caroline Cox, research director for CEH, says the intention is not to sue Infowars out of existence. She only wants Alex Jones to not sell people lead.",JustBadNews,0
"Neo-Nazi and National Front organiser quits movement, comes out as gay, opens up about Jewish heritage",https://www.channel4.com/news/neo-nazi-national-front-organiser-quits-movement-comes-out-as-gay-kevin-wilshaw-jewish-heritage,"A white supremacist active as recently as the start of this year says today he is publicly renouncing 40 years of hate. Speaking on Channel 4 News he comes out as gay for the first time – and admits to a violent past.

After a lifetime of involvement with the far-right Kevin Wilshaw announces on Channel 4 News that he is leaving the movement – at the same time publicly coming out as gay.

The well known National Front organiser in the 1980s was still active in white supremacist groups earlier this year – including speaking at events.

But tonight on Channel 4 News he explains for the very first time why he is publicly disavowing the movement – sharing his secrets, explaining how he was both a Neo-Nazi and of Jewish heritage , while admitting to violent acts and what motivated his hatred.

Jewish heritage

Kevin Wilshaw also opens up about his Jewish mother.

“She was part Jewish, maiden name was Benjamin, we have Jewish blood on that side.

On an application form to join the National Front, he wrote about his hatred of “the Jews”.

“That term ‘the Jews’ is the global faceless mass of people you can’t personalise it, not individuals. That’s the generalisation that leads to 6 million people being deliberately murdered.

“I didn’t have many friends at school, I wanted to be a member of a group of people that had an aim, and I thought getting involved in that kind of thing would be comradeship. “

“Even though you end up being a group of people that through their own extreme views are cut off from society, you do have a sense of comradeship in that you’re a member of a group that’s being attacked by other people.”

Coming out

“On one or two occasions in the recent past I’ve actually been the recipient of the very hatred of the people I want to belong to … if you’re gay it is acceptable in society but with these group of people it’s not acceptable, and I found on one or two occasions when I was suspected of being gay I was subjected to abuse.”

Mr Wilshaw admits that being a Nazi who is gay – but with a Jewish background – is a contradiction.

“It’s a terribly selfish thing to say but it’s true, I saw people being abused, shouted at, spat at in the street – it’s not until it’s directed at you that you suddenly realise that what you’re doing is wrong.”

“You have other members leading National Front who are overtly gay. And nobody could see the contradiction of it that you have an overtly gay person leading a homophobic organisation, makes no sense.”

“Then you have someone like Nicky Crane, one of the hardest people who would be gay.”

“Even when people found out, they’d rationalise it, ‘He’s not really gay’ or ‘gay and ok’.”

Violent attack

He said he had hurt people, “but not unprovoked, in defence. In a by-election in Leeds I smashed a chair over someone’s head.”

But he denied ever having approached minorities and assaulted them.

“I’d never do that, but I have seen incidents where people were singled out because they were black by a group of people. It turned my stomach, I rejected that, I pushed it to the back of my mind.”

Mr Wilshaw was arrested for vandalising a mosque in Aylesbury in the early 1990s – and in March this year he was arrested for online race hate offences.

Extremist as recently as the start of this year

He joined the BNP after being part of the National Front and flirted with dangerous fringe groups like the Racial Volunteer Force.

Mr Wilshaw says he remembers meeting David Copeland – the Brixton and Soho nail bomber. More recently he took to social media – and until the start of year was still speaking at rallies.

Former National Front activist Matthew Collins, who now works for the anti-racist group Hope not Hate said: “One of things we noticed is there was someone who was struggling, he was becoming more and more extreme.”

“We almost expected the phone call and a cry for help, and that’s what he’s done.”

‘I want to hurt extremists’

“I feel appallingly guilty as well, I really do feel guilty, not only that, this is also a barrier to me having a relationship with my own family, and I want to get rid of it, it’s too much of a weight.”

“I want to do some damage as well, not to ordinary people but the people who are propagating this kind of rubbish – want to hurt them, show what it’s like for those who are living a lie and be on the receiving end of this type of propaganda, I want to hurt them.”

Fearing some level of revenge, Mr Wilshaw says “one or two would want to sort me.. they’d see it as betrayal.”

“I am going to find it difficult, granted, to fill a void that has occupied my life since childhood.”",JustBadNews,0
Finance Minister Bill Morneau waited 2 years to disclose company that owns French villa to ethics watchdog - Canada,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/morneau-company-france-ethics-1.4351933,"Finance Minister Bill Morneau waited two years to disclose a private corporation that owns a villa in southern France that he shares with his wife to Canada's ethics watchdog, CBC News has learned.

In fact, Morneau only disclosed the corporation to conflict of interest and ethics commissioner Mary Dawson's office after CBC News discovered its existence and began asking questions.

Morneau's office says the failure to disclose the company is the result of ""early administrative confusion."" Communications director Dan Lauzon said the villa was disclosed but the company was not.

Still, opposition critics say they are troubled by the finance minister's failure to fully disclose all of the private companies he owns.

""I guess that he expects us to believe that he's so rich that he just forgot that he has a private corporation in France and a wonderful villa in Provence,"" said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre. ""It's a little hard to believe.""

Morneau's disclosure came after a search by CBC News of corporate records in France revealed that Morneau is listed as a partner in the company SCI Mas des Morneau, which owns and manages a villa in the picturesque town of Oppède in France's Provence region.

Morneau's wife, Nancy McCain, a member of the wealthy family that owns McCain Foods, is named as a partner.

According to the Greffe du Tribunal de Commerce d'Avignon's registry, the company was incorporated on Aug. 17, 2007. Among the company's activities listed in the registry are real estate, rentals and leases.

Tax experts say there can be some advantages to holding real estate in France through a company such as Mas des Morneau, including avoiding inheritance tax. It is a completely legal and commonly used method.

But while Morneau has owned the company for a decade and was named finance minister two years ago, the company was only added to Morneau's ethics filings on Sept. 22 — as CBC News was pressing his office repeatedly for information about the company and why it did not appear in his public ethics declaration.

Dawson's office says MPs are supposed to disclose any private companies they own anywhere in the world. Any private companies that are disclosed to the ethics commissioner's office are listed in the public registry of ethics filings maintained by the office.

Some assets must be disclosed to the commissioner's office but are not listed in the public registry, such as an MP's family home or properties used primarily for recreation.

Jocelyne Brisebois, spokesperson for Dawson's office, said the ethics commissioner can fine a public office holder if she believes they have contravened the law. Under the Conflict of Interest Act, fines can range up to $500.

Brisebois said there is currently no examination or inquiry underway.

Since 2009, Dawson has fined four cabinet ministers $100 each for not disclosing changes to their assets within 30 days as required. One cabinet minister, Conservative Peter MacKay, was fined $200 twice for failing to provide a description of his assets while Liberal Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay was fined $200 in 2016 for failing to declare a gift he received within the deadline.

Lauzon, described Morneau's failure to initially declare the company as ""early administrative confusion"" when contacted by CBC News on Thursday.

""The SCI is related to a family property in France and is of a non-commercial nature,"" he said. ""It's simply a legal structure, or an administrative vehicle to own and maintain the house, according to French law. It is the mechanism through which the property is owned.""

Morneau's own financial affairs have been in the spotlight in recent weeks as the opposition has increased its attacks over his proposed changes to the tax rules that apply to private corporations.

The Conservatives have been pointing out in question period that Morneau's proposed tax changes will hit small businesses, farms and professionals like doctors but not large companies traded on the stock exchange like Morneau Shepell, a human resources company formerly headed by Morneau.

The proposed tax changes also won't affect Morneau's company in France. Finance Department spokesperson Jack Aubry said the proposed changes will not affect private corporations owned by Canadians that are incorporated in other countries.

Morneau's previous ethics declaration included joint or sole ownership of six other private numbered companies, some of which are associated with property in Florida.

NDP MP Nathan Cullen says ethics commissioner Mary Dawson should make an example of Morneau for failing to declare his private corporation in France. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

New Democrat ethics critic Nathan Cullen says Dawson should ""make an example"" of Morneau's failure to disclose his company in Provence.

""The idea that the finance minister would have failed to disclose to the ethics commissioner and to all Canadians what businesses he actually had is incredibly worrisome,"" Cullen said.

""This is a big problem for me and I think it's going to be a problem for a lot of Canadians.""

Cullen also contrasted Morneau's decision to hold the villa through a company, potentially saving his family money in the future on inheritance taxes, with the changes he is proposing to the tax rules governing private companies in Canada.

""Morneau seems to have set something up which makes it easier for him to pass on his wealth to his kids where they are proposing tax changes which make it harder for farmers to do the same thing.""

Conservative Pierre Poilievre says it is important for cabinet ministers to disclose all of their assets. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

Poilievre said the failure to report the corporation in France calls into question Morneau's personal credibility.

""Here he is storming across the country, lecturing our local businesses and family farmers, calling them tax cheats and saying they should pay more, and meanwhile,, he just forgot to mention that he has a private corporation in France that owns his villa.""

Poilievre said it is important for cabinet ministers to fully disclose what they own.

""Ministers are supposed to report their assets so that Canadians can judge their interests and potential conflicts. These rules exist for a reason.""

"Equifax website hacked again, this time to redirect to fake Flash update",https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/equifax-website-hacked-again-this-time-to-redirect-to-fake-flash-update/,"In May credit reporting service Equifax's website was breached by attackers who eventually made off with Social Security numbers, names, and a dizzying amount of other details for some 145.5 million US consumers. For several hours on Wednesday, and again early Thursday morning, the site was maliciously manipulated again, this time to deliver fraudulent Adobe Flash updates, which when clicked, infected visitors' computers with adware that was detected by only three of 65 antivirus providers.

Randy Abrams, an independent security analyst by day, happened to visit the site Wednesday evening to check what he said was false information he had just found on his credit report. Eventually, his browser opened up a page on the domain hxxp//:centerbluray.info that looked like this:

He was understandably incredulous. The site that previously gave up personal data for virtually every US person with a credit history was once again under the influence of attackers, this time trying to trick Equifax visitors into installing crapware Symantec calls Adware.Eorezo . Knowing a thing or two about drive-by campaigns, Abrams figured the chances were slim he'd see the download on follow-on visits. To fly under the radar, attackers frequently serve the downloads to only a select number of visitors, and then only once.

Abrams tried anyway, and to his amazement, he encountered the bogus Flash download links on at least three subsequent visits. The picture above this post is the higher-resolution screenshot he captured during one visit. He also provided the video below. It shows an Equifax page redirecting the browser to at least four domains before finally opening the Flash download at the same centerbluray.info page.

The file that got delivered when Abrams clicked through is called MediaDownloaderIron.exe. This VirusTotal entry shows only Panda, Symantec, and Webroot detecting the file as adware. This separate malware analysis from Payload Security shows the code is highly obfuscated and takes pains to conceal itself from reverse engineering. Malwarebytes flagged the centerbluray.info site as one that pushes malware, while both Eset and Avira provided similar malware warnings for one of the intermediate domains, newcyclevaults.com.

Malvertising, analytics?

It's not yet clear precisely how the Flash download page got displayed. The group-sourced analysis here and this independent assessment from researcher Kevin Beaumont—both submitted in the hours after this post went live—make a strong case that Equifax was working with a third-party ad network or analytics provider that's responsible for the redirects. In that case, the breach, technically speaking, isn't on the Equifax website and may be affecting other sites as well. But even if that's true, the net result is that the Equifax site was arguably compromised in some way, since administrators couldn't control the pages visitors saw when trying to use key functions, some which require visitors to enter Social Security numbers.

Several hours after this post went live, an Ars reader e-mailed to say he recently encountered a sketchy ad when putting a temporary fraud alert on his Equifax file. The reader wrote:

When I clicked it (from Gmail on Android) I was redirected to a spam page shortly after seeing the Equifax credit file form. I thought maybe it was an anomaly because it didn't happen again. But after reading your article about how sometimes hacks will redirect randomly I tried the link again just now and sure enough I got a spam page again (lucksupply.club saying I won an iPhone X). This is Chrome-in-a-tab from Gmail so i don't believe there's any extensions or other malware on my device that could have caused this redirect.

In the hour this post was being reported and written, Abrams was unable to reproduce the redirects leading to the malicious download, but he said they returned early Thursday morning. Shortly after that, a section of the site was taken down. In an e-mail sent mid Thursday morning, an Equifax represesentative wrote:

We are aware of the situation identified on the equifax.com website in the credit report assistance link. Our IT and Security teams are looking into this matter, and out of an abundance of caution have temporarily taken this page offline. When it becomes available or we have more information to share, we will.

Post updated at several times on the morning of 10/12/2017 Pacific time to discuss ad networks and add details of ad served on reader. The word ""hacked"" was removed from the headline to reflect the possibility the redirects are the result of a third-party malvertising campaign.",JustBadNews,0

Affleck, who is about to appear as Batman for the second time in DC's big-budget superhero film Justice League, has been called ""Buttman"" on social media since make-up artist Annamarie Tendler became the second woman to allege that he touched her.

Days after condemning the actions of his former colleague Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of three incidents of rape and countless accounts of sexual assault of young female stars, Affleck publicly apologised for touching actress Hilarie Burton live on camera in 2003.

Terry Crews details alleged sexual assault by 'high level' Hollywood exec,http://pagesix.com/2017/10/10/terry-crews-details-alleged-sexual-assault-by-high-level-hollywood-exec/,"In the wake of many female stars and employees coming forward about Harvey Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment and assault, actor Terry Crews has a story of his own experience with sexual assault in Hollywood.

The “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star, 49, shared his story on social media because he wanted to let his followers know that Weinstein “is not the only perpetrator.”

“This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME…,” Crews tweeted Tuesday. “My wife n I were at a Hollywood function last year n a high level Hollywood executive came over 2 me and groped my privates.”

Crews continued, “Jumping back I said What are you doing?! My wife saw everything n we looked at him like he was crazy. He just grinned like a jerk.”

The “Expendables” star said he didn’t “kick his ass” because he thought of how the media would spin the story.

“’240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho’ would be the headline the next day,” Crews shared, adding that he wouldn’t have been able to read it because he “would have been in jail.” Instead, he and his wife left the party.

Crews says he talked to other people who had worked with the unnamed executive, and the next day the power player apologized to Crews but “never really explained why he did what he did.” Crews said he didn’t go public with his experience because he didn’t want to be “ostracized” from the business, which he described as something that would be “par 4 the course when the predator has power n influence.”

“I let it go. And I understand why many women who this happens to let it go,” he tweeted. “Who’s going 2 believe you? ( few) What r the repercussions?(many) Do u want 2 work again? (Yes) R you prepared 2b ostracized?(No).”

Crews wrote that he hoped his story would “deter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless.”",JustBadNews,0

After hearing multiple women in Hollywood share stories of sexual abuse by Harvey Weinstein, actor Terry Crews was moved to go public with his own tale of sexual assault from a powerful Hollywood figure. In a series of tweets Tuesday afternoon, Crews revealed that he was groped by an unnamed male executive at an industry party last year. Crews says he almost lashed out at the man, but stopped himself once he realized how it would be portrayed: “240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho.” After telling the man’s co-workers about what happened, he received an apology the next day; he let it go after that, out of fear of being ostracized in the industry. Now, Crews says he can empathize with what Weinstein’s alleged victims, as well as many others, went through: “Hollywood is not the only business where this happens, and to the casualties of this behavior — you are not alone.” You can read the full string of tweets below.

Lurid Trump allegations made by Louise Mensch and co-writer came from hoaxer | US news,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/28/trump-tweets-hoax-louise-mensch-claude-taylor,"Explosive allegations about Donald Trump made by online writers with large followings among Trump critics were based on bogus information from a hoaxer who falsely claimed to work in law enforcement.

Claude Taylor tweeted fake details of criminal inquiries into Trump that were invented by a source whose claim to work for the New York attorney general was not checked, according to emails seen by the Guardian. The allegations were endorsed as authentic and retweeted by his co-writer Louise Mensch.

The source’s false tips included an allegation, which has been aggressively circulated by Mensch and Taylor, that Trump’s inactive fashion model agency is under investigation by New York authorities for possible sex trafficking.

The hoaxer, who fed the information to Taylor by email, said she acted out of frustration over the “dissemination of fake news” by Taylor and Mensch. Their false stories about Trump have included a claim that he was already being replaced as president by Senator Orrin Hatch in a process kept secret from the American public.

“Taylor asked no questions to verify my identity, did no vetting whatsoever, sought no confirmation from a second source – but instead asked leading questions to support his various theories, asking me to verify them,” the source said in an email.

After being approached for comment by the Guardian on Monday, Taylor posted what he described as a “mea culpa” on Twitter. “As a ‘citizen journalist’ I acknowledge my error and do apologize,” he wrote.

Mensch denied using the bogus information and said her allegations about Trump’s model agency came from her own sources. Asked why she had retweeted Taylor’s false posts, Mensch said: “I don’t think anybody can vet anybody else’s sources.”

The source falsely claimed to be an official named “Caitlin” in the office of Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general. She shared details of her hoax on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from followers of Taylor and Mensch. The Guardian verified her true identity and confirmed that she is not named Caitlin and does not work for Schneiderman.

In his emails, Taylor pushed the source for sensational material. Three days after she first contacted him, Taylor asked her: “Is there anything you have heard that’s really going to shock people? An ‘Oh my god!’ sort of thing?” In another message, Taylor conceded that he may have been “going farther than I should” by posting tweets that exaggerated the false tips she was giving him.

Thousands of people have reposted the false claims tweeted by Taylor, a former staffer in Bill Clinton’s White House. Mensch, a former member of parliament in the UK, retweeted at least 18 posts by Taylor that were based on the hoaxer’s false information, spreading them further afield.

The pair describe themselves as co-writers and have cultivated a large fanbase among some critics of Trump, many of whom identify as members of the “resistance” movement eager to see the president removed from office. Taylor has about 200,000 followers on Twitter while Mensch has 267,000 followers.

Claiming to report things that the mainstream media will not, they have also moved to collect money from readers. Mensch’s website Patribiotics accepts donations “to fund more writers and research”. Taylor has said he will soon establish an online fundraising campaign to protect himself from legal threats. A GoFundMe page created by supporters of Taylor has already raised more than $18,000 in his name.

Their reporting has at times entered the mainstream political news agenda. During a television interview earlier this year, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts repeated unverified information about the inquiries into Trump and Russia that he had gleaned from Mensch’s website. He later withdrew the comment.

Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said in a statement that the incident highlighted the importance of using “legitimate news outlets, which know to verify their sources and their facts”.

The bogus source first contacted Taylor by email on 20 July with an email titled “NYAG investigation”. Earlier that day, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough had quoted approvingly from an online post by Taylor, describing it as “one of the best tweets of the past month”.

Claiming to be “a fan” of Taylor’s writing who worked in Schneiderman’s organized crime task force (OCTF), the hoaxer told him his reporting on Trump had been “right on the money”. Taylor replied within two hours, pressing her for usable information about “tangible results like indictments”. He asked: “Are there sealed indictments from grand juries that Schneiderman has convened?”

Later that day, the hoaxer replied that Trump associates were indeed facing prosecution on state charges in New York. “I am aware of at least one preliminary sealed indictment in that case targeting multiple Trump Org principals,” she wrote.

Taylor posted a lightly edited version of this to Twitter two days later. He quoted a “NYAG Schneiderman source” as having told him: “I am aware of at least one sealed indictment targeting multiple Trump Organization Principals”. The post was retweeted by Mensch. In all it was retweeted and liked 8,800 times.

In the same email, the source gave Taylor false details of how multiple inquiries into Trump were under way across Schneiderman’s OCTF and financial crimes bureau. She said that Trump’s modelling agency was under scrutiny. Taylor relayed all this without verification to his almost 200,000 followers in a pair of tweets.

“There are a number of investigations being coordinated by NYAG Schneiderman office under both the Financial Crimes Bureau and the Organized Crime Task Force. According to my source one of the more intriguing ones is an inverstigation [sic] into the Trump Modeling Agency,” Taylor said.

After being asked by a follower for more information, Taylor claimed to know even more than the hoaxer had told him. “I have few details but apparently the possibility exists that our president has been a sex trafficker,” he said. Mensch then weighed in, reposting this false claim by Taylor and adding a vague allegation of her own that the full story was even worse.

Taylor and Mensch also repeated an invented claim from the source that former president Bill Clinton knew of criminal wrongdoing by Trump’s model agency and was preparing to testify for the prosecution. Taylor posted another series of tweets making lurid allegations about Trump’s model agency that yet again matched invented claims supplied to him in emails from the hoaxer.

Since Taylor posted the allegations about Trump’s model agency, Mensch has pushed similar claims and pushed the hashtag “#PIMPOTUS” – a play on “pimp” and the acronym for president of the United States. Citing what she said were her own sources connected to the intelligence community, she published an article expanding on the allegations on 15 August, tagging the post with the label “Eric Schneiderman”. Mensch had claimed to have knowledge of inquiries by Schneiderman’s office before the hoaxer contacted Taylor.

The source also falsely specified to Taylor that the state case was “proceeding under the NY version of a RICO statute” – referring to the federal Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act – “which is called enterprise corruption.”

In another tweet on 22 July, Taylor claimed that “in point of fact” Schneiderman’s office was “using New York’s ‘Enterprise Corruption’ statutes which are that State’s RICO corollary” in its apparent pursuit of Trump and his associates.

The following day, claiming to have “more from Schneiderman source”, Taylor posted a series of tweets giving details about the number of people supposedly being targeted by the inquiries. The tweets corresponded directly with more bogus information emailed to Taylor by the hoaxer earlier that day.

Taylor repeatedly asked the hoaxer whether Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and an ally of Trump, was implicated. The source replied on 25 July that Giuliani was “currently a subject in the investigation involving money laundering and the Russian mob”.

A few hours later, Taylor tweeted to claim that he had confirmed Giuliani was “a target of NYAG Trump Organization/money laundering/Russian Organized Crime investigation”. He repeated several other false details provided by the source.

Hello Claude,

As you probably know, the RICO case that moved to FISC started in our state. I am not privy to what is happening with the federal case but our state court case in proceeding under the NY version of a RICO statute, which is called enterprise corruption. That case is ongoing and being handled by the Financial Crimes Bureau. I am aware of at least one preliminary sealed indictment in that case targeting multiple Trump Org principals. OCTF is not directly involved in that case but is working on a parallel money laundering investigation involving the Russian mafia and principals in the Trump campaign/transition team as well as an investigation of the modeling agency. As you can imagine, there is substantial overlap among the parties and the timeline has been repeatedly adjusted as more targets have come to light. The enterprise corruption case has a head start on our cases but AGS will want to drop them all at the same time so we are likely looking toward the end of the year.

Yours truly,

Caitlin

Hello Mr Taylor,



Thank you for keeping the public informed and for being discreet about my position. I can tell you that OCTF is targeting a total of 78 people right now between the two investigations we have. As you point out, more will likely be added. Currently, it is a combination of Russian mafia and bag men as well as Trump associates and family members. My understanding is the Financial Crimes Bureau currently has around 30-40 targets for the Trump Org-related case. There is overlap among the targets.

Trump is personally exposed in all three of these investigations, including the money laundering.

The issues that may shock the general public, though probably won’t surprise you, have to do with the human trafficking case. Trump Model Management, which recently closed, has ties to Yuri Chaika and his son. We are currently exploring those ties and working with INTERPOL on that aspect of the case. I have to be discreet in how much information I can share at one time so this does not come back to me. But I can tell you now that when this case drops, some VERY high profile names will be involved, some of which are already in talks for immunity deals. I will try to tell you more when I can.



Yours truly,

Caitlin

On all three. Many Russian nationals are also among the targets as are other Trump family members. — Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) July 23, 2017

Hello Claude,

i apologize for the delayed response. It was a busy at the office today and I did not have time for a break. Just got off. I am working the human trafficking case so I am more knowledgeable on that but as for the money laundering, there are about 15 Russian nationals involved in that case so far. Some names will be familiar to you, Sater for one. This case is in early development but so far, we know that T kids are involved with some of the shell companies in the money laundering schemes. Fruaiduleng transactions with weird LLCs to hide where the money is coming from and where it is going.

I cannot confirm that “on the record” at this time. But you worked for him. You know. There may be an immunity deal but it”s a political mess and very sticky. If a high profile democrat gets a deal, high profile republicans will have to get deals as well. No one is going to be happy about this when the dust settles and it may kill AG”s political aspirations.

Women say they quit Google because of racial discrimination: 'I was invisible' | Technology,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/18/women-google-memo-racism-sexism-discrimination-quit,"As Google reels from the fallout over a controversial diversity memo, multiple women say they faced regular discrimination and ultimately left

Qichen Zhang couldn’t believe what she was hearing. The technical specialist was in the middle of the office at Google when a white male colleague began joking with her about her hiring.

“He said, ‘It must’ve been really easy for you to get your job because you’re an Asian woman and people assume you’re good at math,’” Zhang recalled in a recent interview. “It was absolutely stunning. I remember me just emotionally shutting down.”

The conversation was one of many instances where Zhang said she felt isolated as a woman of color working for the technology giant, and a few months later, feeling like there was no future for her at Google, she quit.

“I didn’t see a lot of women, especially Asian women, black women or other women of color in the executive ranks,” she said. “I didn’t see any opportunities for myself … The culture there is really discouraging, and that’s ultimately why I left.”

Zhang spoke with the Guardian days after a white male engineer at Google sparked an international uproar with a memo criticizing diversity initiatives, arguing that white men are victims of discrimination and that women are underrepresented in tech because they are biologically less suited to engineering and leadership positions.

I didn’t see a lot of women, especially Asian women, black women or other women of color in the executive ranks Qichen Zhang, former Google specialist

More women have since come forward with stories of sexism at Google, and now, people of color are sharing accounts of racial discrimination at the corporation, which has a predominantly white and male workforce, much like the rest of Silicon Valley.

Despite Google’s notoriously strict confidentiality policies, which some say are used to intimidate and silence critics, several former and current employees spoke in interviews about the ways in which they believe minorities, particularly women of color, are denied opportunities and equal pay. They described a culture that tolerates racism and sexism, where white male managers frequently support and promote employees who look like themselves.

“Google is seen as the pinnacle … a cultural beacon for a lot of people in the tech industry. People really try to emulate Google,” said Zhang, 27, who now works at Spotify. “The fact that the bar is so low really sets an example for the rest of the industry.”

‘I didn’t belong’

Concerns about discrimination at Google have escalated this year following the US Department of Labor’s allegations that women across the company are paid less than men for similar work, in violation of federal law. Google has vehemently denied that it underpays women.

The recent memo – which argued that women’s high rates of “neuroticism” and “agreeableness” make them less qualified for tech jobs – has further exposed a mentality that some say is common among conservative white men in tech who believe affirmative action and gender equality initiatives are bad for businesses (despite research showing the opposite).

James Damore, the author, was fired, turning him into an overnight hero to the “alt-right”.

Quick guide What is the 'alt-right'? Show Hide Who coined the term 'alt-right'? The white supremacist Richard Spencer devised the term in 2010. He has described the movement as ""identity politics for white Americans and for Europeans around the world"". What does it stand for? The movement supports extreme rightwing ideologies, including white nationalism – used interchangeably with white supremacism – and antisemitism. It positions itself broadly against egalitarianism, democracy, universalism and multiculturalism. Some ""alt-right"" supporters have argued that their hardline, extremist positions are not truly meant, but are a way to disrupt conventional and accepted thinking. Memes, irony and ambiguity are sometimes used in an attempt to wrongfoot critics. How does the 'alt-right' relate to the Trump administration? The Trump administration includes figures who are associated with the ""alt-right"", including the former Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, who worked as chief strategist in Trump's White House in 2017. Many of Trump's policy positions have won favour with the movement.

At Google, men occupy 80% of tech jobs and 75% of leadership roles, according to the company’s own figures. Overall, only 2% of employees are black, 4% are Hispanic, 35% Asian and 56% white. The company has touted its recent 1% increases in a number of underrepresented groups.

Asked about the slow pace of progress, Yolanda Mangolini, Google’s director of global diversity and inclusion, said in an interview that “change takes time”, adding: “We know that it’s not just about recruiting a diverse workforce. It’s about creating an environment where they want to stay.”

One black woman who worked as a specialist at Google for several years told the Guardian that discrimination and prejudice impacted her job on a daily basis.

“I felt like I didn’t belong nor did anybody want me to belong,” said the woman, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation by Google.

The former employee, who said she was the only black woman on her team, noted that employees would frequently ask to see her identification throughout the Google campus while non-black workers were rarely questioned.

She said she also overheard racist jokes on multiple occasions and that she immediately felt left out at the workplace – excluded from emails and social events and working alongside colleagues who didn’t bother to learn her name.

The woman said that her efforts to advocate for diversity further took a toll on her. The company seemed primarily interested in PR and positive branding when it came to diversity initiatives, which made it difficult to push for more substantive reforms.

She felt she was negatively judged for her advocacy for people of color: “They didn’t like the way you’re prioritizing diversity, because that’s not your role.”

The woman said that her time serving on a hiring committee was particularly disheartening. Committees of mostly white hiring managers would complain that a candidate lacked “Googliness”, meaning they believed an applicant might not be a good match for the company culture, she said. “It seems like we are interviewing people to fit in with white people, and not to interview everyone to make sure they are culturally competent.”

“When you speak up, you’re going to be negatively impacted,” she said. “It was almost like you had to compromise on your values and morals.”

People had this concept of ‘racism doesn’t exist at Google’

Zhang, a Harvard graduate, said she was thrilled to get a job at Google in 2013, noting that she loved the “don’t be evil” motto and its reputation as a “politically progressive” company “using technology to improve the world”, she said. “Everybody wants to work at Google.”

While initially enamored, she quickly felt “disposable” and unappreciated as a specialist who was not an engineer – a feeling made worse by the fact that most engineers and their managers were men. She recalled one meeting where she said she was the only woman, surrounded by white male engineers, who excluded her from the discussion.

“It’s just these little daily aggressions that really add up over time,” she said.“Having a lack of people who look like you in general is demoralizing.”

The culture at Google promoted the idea of the “meritocracy”, meaning discrimination is no longer a problem and that women struggling to get promotions should simply work harder and advocate more loudly, said Zhang.

“People had this broad concept of ‘racism doesn’t exist at Google and sexism doesn’t exist at Google’,” she said. “Just because your officemates aren’t saying racial slurs out loud doesn’t mean they’re not racist.”

Zhang added: “They care about getting good press, but they don’t actually want to put in the work to understand racism and sexism.”

Lakshmi Parthasarathy, who started at Google as a specialist in 2014 and was later promoted to technical solutions engineer, said she lacked female mentors and managers.

It’s difficult for women to see paths for themselves at Google or in tech Lakshmi Parthasarathy, former Google engineer

Parthasarathy, 26, emphasized that she liked everyone on her team and has remained friends with them since quitting earlier this year, but added: “You’re the only girl in the room all the time … Google has resources and I think they make efforts in some ways. But there’s only so much they can do when at the end of the day our organization was, at a manager level, mostly male.”

She said she rarely met women over the age of 30 in technical positions at the company: “It’s difficult for women to see paths for themselves at Google or in tech.”

Although she felt supported, she said she wished there was more transparency in the promotion process and salaries, and noted that for some women, Google can feel like a “boys’ club” with a “culture of guys promoting guys”.

Parthasarathy said she was also angry to hear this year that a male co-worker appeared to have received a more valuable stock package than her for reasons that were unclear.

Mekka Okereke, a black technical manager for Google Play, said he has one of the most diverse engineering teams in the company – 10% black, 10% Latino, 25% women and 50% female managers. The team, he said, has worked on building fairer hiring processes that proactively eliminate biases.

“It is possible to build inclusive teams and ... most managers are starved for information about how to actually go about doing that,” said Okereke, who was made available for an interview by Google’s communications department. “This is something we’re scaling across the company, and it’s working.”

‘You always have to prove yourself’

Zhang, who quit in 2014, said she felt that raising concerns to human resources about the racist joke she faced would be pointless, especially since the colleague was an engineer and she was not. (Reached for comment, the former co-worker said he did not recall making the remark).

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Yolanda Mangolini, Google’s director of global diversity. Photograph: Weinberg-Clark Photography

“I don’t want to be labeled as the girl who cries ‘race card’ or plays the ‘woman card,’” she added. “I was just trying to get over it.”

After reviewing the Guardian’s summary of the women’s claims, Mangolini said: “I’m always disappointed when I hear these stories.” She pointed to Google’s “employee resource groups”, such as the “black Googler network”, which she said can go a long way in helping minorities who feel isolated find support and make connections.

Google, she said, has also made huge strides in its efforts to move away from subjective measures in hiring, performance reviews and promotions by focusing on rubrics with objective metrics.

Mangolini declined to discuss the pay gap claims and Google’s response to the Damore memo.

“It saddened me personally when I read it, because I knew the impact of those words on the technical women … [whose] skills are always questioned,” Mangolini said. “My heart sort of broke for them.”

How the tech industry wrote women out of history Read more

Parthasarathy said she was frustrated by the argument that affirmative action helps unqualified minorities get hired: “People do think it’s easier for me to get into my job … There’s this feeling all the time whenever I do a project, you always have to prove yourself, and that really sucks.”



The black woman who worked as a specialist at Google said her experiences with discrimination took a severe toll on her mental health.

“There were times I cried at my desk,” she said, adding that she ultimately decided it wasn’t worth the trouble to stay at Google and began looking for jobs outside of the company, not caring that she would be earning a lower salary.

At Google, she added, “I was invisible. It was like I didn’t matter. So what was the point of being there?”

A third teenager dies 48 hours after arriving at one of China's internet addiction bootcamps,https://www.techspot.com/news/70557-teenager-dies-48-hours-after-arriving-one-china.html,"Another teenager has died in one of China’s military-style internet addiction treatment centers. The 18-year-old boy allegedly suffered multiple injuries and died just days after he arrived at one of the controversial “bootcamps.”

The latest incident took place in the eastern Anhui province. The teenager’s parents said they were unable to help their son’s serious internet addiction and decided to send him to one of the increasingly popular centers in Fuyang city. The Anhui Shangbao newspaper reported that the facility used ""psychological counseling and physical training” to treat those staying there.

Two days after dropping him off on August 3, the parents received a phone call informing them that their son had been taken to hospital, where he later died. Doctors told them he had sustained more than 20 external injuries and several internal injuries.

""My son's body was completely covered with scars, from top to toe [...] When I sent my son to the center he was still fine, how could he have died within 48 hours?"" said Ms Liu, the victim’s mother.

The center has been closed down while investigations continue. Its director and four teaching staff are now in custody.

Back in 2014, a 19-year-old girl died at one of the boot camps in Henan province. She was forced to undergo “training” that involved instructors lifting her a short distance above the ground before dropped her on her head. Another 14-year-old girl, who suffered neck and head injuries after undergoing the same training, said the victim endured the practice for two hours, at which point she started vomiting blood and fell unconscious.

In 2009, a 15-year-old boy died two days after his arrival at one of the centers after trainers severely beat him. The incident came shortly after the country’s health ministry banned the use of electro-shock therapy as a means of treating internet addiction.",JustBadNews,0
BART Withholding Surveillance Videos Of Crime To Avoid 'Stereotypes',http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/07/09/bart-withholding-surveillance-videos-of-crime-to-avoid-stereotypes/,"SAN FRANCISCO (KPIX) — In the last three months, there have been at least three robberies on BART involving groups of teenagers.

“I think people are genuinely concerned — they are fearful about the stories that have come out about the recent attacks, the assaults, the thefts,” said Debora Allen, who is a member of the BART Board of Directors.

April 22: Forty to sixty kids boarded a train at the Coliseum stop and robbed seven passengers, beating up two;

June 28: A group of four kids assaulted a passenger and made off with a cell phone at Dublin; and

June 30: A woman on a train with about a dozen teenagers had her phone snatched by one them before the group got off at the Coliseum stop. Thankfully, a good Samaritan was on hand to retrieve the phone.

So far, BART has refused to turn over surveillance video for any of these incidents.

Allen told us the agency issued an explanation for why it is being tight-lipped about the thefts.

“To release these videos would create a high level of racially insensitive commentary toward the district,” she was told. “And in addition it would create a racial bias in the riders against minorities on the trains.”

According to a memo distributed to BART Directors, the agency won’t do a press release on the June 30 theft because it was a “petty crime” that would make BART look “crime ridden.” Furthermore, it would “unfairly affect and characterize riders of color, leading to sweeping generalizations in media reports.”

The memo was from BART Assistant General Manager Kerry Hamill.

Allen emailed Hamill, “I don’t understand what role the color of one’s skin plays in this issue [of whether to divulge information]. Can you explain?”

Hamill responded, “If we were to regularly feed the news media video of crimes on our system that involve minority suspects, particularly when they are minors, we would certainly face questions as to why we were sensationalizing relatively minor crimes and perpetuating false stereotypes in the process.” And added her opinion of the media: “My view is that the media’s real interest in the videos of youth phone snatching incidents isn’t the desire for transparency but rather the pursuit of ratings. They know that video of these events will drive clicks to their websites and viewers to their programs because people are motivated by fear.”

Allen says scared passengers aren’t being unreasonable — being on a BART train is a vulnerable position.

“This is BART, people are sort of trapped in this train for awhile and they have a right to see what could potentially happen.”

She says all this raises questions, “What is the priority of BART? Is the safety of the passenger — of all passengers — is that a lesser priority than the race bias issue?”

According to BART spokesman Taylor Huckaby, state law protecting “juvenile police records” prevents them from showing the surveillance video, even though at least one of the people arrested for the April 22 attack is 19 years old. (He cited Cal. Gov’t Code 827.9) And, even if the faces of juveniles were blurred, Huckaby says watching the videos would be pointless gawking.

"Brexit: ""Vote Leave"" campaign chief who created ?350m NHS lie on bus admits leaving EU could be 'an error'",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-vote-leave-director-dominic-cummings-leave-eu-error-nhs-350-million-lie-bus-a7822386.html,"One of the masterminds behind the Brexit vote has performed an astonishing U-turn by admitting that leaving the EU may be “an error”.

Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave campaign director, described the referendum as a “dumb idea” before other ideas had been tried to win back powers from Brussels. He has also warned that Brexit is shaping up to be a “guaranteed debacle”, without big changes in Whitehall to deliver a successful negotiation.

Minister appointed to negotiate Brexit wanted EU 'torn down'

Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, seized on the comments, saying: “Dominic Cummings has let the cat out of the bag. This is the man who slapped the £350m NHS lie on the side of the bus who is now saying leaving the EU could be a mistake.

“These Brexiteers have sold us a pup and lied to the public. This is why I believe the public should be given a say on the final Brexit deal.”

Mr Cummings is little known to the public, but is widely seen as hugely influential behind the scenes in pulling off last year’s shock referendum Leave vote. A former special adviser to Michael Gove, he coined the phrase “vote leave, take control”, which excited wavering voters into believing Britain could reclaim sovereignty.

Government stance on Brexit 'nonsense' and Labour 'cowards', Anna Soubry says

And, notoriously, he came with the campaign for an extra £350m to be spent on the NHS every week from diverted EU spending – which also proved crucial, MPs said. Leading Brexiteers including Boris Johnson were photographed alongside the bus – but the pledge was immediately dumped when Theresa May took over in Downing Street.

Mr Cummings’ volte-face came in a late-night Twitter exchange with the legal commentator David Allen Green, in which he was asked whether anything could happen to “wish Leave had not won the referendum?”

In reply, he wrote: “Lots! I said before REF was dumb idea, other things shdve been tried 1st. In some possible branches of the future leaving will be an error.”

Last month, Mr Cummings tweeted that MPs who backed Leave must force change on Downing Street and the Department for Exiting the European Union, led by David Davis. “If Leave MPs don't assert themselves to force MANAGEMENT changes on No10/DEXU, Brexit talks = guaranteed debacle as I’ve said for a year,” he wrote.

The comments come amid fresh cabinet infighting over the terms of Brexit, as ministers exploit Ms May’s weakness to argue for different approaches.

The Chancellor Philip Hammond mocked Mr Johnson’s claim that Britain could “have its cake and eat it” in the talks – but was, in turn, slapped down by Mr Davis for arguing for a lengthy transitional period.

The State Department describes this sale as fermenting U.S. efforts to ""strengthen the security and defense architecture of the region."" They point out that it does not directly conflict with the current regional dispute as it will take years to complete and fill the sale in full.

""We are confident that Qatar can address its remaining issues within this timeframe, prior to delivery,"" explains a State Department official.

Qataris had scheduled Wednesday's trip to formalize portions of this arms deal with the U.S. government about two months ago, according to Qatari and State Department officials. They want these weapons. So, despite growing tensions and Mr. Trump's repeated hardline stance against their support of Iran and regional terrorist groups, the Qataris came because they want the weapons.

""We are working on the process related to the signing,"" said one Qatari official on Wednesday morning. ""It is normal. We are in the stage where we want to finalize this deal.""

Qataris say the deal demonstrates the ""long standing commitment"" Qatar has to working with the U.S.

The full arms sale, of over $20 billion for 72 F-15QA fighter jets, was notified in November 2016. This means it had already been authorized by congress and the executive branch, when President Obama was in office, before the Trump administration came into office. During Mr. Trump's recent visit to Riyadh, he made a point of telling reporters during a photo spray with the Qatari emir that he was going to sell Qatar ""big beautiful weapons."" In the wake of the diplomatic crisis -- and Mr. Trump's public statements raising concern about alleged Qatari funding of terrorism -- there were questions about whether the arms deal would go through. However, on Wednesday, in Washington, Defense Secretary James Mattis formally signed the letter of offer and acceptance for the purchase.

In the face of the escalating tensions Qataris came to D.C. with a large entourage -- expecting to break ground on the escalating regional standoff. But there is no sign of progress. The State Department has yet to extend an official request for a joint meeting between representatives that are in the nation's capitol from Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Qatar says have still not received the list of demands that the countries have for them. The U.S. has not played a role in passing along request, either.

On Tuesday morning, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubier. He stood silently as Jubier declared to reporters that there ""is no blockage of Qatar."" Tillerson will have a working dinner with UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Wednesday night.

There has been nothing on his public schedule with Qatari leaders. Though Qatar has sent a team, including individuals from Qatar Central Bank, to the State Department to discuss the matter at a technical level. Last week, Tillerson called for an easing of the Qatari ban - but hours later, Mr. Trump did not echo those sentiments.

""The nation of Qatar has unfortunately been a funder of terrorism, and at a very high level,"" Mr. Trump said on Friday at the White House. He added ""the time has come to call on Qatar to end its funding.""

There are more than 10,000 U.S. service members at the U.S. central command base in Qatar. The U.S. commander there has said there are ""no plans to change our posture in Qatar"" amid a Gulf diplomatic crisis. Qatar is quick to remind the U.S. of this working relationship.

""When no one wanted to host your troops after 9/11, we did. We protected them. Saudi Arabia asked you to leave,"" said Meshal bin Jamad al Thani, the Qatari ambassador to the U.S. Qataris believe that the blockade of their country is politically motivated by the Saudis in an effort to flex their muscle in the region.

Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the U.S., has suggested that the U.S. consider moving their base there. Qatar has received no indications of U.S. plans to do so, and they are not asking them to leave or change their operations in any way.

""None of our people attacked the U.S.,"" said al Thani, a nod to the Saudis who were involved in the Sept 11th terrorist attacks.",JustBadNews,0

Red Crescent: Hamas tried to stop humanitarian aid distribution in Gaza,"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4975170,00.html","The secretary-general of the Red Crescent Society of the United Arab Emirates accused Hamas on Monday of attempting to prevent the distribution of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.

Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter



According to Secretary-General Mohamed Ateeq Al-Falahi, the Red Crescent's staff was stationed at a UAE field hospital in the strip during the 2014 Operation Protective Edge when Hamas fighters began provoking Israeli forces by firing rockets from that hospital.

This led Israel to attack the hospital as the launch point for the rockets, thus sabotaging the distribution of the humanitarian aid.

""This shows (Hamas's) wicked intentions and how they scarified us,"" said Al-Falahi. ""They always claim the enemy targets humanitarian envoys, but the betrayal came from them.""

When the Red Crescent team was leaving Gaza, Hamas ""accused us of being spies, undercover foreign intelligences who were escaping.""

When they left the strip through Sinai, Al-Falahi said Hamas had apparently informed ""extremist militias in Sinai... that there was a group making their way there, so prepare for jihad against them... as we stopped at a grocery store to buy something to eat, they started shooting at us.""

In addition, he said, the Red Crescent team learned those extremist militias had also planted landmines a few kilometers down the road.

""What hurts is that the betrayal came from our own people,"" Al-Falahi lamented. ""Muslims fighting Muslims, who were giving humanitarian aid to Muslims.""",JustBadNews,0
Trump leaked to the Russians that Israel successfully hacked ISIS computers,http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.795260,"The source of the classified intelligence that U.S. President Donald Trump shared with Russian officials in May was information Israel obtained after hacking computers belonging to ISIS, the New York Times reported Monday.

According to the Times, which cited a U.S. official, Israeli ""cyberoperators"" managed to penetrate an ISIS cell of bombmakers based in Syria a number of months ago.

According to the report, the information was so good that it allowed the United States to learn that the terror cell was working on explosives that could fool airport security by passing as a laptop battery.

According to the report, the information helped support a ban since March on carrying electronics such as laptops on incoming flights from number of predominantly Muslim countries to the United States and Britain.

According to a May article in the New York Times, the source of the classified intelligence was Israel. The report cited a current U.S. official and a former one.

The intelligence was shared at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. The unnamed officials said Israel had previously urged the United States to be cautious with the information. The revelation that Trump shared sensitive intelligence with Russia raises the possibility that the information could be subsequently leaked to Iran.

The New York Times report said Israeli officials refused to confirm that Israel was the source of the information. But BuzzFeed News quoted two Israeli intelligence officials as saying that Israel had shared information with the United States on an Islamic State plan to sneak explosive-laden laptops onto airplanes. The New York Times' report that the U.S. president had shared Israeli intelligence with Russia was Israel's ""worst fears confirmed,"" one of the officers was quoted as saying.

Cooperation between Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies has intensified over the past two decades, with most of the joint operations directed, according to reports, against Iran, but also targeting Hezbollah and Hamas. An official agreement in 2008 for comprehensive cooperation, including the disclosure of sources and methods, reportedly led to impressive results, including the disruption of the Iranian nuclear program.

In January, it was reported that Israeli intelligence officials were concerned that the exposure of classified information to their American counterparts in the Trump administration could lead to it being leaked to Russia and onward to Iran. The intelligence concerns, which had been discussed in closed forums, were based on suspicions of ties between Trump, or his associates, and the government of Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

According to the January report, American officials under President Barack Obama implied that Israel should “be careful” when transferring intelligence information to the White House and the National Security Council following Trump's inauguration on January 20.

Vladimir Putin says can prove Trump did not pass Russia secrets,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-putin-idUSKCN18D1EA?il=0,"SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump had not divulged any secrets during a meeting in Washington with Russian officials and offered to prove it by supplying Congress with a transcript.

But a leading U.S. Republican politician said he would have little faith in any notes Putin might supply.

Two U.S. officials said on Monday Trump had disclosed classified information about a planned Islamic State operation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they met last week, plunging the White House into a fresh controversy just four months into Trump’s tenure.

Trump, whose administration has been dogged by allegations that Russia helped him win the White House and that he and his allies are too cozy with Moscow, has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians after media reports of the meeting alarmed some U.S. and foreign politicians.

President Putin deployed his trademark sarcasm on Wednesday to make clear he thought the accusation that Trump had divulged secrets absurd.

“I spoke to him (Lavrov) today,” a smiling Putin told a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.

“I’ll be forced to issue him (Lavrov) with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us. Not with me, nor with representatives of Russia’s intelligence services. It was very bad of him.”

Putin, who still hopes Moscow can repair battered ties with the United States despite a deepening political scandal in the United States related to Trump’s purported Russia ties, said Moscow had rated Lavrov’s meeting with Trump highly.

If the Trump administration deemed it appropriate, Putin said Russia could hand over a transcript of Trump’s meeting with Lavrov to U.S. lawmakers to reassure them that no secrets were revealed.

A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, later told reporters that Moscow had a written record of the conversation, not an audio recording.

KREMLIN CREDIBILITY

U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio was unimpressed with Putin’s offer and alluded to alleged Russian hacking of Democratic groups during the U.S. presidential election.

“I wouldn’t put much credibility into whatever Putin’s notes are,” Rubio said on Fox News. “And if it comes in an email, I wouldn’t click on the attachment.”

Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is among those probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, called Putin’s offer “quite amusing.”

“The last person Trump needs to vouch for him right now is Vladimir Putin,” Schiff said in an interview with CBS News. “If they want to send something, you know, hats off. Send it our way... It’s credibility would be less than zero.”

Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election.

Trump is also under pressure over accusations he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end the agency’s investigation into the Russia ties of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The allegation stems from a memo written by Comey and seen by a source familiar with the contents of the memo.

In Washington, Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the Comey memo. U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger joined a small but growing number of Republican lawmakers who have said they would back some sort of independent investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election.

“If in fact what was in the memo is true, it’s very concerning and we need to get to the bottom of that,” Kinzinger said on CNN.

‘EITHER STUPID OR CORRUPT’

Complaining about what he said was “political schizophrenia” in the United States, Putin said Trump was not being allowed to do his job properly.

“It’s hard to imagine what else these people who generate such nonsense and rubbish can dream up next,” said Putin, referring to unnamed U.S. politicians.

“What surprises me is that they are shaking up the domestic political situation using anti-Russian slogans. Either they don’t understand the damage they’re doing to their own country, in which case they are simply stupid, or they understand everything, in which case they are dangerous and corrupt.”

Russia has repeatedly said that Trump’s opponents are trying to damage him and Moscow by making what it says are false accusations about the billionaire president and the Russian government which initially had high hopes of a rapprochement.

Officials have told Reuters Trump’s alleged disclosure of classified information to Russia’s foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with Washington from cooperating.

That view was reinforced on Wednesday when British Prime Minister Theresa May said her government had confidence in its relationship with the United States and would continue to share intelligence with Britain’s most important defense and security ally.",JustBadNews,0

Facebook Shuts Down World's Biggest Page For Atheists,https://ultra.news/t-t/31216/facebook-shuts-worlds-biggest-page-atheists,"Facebook has restored ‘Atheist Republic’, by far the biggest page operated by the Atheist community on any social media network, after it was shut down using ‘mass reporting’ by religious people.

The move followed a big outcry among atheists and free-speech advocates online.

The page was taken down about 24 hours ago, and remained inaccessible to the general public for much of that time period.

However, the associated Facebook group by the same name was functional and accessible.

The Atheist Republic page was being used by over 1.6 mln Atheists to communicate, and is only one of the several such minority-oriented pages that have been targeted by religious believers via ‘mass reporting’.

Under Facebook’s ‘community guidelines’, if enough people flag a page as being harmful or promoting violence or containing illegal content, the page is automatically hidden without any manual intervention.

There are several groups on Facebook whose sole purpose is to shut down the personal accounts, groups and pages of those who are critical of major established religions (see picture below).

Once a page is restricted, the moderators and administrators have the option of submitting the decision for a manual review, and several pages have been resuscitated as a result of the appeals process.

The Atheist Republic page was reportedly started by Armin Navabi, who is of Iranian origin, and was being managed by a group of moderators including Allie Jackson.

“I’m simply in tears,” Jackson said. “Every single day, we have helped numerous atheists.. now, without proper reason, without care, they remove us.. they have cut off our reach to the community we’ve spent years growing.”

She said that for over 6 years, Atheist Republic administrators have had their personal Facebook accounts banned and their posts removed “because people have harassed us over content they didn’t like. She said Facebook knows that the platform’s algorithms are abused by people and organized groups. But “they blame us for not following terms of service, or community standards, while the people harassing us get rewarded for organizing complaints over content they disagreed with.”

In addition to pages, groups too can be shut down by mass reporting.

However, since membership in groups can be controlled by the administrators unlike in case of page — which is visible to everyone on the Internet — reporting a group in a co-ordinated attack is more difficult.

Believers in God have, however, successfully targeted groups too, such as the Freethinkers Group of India, which was taken down six times.

Many religious people find the idea of people not believing in their religion abhorrent, especially since the non-believers often create posters and articles that question their beliefs.

“The page that has oppressed me for four hideous months is no more,” claimed a user in another group.

“Atheist Republic has been removed from Facebook.. I’ve gotten (sic) justice for being emotionally violated by that evil page,” he added.

On the other side, many fans of the page are equally distraught at the ‘taking down’ of the page as well.

“Religious fanatics are organizing together and mass reporting secular pages, taking advantage of Facebook’s reporting algorithm to shut freethinkers down,” complained Ali Rizvi, a Canada-based doctor of Pakistani origin.

Paradoxically, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, was earlier listed as an atheist himself, though he recently said he was no longer ‘anti-religion’ as he used to be.",JustBadNews,0
Monsanto accused of hiring army of trolls to silence online dissent ? court papers,https://www.rt.com/usa/386858-monsanto-hired-trolls-court/,"Biotech giant Monsanto is being accused of hiring, through third parties, an army of Internet trolls to counter negative comments, while citing positive “ghost-written” pseudo-scientific reports which downplay the potential risks of their products.

The documents emerged during pre-trials on 50 lawsuits against Monsanto which were pending in the US District Court in San Francisco. The plaintiffs allege that exposure to the biotech giant’s flagship product, the herbicide Roundup, caused them or their relatives to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while Monsanto concealed the potential risks.

In March, a judge ruled, despite Monsanto’s objections, that the documents obtained by the plaintiffs could be released. The court papers are being gathered at the website of food-safety whistleblower organization US Right to Know.

The plaintiffs alleged that Monsanto targeted all online materials and even social media comments that indicate potential dangers of its products, according to one document released late in April.

“Monsanto even started the aptly-named ‘Let Nothing Go’ program to leave nothing, not even Facebook comments, unanswered; through a series of third parties, it employs individuals who appear to have no connection to the industry, who in turn post positive comments on news articles and Facebook posts, defending Monsanto, its chemicals, and GMOs,” the document reads.

On a larger scale, Monsanto allegedly “quietly funnels money to ‘think tanks’ such as the ‘Genetic Literacy Project’ and the ‘American Council on Science and Health”– organizations intended to shame scientists and highlight information helpful to Monsanto and other chemical producers,” according to the plaintiffs.

The accusations are backed by a batch of emails, used in court as evidence, which were written by some Monsanto executives, instructing the staff to “ghost-write” articles and then have some “independent scientists” just sign their names under the “study” in order to reduce costs.

“A less expensive/more palatable approach might be to involve experts only for the areas of contention, epidemiology and possibly MOA (depending on what comes out of the IARC meeting), and we ghost-write the Exposure Tox & Genetox sections,” the letter’s excerpt reads. “An option would be to add Greim and Kier or Kirkland to have their names on the publication, but we would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just edit & sign their names so to speak. Recall that is how we handled Williams Kroes & Munro, 2000.”

Monsanto, however, dismissed such allegations, claiming that the plaintiffs’ attorneys took a “single comment in a single email out of context.” The new accusations appear to be better-founded than earlier ones, which were largely based on the words of one of Monsanto’s top executives, Dr. William Moar, who reportedly said at a conference in January 2015 that the company had an “an entire department,” dedicated to “debunking” science which disagreed with the agrochemical giant’s own research.

One of Monsanto’s most well-known attempts to silence “bad” science was related to a report issued by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in March 2015. Monsanto promptly labelled the report as “biased,” and demanded it be retracted. The report said Roundup’s key ingredient glyphosate was “probably carcinogenic.”

“We question the quality of the assessment,” Monsanto’s vice president of global regulatory affairs, Philip Miller, said. “The WHO has something to explain.”

'Lawsuits have no merit, glyphosate does not cause cancer' – Monsanto to RT

In a response to this story, a Monsanto representative has sent a statement to RT, ""confidently [saying] that glyphosate is not the cause"" of cancer.

Read more

Saying that ""no regulatory agency in the world considers glyphosate a carcinogen,"" Monsanto referred to regulatory authorities in Europe, US, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Australia, who ""have publicly reaffirmed that glyphosate does not cause cancer.""

""Plaintiffs’ attorneys in the United States have been soliciting plaintiffs for potential lawsuits since an ad hoc working group called IARC incorrectly classified glyphosate,"" the statement said, adding that ""these attorneys are attempting to tie the IARC classification to individual cases of cancer, and they have been running advertisements to recruit plaintiffs. These lawsuits have no merit.""

""While IARC’s erroneous classification has attracted media attention and been used repeatedly by certain anti-agriculture organizations to generate unwarranted fear and confusion, regulators around the world continue to support the safe use of glyphosate,"" Monsanto's email to RT said, adding that the company ""empathize[s] with anyone facing cancer.""",JustBadNews,0

Lebanon clerics order 'scandalous' Coca-Cola ads to be replaced,https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/blog/2017/4/24/lebanon-clerics-order-scandalous-coca-cola-ads-to-be-replaced,"A religious committee in northern Lebanon has demanded that local authorities take action against the display of ""scandalous"" advertising billboards in Tripoli.

The Association of Muslim Scholars in Lebanon this month ordered Tripoli's municipality to remove several offensive Coca-Cola ads from the streets of the conservative Sunni majority city.

The billboards were taken down out of ""respect for the common morals of people"" the association said in a statement on Saturday.

It posted an image on social media of the ads - which featured a topless man and a swimsuit-wearing woman embracing on the beach - being torn down.

Raid Hlaihel, head of the Association of Muslim Scholars, told local media that the large outdoor ads were ""indecent and immoral"".

""It was disrespectfully placed outside a mosque. If we could have removed them ourselves we wouldn't have hesitated so we took legal action and asked the municipality to take it down,"" Hlaihel said.

""As summer is approaching we ask companies to not exploit women's bodies to sell their products and to respect our values… some of these images I haven't seen in Europe before.""

The Association of Muslim Scholars has made headlines in the past for making controversial decisions such as banning Muslims from taking part in non-Islamic religious ceremonies.



This order came about after a video went viral showing Muslim girls singing at Christmas mass.

It has also been accused of having close ties to extremists movements after it mediated between the Lebanese army and jihadi groups.

Many Lebanese have taken to social media to comment on the decision to take down the advertisement.

""We will not be silent about Tripoli being expelled from Lebanese society,"" TV journalist Dima Sadek said on Twitter.

Professor at Lebanese University, Rouba Dalati, said: ""Coca-Cola thanks you for the free marketing"".",JustBadNews,0
"Jimmy Wales, the founder of online encyclopedia Wikipedia, has launched a website aimed at countering the spread of fake news by bringing together professional journalists and a community of volunteers and supporters to produce news articles",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-media-wikitribune-idUSKBN17R11K?il=0,"LONDON (Reuters) - The founder of online encyclopaedia Wikipedia has announced plans for a crowd-funded news website offering stories by journalists and volunteers working together, an initiative he hopes will counter the spread of fake news.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

Jimmy Wales said the new platform, Wikitribune, would be free to read and carry no advertising, instead relying on supporters to fund it, while the accuracy of its articles would be easily verifiable as source material would be published.

“The news is broken, but we’ve figured out how to fix it,” he said in a promotional video posted on the website’s homepage, which does not yet carry any news stories. The page indicates the platform will go live in 29 days.

The initial goal is to raise sufficient funds to hire 10 professional journalists. The website is set up to encourage supporters to give $10 a month, but the amount and frequency of gifts can easily be modified.

The online proliferation of fake news, some of it generated for profit and some for political ends, became a major topic of angst and debate in many developed countries during last year’s U.S. presidential election.

Charlie Beckett, media professor at the London School of Economics, welcomed Wikitribune as an attempt to tackle a lack of public trust in mainstream media, but questioned whether it would have the scale and reach to stem the flow of fake news.

“The kind of people who will pay attention to Wikitribune and contribute to it are people who are already pretty media-literate,” he told Reuters.

Wales argued in his video that because Internet users expected news to be free, news sites were reliant on advertising money, which incentivized them to produce “clickbait” rather than quality output.

He also said social media networks, where an ever-increasing number of people get their news, were designed to show users what they wanted to see, confirming their biases.

The Wikitribune website said articles would be authored, fact-checked and verified by journalists and volunteers working together, while users would be able to flag up issues and submit fixes for review.

Beckett said journalists could benefit from tapping into expertise or information held by readers, but said this was already being done by many mainstream media. He also said it was not a miracle remedy against inaccuracy.

“There’s nothing magical about being a citizen. As a citizen you have your own bias and prejudice and experience as well,” he said.",JustBadNews,0
12 killed in Venezuela as protests continue,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/eleven-killed-violence-venezuela-protests-170421173018957.html,"Deaths occurred overnight throughout the capital Caracas during running street battles with security forces and looting.

Twelve people were killed in Caracas overnight following two days of mass street protests against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro‘s beleaguered government.

Six people were also injured in the escalating violence, the public ministry said in a statement on Friday. The latest figures raised the total number of deaths during growing protests to 20 over the past three weeks.

Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami said on Friday the country is facing what he calls an “unconventional war” led by opposition groups working in concert with criminal gangs.

Riot police firing tear gas fought running street battles in the east, west, and south of Caracas with demonstrators demanding the removal of Maduro, witnesses quoted by AFP news agency said.

The public ministry said 11 people died in El Valle – a working class neighbourhood near Caracas’ biggest military base – all men between the ages of 17 and 45. Another death was reported east of Caracas in El Sucre.

A probe was ordered “to investigate the deaths of 11 people and the injuries caused to six others”, the ministry said.

Opposition leaders said some people were hit with an electrical current in El Valle while trying to loot a bakery protected by an electric fence.

Resident Carlos Yanez said the scene was “like a war”.

“The police were firing tear gas, armed civilians were shooting guns at buildings. My family and I threw ourselves to the floor. It was horrible,” said the 33-year-old construction worker.

The opposition accuses the left-wing government of sending gangs of armed thugs to attack them, and says security forces have been repressing protesters.

Video taken by locals showed residents throwing bottles and other objects out their windows at the gunmen in the streets below, shouting “murderers”.

At one point, demonstrators throwing Molotov cocktails managed to set fire to one of the armoured police trucks firing tear gas at them, lighting up the night sky.

There was a heavy security presence Friday on the streets of Caracas, as residents and workers cleaned up the destruction left by the clashes and bouts of looting.

The two sides looked set to spend the day regrouping after massive protests Wednesday and Thursday erupted into unrest in the flashpoint western city of San Cristobal and several other cities.

Call for more protests

Opposition leaders have called new protests for Saturday and Monday.

On Saturday, they plan to march in silence to the Catholic Church’s episcopal seats nationwide. They also intend to erect roadblocks on Monday to grind the country’s traffic to a halt.

Protesters blame Maduro – heir of the leftist Bolivarian Revolution launched by the late Hugo Chavez in 1999 – for an economic crisis marked by severe shortages of food, medicine, and basic goods.

Maduro says the protests seeking to remove him are part of a United States-backed coup plot.

On Thursday, the president said the opposition had agreed to new talks, but his opponents denied the claim, saying the only way forward was new elections.

Senior opposition leader Henrique Capriles slammed Maduro as a “dictator” and “mythomaniac”.",JustBadNews,0

"Arizona Coyotes hockey team draft pick Mitchell Miller is being accused of a long history of racism and abuse. Miller bullied and assaulted a developmentally disabled black classmate for years, the case was so bad it ended up going to court. The team stands behind their pick.",http://cbssports.com/nhl/news/coyotes-drafting-mitchell-miller-is-latest-proof-that-nhls-anti-racism-initiatives-are-ringing-hollow/,"The NHL and its 31 teams swear they're doing everything that they can to eliminate racism from the sport. The social unrest amplified by events of 2020 have helped shine a light on race issues that have existed in hockey for decades. Before the start of this year's Stanley Cup Playoffs in August, Minnesota Wild defenseman Matt Dumba delivered a heartfelt speech about racism, its existence in the sport and the need to change the culture around hockey. Later that month, the NHL followed the lead of the NBA and postponed two days of playoff hockey as a form of protest against systemic racism and police brutality.

Seeing the NHL and its teams openly recognize racism and offer a commitment to change is a step in the right direction, but those gestures only mean so much if they're followed by meaningful change. Unfortunately, some of the early returns on those commitments have been disappointing.

The latest instance of that comes from the Arizona Coyotes, who just last month touted the fact their CEO had joined an NHL committee tasked with eradicating racism and discrimination. A few weeks later, the team used its first draft pick on Mitchell Miller, a player with a significant and concerning history of racism away from the ice.

As reported by the Arizona Republic on Monday, the 18-year-old Miller was convicted of ""bullying"" Isaiah Meyer-Crothers, a developmentally disabled, Black classmate four years ago.

Here are the details, via the Arizona Republic:

""Four years ago, Miller admitted in an Ohio juvenile court to bullying Meyer-Crothers, who was tricked into licking a candy push pop that Miller and another boy had wiped in a bathroom urinal. Meyer-Crothers had to be tested for hepatitis, HIV and STDs, but the tests came back negative, according to a police report. Meyer-Crothers, also 18 and who now lives in Detroit, said Miller had taunted him for years, constantly calling him 'brownie' and the 'N-word,' while repeatedly hitting him while growing up in the Toledo suburb. Other students at their junior high confirmed to police that Miller repeatedly used the 'N-word' in referring to Meyer-Crothers.""

According to Meyer-Crothers' mother, video surveillance footage also captured Miller ""smashing Isaiah's head against a brick wall."" She believes part of the reason Miller pled guilty was to prevent that video from being released in court.

The police report provides further gut-wrenching details of what Miller did.

The Coyotes, in light of the report, continue to stand behind the decision to draft Miller, saying ""given our priorities on diversity and inclusion, we believe that we are in the best position to guide Mitchell into becoming a leader for this cause and preventing bullying and racism now and in the future.""

Mitchell completed court-mandated community service and sent a letter to every NHL team acknowledging his transgressions and apologizing for his behavior. According to Meyer-Crothers' mother, Mitchell never personally apologized to her son for the pain he inflicted. Last week, more than two weeks after Miller's selection, the Coyotes published a statement from the player in which he said he is ""extremely sorry about the bullying incident that occurred in 2016"" and that he wants ""to be a leader for this cause and help end bullying and racism.""

Obviously, the team trusted his words and saw enough in Miller to believe that he was worth the PR headache that they had to figure would come after the draft. Whether it was the player's hockey ability or actual personal growth that convinced them, we may never know.

""Mitchell made a huge mistake, but we are providing him with a second chance to prove himself,"" Coyotes GM Bill Armstrong, who recently joined the team's front office and wasn't involved in the process of drafting Mitchell, told the Arizona Republic. ""We hope that he uses his platform moving forward to raise awareness about bullying and to discourage this type of behavior.""

A key part of that quote from Armstrong is the team ""providing"" Miller with a second chance. He hasn't really seemed to earn that second chance, at least not yet, and that's what makes the Coyotes' decision to draft him a bit harder to stomach.

Not only does it contradict the organization's supposed hard stance against racism, but it also sends an all-too-familiar message: A team recognizes a player's problematic behavior but are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because he's talented and says he's sorry.

Some will argue that the Coyotes drafting this kid should be viewed in a positive light. Others will argue that Miller's age at the time of these events should play a factor. Kids make mistakes and kids do stupid things that they grow and learn from.

But anyone using age as a defense here also has to recognize that actions of the immature still often carry consequences. Miller hasn't seemed to suffer too many consequences as a result of his heinous transgressions. A terrible display of character and judgement as a kid shouldn't necessarily follow a person for the rest of their life, but in certain circumstances a person has to dig their way out on their own without the way being paved for them. He's still earned a scholarship to the University of North Dakota (which, in a statement, called Miller's conviction an ""unfortunate incident"") and was drafted about one round later than initially projected.

Ultimately, the problem is -- and continues to be -- a lack of significant change when it comes to behavior, approach and consideration with situations like these in the NHL. How are Black hockey players supposed to feel when they hear the NHL say it is committed to ridding the game of racism, yet a team is willing to take a chance on a player with a clear history of racist behavior before he's even had a real opportunity to show that he's changed?

This isn't an isolated circumstance of words ringing hollow, either. Earlier in October, the Hockey Diversity Alliance -- which was only founded four months ago to fight inequality in hockey -- made the decision to cut ties with the NHL because the organization didn't feel the league was serious about addressing issues of race in the sport.

""The support we hoped to receive from the NHL was not delivered, and instead the NHL focused on performative public relations efforts that seemed aimed at quickly moving past important conversations about race needed in the game,"" the HDA said in a statement. ""We have waited many months for a response to the common sense HDA pledge we proposed and it is clear that the NHL is not prepared to make any measurable commitments to end systemic racism in hockey.""

It's unfortunate, too, because this situation with Miller could have been one of the first real chances for the NHL and HDA to work together under a specific incident of racism involving a player. The two sides would have had the opportunity to consult one another and discuss how they should move forward.

If a young player with a track record of racial insensitivity is brought into the league, the HDA should be able to serve as the voice of those players who may feel uncomfortable or overlooked as a result. They should also be able to provide an idea of what sort of things they'd need to see from that incoming player in order to feel like they've showcased real change.

Assuming the relationship isn't irreparably fractured, there's still time for the league to revisit its ties to the HDA and ask for help navigating the current situation in Arizona, as well as any future situations like this one.

Despite all the lip service and nice gestures, it's hard to feel like league is making steadfast progress on real change when the patterns appear to be staying the same.",JustBadNews,0

Washington (AFP)

US President Donald Trump on Friday voiced anger at Ethiopia over its construction of a huge dam on the Nile River and appeared to suggest that Egypt may destroy it.

Trump made the remarks as he announced a breakthrough normalization deal between US ally Israel and Sudan, which like Egypt fears that Ethiopia will use up scarce water resources.

""It's a very dangerous situation because Egypt is not going to be able to live that way,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office with leaders of Sudan and Israel on speakerphone.

""They'll end up blowing up the dam. And I said it and I say it loud and clear -- they'll blow up that dam. And they have to do something,"" Trump said.

""They should have stopped it long before it started,"" Trump said, regretting that Egypt was in domestic tumult when the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam project began in 2011.

Trump -- a close ally of Egypt's general turned president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi -- had agreed to Cairo's pleas to mediate over the dam, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin leading talks.

The State Department in September said it was cutting off aid to Ethiopia due to its decision to begin filling the dam despite not reaching an agreement with the downstream nations.

""I had a deal done for them and then unfortunately Ethiopia broke the deal, which they should not have done. That was a big mistake,"" Trump said.

""They will never see that money unless they adhere to that agreement,"" he said.

Ethiopia says that the $4 billion project is indispensible for its electrification and development needs and has voiced hope of beginning operations in early 2021.

Egypt depends on the Nile for about 97 percent of its irrigation and drinking water.

Sudan's Prime Minister Abdulla Hamdok, asked by Trump on speakerphone about the dam, voiced appreciation for US diplomacy and said his government wanted an ""amicable solution soon"" among the three countries.

"Five people die after getting flu shots in South Korea, sparking vaccine fears",http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8862469/Five-people-die-getting-flu-shots-South-Korea-sparking-vaccine-fears.html,"Five people have died after getting flu shots in South Korea in the past week, authorities said, raising concerns over the vaccine's safety just as the winter jab programme is expanded because of Covid-19.

Authorities said there was no reason to believe the deaths were linked to the vaccine but an investigation including post-mortems is underway.

'It makes it hard for us to put out a categorical statement,' vice health minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing today about the deaths, which include a 17-year-old boy and a man in his 70s.

Coming just weeks after the rollout of the national vaccine programme was suspended over safety worries, the deaths have dominated headlines in South Korea.

A nurse holds up a flu vaccine at a clinic in Seoul, South Korea, where authorities say five people have died after getting the shot in the last week

A 17-year-old boy who died on Friday was the first death noted by officials to follow receipt of the vaccine.

The boy died two days after receiving the flu shot in Incheon, near the capital Seoul.

A man in his 70s, who had Parkinson's disease and arrhythmia, was the most recent case. He died in Daegu on Wednesday, a day after receiving the flu vaccine.

Daegu officials said the man had received vaccines since 2015 with no prior adverse reactions.

Officials last month announced plans to procure 20 per cent more flu vaccines for the winter than the previous year.

They hope to inoculate 30million people in a bid to prevent the health system being overloaded by patients with flu and Covid-19 exposure.

However, the start of a free jab programme was suspended for three weeks after it was discovered that some 5 million doses, which need to be refrigerated, had been exposed to room temperature while being transported to a medical facility.

Officials said 8.3million people have been inoculated with the free flu vaccine since it resumed on October 13, with around 350 cases of adverse reactions reported.

South Korea's president Moon Jae-in looks into a microscope during a visit to a vaccine development company in Seongnam last week

The highest number of deaths linked to the seasonal flu vaccination was six in 2005, according to Yonhap news agency.

Boosting public trust in vaccines has become a major global challenge this year, as some countries rush to approve experimental Covid-19 vaccines before full safety and efficacy studies have been completed.

The World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global health threats for last year.

In South Korea, a poll earlier this month found that 62 per cent of people in Gyeonggi province, near Seoul, would not get vaccinated against Covid-19, even if a vaccine is approved, until all safety questions are fully answered.

South Korea's flu vaccines are supplied by different drugmakers, including LG Chem Ltd and Boryung Biopharma Co. Ltd, a unit of Boryung Pharm Co Ltd.

A Boryung official said the company was aware of the reported deaths, but had no immediate comment. LG Chem said the company would follow government advice.",JustBadNews,0

A number of people have reportedly been shot dead or wounded at a protest against police brutality in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos.

Witnesses and the rights group Amnesty International said several people were killed and wounded when soldiers opened fire.

The state governor said about 25 people had been wounded but only one person had died.

An indefinite 24-hour curfew has been imposed on Lagos and other regions.

Protests over a now-disbanded police unit - the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) - have been taking place for two weeks, with demonstrators using the social media hashtag #EndSars to rally crowds.

As tensions continued to rise on Wednesday, police in different districts of Lagos fired shots in the air to disperse people defying the curfew, the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo reports from the capital, Abuja.

Protesters who briefly gathered again at the Lekki toll gate - where Tuesday's shootings took place - were forced out by police, he adds.

President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed for ""understanding and calm"".

However, plumes of smoke could be seen above Lagos on Wednesday.

A reporter for AFP news agency said several buildings were in flames around the Lekki area. A bus station was reported to be on fire in another district while a major TV station - linked to one of the governing party's top politicians - was reportedly set alight by people throwing petrol bombs.

The headquarters of the Nigerian Ports Authority was also set on fire, local media said.

What do we know about the shooting?

Witnesses spoke of uniformed men opening fire in the wealthy Lekki suburb on Tuesday evening.

Soldiers were seen barricading the protest site moments before the shooting, BBC Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones reports.

Social media footage streamed live from the scene shows protesters tending to the wounded.

image copyright Reuters image caption Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu visited injured people in hospital on Wednesday

An unnamed witness told BBC News that shortly before 19:00 local time soldiers ""pulled up... and they started firing directly"" at peaceful protesters.

""They were firing and they were advancing straight at us. It was chaos. Somebody got hit straight beside me and he died on the spot,"" he said.

Four witnesses told Reuters news agency that soldiers had opened fire on demonstrators. One of them, Alfred Ononugbo, 55, said: ""They were firing into the crowd. I saw the bullet hit one or two persons.""

The Premium Times newspaper quoted witnesses as saying about 12 people had been killed.

In a tweet, Amnesty International Nigeria said it had ""received credible but disturbing evidence of excessive use of force occasioning deaths of protesters at Lekki toll gate in Lagos"".

How have the authorities reacted?

In a statement on Wednesday, President Buhari did not directly refer to the shootings, but called on people to have patience as police reforms ""gather pace"".

A statement issued by his office said the dissolution of the Sars was ""the first step in a set of reform policies that will deliver a police system accountable to the Nigerian people"".

""The presidency wishes to reiterate the full commitment of the Buhari administration to the implementation of lasting police reforms in Nigeria,"" it added.

The army has not issued a statement on events in Lekki, but in several Twitter posts it described media reports as ""fake news"".

Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who visited hospitals on Wednesday, said about 25 people had been wounded in what he described as an ""unfortunate shooting incident"".

He initially said no-one had been killed but later said one person had died in hospital due to ""blunt force trauma to the head"".

Contradicting the army, he told the BBC's Newshour programme that the military had been at the scene at the time of the shooting despite public assurances that soldiers would not be deployed until after the start of a curfew at 21:00.

""I think about seven o'clock or thereabouts there was a small unit of the military that went [to Lekki] and we heard that gunshots were fired,"" he said.

What other reaction has there been?

And former US Vice-President Joe Biden - who is standing against President Donald Trump in next month's election - also urged authorities to end the ""violent crackdown on protesters"".

""The US must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy,"" he said in a statement.

Nigerian footballer Odion Jude Ighalo, who plays for Manchester United, accused the Nigerian government of killing its own citizens. ""I'm ashamed of this government,"" he said in a video posted on Twitter.

Nigeria reacts to harrowing scenes

Analysis by Mayeni Jones, BBC Nigeria Correspondent

It was a bleak night in Nigeria as social media footage from the shooting poured in, showing gunshots ringing out at the protest site long into the night.

This is not the first time the Nigerian army has been accused of shooting unarmed protesters. There have been reports of violent crackdowns on EndSars protesters in other parts of the country.

But seeing live rounds used at one of the protest sites that had been peaceful until last night has rattled many. Just last week I stood at the very site of the shooting.

The protesters were peaceful, organised, hopeful for the future of their country. But this is no more.

Harrowing social media videos showing protesters singing the national anthem as shots ring out in the background have caused outrage.

Multiple online accounts say the CCTV and lights were taken out at the toll gate where the protest took place before troops started advancing, leading to total chaos.

These details are galvanising a generation already disillusioned with the ruling class. The Nigerian government is running out of time to quell the growing dissatisfaction.

How did the unrest begin?

Protests began nearly two weeks ago with calls for the Sars police unit, which had been accused of illegal detentions, assaults and shootings, to be disbanded.

President Buhari dissolved the unit on 11 October.

But the demonstrators called for more changes in the security forces as well as reforms to the way the country is run.

The Ombudsman's office has found out that at around 1:00 PM on October 16, a member of the Azerbaijani armed forces called the brother of the Armenian soldier and said that his brother is with them, that they have beheaded him and were going to post his photo on the Internet. Afterwards, several hours later, the brother found the photo on the murdered soldier's social media account.

""The conviction is that these were members of the Azerbaijani army who posted the Armenian solder’s photo on his social media page.

France: Teacher decapitated in gruesome 'Islamist terror attack' near Paris,http://dw.com/en/france-teacher-decapitated-in-gruesome-islamist-terror-attack-near-paris/a-55304870,"French police shot a man dead on Friday after he allegedly decapitated a teacher near Paris.

The suspect allegedly beheaded 47-year-old history teacher Samuel Paty at about 5 p.m. in Conflans Sainte-Honorine, northwest of Paris.

Officers were called to the area after reports of a suspicious man loitering near the victim's school. They found the dead victim and saw the alleged perpetrator nearby. He was then shot dead after allegedly threatening officers.

The suspect is alleged to be an 18-year-old born in Moscow and originating from Chechnya, the predominantly Muslim Russian republic in the North Caucasus.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the victim was murdered because he was a teacher and taught freedom of expression

French President Emmanuel Macron described the incident as an ""Islamist terror attack"" and urged the nation to unite.

He said the victim was murdered because he was a teacher and taught freedom of expression.

""The whole country stands behind its teachers. Terrorists will not divide France, obscurantism will not win,"" Macron said after visiting the scene.

Prosecutors launch anti-terror probe

Police told reporters that the victim had recently held a class on freedom of speech in which he showed caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad — a lesson that had prompted a complaint against the teacher.

The father of a 13-year-old pupil told France Inter that the teacher gave Muslim students the option of leaving the room before showing the images. The teacher was not ""condesending or disrespectful,"" he said.

French anti-terror prosecutors said they were treating the incident as ""a murder linked to a terrorist organization"" and related to a ""criminal association with terrorists.""

'Unbelievably violent'

Local Mayor Eragny Thibault Humbert told Europe 1: ""It's unbelievably violent.""

""It is necessary to underline the speed with which the police officers neutralized the individual,"" he said.

A Twitter account purportedly operated by the killer posted a gruesome, unverified image of the killing and claimed responsibility for the attack shortly after the incident. The account was quickly suspended.

The Russian embassy in Paris later requested information about the suspect from French authorities, Russian news agency TASS reported.

French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said on Twitter said the incident would strengthen the fight against radical Islam. ""Our unity and our resolve are the only responses faced with the monstrosity of Islamist terrorism,"" the minister wrote.

The President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand said on Twitter: ""The assassination of a history teacher is an attack on freedom of expression and the values of the Republic.""

""Islamism is waging war on us,"" wrote right-wing leader Marine Le Pen following the killing.

Some Muslim leaders condemned the killing, which was perceived by many public figures as an attack on the essence of French statehood and its values of secularism, freedom of worship and freedom of expression.

Deadly attacks in France

France has seen a spate of deadly attacks in recent years, with over 250 people killed since 2015. The latest incident comes just weeks after another knife attack on the former offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which injured two people.

In 2015, several staff members at Charlie Hebdo were killed after publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. The paper recently republished the caricatures.

Michigan man charged with hate crimes after he allegedly attacked a group of Black teenagers and called them the N-word,http://cnn.com/2020/10/14/us/michigan-racist-charged-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A Michigan man is facing both a state and federal hate crime charge, after allegedly approaching a group of three Black teenagers at a state park and knocking one in the face with a bike lock.

The Black teen,who is not named in the criminal complaint, was in a parking lot at a state park in Monroe, Michigan, back in June, when Lee James Mouat, who is White, told them (using a slur) that ""n***ers don't belong on this beach,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

Mouat also repeatedly yelled racial slurs at the victim and the other teenagers, before allegedly striking the victim with a chain bike lock -- knocking out several teeth and fracturing his jaw, court documents say. If charged, Mouat could face up to 10 years in prison.

The Monroe County Sheriff's Office deputies arrived within several minutes of the attack and spoke with multiple witnesses who heard Mouat use racial slurs multiple times and threaten the Black teens, according to the complaint. According to the witnesses' accounts in the complaint, Mouat repeatedly yelled racial slurs and called them the N-word, and then walked over to the teens.

Witnesses told police an argument ensued about the music the teenagers were playing -- one witness heard Mouat describe it as ""gang music,"" according to the complaint -- and Mouat then went to his vehicle, returned with the chain bike lock and hit the victim. Another witness said they heard Mouat yell ""Black lives don't matter!""

Confused Eric Trump Says Dad Is Getting Cured by His Own 'Vaccine',http://thedailybeast.com/confused-eric-trump-says-dad-is-getting-cured-by-his-own-vaccines,"Presidential son Eric Trump apparently thinks that a coronavirus vaccine has been fully developed and his father took it after he caught the virus in order to defeat COVID-19.

If you are confused by that, you aren’t alone.

Eric Trump appeared on ABC’s This Week on Sunday morning to discuss President Donald Trump’s return to public events and campaign rallies despite his recent hospitalization for coronavirus. Prior to the younger Trump’s interview, guest host Jonathan Karl told viewers that the White House refused their request to bring on public health experts from the coronavirus task force.

“While his physician says the president is no longer contagious, the American public is still in the dark about basic questions, such as when the president last tested negative for COVID, and whether he is now completely in the clear of the disease,” Karl noted, adding: “We had hoped to talk to Dr. Fauci about both the outbreak at the White House and across the country. He was more than willing to join us, but the White House wouldn’t allow you to hear from the nation’s leading expert on coronavirus.”

Turning to the president’s son, Karl asked if he was concerned about his father hitting the campaign trail considering his recent battle with the serious disease. After Eric defended this weekend’s White House event that the president spoke at, noting that most attendees were wearing masks, Karl brought up the president telling radio host Rush Limbaugh that there was a moment when he was concerned he might succumb to the disease.

“How bad did it get?” Karl wondered aloud.

“Listen, that first day he got hit hard, Friday,” Trump said. “As a son, it’s never fun to watch your father fly off to Walter reed on Marine One. It’s a day no son wants to remember.”

He went on to say that the following day, he spoke with his father multiple times and “the guy sounded 100 percent,” crediting the medications and therapeutics the president took during his hospital stay.

Except, according to Trump, his dad was given a vaccine.

“It goes to speak how good some of these vaccines that are being created are and what my father's done on the vaccine front no one could have done,” Trump boasted. “My father literally started day one creating this vaccine, he worked to push this vaccine and now my father just took it and you see how well he got over it.”

“Can you clarify that? You said your father just took a vaccine?” Karl pushed back, wondering if Trump was referencing the therapeutics the president took during his stay.

Eric Trump quickly shifted, saying that it “shows the power of medicine and how far we’ve come on COVID,” noting that he was talking about the “medicines he was taking” at Walter Reed.

This isn’t the first time that Eric Trump has falsely asserted that the president took a “vaccine” during his hospital stay. (This is, of course, not how vaccines work—patients don’t take vaccines after they’ve been infected with a disease.)

“There's never been vaccines that were created so quickly, my father was just on one of them… it knocked it out in 24 hours,” Eric said during a radio interview on Oct. 7.

The president himself has repeatedly referred to the experimental cocktail of monoclonal antibodies he took from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as a “cure” and that he is now “immune” to the virus.

“I think this was a blessing from God that I caught [the virus], I think it was a blessing in disguise,” Trump said in a video last week. “I caught it, I heard about this drug, I said, 'Let me take it' … and it was incredible the way it worked.”

The president has also suggested the expensive treatment is more important than a vaccine and has promised senior citizens, without an explanation or plan, that he will make it “free” for them to take in the future.",JustBadNews,0
Kids jailed for not wanting to see father,http://news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/investigations/two-teen-brothers-refused-to-see-their-dad-an-ohio-judge-locked-them-up-during-a-pandemic,"CHARDON, Ohio — As Ohio jails released inmates over fears of the coronavirus this spring, Geauga County Juvenile Court Judge Timothy J. Grendell sent two teenage brothers, who hadn't been charged with any crimes, to spend the weekend incarcerated in the Portage County Juvenile Detention Center.

Our exclusive News 5 investigation ""Juvenile Injustice"" found serious concerns about how Judge Grendell punished the boys.

“This is abhorrent. Even if there is not a pandemic,"" said Amanda Powell, a longtime Ohio public defender who now works as a consultant for the National Juvenile Defender Center.

""It is my reading of Ohio statutes, that this detention of youth... was not authorized by law,"" she said.

Sent to detention

The brothers' trouble began in the early evening hours of Friday, May 29.

Their mother, Stacy, took Carson, 15, and Conner, 13, to the Geauga County Sheriff's Department, just as she was ordered to by Judge Grendell.

The judge decided the day before that Carson and Conner should resume visitation with their estranged father, even though the boys had repeatedly told their guardian ad litem they were not ready to see their dad.

At the sheriff's department, Carson and Conner refused to go with their father.

Instead of sending them back home with Stacy, Judge Grendell sent them straight to juvenile detention.

""I couldn’t believe that was happening. I didn’t understand how that was happening,"" she said.

'Well-mannered boys'

“I never imagined that I would ever see them in handcuffs,"" said Stacy. ""They’re very calm, well-mannered boys.""

She said her sons are the last kids you'd expect to be sent to juvenile detention.

Conner belongs his school's unicycle drill team.

Carson plays golf.

Both receive good grades, belong to a chess club, and volunteer at church.

""I’m trying to figure out what was in the best interest of the kids here to throw them in jail over this,"" she said.

‘I couldn’t bear it'

""It was extremely difficult to be stripped away from everything I am,"" said Carson, 15. ""I couldn't bear it.""

During his weekend at the detention center, Carson said he was locked up alone inside a cell.

He said he was not allowed to speak to anyone at the facility, including his little brother, whom he worried about constantly.

“I can’t even imagine how it was for him,"" said Carson. ""He needed me.""

‘Treated like an animal’

Carson was right.

""It ripped me apart not to be able to see him (Carson),"" said Conner.

He said reading books and reciting prayers gave him strength to endure his incarceration.

“I felt terrified,” said Conner. “I was treated like an animal. I was put in a cage, basically.”

'Unlawful, immoral, unjust'

""This is not the kind of behavior we want judges to exhibit in cases that are supposed to protect children,"" said Powell. ""I would describe it as unlawful. I would describe it as immoral. And I would describe it as unjust.""

Powell has trained thousands of attorneys in 26 states for the National Juvenile Defender Center, which works to ensure children receive ""excellent representation"" and are treated fairly in court.

""Ohio law provides for detention of youth in very limited circumstances and none of those circumstances were present here,"" she said. ""We know that children who have spent even one night in detention have, are harmed by that, even when that detention is warranted.""

The lieutenant's email

A few days later, Geauga County Sheriff's Lt. Gary Gribbons was so concerned by Carson and Conner's detention that he emailed staff regarding when juveniles can be detained.

Lt. Gribbons email said, ""The only times we should be taking juveniles into custody or to Portage is when... we have had direct involvement with a juvenile via an unruly or delinquent issue and have PC for a charge and we contact the Judge directly for placement and he orders the juvenile into custody,... we have an arrest warrant or written court order in hand from the judge to take the child into custody.""

""In this above mentioned incident we had no charges and no PC for the lock up, simply the judges verbal order, which is not enough,"" he wrote.

READ THE FULL EMAIL:

'Abuse of the system'

""I really don’t think the way to get visitation going in a productive way in a custody case is to lock the kids up,"" said John Lawson.

Lawson has practiced juvenile law in Ohio for 44 years, with a ""special emphasis in child custody and abuse and neglect and dependency cases.""

""My feeling is that, in and of itself, is really an abuse of the system,"" he said. ""These are kids that haven’t committed any crimes.""

The weekend the boys spent in juvenile detention is far from Lawson's only concern.

Close to two weeks after their release, Judge Grendell's constable, John Ralph, filed complaints against the brothers, alleging they violated Ohio's Unruly child statute.

""For unruly charges to evolve out of a private custody is extremely unusual,"" said Lawson. ""I’ve never seen a self-initiated filing of unruliness from a court employee before. It’s a rather peculiar situation.""

""I've only it seen happen once in my career and that's in this case,"" he said.

Lawson said the juvenile status offense is supposed to address chronic bad behavior, like truancy, not custody disputes.

""It’s just not what it’s there for,"" he said. ""It’s for kids that are in patterns of misbehavior.""

'No evidence'

The Office of the Geauga County Prosecuting Attorney agreed the charges were inappropriate.

A week after the complaints against Carson and Conner were filed, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Natalie Harper sent a memo to the sheriff's department stating, ""There is no evidence supporting Unruly charges against either of the juveniles.""

Harper wrote, ""Please be advised that Unruly charges are not a remedy for allegedly failing to comply with a court order issued in a private custody matter.""

READ THE FULL MEMO:

Judge Grendell's response

News 5 made several requests for an on-camera interview with Judge Grendell. He declined our requests.

His Court Administrator, Kimberly Laurie, emailed News5 the following statement:

“Not only am I prohibited from commenting on confidential juvenile matters as well as pending court cases, but my job as a Juvenile Court Judge is to protect the best interests of the children who come before the Court. While I cannot comment on the specifics of the case about which you inquire, I can assure you that my decisions are always in the best interest of the children, based on sound law and the actual facts in the case, which can include psychological exams by professionals, prior court rulings in other courts, and other expert testimony.”

“Every instance of the Court’s placement of a juvenile into the detention facility is in accordance with Ohio Law and Ohio Supreme Court approved Rules of Juvenile Procedure.

The aftermath

Since their incarceration, Stacy said her sons haven't been the same.

Conner is quieter. Carson struggles to sleep.

""It was horrifying that I was treated like that,"" said Conner. ""It made me realize that something needs to change in the way of the court.""

""I’ve been losing a lot of sleep. I dream about it almost every single night,"" said Carson. ""I read a lot now. That is to try and keep my mind off of it, but I just can’t.""

What happened next

The Unruly allegations against Carson and Conner were eventually dismissed without prejudice.

Court records show Judge Grendell recently transferred their custody case back to the Domestic Relations Court.

News 5 has confirmed there is at least one complaint filed with the Ohio Supreme Court against Judge Grendell.

We are unable to confirm whether there are additional complaints. The complaints are private unless there is a finding of wrongdoing.

Stacy's complaint regarding the custody order was recently dismissed by the Eleventh District Court of Appeals.

Fake Eggs Fitted With GPS Track Sea Turtle Traffickers In Central America - The Eggs Uncovered A 137-Kilometer Long Illegal Trade Chain.,http://zmescience.com/ecology/animals-ecology/fake-eggs-fitted-with-gps-905233/,"This photo shows the interior of a decoy turtle egg with visible GPS tracking mechanism. Credit: Helen Pheasey.

Seeking to address the rampant illegal trade of sea turtle eggs in Central America, researchers took inspiration from popular TV crime series, such as Breaking Bad and The Wire, and employed 3-D printed, GPS-enabled decoy eggs into nests on the beach — and this worked! Unsuspecting sea turtle egg traffickers collected the decoys along with the real eggs, and the researchers were able to track their movements across a trade chain covering 137 kilometers.

The study’s lead author, Helen Pheasey, a conservation biologist at the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology at the University of Kent in the UK, worked in close collaboration with conservation organization Paso Pacifico. The NGO’s mission is to stop the illegal trade of endangered sea turtles in Central America, and researchers affiliated with Paso Pacifico responded to a call for proposals for the Wildlife Crime Tech Challenge organized by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which gathers projects that employ technology in order to fight wildlife poaching.

In Costa Rica, turtle eggs are considered a delicacy and ‘seasonal treat’, even an aphrodisiac. Poachers sell the eggs for about $1 each to restaurants and bars, and with each nest having as many as one hundred eggs per nest, selling them is definitely big business.

Although collecting endangered sea turtle eggs is illegal and despite beach patrols, poaching is still rampant in Costa Rica and the Caribbean.

“In response to this, we came up with the idea of putting a tracking device in sea turtle nests to see if it was possible to see where the eggs were going once they’ve been taken. And this innovation really sort of came from Breaking Bad and from The Wire where they placed tracking devices on a tank of chemicals in Breaking Bad and a sound recorder in a tennis ball in The Wire,” Pheasey told ZME Science. “Essentially, what they did [Paso Pacifico] was they placed a 3d printed housing as similar as possible to a sea turtle egg. And inside it embedded a tracking device, which uses a similar sort of technology as your mobile phone. So it’s got a GPS and an SMS detector in there, and it will give you a signal, whenever there’s clear skies. My role really came in a lot later, they already had a prototype developed. I was actually the person who put the eggs in the nests. So I was the first person to deploy the decoys and actually test this technology on behalf of Pacifica,” she added.

The decoys, aptly named InvestEGGators, were placed in 101 turtle nests on four beaches in Costa Rica. A quarter of the fake eggs were eventually snatched by poachers from five clutches, including two belonging to two green turtle nests and three olive ridley nests.

Throughout all this time, the researchers could track the poachers’ movements through the GPS-enabled decoys. One made it close to a residential property before going radio silent, while another decoy traveled two kilometers to a nearby bar. But other poachers proved far more adventurous.

“We did it, we proved the concept that you can actually do this. And our longest track went from the beach to what we believe to be the end consumer. It was a 137-kilometer long track. Basically, what happened was the eggs were deployed in Aragon the Saturday night. On Monday morning, it started moving.” “The biggest challenge was secretly setting the eggs in nests that were likely to get stolen by poachers. This is sometimes difficult to predict. A memorable moment was watching the movement of sea turtle nest eggs from the computer, and realizing that they had moved from the coast to a market in San Jose, Costa Rica, and then onto a residential neighborhood. This documents the entire illegal market chain, and also pinpoints potential points of sale. Law enforcement and the government could use this tool in the future,” Sarah Otterstrom, Executive Director of Paso Pacifico, told ZME Science.

Pheasey noted that the eggs could be tracked via a cell phone app which allowed this egg’s progress to be tracked hourly.

“I basically watched this egg moving farther and farther inland. And eventually, it stopped. So I zoomed in and it showed me very, very clearly that it had gone behind a supermarket — some sort of back alley supermarket loading bay kind of area, which was pretty suspicious. There’s really no reason to be there unless you’re up to up to no good and that was a great result in itself,” Pheasey told ZME Science. “Then, the next day, I went to download the data from the eggs and, lo and behold, it had moved again, it was actually in a residential property. Now, this really does give us a lot of information. We know for a fact that the egg was taken illegally from the beach. The fact that it spent two days in sort of waiting suggests that it may have been handed over to a trafficker and there was definitely some transaction going on behind that supermarket… Then [the egg] ended up in a residential property, which really fits with what we know about the illegal trade of eggs in Costa Rica. We know from anecdotal information (from interviews) that eggs are sold door to door, and it seems very likely that this is what has happened.”

Another decoy traveled 43 kilometers from the deployment beach, before going silent in a residential area near the Costa Rican town of Cariari. Eleven days later, Paso Pacifico received photos of the dissected fake egg, along with information about where the eggs were supposedly purchased and for how much. This shows that the local community is aware of poaching activity and is actively interested in aiding conservation efforts by supplying information.

“Now, what we’re looking to do is invite people to actually participate in this project themselves… If they’ve got a turtle monitoring project, and they want to deploy some of these eggs, it’ll be very, very interesting to see what challenges they face in different places. For us, we found that the behavior of illegal harvesters was different on different coastlines on the Caribbean. And most of the illegal activity was happening very early hours of the morning, say 4 am. Whereas in the Pacific, it was happening in the early evening, sort of 6-7 pm. So this is just one of these things that you wouldn’t know until you actually get out into the field and test these things. And that’s what we’d like to see more,” said Pheasey.

The British researcher added that nobody was arrested, nor any legal repercussions resulted from this field trial. “It was very much about learning what the eggs were capable of,” Dr. Pheasey told me.

“Something to be aware of is that the local illegal harvesters, we’re pretty familiar with them, we know who they are. What we’re interested in doing with this technology is actually taking it beyond that, and looking at the bigger crime if you like, which is trafficking the eggs and moving the eggs around the country. That’s very much what we’re interested in from a law enforcement perspective,” she added. “But this is very much part of a holistic approach to the problem. And a lot of the work that really will benefit the conservation of sea turtles is education, providing people with opportunities, so they’re not having to resort to taking wildlife resources illegally, and they don’t have to run those risks. So improving literacy in the area, providing better healthcare, better education, and all of these will serve alongside this law enforcement tool.” “Dr. Pheasey is looking forward to a career in international wildlife trade. Paso Pacifico is working with local and international partners to explore concepts around the design of decoy trackers for shark fins and parrot eggs. Presently, we are meeting with conservationists who work on the ground on these species, but the design portion is in very early stages,” Otterstrom added.

Analysis of the skull showed that the girl, thought to have been between 15 and 18 at the time of her death, had had her nose and lips cut off, and she may have also been scalped as part of her punishment.

The team of researchers from University College London (UCL) believe she died shortly after sustaining the injuries, as the remains showed no evidence of healing.

Using radiocarbon dating, the researchers were able to estimate that the remains date back to between 776 and 899 AD.

Turkish government lied on COVID-19 infection and death statistics.,http://wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/02/turk-o02.html,"The COVID-19 pandemic’s resurgence in Turkey is intensifying, due to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s back-to-work campaign, supported by the bourgeois opposition parties and the union bureaucracy. Officially, around 1,500 new infections are recorded daily, and the total number of COVID-19 patients has reached 315,000. The daily death toll is between 65 and 70, and total deaths have passed 8,100.

On Wednesday, however, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca confirmed widespread suspicions that the Turkish government has deliberately lied to the public in order to downplay the severity of the pandemic and force workers back to work.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a COVID-19 case is “A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.” However, Koca said: “Not all cases are patients, because there are those who show no symptoms at all even though their tests come back positive. These amount to the vast majority,” admitting that from the beginning of the pandemic, “We have given this as the daily number of patients.”

When Koca said last month that “The number of people who have no symptoms and who are only vectors does not matter, as long as they do not infect someone else,” the WSWS explained that he “all but admitted that ‘herd immunity’ is his government’s strategy against the pandemic.”

After the health minister has acknowledged that his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has lied about and downplayed the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, endangering public health, the Turkish Medical Association (TTB) issued a statement denouncing the government.

“We have been saying this for six months. You haven’t run the process transparently,” the TTB declared, adding: “You have concealed the truth. You haven’t prevented the spread of the disease.” In response to this scandal, thousands of people used the hashtag “What is the number of cases?” in protest on social media.

Koca’s admission comes after CHP (Republican People’s Party) deputy Murat Emir published a document on September 29 allegedly coming from the health ministry’s internal records. It showed the number of positive cases on September 10 were 29,377, compared to the 1,512 new patients announced by Koca on the same day.

Moreover, Mustafa Adıgüzel, another CHP deputy, had announced in early September that only in five large cities, including Istanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Adana and Antalya, which are governed by the CHP, total death toll from the pandemic was 8,850 according to the official municipality data compared to nearly 6,800 deaths announced by the health ministry in that time.

These revelations expose not only the government’s lies, but also the complicity of the bourgeois opposition parties like the CHP. As the AKP government lied about the pandemic, the municipalities also refused to publicize their own statistics on deaths from COVID-19. In fact, the CHP supported the back-to-work and back-to-school campaigns, pursuing virtually identical policies in its local administrations as the AKP did at the national level.

The reopening of schools has already caused disastrous results, and three teachers in Kayseri have lost their lives due to coronavirus. Confirmed cases among workers in this CHP-led Ankara municipality have reached 981 last week, though it was only 235 just one month ago. Anger and opposition are escalating among health care workers, as more than 100 have lost their lives fighting the pandemic without serious measures taken by the government.

Ultimately, the government found no way except lies and manipulation to contain growing anger and opposition among workers at the official response to the pandemic and the growing social crisis.

Real unemployment and job losses after the pandemic have reached 14.2 million in June. Workers’ purchasing power is constantly falling as the Turkish lira continues to depreciate against the US dollar. Over the year, Turkey’s minimum wage of 2,300 liras has fallen from $385 to $300. Since the pandemic began, hundreds of thousands of workers have been forced to take unpaid leave on only 1,170 liras. This forced “unpaid leave” process was extended until July 2021 with the votes of the bourgeois opposition CHP.

In response to the widespread popular outrage that emerged over his government’s lies, Health Minister Koca tweeted yesterday, using capital letters, like US President Donald Trump, “Let’s remember that, as it combats the epidemic, our state is protecting NATIONAL INTERESTS AS MUCH AS PUBLIC HEALTH, because the epidemic affects all areas of life.”

This statement has made clear that the “national interests” mean the interests of the ruling class and its war policies across the region at the expense of the vast majority of society. Events are demonstrating that the ruling elites’ only concern during the pandemic has been to transfer trillions from working people to the banks and companies, and to suppress growing opposition to the “herd immunity” policy.

These policies are not peculiar to Turkey or the Erdoğan government. They have an international and bipartisan character amid the resurgence of the class struggle all over the world. Governments all over the world have lied about the danger COVID-19 poses, trying to manipulate figures to contain growing anger within the working class amid the raging pandemic.

Last month, it was revealed that US President Trump consciously sought to downplay the danger posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ignoring warnings from US intelligence and Chinese officials on the seriousness of the pandemic, he pressed ahead, leading to more than 200,000 deaths in the United States alone. Trump said, “I always wanted to play it down ... I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.”

His response only reflected major concerns of the ruling classes not only in the US but internationally. As the WSWS explained, “What ‘panic’ was Trump speaking about? He was primarily concerned with containing a stock market selloff before the bailout of Wall Street had been prepared. Furthermore, with workers in factories increasingly uneasy about the spread of the disease, he was afraid of mass working class walkouts, such as those that ultimately led to the closure of the US auto plants in March.”

While the most prominent example of this malign neglect policy of the ruling classes all over the world is the Trump administration in the United States, the European governments have also lied about and manipulated the real situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the fact that the German Interior Ministry reported in March that inaction would lead to over a million deaths just in Germany, president of the German parliament, Wolfgang Schäuble, said in April, “The truth is, we all hoped among ourselves that it wouldn’t get so bad,” in response to a question on why his government had not acted more rapidly against the pandemic.

This international capitalist conspiracy against the working class has vindicated the warnings made by the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) from the beginning. Only the mobilization of the working class can halt the herd immunity policy imposed by the ruling classes internationally, impose lock-downs to achieve social distancing and prevent a massive loss of life.",JustBadNews,0

Rape and killing of Dalit woman in India sparks mass outrage,http://cp24.com/world/rape-and-killing-of-dalit-woman-in-india-sparks-mass-outrage-1.5125984,"

Sheikh Saaliq, The Associated Press





NEW DELHI -- The gang rape and death of a woman from the lowest rung of India's caste system sparked outrage across the country on Wednesday, with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying in the streets.

The attack of the 19-year-old is the latest gruesome case of sexual violence against women to rile India, where reports of rape are hauntingly familiar.

The victim, who belonged to the Dalit community, was raped by four men on Sept. 14 in the heartland state of Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district. The woman's family told local media that they found her naked, bleeding and paralyzed with a split tongue and a broken spine in a field outside their home. She died two weeks later, on Tuesday, after battling serious injuries in a hospital in New Delhi.

Police said the four men, all from an upper caste, have been arrested.

Uttar Pradesh's chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, on Wednesday ordered a special investigation team to handle the case and said it will be tried in a fast-track court.

In New Delhi, police detained several female activists after they tried to march in the street shouting slogans against Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators carried placards that read, “Stop rape culture.”

Maimoona Mullah of the All India Democratic Women's Association said Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country, had become the “rape state of India.”

“We do not accept rape culture in the name of new India,” Mullah said.

Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, thronged the hospital premises in New Delhi and jostled with police. Party leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad urged Dalits across the country to flood the streets to demand that the perpetrators be hanged.

Dalits - formerly known as “untouchables” and at the bottom of India's unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy - are victims of thousands of attacks each year. According to human rights organizations, Dalit women are particularly vulnerable to caste-based discrimination and sexual violence.

Last month, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh. In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges. Both cases are pending in court.

In the latest case, questions were raised over a hasty cremation, with several politicians calling it an abuse of human rights.

The woman was cremated early Wednesday, with the family alleging that police did not allow them to perform her final rites. Videos on social media show the family weeping as police insisted on cremating the body without allowing them to take it home.

Senior Police Officer Vikrant Veer denied the allegations, while the leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, described the cremation incident as “abusive and unjust.”

In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties for those convicted of the crime.

In March, four men sentenced to death for the 2012 attack were hanged.

Indians often rally for swift justice in a country where a woman is raped every 15 minutes, according to government data, and sentencing is notoriously delayed by backlogged courts.

According to the government, police registered 33,658 cases of rape in 2017 - an average of 92 per day and a 35% jump from 2012. About 10,000 of the reported victims were children. The real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma of sexual violence.

India: Rape victim from untouchable caste cremated by police without family's consent; family beaten up upon protesting,http://news.yahoo.com/hathras-gang-rape-india-victim-065851955.html,"The family of a Dalit (formerly untouchable) woman who died after she was allegedly gang-raped has accused police officials of cremating her body without their permission.

The 19-year-old was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras district in northern India.

She was grievously injured and died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday after fighting for her life for two weeks.

Activists say police must explain why they took the ""inhumane decision"".

Her alleged attackers have been arrested and a fast-track court has been set up to hear the case.

Local journalist Abhishek Mathur, who witnessed the cremation from a distance, told the BBC that the police kept her family and media away from the funeral pyre.

Her body was brought to their village in Uttar Pradesh state around midnight. The victim's brother said that police officials were putting pressure on the family to cremate her immediately.

""When we refused, they took the body in an ambulance and cremated her,"" he said.

A senior district administration official, however, denied the allegation, saying the family's consent was taken.

Mr Mathur said the victim's mother wanted to take her body home for rituals before the last rites, but her request was denied.

""Police had formed a human-chain to stop the protesting crowds, the family and the media from getting close to the cremation spot,"" he added.

The victim's brother said some police officers were rude to them.

""They took the body away without our permission, without the permission of my parents and cremated her. We didn't even get to see her one last time,"" he said.

He further added that the police beat up members of the family when they protested to see the body, adding that even women members of the family were beaten up.

'Illegal and immoral'

By Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi

In India where a rape is reported every 15 minutes, most assaults don't even make news.

Story continues

But then comes a case that stands out for its brutality and shocks the conscience of the nation.

The gang rape of the 19-year-old Dalit teen is one such case that has caused widespread outrage.

But in this case, it's not just the attackers who have committed a heinous crime. The authorities too have treated her family with indignity - before and after her death.

Following the outrage, the Hathras police have denied reports that they cremated her body without the family's consent, but many local journalists have contested their story.

Videos shared widely on news TV channels and social media show her distraught family and villagers making several attempts to claim her body as the police ambulance arrived in the village.

In one video, her mother is seen weeping with her head on the bonnet of the car. In another, she's sitting on the road in front of the ambulance, weeping and beating her chest.

She's heard repeatedly pleading with officials to hand over the body to her so she could take it home one last time - and perform some rituals.

The victim's father is heard telling reporters that cremations are never held during the night. But the police still carried on with the 2:30am funeral.

The opposition Congress party has called the hasty cremation ""a gross violation of human rights"". On social media, many have called it ""illegal"" and ""immoral"".

Police officials have not made a statement about the allegations.

Her death has sparked anger across the country. Dalit activists have shut down the main market in Hathras and are demanding action against police officers.

They are also angry with the way police handled the investigation.

Activists in Delhi took to the streets to protest over the news of the victim's death

The victim's brother said that no arrests had been made in the first 10 days after the incident took place. ""She was left for dead. She fought for her life for 14 days,"" he said.

Several opposition leaders have condemned the incident, calling it ""insulting and unjust"".

Dalits are some of India's most downtrodden citizens because of an unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy that condemns them to the bottom of the ladder. Despite laws that protect them, discrimination remains a daily reality for the Dalit population, thought to number around 200 million.

On Twitter, the victim's death is among the top discussion trends, with many calling her the forgotten Nirbhaya, a reference to the 2012 gang-rape and murder of a woman in Delhi that shocked the world.

The 23-year-old physiotherapy student was named Nirbhaya - the fearless one - by the press as she could not be named under Indian law.

"Police: N.H. man killed wife's lover, ordered her to behead him",http://boston.com/news/crime/2020/09/25/police-n-h-man-killed-wifes-lover-ordered-her-to-behead-him,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A New Hampshire man who discovered his wife was having an affair kidnapped and killed the other man and forced his wife to decapitate him, according to police who charged the husband with capital murder and the wife with falsifying evidence.

In what one prosecutor called an “especially heinous and gruesome” case, authorities allege that the 30-year-old man from Jaffrey kidnapped Jonathan Amerault, 25, of Keene on Sept. 19, shot him to death in a car in Rindge and hid the body at a campsite in far northern New Hampshire, near Errol.

He is also charged with beating and threatening his wife, who has been charged with falsifying evidence. She told police her husband forced her to slice Amerault’s wrists while he was still alive and to cut off and bury his head after he died.

The Associated Press is not naming the couple because doing so could identify the woman, who says she suffered extreme abuse. Both pleaded not guilty in separate court hearings Friday afternoon and were ordered held without bail pending trial.

Appearing by video feed from the jail, dark bruises surrounded both of the women’s eyes, and her lawyer said everything she did was under extreme duress and fear for her life.

“She helped solve this crime. Rather than conceal evidence or falsify evidence, she led the police directly to evidence,” Richard Guerriero said in unsuccessfully arguing for her release with electronic monitoring. “She was beyond cooperative. It’s hard to imagine being beaten like that, threatened with your life, being fearful and then cooperating with the police, but that’s what she did.”

Assistant Attorney General Scott Chase agreed that the woman was cooperative but said that was taken into account in deciding which charges to bring. He argued that her release would endanger the public, and that she had opportunities to get away from her husband and report the crime, including when they were in separate cars driving 200 miles north.

“She was cooperative after she got caught,” he said.

According to a police affidavit, the woman told investigators that her husband went through her cellphone on Saturday and discovered the affair. She said he repeatedly assaulted her, put a gun in her mouth and choked her until she passed out.

Late that night, the husband used his wife’s phone to lure Amerault to a park in Rindge, police said, where he violently assaulted him and tried to force his wife to shoot him. When she refused, he forced Amerault into the back of the victim’s car and shot him three times while his wife was driving, according to the affidavit.

The wife said she was then forced to drive Amerault’s car, containing his body, to the campsite, while her husband drove another vehicle.

“He communicated to her that once the sun came up the next morning he would forgive her,” police wrote.

At the campsite, the woman said her husband ordered her to cut off Amerault’s head so his body could not be identified by dental records, bury it and wrap the rest of the body in a tarp. He later left her there to dispose of the body and returned home, according to the documents.

On Tuesday, two Fish and Game conservation officers who found the campsite noticed a large brown tarp that later was revealed to be covering Amerault’s car. They later noticed another object wrapped in a tarp in a shallow brook; that turned out to be Amerault’s body.

“I’m in big trouble,” the woman told the officers, according to the police affidavit.

Chase, the prosecutor, said the brutality of the crime combined with destruction of evidence in a capital murder was especially alarming.

“Had this defendant successfully destroyed that evidence, her husband, the alleged murderer, may very well have evaded detection and/or apprehension,” he said.

While the state’s capital murder law covers deaths during kidnappings and six other scenarios, lawmakers eliminated the death penalty last year. Those convicted under the statute are sentenced to life in prison without parole.

There was no dispute over bail at the husband’s brief hearing. Neither spoke other than to confirm they could hear the attorneys and judge.",JustBadNews,0
"Coronavirus: Two million deaths 'very likely' even with vaccine, WHO warns",http://bbc.com/news/world-54303628,"Coronavirus: Two million deaths 'very likely' even with vaccine, WHO warns Published duration 25 September Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic

image copyright Reuters image caption Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies team, issued the stark warning at a media briefing

The global coronavirus death toll could hit two million before an effective vaccine is widely used, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.

Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's emergencies head, said the figure could be higher without concerted international action.

Almost one million people have died with Covid-19 worldwide since the disease first emerged in China late last year.

Virus infections continue to rise, with 32 million cases confirmed globally.

The start of a second surge of coronavirus infections has been seen in many countries in the northern hemisphere as winter approaches.

So far, the US, India and Brazil have confirmed the most cases, recording more than 15 million between them.

But in recent days, there has been a resurgence of infections across Europe, prompting warnings of national lockdowns similar to those imposed at the height of the first wave of the pandemic.

""Overall within that very large region, we are seeing worrying increases of the disease,"" Dr Ryan said of the marked spike in cases in Europe.

He urged Europeans to ask themselves whether they had done enough to avoid the need for lockdowns - and whether alternatives, such as testing and tracing, quarantines and social distancing, had been implemented.

""Lockdowns are almost a last resort - and to think that we're back in last-resort territory in September, that's a pretty sobering thought,"" Dr Ryan told reporters at the WHO's headquarters in Geneva.

What did he say about the death toll?

Asked whether two million fatalities worldwide was possible before a vaccine became available, Dr Ryan said: ""It's not impossible.""

He added that fatality rates were dropping as treatments for the disease improve.

But better treatments and even effective vaccines might not be enough on their own to prevent deaths surpassing two million, he said.

""Are we prepared to do what it takes to avoid that number?"" Dr Ryan asked, calling on governments to do everything to control Covid-19.

""Unless we do it all, the number you speak about is not only imaginable, but unfortunately and sadly, very likely.""

What are the latest developments globally?

Around the world, stricter social-distancing guidelines and restrictions on businesses are being brought into effect to curb a second spike.

In Spain, the government has recommended reimposing a partial lockdown on all of Madrid area, where cases have risen sharply. Instead, local authorities stepped up restrictions on some districts of the city, affecting a million people.

Meanwhile in France, staff from bars and restaurants in the southern city Marseille protested against the closure of their workplaces on Saturday.

On Friday, more restrictions were announced in several regions of the UK, as new daily infections continue to rise.

media caption The pandemic officially started when the WHO declared it in March 2020 but how will it end?

In contrast, curbs on businesses are being lifted in some US states, despite the increasing number of cases nationwide.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious diseases expert, said the first wave of the pandemic had not ended yet in the US, because infections have not decreased sufficiently since the initial outbreak.

""Rather than say, 'a second wave,' why don't we say, 'are we prepared for the challenge of the fall and the winter?',"" Dr Fauci told CNN.",JustBadNews,0
New allegations of mass hysterectomies inside US detention centres are the 'echoes of an awful past',http://sbs.com.au/news/new-allegations-of-mass-hysterectomies-inside-us-detention-centres-are-the-echoes-of-an-awful-past?cid=newsapp:socialshare:copylink,"When US lawyer Regina Jeffries heard recent allegations of immigrants in US detention centre being subject to ""jarring medical neglect"", she wished she could say she was surprised.

On 14 September, several legal advocacy groups filed a whistleblower complaint on behalf of a nurse who worked at the privately-run Irwin Country Detention Centre in Georgia.

The nurse, Dawn Wooten, alleged a variety of health and safety violations at the facility during the COVID-19 pandemic, including refusing to test detainees with symptoms of the virus, fabricating medical records and performing hysterectomies on immigrant women without informed consent.

Politicians are calling for an investigation, while a US immigration spokesperson has stressed the need for ""appropriate scepticism"" of ""anonymous, unproven"" allegations.

READ MORE Whistleblower nurse alleges mass hysterectomies at US immigration detention centre

Ms Jeffries spent 10 years working in asylum and immigration law in the US before moving to Australia to undertake a PhD three years ago. She says she has had clients who have been ""caught up in that system"".

""Unfortunately, these allegations were not surprising. I think it's a continuation of a system in the US that was already broken,"" Ms Jeffries told SBS News.

""There is a long history of poor medical services and a lack of appropriate medical care in detention facilities, along with a lack of transparency and accountability for those failures.""

Dr Prudence Flowers, an Australian historian and senior lecturer at Flinders University, agrees the recent allegations are part of a long history of forced sterilisation and reproductive injustice in the US.

""This seems to be a horrible repetition of American behaviour,"" Dr Flowers told SBS News.

""It calls to mind so many incidences, particularly in the 20th century, around the forced sterilisation of people who were seen as 'undesirable'.""

In the complaint, Ms Wooten alleges a high rate of hysterectomies - a procedure which removes part or all of the uterus - were being performed on immigrant women under the custody of US authorities at the centre.

“I’m a single mother of 5. (Irwin County Detention Center) was my means of employment. But Because I began to ask questions about why we were doing no #COVID19 testing, I was demoted.” Nurse Dawn Wooten, who bravely shared her experience at ICDC. #ShutDownIrwin #AbolishICE pic.twitter.com/OZxPoqrSU1 — Project South (@ProjectSouth) September 15, 2020

She said one doctor appeared to perform the surgeries on women who complained of heavy menstrual cycles, but many of them did not appear to understand why they had undergone the procedure.

According to the complaint, nurses obtained consent from the women ""by simply Googling Spanish"".

""I've had several inmates tell me that they've been to see the doctor and they've had hysterectomies and they don't know why they went,"" Ms Wooten said.

“Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy – just about everybody. That’s his specialty, he’s the uterus collector. Everybody’s uterus cannot be that bad.”

Azadeh Shahshahani, director of Project South - one of the human rights groups that filed the complaint - said on 17 September the group had documented conditions at Irwin for many years.

""The treatment of immigrants at this prison has always been horrid,"" Ms Shahshahani said.

""These new shocking revelations further highlight the extent of the egregious abuses at the facility.""

Ms Jeffries said it wasn't ""entirely surprising"" to hear the allegations come out of the Irwin facility.

She said they should be considered within the current lens of ""a very clear move by the Trump administration to crack down on certain types of immigration"".

""It's really disturbing that women are potentially being subject to medical procedures they haven't properly consented to.

""You have to view it in that context, and I think that’s part of the reason why it’s so disturbing to hear these allegations, which have echoes of a really awful past in the US.""

A long and troubling history

It is estimated more than 60,000 people were sterilised in the US during the 20th century, after the country became the first to pass ""eugenic laws"".

The term, coined by Sir Francis Galton in 1883, applied emerging theories of biology and genetics to human breeding.

""In the early 20th century, a lot of eugenics thinking was about encouraging reproduction among the 'fit', which was people who were seen as having 'desirable' qualities, and then often forcibly discouraging it among those seen as 'unfit' or had 'undesirable' characteristics,"" Dr Flowers explained.

""You could be sterilised for reasons of mental attributes, but of course in practice, a lot of the people who end up being targeted are minorities, either in terms of class and/or race.""

In 1907, Indiana passed the first sterilisation law that was upheld by a Supreme Court decision, known as Buck v. Bell, in 1927.

""After that decision, 32 states had passed eugenic laws allowing for the forcible sterilisation of people the state saw as not being appropriate to reproduce,"" Dr Flowers said.

Women and people of colour became the targets

Experts say this practice went on as being part of US law for quite some time, with states approaching the practice in different ways.

At least 20,000 people were forcibly sterilised in California, many of who were described as ""inmates"" in prisons, mental hospitals or asylums. The Third Reich's 1933 Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases was later modelled on California's laws, and those out of Indiana.

""Certainly the fact the US was a model for Nazi Germany is one of those things that historians point out, and people are shocked by. It's not part of how the public wants to understand the States,"" Dr Flowers said.

Over time, women and people of colour were disproportionately targeted.

Dr Flowers said in the southern state of North Carolina, where African Americans made up 25 per cent of the population, they accounted for 65 per cent of the almost 8,000 people who were sterilised. Many of them were women or minors.

""A lot of what was happening - particularly in the south - was young Black women were not told they were receiving a sterilisation. It was referred to after the fact as a 'Mississippi appendectomy' where you would go in for an appendectomy or some other kind of surgery and you would have your uterus removed,"" she said.

""It's incredibly intrusive. People were often not told they had been sterilised.""

Meanwhile, Dr Flowers said other 'layers' of forced sterilisation were taking place on US territory, such as in Puerto Rico, where up to one third of all women were sterilised in the 1960s.

""Again, these women weren't told the procedure was irreversible,"" she said.

""The issue of meaningful consent I think has real parallels with what is potentially happening in the US right now.""

Where are we now?

The Supreme Court decision of 1927 has never been officially overturned.

In 1978, however, a victim of forced sterilisation sued the state of Oklahoma and won, creating legal obstacles that essentially put a stop to mass forced sterilisation.

Ms Jeffries says the practice has continued.

""There is this issue of people continuing to undergo these types of sterilisation procedures outside of that formal ban who may have been coerced,"" she said.

With much of the US immigration detention centre system being privatised, Ms Jeffries said poor oversight and transparency among facilities is part of the problem.

""All facilities have differing standards in terms of what medical care is provided, so it's actually quite difficult to tell from one facility to another what practices actually happen - not to mention the failures of the complaint mechanism that detainees have to raise issues they're experiencing,"" she said.

What now?

Over the last week, Democratic politicians have exposed the country's history of forced sterilisation as they called for an investigation into the whistleblower's allegations.

""If true, the appalling conditions described in the whistleblower complaint - including allegations of mass hysterectomies being performed on vulnerable migrant women - are a staggering abuse of human rights,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on 15 September.

""This profoundly disturbing situation recalls some of the darkest moments of our nation's history... The DHS Inspector General must immediately investigate the allegations detailed in this complaint.""

In a statement to the Associated Press on Friday, ICE Acting Director Tony Pham said, “If there is any truth to these allegations, it is my commitment to make the corrections necessary to ensure we continue to prioritise the health, welfare and safety of ICE detainees"".

ICE officials had earlier declined to comment in detail on the broader allegations in the complaint, but casted doubt on its use of anonymous testimony from detainees.

“In general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate scepticism they deserve,” the agency said in a statement to The Washington Post.

LaSalle Corrections, which operates the jail, said in a statement that it “strongly refutes these allegations and any implications of misconduct"".

Ms Jeffries agreed the recent allegations need to be investigated.

""There is obviously a problem with the way medical care is - or is not - delivered in immigration detention,"" she said.

""It is absolutely critical that people who are detained civilly are able to give informed consent in those circumstances - and for people not to have given informed consent should concern everyone.""",JustBadNews,0

Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll says the force is ""in no way racist"" Police Minister Mark Ryan says the Government has invested a record amount into police resources

Several hundred protesters marched in Brisbane's streets to Queensland's Police Headquarters on Friday night, demanding an end to Indigenous deaths in custody.

The protest was organised in response to the death of 49-year-old Aunty Sherry Tilberoo, an Indigenous woman who was found unresponsive in a cell at the Brisbane watch house last week.

She had been held in the watch house for several days on drug and theft charges and was awaiting transfer to a correctional centre.

Friday's vigil was held outside Queensland police headquarters where protesters lit candles to remember the 49-year-old woman.

Some protesters blamed deaths in custody on police negligence and ""systemic"" racism.

Aunty Sherry's death sparked a wave of anti-police sentiment, with protests sparked the week before resulting in police being accused of ""aggressive"" behaviour as they made multiple arrests.

'We are in no way racist'

While the woman's death remains under investigation by the Ethical Standards Command, police said autopsy results indicated the woman had died of natural causes.

Speaking from the Brisbane suburb of Morningside, Commissioner Katarina Carroll said she was upset to hear some protesters labelling the force as ""racist"".

""I am really upset about that,"" Commissioner Carroll told the media.

""We've done the right thing here all along.

""We've been extraordinarily open and transparent about this investigation, like we should be and always are.

""Sadly, she did pass away — sadly, it was of natural causes, but we are in no way racist.

""That does concern me.""

There have been calls for police to release CCTV footage from the night Aunty Sherry died, but Commissioner Carroll said that had been referred to the coroner.

The Commissioner acknowledged reports of protestors describing the police service as racist.

""I think there is a select few that might say that, but in some ways ... it's not the right thing to always say that when we are trying to work very hard together,"" she said.

""So, please, let's settle ... let's make sure that the corner gets to do the hearing or the investigation and we'll go from there.""

She said, overall, Queensland police have a good relationship with the majority of the community.

It comes as Queensland's Police Minister Mark Ryan said the Government had invested a record amount of money into the police force across the state.

""Over the last five years our Government's been rebuilding the police service,"" he said.

""We've been putting on more staff — over 600 new staff — and we've given police a record budget, it's up 20 per cent.""",JustBadNews,0

Immigrants in a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in Georgia are being subjected to horrific conditions and treatment, including “jarring medical neglect” and a high rate of hysterectomies among women, according to a whistleblower complaint filed by several legal advocacy groups on behalf of a nurse who works there.

The nurse, Dawn Wooten, has been practicing for more than 10 years, three of which she was employed at Irwin county detention center in Georgia, which is run by private corporation LaSalle Corrections. The complaint, filed on her behalf on 14 September by the human rights legal groups the Government Accountability Project and Project South, accused the center of negligence, including poor safety precautions surrounding Covid-19 and generally hazardous and unsanitary conditions.

Immigrants who spoke out against these conditions were regularly pushed into solitary confinement, the complaint said. Wooten says she was demoted and reprimanded when she spoke out about these practices, according to an interview with the Intercept.

The Intercept also reported that Wooten’s account was “bolstered by interviews with another current member of Irwin’s medical staff – who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation – and four people currently or recently detained there”.

According to the new complaint, Wooten reported an alarmingly high rate of hysterectomies – a surgery in which part or all of the uterus is removed – being performed on Spanish-speaking immigrants, many of whom did not appear to understand why they had undergone the procedure.

She said an off-site doctor supposedly performed the surgeries on women who complained of heavy menstrual cycles, but that many women seemed to not understand what had happened. In many cases nurses obtained consent from patients by “simply Googling Spanish”, the complaint alleges.

“Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy – just about everybody,” Wooten said. “That’s his specialty, he’s the uterus collector. Everybody’s uterus cannot be that bad.”

The complaint also alleges health and safety violations related to the procedures. One woman said she was not properly anesthetized during a procedure and overheard the doctor say he had mistakenly removed the wrong ovary, rendering her unable to have children. Another went in to have a cyst drained and ultimately got a hysterectomy instead, the complaint said.

“When I met all these women who had had surgeries, I thought this was like an experimental concentration camp. It was like they’re experimenting with our bodies,” one detainee said, according to the complaint.

Project South, one of the human rights groups that filed the complaint, had previously filed a report in 2017 regarding Irwin’s poor treatment of detainees, including unsanitary conditions, inedible food and refusing medical care to detainees. “This place is not equipped for humans,” one detained immigrant at Irwin told Project South at the time.

Conditions have “only worsened” in the face of Covid-19 threats, the complaint says. The facility has refused to test detained immigrants for Covid-19 in a timely manner, concealed numbers of positive tests and mixed those who have been exposed to Covid-19 with those who have not, according to the complaint.

“There is no social distancing possible in a detention center,” said Azadeh Shahshahani, a human rights attorney at Project South. “We are calling for people to be freed immediately, and we have been calling for this facility to be shut down for a long time.”

Shahshahani said the groups also plan to file these documents to Congress as well as to the United Nations. The United Nations defines “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group” as an act of genocide, a crime under international law.

“These are gross human rights violations, and the US government should be held accountable,” she said. She added that Irwin detention center was not unique: Project South filed similar complaints against the Stewart detention center, another location in Georgia where detainees have alleged abuse.

An Ice spokeswoman, Lindsay Williams, said on Tuesday that the agency did not comment on matters that have been presented to the Office of the Inspector General, which is responsible for investigating such allegations. She added that “anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve”.

LaSalle Corrections did not respond to request for comment. When reached by phone, an employee at the Irwin county detention center declined to comment or answer how many immigrants are currently housed there, but according to the company’s website the location houses up to 1,201 people.

Following the report, Bob Trammell, a Georgia state representative, called for suspending the licenses of the providers named in the complaint pending a full investigation by the state’s composite medical board and board of nursing.",JustBadNews,0

Netflix Faces Boycott After 'Cuties' Scene Goes Viral,http://mediaite.com/entertainment/cancelnetflix-streaming-service-faces-new-calls-for-boycott-after-cuties-scene-sexualizing-children-goes-viral/,"On Thursday, #CancelNetflix trended on Twitter amid a new wave of calls to boycott the streaming service after a scene from the movie Cuties went viral.

The movie, about a group of eleven-year-old girls who form a twerking dance group, previously sparked controversy due to the sexualized poster used by Netflix to promote the movie.

Now, following its Netflix release, a scene from Cuties showing the girls dancing in a sexualized manner for an audience of adults has led to new calls for a boycott.

Warning: The following clip may be distressing.

Following the previous controversy over the poster, Netflix had apologized in August, declaring, “We’re deeply sorry for the inappropriate artwork that we used for Cuties… It was not OK nor was it representative of this French film which premiered at Sundance. We’ve now updated the pictures and description.”

In a new statement to Mediaite, a spokesperson for the streaming service said Cuties “is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children.”

“It’s an award winning film and a powerful story about the pressure young girls face on social media and from society more generally growing up – and we’d encourage anyone who cares about these important issues to watch the movie,” they added.

He reached Panipat, a town in Haryana on the Delhi outskirts. Unable to find an accommodation, he entered a public park in Kishanpura area to relax for some time. Minutes later, two men came and asked his name. When Akhlaq told them that he was a Muslims, they thrashed him, and fled.

A couple of hours later, Akhlaq felt thirsty and roamed around in search of water. He reached at the doorstep of a house and asked for water. “As soon as he extended his hand, the inmates pulled him in, and locked the door. Then they beat him ruthlessly,” his 38-year-old brother Ikram, also a hairdresser, said.

“The attackers were three men and two women. They used sticks, clubs and a brick to bash up Akhlaq. His whole body is full of bruises even now. They used a chainsaw to cut his right arm which had an indelible mark of ‘786’ on the upper side of the hand.”

Many Muslims in India use ‘786’ as a mark of good omen which is associated with Muslim identity in films and popular culture.

The attackers dragged the injured hairdresser to a nearby railway track and left him there.

At around 5 am, Akhlaq regained consciousness and asked a passer-by for help; he made a call to the family in his hometown. They then informed the police in Panipat. At 7 am, a policeman reached the spot and then, after nearly one hour, he was taken to a hospital in Panipat.

After first aid, the hospital referred him to B D Sharma Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak for better treatment where he remained admitted for three days. “His condition was serious,” Ikram says. The discharge card from Rohtak hospital reads, “Traumatic amputation below elbow.”

The family says the police are treating it as a case of a rail accident. “It is a case of hate crime,” says Ikram who gave the police the photos of the accused and showed the police the house where his brother was attacked. He says the people who cut his hand were the same who attacked him in the park. “They attacked with a plan.”

Ikram has visited Kishanpura multiple times since then. “The locals who are strangers to me helped me and gave me information about the incident.”

“Initially the police were telling us that this is a case of a rail accident and are trying to close the case,” Ikram says, adding, “Police tried to mislead us.”

He said the police behaviour was unruly. “The police men at Chandni Bagh misbehaved with me.”

But about two weeks later, the General Railway Police Station, Panipat filed the First Information Report under Zero FIR. A copy of FIR dated 07, September, 2020 invokes Sections 323, 326, 34 on the basis of Akhlaq’s complaint. But the family demands that the police should file the case for attempt to murder.

Akhlaq’s severed hand is missing. The police have told the family that they were unable to find it near the railway track. “The police are not even trying to find the missing arm.”

Ikram said the police are asking the family to go for a compromise. “Sub-inspector of the police station asked me to not raise hue and cry,” he said, “they (the accused) had come to the police station and they wanted to negotiate a compromise. It would be better for you to compromise.”

Ikram asserted: “We do not want any compromise. We want justice, only justice.”

He says he has spent all his money on his trips to Panipat to find the attackers. “He was attacked because he is a Muslim,” Ikram says, “They severed his hand because of the 786 mark.”",JustBadNews,0
NGO 'extremely angry' after Hong Kong Justice Dept. drops case against men accused of throwing 30 animals from building,http://hongkongfp.com/2020/09/04/ngo-extremely-angry-after-hong-kong-justice-dept-drops-case-against-men-accused-of-throwing-30-animals-from-building/,"The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said on Wednesday that it was “extremely angry and disappointed” at the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) decision to not prosecute two men accused of throwing 30 animals from a building earlier this year.

According to the SPCA on Facebook, 15 animals – including cats, rabbits and parrots – were found dead around a housing estate in Sham Tseng on February 14. Their inspectors later discovered 15 injured animals in the area, while three succumbed to serious injuries at the SPCA clinic, it added.

The animal welfare group said it had submitted multiple veterinary reports to police which indicated that the cause of death and injury could be due to falling from a height. The NGO also filed reports on the physical and psychological status of the animals that survived the suspected abuse.

But after a six-month investigation, police on Wednesday said the justice department would not bring the two alleged perpetrators – aged 36 and 48 – to trial owing to insufficient evidence to demonstrate a reasonable prospect of conviction.

“We have always hoped that this case and other relevant facts can be presented to the court, and let the judge review them and make a verdict,” the SPCA wrote. “But no matter how hard we tried, we still couldn’t seek justice for the animals that died or got injured innocently. We feel extremely angry, find it regrettable and we are disappointed!”

The SPCA said only a fraction of suspected animal abuse cases it encountered were brought to court. It questioned whether the city’s existing laws for preventing animal abuse and the prosecution procedure should be reviewed. It also said more animals may need a microchip to hold owners accountable for their pets.

Pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo, on the other hand, wrote an open letter to Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng, demanding an explanation for why the case was dropped: “This move is no different than sending society a message that the government looks down on animal lives and easily allows animal abusers walk free.”",JustBadNews,0
"China is forcing all schools in Inner Mongolia to stop teaching in Mongolian and teach in Chinese, which is being considered cultural suicide.",http://mb.ntd.com/massive-protests-break-out-in-inner-mongolia_501974.html,"Massive protests broke out in the Chinese autonomous region of inner Mongolia over the weekend. It was against a move by Beijing that some consider to be a new round of “cultural genocide.”

Local Mongolians in Inner Mongolia never call themselves Chinese, but Mongolian.

They’ve remained steadfast in their resistance against Beijing’s Communist regime for decades and their fight reached a peak over the weekend.

People there call their land Southern Mongolia. The protests began, after a secret order from Beijing was leaked. It dictated that in all schools, teaching in the Mongolian language would be replaced with using the Chinese language, starting from this September.

The US-Based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center called this a new round of “cultural genocide.”",JustBadNews,0
"Face shields and masks with exhalation valves are not effective at preventing COVID-19 transmission, finds a new droplet dispersal study. (Physics of Fluids journal, 1 September 2020)",http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0022968,"Several places across the world are experiencing a steep surge in COVID-19 infections. Face masks have become increasingly accepted as one of the most effective means for combating the spread of the disease when used in combination with social-distancing and frequent hand-washing. However, there is an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with clear plastic face shields and with masks equipped with exhalation valves. One of the factors driving this increased adoption is improved comfort compared to regular masks. However, there is a possibility that widespread public use of these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation efforts. To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these alternative options, we use qualitative visualizations to examine the performance of face shields and exhalation valves in impeding the spread of aerosol-sized droplets. The visualizations indicate that although face shields block the initial forward motion of the jet, the expelled droplets can move around the visor with relative ease and spread out over a large area depending on light ambient disturbances. Visualizations for a mask equipped with an exhalation port indicate that a large number of droplets pass through the exhale valve unfiltered, which significantly reduces its effectiveness as a means of source control. Our observations suggest that to minimize the community spread of COVID-19, it may be preferable to use high quality cloth or surgical masks that are of a plain design, instead of face shields and masks equipped with exhale valves.

Several places across the world, including the United States, Brazil, and India, are experiencing a steep surge in infections. Healthcare systems in the most severely affected locations have been stretched to capacity, which also tends to impact urgent care for cases unrelated to COVID-19.Researchers have reported steady progress in the development of potential treatments and vaccines; however, it is estimated that widespread inoculation will not be available until sometime in the year 2021. It appears that the likelihood of vulnerable individuals struggling with severe health issues and the debilitating socio-economic ramifications of the pandemic will continue in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, widespread uncertainty regarding the re-opening of schools and universities for in-person instruction has created additional cause for concern, since these institutions have the potential to become focal points for unchecked community spread of the disease. In light of the acute circumstances, it has become crucial to establish clear and specific guidelines that can help mitigate the disease’s spread, especially given the high prevalence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread.A number of recent studies have contributed to this effort by significantly improving our understanding of various physical mechanisms involved in the disease’s transmission.

Several private businesses have also adopted requirements for customers to use face coverings. Importantly, certain cloth-based masks have been shown to be effective in blocking the forward spread of aerosolized droplets supplementary material , Movie 1). Although they are somewhat less capable than well-fitted medical grade masks, homemade masks constructed using certain materials can filter out a large proportion of respiratory droplets and particles.Moreover, cloth masks have the advantage of being readily available to the wider public in addition to being cost-effective, comfortable, and reusable when washed and disinfected properly. Additionally, they do not divert away from the supply of medical grade masks for healthcare workers.

While broad acceptance regarding the need for face coverings has risen steadily, there is an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with clear plastic face shields, and with masks equipped with exhalation valves (). Face shields tend to have noticeable gaps along the bottom and the sides, and are used in the medical community primarily for protecting the wearer against incoming sprays and splashes while in close proximity to patients.Moreover, they tend to be used in conjunction with respirators, surgical masks, or other protective equipment. Masks with exhalation ports include a one-way valve, which restricts airflow when breathing in, but allows free outflow of air. The inhaled air gets filtered through the mask material; however, the exhaled breath passes through the valve unfiltered. There has been limited research on how effective face shields and masks with exhalation valves are as a means of source control.

Face shields also offer these benefits, in addition to protecting the eyes from splashes and sprays of infected droplets.Shields have also been credited with other advantages such as ease of cleaning and disinfecting, long-term reusability (which is also true for well-constructed cloth masks), and allowing visual communication of facial expressions for people who may be hearing-impaired.

The authors’ opinion is based on the premise that ejecta from the mouth and nose hit the visor, and their forward motion is arrested completely. While this is true for relatively large respiratory droplets, the effect on the smaller aerosol-sized droplets (diameter less than approximately 5m–10m) is markedly different, since they act as tracers and have a higher tendency to follow airflow patterns more faithfully. We note that one of the primary studies cited by Perencevichexpressly indicates that face shields did not serve as primary respiratory protection for the wearer in experimental tests, since suspended aerosols could flow around the visor and enter the respiratory tract.Over an exposure duration of 1 min–30 min, the shield was only 23% effective in reducing inhalation of droplets that were 3.4m on average. Although this study by Lindsleydid not consider face shields as source control methods, they are likely to suffer the same disadvantage in this role, since smaller outgoing droplets will flow around the bottom and the sides of the visor. While the opinion article by Perencevichis based on the presumption that transmission of COVID-19 occurs primarily through larger respiratory droplets, recent studies support the possibility of airborne transmission via aerosol-sized droplets.

Current CDC guidelines discourage the use of face shields as a sole means of source control,and mention that masks equipped with exhalation valves should not be used when a sterile environment is required.At the same time, there are broad variations in recommendations made by states and counties across the US, with some allowing the use of face shields as alternatives to masks,whereas many others do not address the issue at all. There is a possibility that widespread public adoption of these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation efforts. To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these alternative options, we use qualitative visualizations to examine the performance of face shields and exhale valves in impeding droplet spread.

The settling velocity for spheres in Stokes flow (i.e., at very low Reynolds numbers) is given as follows: v = ( ρ p − ρ f ) g d 2 18 μ , (1) where ρ p is the density of the spherical particle, ρ f is the density of the ambient fluid (air), μ is the dynamic viscosity, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and d is the diameter of the sphere. Using the density of water as an approximation for ρ p , and d = 1e − 5m, we get a settling speed of 0.003 m/s. Thus, a droplet of diameter 10 µm would fall a distance of 0.45 m in 150 s, i.e., in 2.5 min. From our observations in a minimally disturbed environment, the droplets did not display significant downward gravity-driven settling within this time-frame. The droplets eventually disappeared from view, either because they moved laterally off the laser sheet, or because they experienced further evaporation.

Fluids, 061708 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0016018 The visualization setup used here is similar to the arrangement used in a prior study,which examined the effectiveness of various facemasks in stopping the spread of respiratory jets. The setup consists of a hollow manikin head, where a cough/sneeze is emulated via a pressure impulse applied using a manual pump. The air capacity of the pump is 500 ml, which is comparable to the lower end of the total volume expelled during a cough.Tracers composed of droplets of distilled water and glycerin are expelled through the mouth opening, and are visualized using laser sheets to observe the spatial and temporal development of the ejected flow. Up to two laser sheets are used in the visualizations presented here, to provide a better indication of the volumetric spread of the expelled jet. The tracer droplets’ diameter was estimated to be less than 10m based on Stokes’ law, and the observation that they could remain suspended in a quiescent environment for between 2 min and 3 min without significant settling. The settling velocity for spheres in Stokes flow (i.e., at very low Reynolds numbers) is given as follows:whereis the density of the spherical particle,is the density of the ambient fluid (air),is the dynamic viscosity,is the acceleration due to gravity, andis the diameter of the sphere. Using the density of water as an approximation for, and= 1− 5, we get a settling speed of 0.003 m/s. Thus, a droplet of diameter 10m would fall a distance of 0.45 m in 150 s, i.e., in 2.5 min. From our observations in a minimally disturbed environment, the droplets did not display significant downward gravity-driven settling within this time-frame. The droplets eventually disappeared from view, either because they moved laterally off the laser sheet, or because they experienced further evaporation. Additional details regarding the visualization setup may be found in Ref.. We remark that all of the flows described in this work are inherently three-dimensional in nature, but the visualizations only depict plane two-dimensional cross sections. For instance, the uncovered emulated cough shown in the supplementary material , Movie 1, displays three-dimensional behavior, such as the motion of the leading plume, which resembles the formation of a vortex ring. The lateral (sideways) motion of the jets is also evident at times when the visible droplet patches disappear or re-appear in the laser sheet.

Figure 2 Fig. 2(b) Fig. 2(c) Figs. 2(c) 2(d) (Multimedia view) shows the evolution of a cough/sneeze when a face shield is used to impede the expelled jet. As expected, the visor initially deflects the expelled droplets downward [(Multimedia view)]. However, the aerosol-sized droplets do not fall to the ground, but stay suspended beneath the bottom opening of the shield [(Multimedia view)]. These droplets rise upward after a few seconds since they are warmer than the ambient air owing to the vaporized glycerin–water mixture, and also because they might undergo further evaporation once released into the environment. A horizontal laser sheet has been used in addition to a vertical sheet, and the lateral spread of the droplets becomes visible as they cross the horizontal plane inand(Multimedia view). Although the case depicted here shows droplets spreading in the forward direction, slight variations in ambient disturbances were observed to reverse the direction of spread, i.e., toward the manikin’s back. The time evolution of the droplet spread from an additional run with a face shield can be seen in the supplementary material , Movie 2.

Fig. 3 Fig. 3(a) Fig. 3(b) Fig. 3(c) Fig. 3(c) Fig. 3(b) To observe the lateral and longitudinal spread of the suspended droplets over a large area, we examine a far-field view in(Multimedia view). The manikin’s position is shown as an overlay in(Multimedia view), where the ejected droplets are visible in a horizontal and a vertical laser sheet, which help convey the spread of the droplets in the lateral and longitudinal directions. The positioning of the laser planes is depicted in(Multimedia view). After 10 s [(Multimedia view)], the droplets were observed to have spread approximately 3 feet in both the forward and lateral directions. We note that the intensity of the scattered light has decreased noticeably at this point, which is indicative of a decrease in droplet concentration due to spreading over a large volume. Most of the droplets visible in(Multimedia view) are illuminated by the horizontal sheet shown in(Multimedia view), which is aligned with the bottom opening of the face shield. Very few droplets are visible in the vertical laser sheet, since most of them have advected forward of the sheet’s position by this time. We remark that both the longitudinal and lateral spreads depend on a combination of the initial momentum of the cough and advection by very light ambient disturbances. While the specific case discussed here depicts forward spread, we observed that it was equally likely that the droplets could spread in the reverse direction, i.e., behind the manikin. We do not expect diffusion to play a dominant role at the time scales discussed here. Overall, we can surmise that the face shield blocks the initial forward motion of the jet; however, the aerosolized droplets that are expelled can disperse over a wide area over time, albeit with decreasing droplet concentration.

Figure 4 Figs. 4(b) 4(c) Fig. 3 We now consider the effectiveness of masks equipped with exhalation valves in restricting the spread of respiratory droplets.(Multimedia view) shows the spatial and temporal evolution of the jets that emerge from an N95 mask, which has a single exhalation port located at the front. Apart from the design used here, certain cloth-based masks that are available commercially also come equipped with one to two exhale ports, located on either side of the facemask. Inand(Multimedia view), we observe that a small amount of the exhaled droplets escape from the gap between the top of the mask and the bridge of the nose. However, a majority of the exhaled air passes through the exhale port unhindered. The resulting jet is deflected downward in the current case, which reduces the initial forward spread of the droplets. However, the aerosolized droplets will eventually disperse over a large area depending on the ambient disturbances and airflow patterns, as in the case of the face shield [(Multimedia view)].

Fig. 5 Fig. 4(d) Figs. 4 5 We now examine the droplet dispersal pattern when using a regular N95-rated mask in(Multimedia view). Once again, we observe droplets escaping from the gap between the mask and the nose; however, the intensity of light scattered by the escaped droplets is lower than that for the valved N95 mask [(Multimedia view)]. We note that the droplets that escape from the regular mask will also get dispersed by ambient disturbances; however, the extent of exposure will be lower compared to that for either face shields or masks with valves. While the two masks shown inand(Multimedia views) are N95-rated, we expect the observations described here (with regard to valves) to hold true even for cloth/surgical masks that are of a plain functional design vs those equipped with exhale valves.

Figs. 6 7 Fig. 6 Fig. 5 Fig. 7 In order to determine the performance of plain “surgical” masks in comparison to the N95-rated masks, we examine two different commercially available face masks inand(Multimedia views). We note that neither of the two “surgical” masks tested here were recommended for medical use by the manufacturers. Such masks are becoming increasingly available commercially from a wide range of manufacturers, and they are seeing widespread adoption by the general population for regular use. We observe in(Multimedia view) that the first surgical mask tested (brand “A”) is very effective in stopping the forward progression of the jet. As expected, there is some leakage from the gap along the top of the mask; however, it is not excessive, and it is comparable qualitatively to leakage from the regular N95-rated mask shown in(Multimedia view). On the other hand, the second surgical mask (brand “B”), which is shown in(Multimedia view) displays significantly higher leakage of droplets through the mask material, and does not appear to be as effective as the first surgical mask (brand “A”) in the restricting droplet spread. This indicates that even among commercially available masks, which may appear to be similar superficially, there can be significant underlying differences in the quality and type of materials used for manufacturing the masks.

To summarize, we have examined the effectiveness of face shields and masks equipped with exhalation ports in mitigating the spread of exhaled respiratory droplets. The aim of the qualitative visualizations presented here is to help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these alternatives to regular masks. We observe that face shields are able to block the initial forward motion of the exhaled jet; however, aerosolized droplets expelled with the jet are able to move around the visor with relative ease. Over time, these droplets can disperse over a wide area in both the lateral and longitudinal directions, albeit with decreasing droplet concentration. We have also compared droplet dispersal from a regular N95-rated face mask to one equipped with an exhale valve. As expected, the exhalation port significantly reduces the effectiveness of the mask as a means of source control, as a large number of droplets pass through the valve unfiltered. Notably, shields impede the forward motion of the exhaled droplets to some extent, and masks with valves do so to an even lesser extent. However, once released into the environment, the aerosol-sized droplets get dispersed widely depending on light ambient disturbances. Overall, the visuals presented here indicate that face shields and masks with exhale valves may not be as effective as regular face masks in restricting the spread of aerosolized droplets. Thus, despite the increased comfort that these alternatives offer, it may be preferable to use well-constructed plain masks. There is a possibility that widespread public adoption of the alternatives, in lieu of regular masks, could have an adverse effect on ongoing mitigation efforts against COVID-19.",JustBadNews,0

(Bloomberg) — Facebook Inc. plans to block people and publishers in Australia from sharing news, a move that pushes back against a proposed law forcing the company to pay media firms for their articles.

The threat escalates an antitrust battle between Facebook and the Australian government, which wants the social-media giant and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to compensate publishers for the value they provide to their platforms.

The legislation still needs to be approved by Australia’s parliament. Under the proposal, an arbitration panel would decide how much the technology companies must pay publishers if the two sides can’t agree.

Facebook said in a blog posting Monday that the proposal is unfair and would allow publishers to charge any price they want. If the legislation becomes law, the company says it will take the unprecedented step of preventing Australians from sharing news on Facebook and Instagram.",JustBadNews,0
Charlie Hebdo to republish Islamic cartoons that led to the terrorist attack in 2015 as the terrorism trial begins tomorrow,http://ewn.co.za/2020/09/01/charlie-hebdo-to-republish-muhammad-cartoons-for-terror-trial-start,"Twelve people, including some of France's most celebrated cartoonists, were killed on 7 January 2015, when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi went on a gun rampage at the paper's offices.

PARIS - PARIS - French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, the target of a massacre by Islamist gunmen in 2015, said Tuesday it was republishing hugely controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to mark the start of the trial this week of alleged accomplices in the attack.

""We will never lie down. We will never give up,"" its director Laurent ""Riss"" Sourisseau wrote in an editorial to go with the republication of the cartoons in its latest edition.

Twelve people, including some of France's most celebrated cartoonists, were killed on 7 January, 2015, when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi went on a gun rampage at the paper's offices in Paris.

The perpetrators were killed in the wake of the massacre but 14 alleged accomplices in the attacks, which also targeted a Jewish supermarket, will go on trial in Paris on Wednesday.

The cover of the latest Charlie Hebdo issue shows a dozen cartoons first published by the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten in 2005 - and then reprinted by Charlie Hebdo in 2006 - which unleashed a storm of anger across the Muslim world.

In the centre of the cover is a cartoon of the prophet drawn by its cartoonist Jean Cabut, known as Cabu, who lost his life in the massacre.

""All of this, just for that,"" the front-page headline says.

Its editorial team wrote that now was the right time to republish the cartoons, saying it was ""essential"" as the trial opens.

""We have often been asked since January 2015 to print other caricatures of Muhammad,"" it said.

""We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited - the law allows us to do so - but because there was a need for a good reason to do it, a reason which has meaning and which brings something to the debate.""

The paper's willingness to cause offence has made it a champion of free speech for many in France, while others believed it crossed a line too often.

But the massacre united the country in grief with the slogan #JeSuisCharlie (I Am Charlie) going viral.

"Painting Deemed Fake, Consigned to Storage May Be Genuine Rembrandt",http://smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/fake-painting-rembrandt-workshop-180975691/,"Since the 1980s, a postcard-sized painting has sat out of sight in the storeroom of the University of Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum. Titled Head of a Bearded Man, the portrait was donated to the museum in 1951 and displayed as an original work by revered Dutch master Rembrandt. But after a group of investigators deemed the painting inauthentic in 1981, curators decided to move it into storage.

“[N]o one wanted to talk about [it] because it was this fake Rembrandt,” curator An Van Camp tells the Guardian’s Mark Brown.

Now, Bearded Man is set to return to public view under decidedly more auspicious circumstances: As the museum announced in a statement, new research has all but confirmed that the painting was created in Rembrandt’s workshop—and perhaps even by the Old Master himself. (Bearded Man will go on display later this week as part of the museum’s “Young Rembrandt” exhibition, which surveys the artist’s first decade of work.)

Van Camp says she had long suspected that the painting might be authentic. When the Ashmolean began to prepare for “Young Rembrandt,” curators and conservators brought Bearded Man to Peter Klein, a dendrochronologist who specializes in dating wooden objects by examining the growth rings of trees.

Klein found that the wood panel on which the work is painted came from an oak tree felled in the Baltic region between 1618 and 1628. According to Martin Bailey of the Art Newspaper, that same exact wood was used in two other works: Rembrandt’s Andromeda Chained to the Rocks (circa 1630) and Rembrandt collaborator Jan Lievens’ Portrait of Rembrandt’s Mother (circa 1630).

“Allowing a minimum of two years for the seasoning of the wood, we can firmly date the portrait to 1620-30,” says Klein in the statement.

Taken together, the evidence constitutes a compelling argument for Bearded Man’s attribution to Rembrandt’s studio. But researchers will need to conduct further study to assess whether the artist personally crafted the work.

As Brigit Katz explained for Smithsonian magazine earlier this year, Rembrandt—like many artists at the time—filled his studio with pupils who studied and copied his distinctive style. Many went on to become successful artists in their own right.

Rembrandt’s wide-ranging influence makes discerning his “true” works a thorny historical task. Since it was founded in the late 1960s, the Rembrandt Research Project has attempted to determine the authenticity of many would-be Rembrandts, offering up designations with multi-million dollar consequences for collectors.

In February, the Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania announced its identification of Portrait of a Young Woman as a genuine Rembrandt. The Rembrandt Research Project had rejected the 1632 painting as an original in 1979, calling the work’s authorship into question and downgrading its status to a painting by the artist’s studio. A team of conservators used a variety of high-tech methods to determine that the work was indeed an original.

Art dealer Percy Moore Turner bequeathed Bearded Man to the Ashmolean in 1951. A small auction label dated to 1777 and attached to its back identified the work as a Rembrandt painting, but in 1981, the Rembrandt Research Project determined that the work was completed by an artist “outside Rembrandt’s circle” at some point in the 17th century.

Bearded Man depicts an elderly, balding man gazing downward in “melancholy contemplation,” according to Klein.

“Despite overpainting and layers of discolored varnish, expressive brushstrokes show through and convey the troubled face,” says the dendrochronologist. “Head studies such as this are typical of Rembrandt’s work in Leiden and were eagerly collected by contemporaries.”

As Ashmolean conservator Jevon Thistlewood notes in the statement, small parts of the canvas were painted over by an “unknown hand.” These additions “have considerably disrupted the subtle illusion of depth and movement.”

After “Young Rembrandt” closes in November, the team plans to conduct a thorough cleaning and restoration of the work.

Thistlewood adds, “[W]e can’t wait to see what we find.”",JustBadNews,0

Romina Ashrafi was decapitated at her family home in the county of Talesh, Gilan, on May 21 earlier this year.

Her death sparked widespread outrage with media condemning the 'institutionalised violence' in the Islamic republic.

Her father, who remains unnamed, has today been jailed for nine years despite Romina's mother, Rana Dashti, demanding the death penalty.

'Despite the judicial authorities' insistence on a ""special handling"" of the case, the verdict has terrified me and my family,' Dashti told ILNA.

'I don't want my husband to return to our village ever again,' she said, calling for the verdict to be reviewed and changed to 'execution'.

Dashti, who lived with the man for 15 years, added that she now fears for the life of the rest of her family.

According to ILNA, Iran's penal code does not lay down the death penalty for a father in cases of filicide and the court can only sentence the accused to fines and jail time.

Critics slam leaked police memo about Breonna Taylor: 'Deeply reckless',http://nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/deeply-reckless-critics-slam-leaked-police-memo-about-breonna-taylor-n1238777,"A leaked Louisville Metro Police Department memo shows investigators had more evidence than previously made public showing a connection between Breonna Taylor and the main target of the narcotics probe that led officers to barge into her home the night she was shot dead by police.

But the memo was written several weeks after Taylor’s death and includes details that weren't provided to the judge in the search warrant application as well as evidence that came to light after her death —prompting critics to slam it as an effort to smear Taylor and justify the deadly police raid.

The leaked memo, obtained by NBC News, addresses why the officers sought a warrant to enter Taylor’s apartment but says nothing about the use of force or other possible violations of Louisville police department policy, such as the blind firing of bullets into neighboring apartments.

“Breonna Taylor’s death was a tragedy. Period,” said Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who called the leak an effort to “sway opinion and impact the investigation.”

""It is deeply reckless for this information, which presents only a small fraction of the entire investigation, to be shared with the media while the criminal process remains ongoing,” Fischer added.

Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was killed after midnight on March 13 when officers broke down her door while executing a search warrant.

Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a shot at the front door, striking one officer. He said he believed it was a home invasion. Police opened fire, hitting Taylor five times.

Both the FBI and the Kentucky attorney general are investigating the shooting.

Taylor, who had no criminal record, knew the target of the narcotics probe, Jamarcus Glover, as far back as 2016 when she was in her early 20s, according to the leaked police memo written by a detective.

The 39-page memo contains new information including that Taylor posted Glover’s bond after he was arrested in 2017. When he was arrested again in January 2020, the memo shows, he called Taylor at least three times from jail. In one call, Taylor told Glover that it’s stressful for her when he’s around because of his interactions with the police.

When Glover's car was towed in mid-February, he filed a complaint against a police officer and used Taylor's phone number as his point of contact, according to the memo.

Taylor was killed one month later.

The undated memo, first reported by the Louisville Courier-Journal, includes information from a May news memo, indicating the police document wasn’t finalized until at least two months after the fatal shooting.

“At a time when the public was being assured that the department was doing a thorough and impartial investigation into Breonna’s killing, [the department] was actually preparing a lengthy, one-sided report regarding things that their officers were unaware of at the time they killed Breonna,” said Taylor’s family lawyer Sam Aguiar.

At a press conference last week, Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Robert Schroeder called the leak “simply not helpful” to the investigation and “irrelevant to our goal of obtaining justice, peace and healing for our community.”

The police department did not respond to a question about why the memo was written.

Questions have been raised as to whether or not the warrant used to go to Taylor’s apartment was valid. The memo indicates police had more information tying Taylor and Glover together than police presented to the court.

But legal experts said that the leaked document does not answer key questions that have swirled around the case: whether police announced who they were when they entered the apartment, whether the use of force was appropriate and whether there were other violations of police department policy.

Christopher Slobogin, director of the criminal justice program at Vanderbilt Law School, said those questions are crucial to the investigation.

“You need probable cause to get a warrant to get into a house — that doesn’t mean you’re set,” Slobogin said.

“You still need to execute a warrant properly,” he added. “You still have to knock and announce, or announce and avoid using excessive force.”

Alan Rozenshtein, associate professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said the police practice of knocking on doors and announcing themselves has a long history dating back to English common law.

“Homes are sacred spaces. We want to give people a measure of dignity. Also it is to give everyone a moment to calm down,” said Rozenshtein, a constitutional law expert.

Rozenshtein said the police may want to maintain an element of surprise in certain cases, if they are looking for evidence that might be destroyed or believe delay could pose risks to safety. But Rozenshtein said they should still announce themselves — for their own safety and that of others.

""Knocking without announcing is not helpful,"" he said.

New information in the leaked memo includes transcripts of jailhouse phone calls between Glover and the mother of his child that took place after Taylor was killed.

In one call, Glover indicates Taylor may have held money for him.

""Bre got down like $15 (grand), she had the $8 (grand) I gave her the other day and she picked up another $6 grand,” Glover told the mother of his child, according to the transcript in the memo.

The police found no drugs or money inside Taylor’s apartment, according to the search warrant inventory document obtained by NBC News.

In an interview with the Courier-Journal last week, Glover denied that Taylor ever held money for him.

Glover’s attorney Scott Barton told NBC News that his client has long maintained that “Breonna Taylor had nothing to do with any drug transactions.”",JustBadNews,0
"Horse attackers kill again in France: Pony's skull is smashed, its ear cut off and its diaphragm 'explodes' while a mare is 'disembowelled' in latest barbaric mutilations",http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8673957/Horse-attackers-kill-France-pony-mutilated.html,"A pony was found dead with its right ear cut off and its skull smashed while a mare was 'disembowelled' in the latest mysterious acts of savagery against French farm animals.

Part of the pony's face was sliced off and its diaphragm had 'exploded' as though somebody had jumped on it, an autopsy revealed after the vicious attack in Saint-Vallier in the south of France.

Police told Le Journal de Saone-et-Loire there was 'little doubt' it was a human attack and that 'technical and scientific' personnel were hunting the culprits.

Violent attacks on horses have occurred across the country, with severed ears apparently being collected as 'trophies' - leaving authorities mystified.

Earlier today France's agriculture minister vowed on Friday that those behind the acts of cruelty would be brought to justice.

Julien Denormandie, speaking on a visit to stables in Saint Eusebe where a horse's ear was cut off, said: 'We are here to show that all branches of the state are mobilising to get justice done.

'There is clearly a professionalism, people acting with a certain level of technique.'

At least 15 horses have been mutilated across France since the start of the year, with eyes, ears and bones hacked from animals' bodies (pictured, a horse found recently in Puy-de-Dôme)

In a separate attack, a mare was found 'disembowelled' in Vaucluse near the Mediterranean coast last weekend.

According to 20 Minutes, the mare's owner raised the alarm after reading about similar acts of violence elsewhere in the country.

While most of the attacks have been on horses, a calf was found dead in the Sarthe department with its ear hacked off and lacerations on its genitals last Friday.

The attack on the calf in Sarthe has led prosecutors in Le Mans to open an investigation 'given the national phenomenon of animal abuse that has been highlighted'.

'This is the first case reported in the Sarthe department and, to our knowledge, the first case on a calf, the cases of abuse identified having mainly affected horses,' a source told French media.

Meanwhile, authorities are investigating 'acts of cruelty' in Jura in eastern France after two mares had their genitals mutilated.

Local prosecutor Lionel Pascal denounced the 'barbaric acts' as 'pure cruelty' but said the two animals had survived the attacks.

A horse had its throat cut in Eure-et-Loir in France last weekend by attackers who were condemned by the animal's owner as 'barbarians'

A racehorse was found dead in February in the Vendée region, near Nantes, with one of its ears severed. The owner said it would have taken a group of people to restrain the animal

Elsewhere, a horse had its throat cut in Eure-et-Loir, a mare was found dead with an ear missing in Deux-Sevres while two others had their genitals mutilated near Saint-Claude but survived.

Johan Papillon, a farmer in Eure-et-Loir, raged at the 'barbarians' who had cut his horse's throat in the early hours of the morning.

Mr Papillon said the attackers had put a halter around the horse's neck and tied it to a tree in order to commit their 'vile act'.

The animal survived but needed up to 300 stitches on its neck, according to Mr Papillon who said the horse had apparently broken free of its restraints.

Prosecutors say they have 'no leads' at the moment which could point them to the attackers.

Stable owner Thomas Desgres said he found his mare in her box with a slashed ear late Tuesday night.

He added: 'Now, I sleep here. I patrol every half-hour. It's tiring,' he told Denormandie.

The president of the French Equestrian Federation Serge Lecomte, who accompanied the agriculture minister, said: ''It is cruel savagery of a kind we have rarely seen before.

'Is it a cult? Cruelty towards animals is the precursor to cruelty towards humans.'

A donkey found dead in Forges les Eaux, north of Paris, in June had one of its eyes cut out and an ear removed

A horse found dead in Neuvy-en-Sullias, near Orelans, in March had been stabbed several times in the neck and stomach, and had an ear cut off

Animals have come under attack in various parts of France, including in northern France, near the Atlantic coast and in the countryside near Lyon.

At least 15 attacks on horses and donkeys have been reported in France since the start of the year.

One horse was even stabbed in its meadow across the border in Belgium, according to Estelle Beeckmans who condemned the 'cowardly' attack.

French media says there is no apparent link between the affected owners, apparently ruling out the possibility of revenge attacks.

However, the fact that the mutilated animals regularly have their ears cut off could mean that the attackers are pursuing a 'trophy'.

Security officials have previously suggested the attacks could be linked to a fetish,s sadistic ritual or grisly online 'challenge'.

'Is this a challenge on the internet? The impulse of an individual? All avenues are being investigated,' Bruno Wallart of the police in Riom in the Puy-de-Dome region of central France, where several horses have reportedly been mutilated, said in June.

"Belarus media strike: 'if we can't do honest journalism, we won't work'",http://theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/17/belarus-media-strike-if-we-cant-do-honest-journalism-we-wont-work,"On Monday morning, Belarusians watching the news on state television were greeted with an extraordinary sight: an empty studio. It was the latest development in the rapid unravelling of president Alexander Lukashenko’s hold on power in Belarus during the past week, and potentially one of the most significant.

Belarus One, the national channel, has been churning out government propaganda throughout Lukashenko’s quarter-century rule, and at the beginning of last week was painting the protesters as dangerous provocateurs paid from abroad to disrupt the glorious stability brought by Lukashenko.

But Belarus has changed so quickly in the past week that many at the channel feel they can no longer work for the propaganda machine. On Monday, about 300 of the station’s 2,000 employees went on strike, saying they would not return to work unless the government implemented five demands, including new elections and the removal of television censorship.

“People feel that if we can’t do honest journalism, then we won’t work,” said the documentary maker Kseniya Lutskina, one of those who signed. She was standing outside the headquarters on Monday afternoon fielding calls from colleagues and trying to persuade them to sign up.

Lutskina said some of those striking had said they would come to the office but not work, and said that all but the most ideological were considering joining, but many were scared. “The problem for a lot of people is that the there’s no other television to work at in the country – it’s all state-controlled,” she said. Management has threatened to fire those who go on strike.

Some employees walked out even before the recent elections, feeling suffocated by the atmosphere as Lukashenko jailed his political opponents and looked set to rig the election. Alexander Luchonok, who worked for 18 months as a special correspondent on the twice-weekly current affairs programme Under the President’s Control, handed in his resignation a week before the election.

Luchonok said most correspondents at the station simply wanted to pursue a good career, but added that there were some ideologues who were genuine Lukashenko supporters. “Even if they don’t believe everything in the reports, they think it’s important to keep Lukashenko in office,” he said in a recent interview.

Sensitive political topics were ordered directly from the presidential administration, he said, but “of course, mainly it’s about self-censorship; you know what not to say”.

Luchonok was also deeply disturbed by the station’s coverage of the coronavirus crisis, which Lukashenko dismissed as a “psychosis” that should not stop people from working. “I watched someone who went through a relative dying of coronavirus and saw this same person ordering people to produce a report on how the virus situation in the country was under control,” he said.

For years, the television news has reported on the country as if it is still part of the Soviet Union in 1980: nightly spots on tractor production and grain harvests, always featuring the great leader keeping an eye on things and reprimanding wayward officials.

Even as the country was plunged into chaos last week, there were attempts to portray business as usual. Last Tuesday, as riot police were chasing protesters through Minsk for a third consecutive night and thousands were being subjected to appalling conditions and violent treatment inside prisons, the evening news on Belarus One opened with news of Lukashenko chairing a cabinet meeting about the price of rapeseed oil.

“The peasants are working better than ever before, and we have meat, salt and butter,” he said, ahead of a package featuring footage of various factory production lines.

There was also time for sinister coverage of the protests. Video was carefully edited to make it look as if the majority of the violence had come from the protesters’ side, and there were gruesome interviews with bloodied protesters, lying face down on the ground, hands tied behind their back, who croaked in pain that they would never protest again. Anchors repeatedly emphasised that the protests had been ordered from abroad with the goal of destabilising the country.

Many older people get their news from television, and for this reason it has become one of the protesters’ targets. On Saturday, and again on Monday, crowds gathered outside the headquarters.

“Tell the truth to our grandparents,” read a huge banner placed outside the entrance. Riot police inside the building formed a defence line to prevent the protesters from entering.

At the vast protest rally on Sunday, the opposition politician Maria Kolesnikova said she was appealing to journalists on state television, as well as security forces and diplomats, to join the protests. “This is your last chance. Fight your fear like all of us did. We were all scared, but we fought our fear. Join us and we will support you,” she said.",JustBadNews,0
Seattle BLM protesters demand white people 'give up' their homes,http://nypost.com/2020/08/14/seattle-blm-protesters-demand-white-people-give-up-their-homes/,"A group of Black Lives Matter protesters in Seattle marched through a residential neighborhood this week demanding that white residents give up their homes, dramatic video shows.

Footage of the Wednesday demonstration posted to Twitter shows a crowd of dozens chanting “Black lives matter” before an unidentified man projects his ire toward nearby white residents — saying they are living in a historically black section of the city as another woman in the crowd yells that they should “give up” their homes, the clip shows.

“Do you know that before your white ass came here, this was all black people?” the man says. “Do you know people like you came in here and basically bought all the land from the black people for less than what it was worth, kicked them out so you could live here? Do you know that?”

The man continues: “’Cause if you don’t, now you f–king do — now do something about it!”

Another woman in the crowd then urges the residents to “open their wallet” as the man continues to yell at the unidentified residents off-camera.

“So how do you plan to fix it?” the man continues. “As a gentrifier, because you are part of that problem.”

A woman with a megaphone then urges the residents to “give up” their house, the footage shows.

“Give black people back their homes!” she yells. “You’re sitting there comfortably — comfortable as f—k as if they didn’t help gentrify this neighborhood! I used to live in this neighborhood, and my family was pushed out, and you’re sitting up there having a good time with your other white friends!”

A second clip purportedly shows BLM demonstrators and Antifa members calling for white people to “get the f–k out” as others in the crowd call for reparations.

“Give us our s–t back!” one man yells.

Yet another clip apparently shot in the aftermath of the protest also shows demonstrators threatening a business owner who allegedly called cops to report that a window had been shattered at his business.

“You’re being racist, you’re being racist,” a protester tells the unidentified white business owner. “Check your privilege, check your privilege.”

The protester then tells the man to “go back to his gentrification business” while yelling profanities at him, the clip shows.

“This was never your neighborhood,” the man’s rant continues. “This was never your neighborhood.”

The mask-clad white man then refuses to identify his business before being threatened as he walks away, the clip shows.

“Yeah, we’ll make sure to support you,” the protester continues. “Hey look, we don’t know what happened, we ain’t seen shit, we don’t know shit. You better hope we don’t find out though. That’s not a threat.”

“That’s a promise,” a second man then yells.

One of the protesters was then taken into custody for alleged vandalism as other Black Lives Matter demonstrators yell obscenities at cops, footage shows.

Seattle’s police chief, Carmen Best, stepped down this week as the city council approved cutting the department by as many as 100 cops through layoffs and attrition. The city currently has some 1,400 officers and the reduction fell short of the 50 percent cut that many Black Lives Matter protesters had sought.

The city’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, is also facing a legal battle to get her kicked out of office for her role in Seattle’s violent protests, which started in June when demonstrators took over its Capitol Hill district and later renamed it the Capitol Hill Occupation Protest.

McDonald's is suing its ousted CEO for lying about sexual relationships with employees,http://cnn.com/2020/08/10/business/mcdonalds-steve-easterbrook-ceo-lawsuit/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Ousted McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook lied to the board about the extent of his relationships with employees, the company alleged in a new lawsuit. He misled investigators about engaging in physical sexual relationships with three employees in the year before his ouster, according to the documents.

Now, McDonald's is suing Easterbrook for the amount of his exit package: about $40 million.

The company cut ties with Easterbrook in November . At the time, McDonald's board said the executive had violated company policy and ""demonstrated poor judgment"" by engaging in a consensual relationship with an employee.

McDonald's cut ties with former CEO Stephen Easterbrook in November.

In legal documents filed Monday morning, McDonald's said that an internal investigation found other relationships and evidence that Easterbrook lied and destroyed records to conceal his behavior.

They also offer more details on the incident that the McDonald's board referenced in its statement announcing Easterbrook's exit: a sexting relationship with an employee.

Woman faces possible life in prison after allegedly buying paint for BLM protest,http://globalnews.ca/news/7257388/protester-paint-life-prison-black-lives-matter/,"Send this page to someone via email

A woman who allegedly pushed a police officer and bought red paint for a Black Lives Matter protest could face up to life in prison after Utah authorities charged her under a law meant to punish gang members.

“This is so far beyond just the enforcement of the law, it feels retaliatory,” said Madalena McNeil, who is facing a potential life sentence if convicted of felony criminal mischief and riot charges.

Prosecutors say the charges are worthy of a gang enhancement, which allows them to increase the punishment if McNeil is found guilty. They argued in court documents Wednesday that protesters worked together to cause thousands of dollars in damage during an anti-racism protest in Salt Lake City last month.

McNeil is accused of buying red paint at a Home Depot before the protest on July 9, which was held to denounce a court ruling on a fatal police shooting. Court documents allege that McNeil also yelled at police and shifted her weight as if to slam into an officer.

“It’s really frustrating and scary,” the 28-year-old activist said. “I just feel so much concern for what this means to protest in general.”

McNeil says she was forced to resign from her job at a nonprofit after she was charged along with several others who attended the protest.

“This is the highest degree felony,” said attorney Brent Huff, who represents co-defendant Madison Alleman. “This is usually reserved for murders and rapists.”

Jesse Nix, who represents accused protester Viviane Turman, also denounced the charges. “No one should get life in prison for putting paint on a building,” he said.

Jason Groth, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, criticized prosecutors for using a law meant to target street gangs. “You are calling participants in a protest gang members,” he said.

More than 30 people have been charged with various crimes in Salt Lake County since anti-racism protests broke out following the death of George Floyd in May.

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill says the protesters likely won’t spend time behind bars, because such cases usually end with a plea to a lesser count.

“I don’t think anyone is going to be going to prison for this,” Gill, a Democrat, told the Associated Press.

“There’s some people who want to engage in protest, but they want to be absolved of any behaviour,” he said. “This is not about protest. This is about people who are engaging in criminal conduct.”

Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has denounced the charges as too extreme.

“I feel the potential punishment facing some protestors is excessive,” she tweeted. “While I believe there should be consequences for breaking the law, the potential to spend life in prison for buying paint is too severe.”

“I just don’t think any of the allegations against me warrant life in prison,” McNeil told KUTV.

“It sends a very extreme message to anyone who’s considering acting out their civil right to protest.”

Trolls doll pulled after complaints it promotes child abuse,http://apnews.com/b81955ed00a2b5bbb754261ba2833f5c,"PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — A Trolls doll is being pulled off store shelves amid complaints it promotes child abuse.

Toymaker Hasbro said Wednesday that it’s in the process of removing the “Trolls World Tour Giggle and Sing Poppy” from the market and will be offering customers a replacement doll of the popular female character.

The doll had been designed to giggle when placed in a sitting position, but some parents complain the sound activation button is inappropriately placed under the doll’s skirt and between her legs.

An online petition suggests the doll is “conditioning our children to think pedophilia is OK.”

“This is not okay for a child’s toy! This toy needs to be removed from our stores,” the petition by Jessica McManis reads in part. “What will this toy make our innocent, impressionable children think? That it’s fun when someone touches your private area?”

The petition is addressed to major retailers including Target, Walmart and Amazon.

Hasbro spokeswoman Julie Duffy told The Providence Journal that the Rhode Island-based company recognizes the sensor’s placement “may be perceived as inappropriate.”

“This was not intentional and we are happy to provide consumers with a replacement Poppy doll of similar value through our consumer care team,” she told the newspaper. “We are in the process of removing the item for purchase.”

UK says 50 million face masks it bought might not be safe,http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uk-50-million-face-masks-bought-safe-72210249?cid=clicksource_4380645_2_heads_hero_live_headlines_hed,"UK says 50 million face masks it bought might not be safe The British government says it won’t be using 50 million face masks it bought for medics during the coronavirus outbreak because of concerns they might not be safe

LONDON -- The British government says it won’t be using 50 million face masks it bought during a scramble to secure protective equipment for medics during the coronavirus outbreak because of concerns they might not be safe.

The admission sparked calls from opposition parties for an urgent inquiry into the way contracts for essential supplies were handed out.

The masks were part of a 252-million-pound ($332 million) contract the government signed with investment firm Ayanda Capital in April. Papers filed in a court case reveal that the masks won't be distributed because they have ear loops rather than head loops and may not fit tightly enough.

The papers, published Thursday, are part of a lawsuit against the Conservative government by campaigning groups the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor. They want the courts to review contracts signed by the government for personal protective equipment, which they say were not properly scrutinized.

The groups estimate the 50 million rejected masks cost about 150 million pounds (about $197 million), though the government has not confirmed the amount and it is unclear whether the full 252 million pounds (about $332 million) agreed to in the deal was ever paid.

As the coronavirus outbreak accelerated across the U.K. in March, it became clear that the country lacked enough masks, gloves, gowns and other protective gear for health care workers and nursing home staff. That sparked a race to buy billions of pieces of equipment from suppliers around the world.

Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, said the government had signed three contracts worth more than 100 million pounds each “with respectively a pest control company, a confectioner and a family hedge fund.”

“Each of those contracts has revealed real cause for alarm,” he said.

The government said in its response to the lawsuit that the offer to supply the 50 million masks came from Andrew Mills, a businessman who is both an adviser to the government’s Board of Trade and to Ayanda Capital. Mills has denied there was any conflict of interest.

Ayanda Capital chief executive Tim Horlick said the masks met government standards and were not “unusable or unsafe.” He said National Health Service requirements may have changed in the fast-moving circumstances of the pandemic.

The British government said another 150 million masks of a different type supplied by Ayanda are still being tested.

It said in a statement that “there is a robust process in place to ensure orders are of high quality and meet strict safety standards, with the necessary due diligence undertaken on all government contracts.”

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “very disappointed” that the shipment was unusable. But he said Britain had “achieved a colossal race against time” to obtain supplies of equipment and stockpile it in case of a second wave of coronavirus in the fall and winter.

Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, called for an urgent investigation into the way personal protective equipment was acquired.

“It’s just not good enough to people who need that protective equipment that we find ourselves in this position,"" he said.",JustBadNews,0
One death every 80 seconds: The grim new toll of COVID-19 in America,http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/one-death-every-80-seconds-grim-new-toll-covid-19-n1235890,"Over the last seven days, a grim new COVID-19 calculus has emerged: one person died every 80 seconds from the coronavirus in America.

And the pace at which those 7,486 people died appears to be accelerating, a new NBC News tally revealed Wednesday.

In July, a total of 26,198 deaths were reported, meaning one every 102 seconds. As of Wednesday morning, more than 158,000 people in the U.S. had died of the virus since the start of the pandemic.

The numbing new national snapshot of how COVID-19 is claiming more and more lives came as Johns Hopkins University reported another milestone: The world death toll from this plague had eclipsed 700,000.

The U.S. has logged over 4.8 million confirmed cases. And around 1.8 million of those have come since July 7, when the 3 millionth case was reported, NBC News figures show.

While most of the new cases and deaths have been in the South and Sun Belt, states in the northeast like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts that were hit hardest at the start of the pandemic — and were able to flatten the curve — have also reported worrying upticks.

Under fire for being slow to respond to the COVID-19 crisis and presiding over the biggest economic disaster since the Great Depression, President Donald Trump once again downplayed the extent of the pandemic in a call-in interview Wednesday with ""Fox & Friends.""

“This thing is going away,” he said. “It will go away like things go away.”

Ahora solo mayores de edad podrán comprar los productos, en un movimiento que la diputada impulsora, Magaly López, comparó con la prohibición de la venta a menores de edad de tabaco y alcohol.

La idea es que recaiga directamente en la tutela de mayores de edad, el consumo de refrescos y comida chatarra de los niños. No será prohibido el consumo de menores de edad, solo el que puedan comprar los productos por su propia cuenta. En el mejor de los casos, ahora los padres de familia tendrían la responsabilidad de vigilar la alimentación de los menores, dijo la diputada morenista López.

La iniciativa recibió el apoyo del Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia, e incluso del subsecretario López-Gatell, quien en repetidas ocasiones ha señalado a refrescos y comida chatarra como los motivos indirectos de la gravedad de la pandemia en el país, al ser las causas de comorbilidades como obesidad. En concreto, modificará el artículo 20 Bis de la Ley de Derechos de Niñas, Niños y Adolescentes.

""Veneno embotellado"": López-Gatell

A decir de la OCDE, México experimenta una reducción del PIB del 5.3% por obesidad. Una de las medidas para disminuir el consumo de refrescos ha sido el IEPS a bebidas azucaradas, pero no ha bastado para aminorar el número de personas con obesidad, que se estima en un 73% de la población. De ese porcentaje, un 34% sufre obesidad mórbida.

La iniciativa fue aprobado por 31 votos, aunque la bancada del PRI se posicionó frontalmente en contra. Por su parte, la diputada López dijo que las críticas a la iniciativa no tienen fundamento y son impulsadas únicamente por las grandes empresas. No habrá persecución a tenderos, aclaró.

52% de los recursos del IMSS se destinan a enfermedades no crónicas como la diabetes

La Alianza Nacional de Pequeños Comerciantes (ANPEC) se manifestó en contra de la iniciativa pues dijo que golpeará la economía de los pequeños negocios, indeseable en todo momento pero ahora todavía más dado los efectos de la pandemia.

"Daily Mail leaks bodycam footage of George Floyd arrest, killing",http://startribune.com/daily-mail-leaks-bodycam-footage-of-george-floyd-arrest-killing/571995372/,"A British media company on Monday published segments of two leaked body-worn camera videos showing the arrest and death of George Floyd in May at the hands of Minneapolis police.

The Daily Mail published an article with the videos on its website at 10:53 a.m. Central time. It showed about 10 minutes of video from former officer Thomas Lane's bodycam and about 18 minutes from former officer J. Alexander Kueng's bodycam.

The two former officers' bodycam videos were made available for public viewing inside the Hennepin County courthouse in mid-July, but were prohibited from being recorded or publicly distributed.

It's unclear how the Daily Mail got the videos. The article said they were ""leaked"" to the company.

Hennepin County District Court spokesman Spenser Bickett confirmed that the court was aware of the leak, and said an investigation was underway. ""The court will provide no further comment on this matter at this time,"" Bickett said in an e-mail.

Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is leading the prosecution of the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd's death, issued a statement that he was not the source of the leak.

""We will continue to take the strictest precautions to ensure a fair trial,"" Ellison said.

Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill is presiding over the former officers' cases. Cahill had prohibited the videos from being distributed outside of the courthouse. He also prohibited the media and public from recording them when they were made available.

The videos published by the Daily Mail appeared to have been recorded on a device while they were played on a laptop in a courthouse conference room.

The courts had provided a large room and several laptops to view the videos, and required attendees to stow away their own personal laptops and cellphones during the hourlong viewing sessions. Sheriff's deputies and court staff were stationed throughout the room as several members of the media and public viewed the videos.

The two videos, which totaled about 65 minutes, were viewable by the media and public by appointment only. Sixty-six slots were made available.

Attorney Earl Gray had filed the videos in court in early July as evidence supporting his motion to dismiss the charges against Lane, his client. Court filings make evidence, including bodycam footage, public data, according to state law.

A coalition of local and national media companies, including the Star Tribune, filed a motion in July seeking immediate release of the videos. Cahill took the issue under advisement and has not issued a decision on the matter.

The videos, which were viewed by Star Tribune reporters in July, showed that Floyd was given no explanation for why he was being questioned before Lane pointed a gun and swore at him, touched him multiple times and forced him out of his vehicle into the street.

Kueng and Lane had responded to Cup Foods on May 25 on a report that Floyd had allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill. They arrested Floyd. Their former colleagues, Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao, arrived later to help them.

Kueng, Lane and Thao are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. Prosecutors have said Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly 8 minutes, but Kueng's video showed that it was about 9 minutes and 30 seconds.

The bodycam videos and a video recorded by a bystander showed that Floyd repeatedly told the officers he couldn't breathe, and that several bystanders pleaded with them to stop, but were ignored.

Cahill set the matter for trial next March.

Fossil Fuel Industry Pollutes Black & Brown Communities While Propping Up Racist Policing,http://news.littlesis.org/2020/07/27/fossil-fuel-industry-pollutes-black-brown-communities-while-propping-up-racist-policing/,"Creative Commons Photos: Shell Gas Station (Mike Mozart); Chase (longislandwins); Chevron (Roo Reynolds); Wells Fargo (Mike Mozart); BlackRock (Thomas Hawk)

As movements for racial and environmental justice escalate across the US, these struggles – which, as groups like the National Black Environmental Justice Network point out, must be seen as one – have a common foe: the fossil fuel industry. The same companies that drive environmental racism in Black and Brown communities through toxic and climate-changing pollution also fund police power in cities that stretch from Houston and Detroit to New Orleans and Salt Lake City.

Oil and gas companies, private utilities, and financial institutions that bankroll fossil fuels are all big backers of police foundations, which privately raise money to buy weapons, equipment, and surveillance technology for police departments, bypassing already outsized public police budgets. These corporate actors – from Chevron and Shell to Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase – can be found serving as directors and funders of police foundations nationwide. Furthermore, these companies sponsor events and galas that celebrate the police and remind the public that police power is backed up by corporate power.

Fossil fuel companies, utilities, and the banks that fund them are prominent political players in any local or regional power structure. These companies, which rely on extraction and exploitation to secure their profits, have an incentive to form tight bonds with police forces, which function to uphold and protect their interests in the face of community opposition. In many states, these companies go so far as to back laws to criminalize protests of dirty energy projects such as pipelines, openly weaponizing the police and criminal justice system to protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry and the banks that fund them.

This symbiotic relationship between the fossil fuel industry and police often means that the companies that are polluting Black and Brown communities – like Marathon Petroleum in Detroit, Valero in Corpus Christi, or Shell in Louisiana – are the same ones that are aligned with and propping up police forces in these same cities. This is why divesting from fossil fuels and fighting to end environmental racism goes hand in hand with defunding the police in the fight for racial justice and reinvestment in Black and Brown communities.

Fossil fuel companies

Fossil fuel companies support police foundations across the country, especially in major oil producing states such as Texas and Louisiana. A few of the most prominent Big Oil backers of police foundations include:

Chevron, one of the top integrated oil and gas companies in the world, with a market capitalization value that ranked only behind ExxonMobil at the end of 2019. The fifth biggest US refiner, Chevron is a top polluter that owns two of the top six benzene-emitting refineries in the US. Chevron’s refineries are the targets of numerous environmental justice fights. For example, in Richmond, California, community residents have fought for years against the power, pollution, and environmental racism of Chevron, which owns a major refinery in the city made up of 80% people of color.



Chevron is a “Corporate Partner of the Police” sponsor of the New Orleans Police & Justice Foundation, as well as a board member of the Houston Police Foundation and sponsor of the Houston Police Department’s mounted patrol. It is also donor to and, as of the end of 2018, a board member of the Salt Lake City Police Foundation.

Marathon Petroleum, the nation’s largest oil refining company, has a history of environmental pollution that disproportionately impacts the health of Black and Brown communities where their refineries are based. Sine 2000 Marathon has been fined over $1.4 billion for various environmental, consumer, and workplace violations.



The company operates 16 refineries around the country, including a notorious 250-acre refinery in a Detroit, Michigan community that is 71% Black. Since 2013 Marathon’s Detroit refinery has received 15 violations from the state environmental regulator for surpassing state and federal emissions limits. In 2019 the refinery leaked a “gasoil” mixture that created a toxic vapor cloud that sent workers to the hospital.



Marathon’s Security Coordinator sits on the board of the Detroit Public Safety Foundation, the city’s police foundation. Marathon is also listed as a “Commanding Sponsor” of the foundation’s fundraising event “Above & Beyond” and a “Bronze Sponsor” of their “Women in Blue” event.

We’d like to thank Marathon Petroleum for making a special delivery to @detroitpolice 4th precinct for #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay. They also delivered a check for new gym equipment at the precinct. Thanks Marathon for supporting #BacktheBlueDetroit pic.twitter.com/TnBq7VV2j5 — DetPublicSafetyFndtn (@DetPublicSafety) January 9, 2020

Shell, one of the biggest fossil fuel companies in the world and a major global emitter of carbon pollution. It is building a huge ethane cracker plant near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that some feel could start to turn Appalachia into the next “Cancer Alley” – the nickname for the New Orleans-to-Baton Rouge corridor of Louisiana refineries, where Shell is also a major polluter. Cancer Alley runs through several Black communities that face extremely high rates of pollution and cancer – largely believed to be caused by refining and petrochemical operations.



Shell is a “Featured Partner” of the New Orleans Police & Justice Foundation and a sponsor of the Houston Police Department’s Mounted Patrol.

Valero is the second biggest oil refining company in the US. Its Corpus Christi East refinery – part of the city’s “Refinery Row,” where a slew of refineries sit near predominantly poor, Black, and Brown communities – is a top emitter of benzene. Valero has a board seat on the Corpus Christi Police Foundation’s board of directors, and it is a sponsor of the Houston Police Department’s Mounted Patrol.

Hilcorp, headquartered in Houston, Texas, is one of the largest privately-held oil drillers in the country and is best known for buying older oil and gas fields from other producers in order to extract any remaining product. The company is also known for racking up environmental violations. From 2012 to 2015 Hilcorp’s Alaska operation had 25 documented violations of environmental regulations including allowing a gas pipeline on the seafloor to leak methane rather than stop production until a repair was possible. In Ohio, Hilcorp’s drilling practices were blamed for dozens of earthquakes, while in Louisiana they have been responsible for several oil spills and destroyed oyster beds in an already vulnerable coastal community.



Hilcorp’s billionaire co-founder and Chairman Jeff Hildebrand has a board seat on the Houston Police Foundation and is a notable attendee of their fundraising events.

Other fossil fuel companies also support police foundations. For example, Energy Transfer Partners, one of the companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, is a listed sponsor of the Friends of the Dallas Police, while Aramco, Cabot Oil & Gas, and several companies profiled below sponsor the Houston Police’s Mounted Patrol Department.

Utility companies

Utility companies are some of the dirtiest and most dangerous polluters in the country. According to a 2019 benchmarking report backed by several utility companies, the 100 largest utilities accounted for 80% of measurable air emissions in the United States. Another 2019 study found that Black communities disproportionately suffer health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular damage, and face a higher risk of death from the fine particulate emissions that come from power plants.

Utilities nationwide are prominent players in local power structures, which means they often also hold roles in local police foundations as board members and donors. Here are some other major utility companies that back police foundations:

Detroit Edison (DTE) is an electric utility company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. DTE’s Director of Corporate and Government Affairs sits on the board of the Detroit Public Safety Foundation, the city’s police foundation. DTE sponsors the foundation’s events such as the Above & Beyond Awards and donates directly through its own DTE Energy Foundation, giving $138,000 between 2014 and 2018.



Around 65% of the energy produced at DTE comes from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel to burn. In May 2020 DTE was forced to pay a $1.8 million civil penalty and agree to spend $5.5 million on air quality mitigation projects as part of a settlement with the EPA over violations of the Clean Air Act.

Exelon is a publicly-traded energy company headquartered in Chicago and the largest utility in the country with eight subsidiaries. Exelon is a major political player and a prolific donor to police foundations where it and its subsidiaries operate, giving to foundations in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington D.C. For example, in Baltimore County, BGE, a subsidiary of Exelon, has a seat on the police foundation board and is a gold level sponsor.



Exelon is currently embroiled in a major lobbying scandal in its home state of Illinois for allegedly hiring in exchange for political favors. It has been charged with bribery and has agreed to pay a $200 million fine. In 2019 the company agreed to pay $200 million over 50 years to settle a lawsuit over pollution in the Chesapeake Bay.

Entergy is a publicly-traded, Fortune 500 company headquartered in Louisiana that also services parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy is arguably the most powerful corporate force in Louisiana, with presences on prominent chambers, business associations, philanthropic organizations, and even charter school advocacy groups across the state. Entergy is a “Featured Partner” of the New Orleans Police and Justice Foundation with top billing on the foundation’s sponsors page.



In 2018 Entergy made headlines after it paid actors $60-200 dollars to pose as grassroots supporters at a City Council meeting that was considering the company’s proposed gas-fired power plant in New Orleans East, home to a large Vietnamese community. The resulting scandal, lawsuit, and city council investigation prompted the Entergy New Orleans CEO to step down.

Thank You for Another Amazing Stake Out for Justice Luncheon presented by Entergy – https://t.co/CDsbzCisfH pic.twitter.com/dMVYrGSIje — NOPJF (@nopjf) October 8, 2019

Duke Energy is a publicly-traded electric power company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina and is a bronze level sponsor of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Foundation. Duke was ranked the number one polluting power company in the county by the Los Angeles Times in 2019. In 2015 Duke was sued over a major coal ash leak in North Carolina and in 2020 was forced to agree to the largest environmental cleanup in US history. Duke still owns the coal-fired Gallagher plant in West Louisville, Kentucky where over 30% of nearby residents suffer from environment-related illnesses. Duke was the second largest owner of the recently abandoned Atlantic Coast Pipeline project.

Other utilities also back police foundations. For example, mega-utility and top owner of the now-cancelled Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Dominion Energy, has a seat on the board of the Richmond Police Foundation and is a donor to the Salt Lake City Police Foundation, while NV Energy has a board seat on the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Foundation and sponsors its fundraising events.

Financial institutions

Fossil fuel companies depend on major financial institutions – such as banks, asset managers, and insurance companies – to prop up their oil, gas, and coal operations. Many of these same firms that are financing our climate crisis and environmental racism are also helping to bankroll and support police foundations across the US. Demands to divest from fossil fuels and reinvest in a just transition, and to defund the police and reinvest in Black and Brown communities, have some common targets: big banks and financial institutions. Some of the largest fossil fuel financiers that donate to these private foundations include:

JPMorgan Chase is the top global financier of fossil fuels, funneling over a quarter-trillion dollars towards oil, gas, and coal between 2016 and 2019, according to the 2020 Banking on Fossil Fuels report. Former ExxonMobil CEO and chairman Lee Raymond, who has a long record of climate denialism, has served on the board of JPMorganChase and its predecessor for over three decades. Climate organizers have been campaigning to fully remove Raymond from the board.



JPMorgan Chase serves as a sponsor – a “Corporate Partner of Police,” officially – of the New Orleans Police & Justice Foundation, which uses corporate donations to fund things like surveillance technology and the recruitment and training of police. JPMorgan also occupies the Secretary/Treasurer position on the foundation’s board. The bank’s donor relationship to police foundations also goes far back: nearly a decade ago, JPMorgan garnered scrutiny for its huge $4.6 million donation to the NYC Police Foundation for “security upgrades, including new patrol car laptops and security monitoring software for the department’s main data center,” according to Police Magazine. Organizers have recently staged protests against JPMorgan Chase in Chicago, demanding reparations after a new report revealed egregious racial disparities in the bank’s mortgage lending practices in the city.

Wells Fargo is the second biggest global banker behind fossil fuels, with nearly $198 billion in financing between 2016 and 2019. The scandal-ridden bank has a slew of ties to police foundations. It is a platinum sponsor and has two board seats with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Foundation. It is also a partner and donor to the Seattle Police Foundation, a director and sponsor of the Atlanta Police Foundation, and a donor to the Salt Lake City Police Foundation. Moreover, when it comes to financial ties to racist practices and institutions, Wells Fargo coziness with the police is just one example: the bank has been involved in discriminatory lending, propping up private prisons, and much more (for more information, check out the ACRE’s Forego Wells campaign).

Bank of America is the fourth biggest global financier of fossil fuels, with nearly $157 billion between 2016 and 2019 channeled toward oil, gas, and coal. Along with being a lender to some of the most controversial US pipeline projects, Bank of America also played a key advising role in Occidental’s acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum last year, the biggest oil merger in years. Bank of America also had the biggest increase in financing fossil fuels from 2018 to 2019 – $13.1 billion – of any bank globally, according to the 2020 Banking on Climate Change report.



Bank of America is a sponsor of the Philadelphia Police Foundation and has seats on the Chicago, NYC, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg police foundation boards. Its charitable arm has given $200,000 to the NYC Police Foundation, $51,250 to the Atlanta Police Foundation, $25,000 to the Boston Police Foundation, $10,000 to the Los Angeles Police Foundation, and smaller donations to police foundations in Sarasota, Duluth, Sacramento, and elsewhere. Bank of America’s ties to racist practices go beyond its donations to policing – just last year it agreed to pay a $4.2 million “in back wages and interest to resolve alleged hiring discrimination violations found at several of the bank’s facilities,” according to the US Department of Labor.

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager and remains one of the biggest global investors in oil, gas, and coal. According to a 2019 Guardian report, BlackRock has $87.3 billion invested in fossil fuel companies through its listed portfolio funds. The Guardian report also notes that BlackRock has “routinely opposed motions at fossil fuel companies that would have forced directors to take more action on climate change, the analysis reveals.” And even as BlackRock has gestured towards more climate accountability with companies BlackRock invests in, some have criticized the limited extent of these measures and the firm’s overall credibility on climate issues.



BlackRock’s Larry Fink is a big supporter of the one of the most powerful police foundations in the US, the NYC Police Foundation. Not only is Fink a donor to the foundation, but he has also co-chaired its annual gala from 2016 to 2019. Color of Change, which calls itself “the nation’s largest online racial justice organization,” is currently demanding that Fink and BlackRock stop supporting the foundation.

Morgan Stanley, the 11th biggest global financier of fossil fuels from 2016 to 2018, has close ties to police foundations. Two of its executives togetherchaired the 2019 NYC Police Foundation Gala, which honored its chairman and CEO, James Gorman. Morgan Stanley is represented on the board of the Atlanta Police Foundation and numerous other police foundation boards (from Jupiter, Florida, to Long Beach, California), and is a Bronze Sponsor of the Charlotte Police Foundation. Morgan Stanley also has a seat on the Greenville (South Carolina) Police Foundation board.



A former Morgan Stanley executive who served 16 years as the bank’s global head of diversity is now suing the firm, “alleging racial bias for silencing and retaliating against employees who sought to make it more inclusive,” with her lawsuit claiming that the company had a “toxic workplace culture for employees of color,” according to the Washington Post.

A host of other financial institutions also support police foundations. For example Goldman Sachs, the 14th biggest financier of fossil fuels from 2016 to 2018, is a big backer of police foundations. It gave $250,000 to the Los Angeles Police Foundation and $15,000 to the NYC Police Foundation in 2018, co-chaired the NYC Police Foundation’s 2019 Gala, and is a donor to the Salt Lake City Police Foundation.

In sum, many of the most powerful oil and gas companies, private utilities, and financial institutions that drive environmental injustice are also backers of the same police departments – through their funding, sponsoring, and governing of police foundations – that tyrannize the very communities these corporate actors pollute. As demands continue to rise to defund the police and reinvest in Black and Brown communities, as well as to divest from the fossil fuel industry and reinvest in environmental justice and a just transition, the fossil fuel industry power structure presents a common foe for these interconnected fights.",JustBadNews,0
Paedophile Labour councillor who worked in children's home walks free despite being caught with over one million child porn images including 12-year-old girls being raped,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8568833/Paedophile-Labour-councillor-worked-childrens-home-walks-free.html,"A paedophile Labour councillor who worked in a children's home has walked free despite being caught with over one million child porn images - including of 12-year-old girls being raped.

Roger Spackman, 50, who was a Labour councillor on Exeter City Council until his arrest in 2017, worked at a secure children's home at the time he started collecting the enormous hoard of images.

Exeter Crown Court heard that he was part of an underground internet network called The Other Place.

A police investigation in 2017 charged the two front runners with offences and other members were exposed.

But Judge Peter Johnson jailed Spackman for ten months, suspended for two years, with 40 days rehab for possessing a 'huge number of images'.

Roger Spackman, 50, (pictured) who was a Labour councillor on Exeter City Council until his arrest in 2017, worked at a secure children's home at the time he started collecting the enormous hoard of images

Spackman, of Exeter, Devon, was arrested and 68 electronic devices were found at his home and examined.

Judge Johnson said it was 'an astonishing number' of images which included the most serious category A images and others of category B and C.

The judge said he was of good character working hard in public service as a councillor in Exeter before his 'fall from grace which has been dramatic'.

He said Spackman had been abused as a child and played the role of an abused child in this forum.

Exeter Crown Court (pictured) heard that Spackman was part of an underground internet network called The Other Place

Many of the images were inaccessible but the offences dated back to 2008 - seven years after he began working at the secure children's home.

The court heard the most graphic images showed young girls aged 12 being raped.

Spackman's barrister Barry White said: 'He likes to pretend he is a young girl who will be abused. He will pretend to be a young girl.'

Mr White stressed: 'None of the images are of people who he knows. He has never sexually assaulted any children nor would he do so.

'The images were sent to him by the other party in the fantasy which were indicative of what that person liked. He did not get to choose what images but he accepted them all.'

Prosecutor Thomas Faulkner said some of the worst images were found on two devices found in his bedroom.

He said: 'Those images depicted pre-pubescent girls forced to take part in sexual activity.'

Mr White said there had been 'considerable impact' on his life since his arrest in October 2017 - quitting his Labour seat the day after his arrest and avoiding going out in public because 'everyone knows what he has done'.

Spackman admitted between October 2007 and July 2017 possessing still and moving images of categories A, B and C as well as possessing a prohibited image and possessing 48 extreme pornographic images involving an animal.",JustBadNews,0
Minneapolis police say 'Umbrella Man' was a white supremacist trying to incite George Floyd rioting,http://m.startribune.com/police-umbrella-man-was-a-white-supremacist-trying-to-incite-floyd-rioting/571932272/,"A masked man who was seen in a viral video smashing the windows of a south Minneapolis auto parts store during the George Floyd protests, earning him the moniker ""Umbrella Man,"" is suspected of ties with a white supremacist group and sought to incite racial tension, police said.

A Minneapolis police arson investigator said the act of vandalism at the AutoZone on E. Lake Street helped spark a chain reaction that led to days of looting and rioting. The store was among dozens of buildings across the city that burned to the ground in the days that followed.

""This was the first fire that set off a string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and the rest of the city,"" Sgt. Erika Christensen wrote in a search warrant affidavit filed in court this week. ""Until the actions of the person your affiant has been calling 'Umbrella Man,' the protests had been relatively peaceful. The actions of this person created an atmosphere of hostility and tension. Your affiant believes that this individual's sole aim was to incite violence.""

Police identified ""Umbrella Man"" thanks to a tip that came via e-mail last week, Christensen said.

The Star Tribune could not independently verify the police account, which has so far only surfaced in the search warrant, and isn't naming the man because so far he has not been charged with a crime. The man, who has a criminal history that includes convictions of domestic violence and assault, did not respond to messages seeking comment. Spokespersons for the Minneapolis Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is also involved in the investigation, declined to comment.

Floyd's death under the knee of a since-fired police officer set off protests that spread around the world and stirred widespread reckoning over racial injustice. Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, and three of his former colleagues also at the scene, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, have been charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin.

At least two people died in the subsequent riots, which eventually spread as far as north Minneapolis and South St. Paul, and caused roughly $500 million in damage. Authorities have since charged a handful of people with arson-related crimes.

A widely shared livestream video from May 27 — two days after Floyd's death — showed the man walking casually along the front of the former site of AutoZone at E. Lake Street and Minnehaha, breaking out its windows with a 4-pound sledgehammer, prompting some protesters to confront him and demand that he stop. Before that, police say, the man, clad head to toe in black and carrying a black umbrella, had spray-painted ""free [expletive] for everyone zone"" on the double front doors.

At the time, activists seized on the footage as proof that outside ""provocateurs"" were trying to derail what had been a mostly peaceful demonstration. But others on social media pointed out that at least some looting had gone on before the video surfaced.

Christensen wrote in the affidavit that she watched ""innumerable hours"" of videos on social media platforms to try to identify ""Umbrella Man,"" to no avail. Investigators finally caught a break when a tipster e-mailed the MPD identifying him as a member of the Hells Angels biker gang who ""wanted to sow discord and racial unrest by breaking out the windows and writing what he did on the double red doors,"" she wrote.

Police have also connected the 32-year-old man to a widely publicized incident in Stillwater late last month, in which a Muslim woman was confronted by men wearing white supremacist garb.

A subsequent investigation revealed the man was also an associate of the Aryan Cowboy Brotherhood, a small white supremacist prison and street gang based primarily in Minnesota and Kentucky. Several of its members were also present at the Stillwater incident.

Andy Shoemaker, a former St. Paul police officer who has investigated criminal motorcycle gangs, said the Aryan Cowboys are relatively new with loyalties to the Hells Angels, who operate across the state.

""They're another group that's basically a farm system, a minor league for the Hells Angels,"" he said, adding the Angels occasionally recruit members from some of these offshoot clubs.

The weeks that followed Floyd's death brought dozens of reports of racially motivated assaults against minorities and minority-owned businesses.

Leaked intelligence briefings show that federal authorities were monitoring the movements and online activity of white nationalists and other extremist groups that descended on the city during the riots. The president of the Hells Angels summoned 75 members of the Aryan Cowboy Brotherhood to the help protect the club's headquarters in north Minneapolis, according to an intelligence memo, which surfaced in June as part of a massive trove of leaked law enforcement documents dubbed ""Blue Leaks."" A club member later posted a warning to protesters on Facebook saying that while the Angels agreed with the anti-law enforcement message, any protests that reached the clubhouse or ""any of our neighborhoods"" would be ""met with a very unfriendly welcome party.""

Another leaked memo suggested that local biker gangs were taking advantage of the unrest to step up their drug trafficking in the metro area, and that bikers ""associated with white racially motivated violent extremists"" had discussed inciting riots while posing as members of the anti-fascist group Antifa. It wasn't immediately clear from the leaked materials whether any of these threats materialized.

After the protests began, footage of ""Umbrella Man"" roared around social media, prompting speculation about the man's identity. One persistent rumor argued ""Umbrella Man"" was an undercover St. Paul police officer seeking to incite violence, a claim apparently based on a tweet citing information from a woman who claimed to have once been married to the officer.

In response, St. Paul police released time-stamped surveillance videos showing that the officer was in St. Paul at the time of the incident, and Police Chief Todd Axtell released a statement scolding social media users for spreading misinformation that could ""jeopardize the officer's reputation and safety and chip away at the trust this police department has worked so hard to build with its community.""

Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage, said conversations around Floyd's death and the ensuing riots are important, but they often fail to account for the persistence of structural racism.

""I think at the end of the day, we need to start dealing with those issues, because I think this 'Umbrella Man,' he is a rotten piece of fruit at the farthest branch of the tree, [but] we've gotta get to the roots,"" Terrell said. ""I think we have to do the work to get there, which America has never done, and Minnesota sure hasn't.""

CDC warns many young adults with COVID-19 report severe long-term side effects. 20% of COVID-19 positive people aged 18-34 report continued symptoms 3-weeks after testing positive,http://salon.com/2020/07/27/cdc-warns-many-young-adults-with-covid-19-report-severe-long-term-side-effects/,"In states like Oregon, the recent growth in coronavirus cases comes in large part from younger people in their 20s and 30s, who have been contracting the virus at higher rates than the at-risk elderly. That may be because younger people have the perception that they are at lower risk for mortality, and thus are less invested in self-quarantining behavior.

Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is trying to quash this popular misconception that younger people simply don't get very bad cases of coronavirus. Indeed, as the CDC pointed out in a report, many young people are suffering severe long-term health consequences after contracting the disease — even though their over rate of mortality is quite low.

Advertisement:

In its regular Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes that ""prolonged symptom duration and disability are common in adults hospitalized with [COVID-19].""

The CDC conducted a multistate telephone survey of a random sample of adults between April 15 and June 25, 2020. In this survey, the researchers found that roughly 19 percent of adults between the ages of 18 and 34 who had tested positive for COVID-19 did not return to their usual state of health within two to three weeks after they were tested.

The sample size of adults within that category was small (nine out of 48), but still consistent with larger data which shows that younger populations should not consider themselves immune to serious health consequences if they contract COVID-19.

Advertisement:

The report also found that — after adjusting for sex, age and race/ethnicity — being obese and reporting a psychiatric condition were associated with odds more than two-fold of a patient not returning to their previous state of health after being infected.

""This report indicates that even among symptomatic adults tested in outpatient settings, it might take weeks for resolution of symptoms and return to usual health,"" the CDC writes. ""Not returning to usual health within 2-3 weeks of testing was reported by approximately one-third of respondents. Even among young adults aged 18-34 years with no chronic medical conditions, nearly one in five reported that they had not returned to their usual state of health 14-21 days after testing. In contrast, over 90 percent of outpatients with influenza recover within approximately two weeks of having a positive test result.""

The CDC report tracks with anecdotal evidence from young COVID-19 survivors. Recently, CNN profiled multiple people under 30 who contracted COVID-19 and suffered severe and lasting side effects. A 28-year-old UK man reported ""brain fog, difficulty concentrating and problems with short-term memory that make reading, writing and speaking harder."" A 28-year-old American woman reported that she now has to use an inhaler, and even speaking made her feel winded.

Speaking to Salon last month, Dr. Henry F. Raymond, associate professor and epidemiologist at the Rutgers School of Public Health, explained why we know so little about how the coronavirus will impact younger Americans who get infected.

""Thirty-five years into the HIV epidemic, we still don't know things about the dynamics of HIV infection,"" Raymond explained. ""We know the basics, but we actually don't know who's going to be the next group to be most at risk. To think that after December, January, February, March, April, May and June — seven months — we would have a handle on this whole thing is a little unbelievable to me.""

Salon also spoke earlier this month with Dr. Russell Medford, chairman of the Center for Global Health Innovation and Global Health Crisis Coordination Center, about the misperception that young people do not need to be concerned about coronavirus infections.

""The coronavirus affects both old and young,"" Dr. Russell Medford, chairman of the Center for Global Health Innovation and Global Health Crisis Coordination Center, told Salon. ""What's clear is, in terms of the impact of the virus on, it causes severe symptoms and death in the young. It's much less severe in the young, but the young are infected significantly and in large numbers. We are seeing our hospital beds and ICU beds being filled up with young patients now in Florida and Texas, that are in the hospital and undergoing intensive treatment because of their infection by coronavirus.""",JustBadNews,0

Spokespersons for the Minneapolis Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is also involved in the investigation, declined to comment.

Floyd's death under the knee of a since-fired police officer set off protests that spread around the world and stirred widespread reckoning over racial injustice. Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, and three of his former colleagues also at the scene, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, have been charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin.

At least two people died in the subsequent riots, which eventually spread as far as north Minneapolis and South St. Paul, and caused roughly $500 million in damage. Authorities have since charged a handful of people with arson-related crimes.

A widely shared livestream video from May 27 — two days after Floyd's death — showed the man walking casually along the front of the former site of AutoZone at E. Lake Street and Minnehaha, breaking out its windows with a 4-pound sledgehammer, prompting some protesters to confront him and demand that he stop. Before that, police say, the man, clad head to toe in black and carrying a black umbrella, had spray-painted ""free [expletive] for everyone zone"" on the double front doors.

At the time, activists seized on the footage as proof that outside ""provocateurs"" were trying to derail what had been a mostly peaceful demonstration. But others on social media pointed out that at least some looting had gone on before the video surfaced.

Christensen wrote in the affidavit that she watched ""innumerable hours"" of videos on social media platforms to try to identify ""Umbrella Man,"" to no avail. Investigators finally caught a break when a tipster e-mailed the MPD identifying him as a member of the Hells Angels biker gang who ""wanted to sow discord and racial unrest by breaking out the windows and writing what he did on the double red doors,"" she wrote.

Police have also connected the 32-year-old man to a widely publicized incident in Stillwater late last month, in which a Muslim woman was confronted by men wearing white supremacist garb.

A subsequent investigation revealed the man was also an associate of the Aryan Cowboy Brotherhood, a small white supremacist prison and street gang based primarily in Minnesota and Kentucky. Several of its members were also present at the Stillwater incident.

Andy Shoemaker, a former St. Paul police officer who has investigated criminal motorcycle gangs, said the Aryan Cowboys are relatively new with loyalties to the Hells Angels, who operate across the state.

""They're another group that's basically a farm system, a minor league for the Hells Angels,"" he said, adding the Angels occasionally recruit members from some of these offshoot clubs.

The weeks that followed Floyd's death brought dozens of reports of racially motivated assaults against minorities and minority-owned businesses.

Leaked intelligence briefings show that federal authorities were monitoring the movements and online activity of white nationalists and other extremist groups that descended on the city during the riots. The president of the Hells Angels summoned 75 members of the Aryan Cowboy Brotherhood to the help protect the club's headquarters in north Minneapolis, according to an intelligence memo, which surfaced in June as part of a massive trove of leaked law enforcement documents dubbed ""Blue Leaks."" A club member later posted a warning to protesters on Facebook saying that while the Angels agreed with the anti-law enforcement message, any protests that reached the clubhouse or ""any of our neighborhoods"" would be ""met with a very unfriendly welcome party.""

Another leaked memo suggested that local biker gangs were taking advantage of the unrest to step up their drug trafficking in the metro area, and that bikers ""associated with white racially motivated violent extremists"" had discussed inciting riots while posing as members of the anti-fascist group Antifa. It wasn't immediately clear from the leaked materials whether any of these threats materialized.

After the protests began, footage of ""Umbrella Man"" roared around social media, prompting speculation about the man's identity. One persistent rumor argued ""Umbrella Man"" was an undercover St. Paul police officer seeking to incite violence, a claim apparently based on a tweet citing information from a woman who claimed to have once been married to the officer.

In response, St. Paul police released time-stamped surveillance videos showing that the officer was in St. Paul at the time of the incident, and Police Chief Todd Axtell released a statement scolding social media users for spreading misinformation that could ""jeopardize the officer's reputation and safety and chip away at the trust this police department has worked so hard to build with its community.""

Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage, said conversations around Floyd's death and the ensuing riots are important, but they often fail to account for the persistence of structural racism.

""I think at the end of the day, we need to start dealing with those issues, because I think this 'Umbrella Man,' he is a rotten piece of fruit at the farthest branch of the tree, [but] we've gotta get to the roots,"" Terrell said. ""I think we have to do the work to get there, which America has never done, and Minnesota sure hasn't.""

Both men and the girl had all tested positive for coronavirus, exhibiting mild symptoms, and were in quarantine at India's largest Covid-19 centre, in Delhi.

The alleged rape took place on July 15 at the 10,000-bed facility and police say that the accused, 19, and another man, who allegedly filmed the attack, have been arrested.

It is believed the girl had only been at the quarantine centre for around a week.

A 14-year-old girl was allegedly been raped by a coronavirus patient in a bathroom in the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre (pictured), in south Delhi, while his friend stood guard

Police were contacted after the girl told a family member at the centre what had happened.

Speaking to The Indian Express on Thursday, senior police official Parvinder Singh said: 'The accused have been arrested and sent to judicial custody but will remain in institutional care until they recover from the infection.

Parvinder also said that the girl was transported to a different hospital and the two men were taken to another different location where they remain in custody.

Investigations are still being carried by the police.

The latest data suggests that India has had 1,288,108 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 30,601 people dying because of the virus.

The Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre in south Delhi's Chhatarpur is the largest facility in India and was designed to help patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and cannot isolate at home.

Despite being capable of housing 10,200 patients, only 250 beds are currently filled and of those, 30% of patients admitted are female.

The Indo-Tibetan Border Police have deployed 1,000 personnel to provide security at the centre, with around 100 working on each shift.

"Illegal assault on First Nations brothers by police caught on video was racist, lawsuit alleges",http://cbc.ca/news/indigenous/first-nations-police-video-lawsuit-1.5661097,"Ontario Provincial Police officers allegedly falsified their notes to justify a racially influenced violent takedown of two First Nations brothers in Orillia, Ont., that was caught on cellphone video, according to a lawsuit filed in an Ontario court this week.

The lawsuit, seeking $400,000 in damages, names the Ontario government, two identified OPP officers and a number of unknown officers. It was filed in Toronto on Wednesday.

It alleges that the two officers, acting on a report that a ""Native male"" had fallen off a bicycle, illegally assaulted Randall May, 57, of Nipissing First Nation, and Aaron Keeshig, 50, of Neyaashiinigmiing First Nation.

The lawsuit also alleges that an OPP officer, assigned to investigate a complaint over the incident filed by May, offered to have May's charges dropped if he abandoned the complaint, according to the statement of claim.

The legal action comes at a time of heightened awareness of racial profiling by the police against Black and Indigenous people and amid worldwide protests over recent high-profile incidents of police brutality.

In Canada, two Indigenous people were shot and killed by police in New Brunswick within a span of eight days in June. Chantal Moore, 26, was killed by police in Edmunston during a wellness check at her home while Rodney Levi, 48, of Metepenagiag First Nation, was fatally shot by the RCMP.

The incident involving the OPP in Orillia unfolded in the front yard and driveway of May's home and was captured in cellphone video that was obtained by CBC News.

""In order to justify the illegal assault, detention and arrest, the police falsified police notes, falsely accused both brothers of offences they did not commit and wrongly charged Mr. May of assaulting police,"" said the statement of claim, filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

(Ousama Farag/CBC News)

""Mr. May and Mr. Keeshig, who are both First Nations men, assert that the illegal, violent and entirely unjustified treatment they suffered was the result of racial profiling, racial bias and discrimination.""

The OPP said in a statement it couldn't comment on ongoing litigation.

However, its statement said that the OPP's professional standards bureau investigated the complaint filed by May in February 2019, at the direction of the police watchdog, the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD).

The statement said the internal investigation concluded that the allegations were ""unsubstantiated"" and that the findings were relayed by the OIPRD to May. The file was closed in May 2019, the OPP's statement said.

The police force hasn't yet filed a statement of defence because it was just served with the lawsuit.

Lawsuit alleges man was repeatedly Tasered

May told CBC News he doesn't remember ever receiving the results of the investigation from the OIPRD.

The lawsuit claims he suffered the worst during the takedown. He was thrown to the ground, punched and repeatedly Tasered to the point where he lost control of his bodily functions, according to the statement of claim.

""I could hear myself screaming,"" May said in an interview with CBC News outside his home, at the spot where the incident occurred on Sept. 15, 2018.

It was sunny that Saturday evening when May and Keeshig returned on their bicycles from a restaurant to May's home, which sits on a lot surrounded by thick bushes and trees on a dead-end street.

May said he was walking his bicycle and crossing his driveway when he noticed an OPP cruiser pull up and an officer emerge.

""I had no idea what they were doing here,"" he said.

""He grabbed my bike and I said, 'What are you doing? You're on private property.' And he said that he got a complaint [that] some Native man walking down the road fell off his bike.""

Cellphone video shows incident

Cellphone video, recorded by May's relative, Jessie Fancy, captured what happened next.

The video shows one officer, identified as Sgt. Mark Connor, shoving May into the bushes as Keeshig arrived, walking his bike.

Connor then told Keeshig to ""back off"" as May struggled to his feet, according to the video.

Keeshig inched closer and Connor repeated his warning.

""Don't be rough on my bro,"" Keeshig said, according to the video.

Aaron Keeshig, outside his brother Randall May's home near Orillia, Ont., says he knew that if he resisted police, it could have been much worse. (Ousama Farag/CBC News)

Sirens are heard in the background as Connor pushes Keeshig back before turning his attention to May. The sound of a Taser cracks in the air.

A second officer, Const. Andrew Markle, then appeared, grabbed Keeshig by the arm and flipping him to the gravel driveway.

""Get on the ground,"" Markle is heard saying as he pinned Keeshig down and handcuffed him.

Markle then moved to back up Connor, who yelled at May to ""stop resisting"" and ""put your hands behind your back.""

The sound of Taser charges are audible, along with May's screams.

""Now they're punching him,"" Fancy is heard saying on the video.

""Connor continued to shock Mr. May with successive rounds shot from his Taser while Mr. May lay prone and defenceless on the ground.... At least one of the police officers yanked the Taser barbs out of Mr. May's skin before shooting him again,"" the statement of claim said.

""Connor and ... Markle then began to punch Mr. May repeatedly, while one of them yelled 'put your hand behind your back or I will Taser you again!'""

The lawsuit alleges that May was Tasered so many times that he became incontinent.

""They threw me in the back of this car and I guess I was just full of excrement,"" he said.

May said the OPP did not provide him with a change of clothes or any blankets while he was in the holding cell overnight. He was forced to wash his soiled clothes in the toilet bowl, which he couldn't flush, he said.

""I basically slept beside my own excrement,"" May said.

""I guess they were trying to humiliate me.""

Charges withdrawn by the Crown

May was charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest, along with two counts under the Liquor Licence Act of being intoxicated in a public place and having open liquor.

His criminal charges were withdrawn by the Crown in November 2018 and his liquor charges were withdrawn in April 2019.

Keeshig faced charges under the Liquor Licence Act of being intoxicated in a public place and having open liquor. He was convicted after an administrative error, but the conviction was overturned in March 2019.

The statement of claim alleges that the officers ""illegally"" detained May and Keeshig, and they never informed either man of the reason for their arrest. The document said the brothers were the victims of ""assault and battery"" at the hands of the officers.

""The force was excessive, unreasonable and not justifiable at law,"" the statement of claim said.

It also alleges that the officers ""falsified their police notes and other official records,"" claiming May was in a fighting stance, put up his fist, was aggressive and pushed Connor.

Aaron Keeshig shows some of the injuries he sustained by the Ontario Provincial Police on Sept. 15, 2018. (Courtesy of Randall May)

""Any resistance to the detention and arrest was passive in nature and was justified in law by the fact that ... Connor had no grounds to arrest or detain Mr. May and therefore had no grounds to use force against him,"" the statement of claim said.

The document alleges that the officers falsely claimed that Keeshig fell off his bike when he arrived at May's home and was carrying an open can of beer. The video clearly shows he was walking his bike when he arrived and was not holding a can of beer, which the statement of claim also alleges.

The officers also falsely alleged that Keeshig tried to interfere with the arrest, according to the statement of claim.

""Keeshig was never anywhere near Mr. May and fully complied with the instructions to stay back,"" said the statement of claim, an assertion largely supported by the cellphone video.

Keeshig said in an interview he knew that if he resisted, it could have been much worse.

""I'd imagine if I would have stood up for myself ... I probably would've got shot, too, maybe not with a Taser gun either, probably a real gun,"" he said.

Officer allegedly offered deal

The statement of claim alleges that after May filed a complaint with the OIPRD about his treatment, the police watchdog asked the OPP to investigate, and the provincial police turned the matter over to its professional standards bureau.

One of the officers assigned to the file then offered May a quid pro quo, the lawsuit claims.

""One OPP officer even went so far as to offer to withdraw Mr. May's criminal charges if he in turn would withdraw the OIPRD complaint,"" the statement of claim said.

The document alleges that the officers assigned to investigate ""began harassing Mr. May and pressuring him to drop the complaint.""

The OIPRD said it couldn't comment due to privacy laws.

Promise Holmes Skinner, the Toronto-based lawyer for Randall May and Aaron Keeshig, said she believes the OPP's violent takedown of the brothers was influenced by racism. (Ousama Farag/CBC News)

May and Keeshig's Toronto-based lawyer, Promise Holmes Skinner, said she believes racism clearly played a role in the officer's actions.

""There is no doubt in my mind that if Randy was a white man, none of this would have happened,"" Holmes-Skinner said.

""It's so unbelievable that a group of officers in broad daylight would attack a random Indigenous man for literally no reason and go onto his property and sort of engage in a gang-style beating.""",JustBadNews,0
AT&T tells customers to change their phones or they won't work anymore,http://androidpolice.com/2020/07/22/att-tells-customers-to-change-their-phones-or-they-wont-work-anymore/,"Amid an economy-crushing pandemic, AT&T decided that now was a good time to send a scaremongering email to many of its customers, claiming that their phone ""is not compatible with the new network and you need to replace it to continue receiving service."" The email conveniently omits that this message is regarding a change that won't take place until February 2022, providing only a link that later calls out this change linked to the decommissioning of AT&T's legacy 3G network.

The tone and language of the email make it sound like customers should buy a new phone via the carrier straight away: It advertises that AT&T makes ""getting a new device online easy,"" detailing various free and fast shipping options. Oh boy, free shipping on your new $1000 smartphone! Even a technically savvy person could be easily confused by this email, and it's easy to see how an elderly person might look at it and effectively get scared into purchasing a new phone immediately.

The notice is poorly worded enough that an AT&T subscriber asked if it was a scam AT&T's forums, since they own a relatively recent Galaxy S10e. Other customers even agreed that it's likely not a genuine email until someone eventually pointed to the support page that AT&T linked to through the ""Learn more"" button. It details that in February 2022, the carrier will turn off its 3G network, which will make some phones lose the ability to make voice calls.

You might think that this isn't a widespread issue since most modern phones support 4G data and calling (or HDVoice, as AT&T calls it). However, AT&T whitelists a small number of handsets it directly sells to customers for 4G voice calling, and it looks like identical non-carrier phones don't necessarily work with the carrier's HDVoice service, like the aforementioned Galaxy S10e.

AT&T does certify some popular unlocked smartphones as compatible with HD Voice, and you can find a list of them in this PDF on the carrier's website. Still, that list claims the unlocked S10e is supposed to be compatible with AT&T's HDVoice, despite the fact that an owner of said phone received this email stating otherwise. We're not sure if the email was mistakenly sent out to the S10e owner or if the list in the document is outdated (or has never been accurate). Either way, depending on how many handsets AT&T deems incompatible, this email might have gone out to a significant number of subscribers.

When we did reach out to AT&T, the company provided us with the following statement:

“This email was one of many planned to keep customers informed about the shutdown of our 3G network in early 2022. It should have included the date that certain devices would no longer be supported. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused and will be more clear in future updates.”

When asked to clarify why the message was sent to some subscribers with phones that appear to support HD Voice, the carrier only reiterated that users who ""have a device that does not support HD Voice on our network or that requires 3G"" should have received the notice."" If you're still confused about your handset's fate, AT&T advises subscribers to contact customer care. You can also check out our quick how-to to determine if you're phone actually can use VoLTE on AT&T's network.

Still, for those phones actually affected, AT&T could easily whitelist modern non-carrier devices like the S10e and the Nokia 6.1 (and why not even older ones like the OnePlus 5) so they could continue working on the network in 2022. Let's hope no one ends up feeling pressured into getting a new phone right now involuntarily.

So there you have it: If you've received this email, you have more than a year and a half to upgrade your current phone. And in a best-case scenario, you received the email in mistake and your phone actually does work on AT&T's VoLTE. AT&T should strongly consider whitelisting more devices regardless, which would allow more customers to keep their handsets longer without switching to another carrier like T-Mobile (who will soon be deactivating their own 3G voice network).",JustBadNews,0

'Junk food is the new tobacco': experts call for restrictions to tackle obesity | Scientists and health campaigners want bans on outlets near schools and an advertising watershed,http://theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/19/junk-food-is-the-new-tobacco-experts-call-for-restrictions-to-tackle-obesity?s=09,"Ministers should regulate processed food as heavily as tobacco to tackle the “massive national challenge” of the UK’s obesity crisis, health experts have warned.

They have urged severe restrictions on supermarket promotions of processed foods, and bans on fast food outlets near schools, and TV adverts for pizzas, burgers and similar foods before 9pm. One campaign group even urged the government to consider plain packaging for processed food.

The calls come as Boris Johnson prepares to unveil a “war on obesity”, after weight was identified as a major factor in deaths from Covid-19. In England, 64% of adults are overweight or obese and Johnson has said his time in intensive care after contracting the virus – when he weighed more than 17 stone – has changed his “libertarian” views on food and obesity.

The government is now preparing measures – likely to be announced before the end of the month – to tackle obesity in Britain before a possible second wave of coronavirus infections.

A range of health experts told the Observer that every possible method of tackling the crisis should be included in the package.

Human beings like high-calorie, high-salt, high-fat items. You are fighting against 5 million years of evolution Richard Murray, King’s Fund

“Think what was done with tobacco,” said Richard Murray, chief executive of the King’s Fund. “Don’t let it brand, limit how much can be sold, tax it – use every possible route. You’re not going to find the magic bullet right away, but there’s got to be a genuine recognition that this is a massive national challenge.”

Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of over 40 charities, medical royal colleges and campaign groups, warned that it has now become difficult for people to resist the relentless bombardment of adverts for sugary, calorific foods on TV and online.

“The plan must address the environmental drivers of obesity, with a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV and online, and controls on how and where unhealthy food can be marketed. We have to take junk food out of the spotlight.”

Other proposals put forward by health experts include closing down fast food outlets near schools, the creation of more cycle lanes, banning sweets at checkouts, outlawing discount deals on alcohol; making restaurants publish the calorific content of items in their menus and extending sugar taxes to milky drinks.

Campaigners also point to the success of past efforts such as the 2018 levy on soft drinks, which forced manufacturers to either pay a levy or reduce sugar levels, and resulted in a 28.8% fall in the amount of sugar in fizzy drinks.

“The sugar tax was an innovation – it worked well,” Murray said. “You’ve just got to do a lot more of it, and that could include controlling, through taxation, the calorific content of food and the quality of the food itself. So a tax could be levied on saturated fat or calories.”

Income is also an issue, health experts warned last week. “Healthy foods are not necessarily more expensive than processed food,” said Emma Boyland of Liverpool University. “You can buy frozen fruit and vegetables quite cheaply. However you need the facilities to keep them frozen and to cook them, and that is not always possible.”

Murray agreed: “You don’t want lower-income people having to pay more, so that might argue for a subsidy. The market is not going to do this. Human beings like high-calorie, high-salt, high-fat items. You are fighting against 5 million years of evolution, after all. So you cannot expect each supermarket or food manufacturer to have a go on their own. The law of the market is going to punish them. We need everybody to do it, and that argues for central government action.”

Susan Jebb, professor of diet and population health at Oxford University, said the time had come to start treating obesity as a problem akin to smoking.

“GPs are now quite happy to urge people to stop smoking and offer support services that could help them quit. They need to do the same for the obese and the overweight and offer support for people to lose weight. And patients need to know this is an issue they can raise with doctors and can expect to get help.”

Amsterdam’s experience

Amsterdam set up a scheme in 2012 to tackle obesity after a fifth of its children were found to be overweight. Within three years, the number of overweight and obese children had dropped by 12%. Measures included:

Banning fruit juice from schools and only allowing water and milk.

No sponsorship from fast-food firms.

Parents asked to stop using pushchairs and start putting children on pedal-less balance bikes.

A team of 100 focusing on the first 1,000 days of every child’s life

Subsidised gym and sports centre membership for low-income families

Cooking classes to create healthier versions of traditional recipes

Fast food outlets asked not to serve children without an adult present

UK obesity policies



David Cameron

In 2015, after lobbying from Jamie Oliver, Cameron looked at creating a sugar tax on soft drinks, banning TV advertising of junk food before 9pm and limiting supermarket promotions. But he only had time to create the Soft Drinks Industry Levy before the EU referendum forced his resignation.

Theresa May

May was persuaded to press ahead with the sugar tax, and drew up plans for a ban on the sale of high energy drinks to under 16s. That was also left on the shelf after her resignation last year.

Boris Johnson

The prime minister decried “sin stealth taxes” when he entered number 10 and hinted that he would repeal the sugar tax. Now, shaken by his own covid-19 experience, Johnson is now considering major changes to food regulations.",JustBadNews,0
Pakistani teacher raped 132 students and is said to have made videos of the activities,http://incpak.com/national/sindh/thari-mirwah-rape-scandal/,"SINDH: Thari Mirwah rape scandal has shaken the hearts and souls of people. A teacher is being accused of raping 132 students in different time periods.

The retired teacher is being identified as Sarang Shar, who gave private tuition to children in Khairpur Mirs Tehsil, Sindh. The horrendous news and videos are going viral on social media.

It is being said the teacher was involved in raping his students and also groomed them for group sex. He also made videos of the activities and blackmailed the students.

Sarang Shar teacher involved in Thari Mirwah Rape Scandal

Sarang Shar raped students under the pretext teaching them

The activities have been going on for years under the pretext of giving tuition to innocent students.

Thari Mirwah Rape Scandal occurred in the Thari Mirwah Tehsil of Khairpur Mirs where a retired Grade-17 teacher from Nebao Mohalla was involved in sexually abusing his students under the guise of tuition center.

The teacher Sarang Shar is believed to have been carrying out these heinous activities for the past several years. He is accused of doing group sex with many of his innocent students and recording it.

He has been grooming his students to have group sex with each other and making videos of the activities to blackmail them.

According to reports it has come to light that the local police have been receiving many complaints from the local residents, the police have not been able to take any action against Sarang Shar as he is said to be influential. Some claim he works for the dark web.

It is being said that the SSP Kairpur, Amir Saud Magsi has just registered a minor FIR of this major case due to the culprit being influential.

Thari Mirwah Rape Scandal

On questioning the SSP about the case, he said so far only one complaint is received from the father of a 6-grade student whose age is around 11 or 12 years. The student is named Sahil Sammo and the father’s name is Zahid Sammo. The complaint has been registered and investigations are going on at present. However, no arrests were made.

Efforts are being made to cover up the case due to the incompetency of the police and the influence of the accused teacher. Social organizations have expressed their major concern over the case.

Sarang Shar who retired a few years back is actually the resident of Faizganj Tehsil of Khairpur Mirs. According to SHO he was previously involved in the same activities and had to move to Thari Mirwah to take refuge. He moved here ten to fifteen years back. The accused teacher is said to have vacated his house and fled ones again. The search is going on to arrest the teacher.

A little student has been raped by retired School teacher named Sarang Shar at Thari Mirwah

He raped 132 students in different Time period #ThariMirWah #Raped #Case — Nisar Banbhan (@NisarBanbhan) July 16, 2020

The investigations have revealed that Sarang is a known social figure in the area. He has made himself visible in all social and educational movements. He was the chief executive of Government School Teacher’s Organization and also founded several social organizations in the past. It is obvious that any complaints against him would have gone in vain.

The police information further revealed that his son and brothers were aware of his activities and strongly opposed him. Many complaints were received by the police in the past but somehow the plaintiffs withdrew their complaints themselves. Zahid Sammo who is father of one of the victim said we sent our children for tuition because he was a senior and respected teacher of the area. We did not know there was a devil inside a teacher. He also said many parents are silent out of respect for the profession of teacher.

Hang The Rapist !

"Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk just had their Twitter accounts hacked in apparent crypto scam",http://geekwire.com/2020/bill-gates-elon-musk-just-twitter-accounts-hacked-apparent-bitcoin-scam/,"Hackers gained access to the Twitter accounts of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and many others Wednesday afternoon in an apparent cryptocurrency giveaway scam. Other accounts including Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Apple, Uber, and Square’s CashApp were also hacked.

Mom gets 5 weeks in prison for son's online class cheating,http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/mom-weeks-prison-sons-online-class-cheating-71796302,"Ex-Canadian football player gets 3 months for college scam A former Canadian Football League player has been sentenced to three months in prison for hiring someone take the SATs in place of his two sons as part of the college admissions cheating scheme

A former Canadian Football League player was sentenced Wednesday to three months in prison for hiring someone take the SATs in place of his two sons, while a California mother got five weeks behind bars for paying $9,000 to have online classes taken on her son’s behalf.

David Sidoo, who played professional football for the Saskatchewan Roughriders and BC Lions, lowered his head into his hands and cried as U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton chided him for his actions. Sidoo told the judge he's “deeply ashamed.""

“I make no excuses. I broke the law. I pled guilty to a crime and now I must pay for my actions,” Sidoo said.

Earlier Wednesday, Karen Littlefair of Newport Beach, California, asked U.S District Judge Allison Burroughs for leniency before being sentenced to more than a month in prison for the online course scam. Littlefair said she was “truly sorry” and called the experience a “nightmare” for her family.

“I acted out of love for my son but I ended up hurting my son greatly,” said Littlefair, 57.

Both Sidoo and Littlefair appeared before the Boston federal court judges via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic.

They are among more than 50 people charged in the college cheating scheme involving wealthy parents and athletic coaches at elite universities across the country. Authorities say the parents worked with the admissions consultant at the center of the scam, Rick Singer, to have someone cheat on their kids’ exams or get them admitted to selective schools with fake athletic credentials.

Sidoo was CEO of mining firm Advantage Lithium Corp. when he was arrested last year. He was also a founding shareholder of an oil and gas company that was sold in 2010 for more than $600 million.

The Vancouver businessman paid Singer $200,000 to have someone pose as his sons using a fake ID to secure higher scores on their SATs, prosecutors said. Sidoo also worked with Singer to craft an admission essay for his son with a bogus story about the teen being held at gunpoint by Los Angeles gang members and saved by a rival gang member named “Nugget,” prosecutors said.

After Littlefair’s son was put on academic probation by Georgetown University, she hired Singer’s company to take four online classes on his behalf so he could graduate in 2018, prosecutors said. Three of the courses were taken through Georgetown, prosecutors said, while one was taken online at Arizona State University and then transferred to Georgetown.

Littlefair demanded a discount on the cheating after the person earned a C in one of the courses, authorities said.

“Kind of thought there would have been a discount on that one. The grade was a C and the experience was a nightmare,” she told Singer’s accountant in an email, according to court documents.

Burroughs told Littlefair she taught her son “it’s OK to cheat, it’s OK to take shortcuts.”

“You’re supposed to get more by earning it and working for it and I think that’s a lesson your son needs to learn and sadly he’s going to learn it the hard way here,” the judge said.

Nearly 30 parents have pleaded guilty in the case.

Others include “Full House” actor Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who admitted to paying half a million dollars to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake crew recruits.

They are scheduled to be sentenced next month. If the judge accepts their plea deals, Loughlin will be sentenced to two months in prison and Giannulli will be sentenced to five months.",JustBadNews,0
A man dies after attending 'Covid Party' that was hosted by an infected person.,http://asiatimes.com/2020/07/us-man-dies-after-attending-covid-party/,"A 30-year-old man from Texas died from the new coronavirus after attending a “Covid-19” party hosted by an infected person, a doctor has revealed, underlining the risk to younger people.

Jane Appleby, chief medical officer at the Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, said the man thought the virus was a hoax, despite it killing more than 135,000 people in the United States so far.

“Someone will be diagnosed with the disease, and they’ll have a party to invite their friends over to see if they can beat the disease,” Appleby said in a video broadcast by US media on Sunday.

“One of the things that was heart-wrenching that he said to his nurse was, ‘You know, I think I made a mistake.’

“He thought the disease was a hoax. He thought he was young and invincible and wouldn’t get affected by the disease.”

Appleby said young patients often do not realize how sick they are.

“They don’t look really sick. But when you check their oxygen levels and their lab tests, they’re really sicker than they appear,” she said, calling on people to take the risks seriously.

The Trump administration on Sunday again pressed for full school reopenings in the fall, even as resurgent coronavirus infections – many of them blamed on younger people – and a record spike in cases in Florida raise further questions about the country’s efforts to quell the disease.

The United States has by far the world’s highest caseload and number of deaths.

France has been struck by two terror attacks within hours of each other as three people were killed – two of them beheaded – in an attack inside a church in Nice before a gunman was shot dead by police in Avignon.

By: Daily Mail, October 29, 2020:

The first attack began around 9am at the Notre Dame basilica in Nice where a knifeman beheaded an elderly female parishioner and a male church warden, fatally stabbed a second woman, wounded several others, and was then shot and arrested by police.

Two hours later, a gunman threatened people on the streets of Avignon – 120 miles from Nice – while shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ before he was fatally shot by police.

A security guard was also stabbed and wounded outside the French consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, while two other men were arrested after being found in public with knives.

The attacks come amid fury across the Islamic world at President Macron for defending satirical cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, and on the day that Sunni Muslims mark the Prophet’s birthday.

It also comes less than two weeks after a schoolteacher, Samuel Paty, was beheaded north of Paris for showing cartoons of the Prophet to his class in a lesson on free speech.

An elderly woman who had come to the church early to pray was the first to be beheaded before a male church warden was also killed. A third woman was then stabbed multiple times, ran across the street, and died of her injuries

Police who stormed the basilica said the body of the first woman was found close to the font. The suspect is believed to be a man in his 20s who gave his name as ‘Brahim’

Police swarmed the area around 9am, running into the church before the attacker was shot and arrested. Mayor Christian Estrosi said the attacker kept shouting Allahu Akbar even after being medicated

In Sartrouville, north of Paris, a man was arrested around 1pm after his father called police and said his son had left home and planned ‘to do as in Nice.’

Muslims ‘have a right to kill French people’, ex Malaysian PM says

Malaysia’s former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has said that Muslims have a right ‘to kill millions of French people’, shortly after a knife-wielding man launched a deadly attack in Nice.

Mahathir – who was prime minister of Muslim-majority Malaysia until his government collapsed in February – launched his extraordinary outburst on Twitter.

Referring to the beheading of a French teacher who showed pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, Mahathir said he did not approve of that attack but that freedom of expression does not include ‘insulting other people’.

‘Irrespective of the religion professed, angry people kill,’ said the outspoken 95-year-old, who has in the past drawn controversy for remarks attacking Jews and the LGBT community.

‘The French in the course of their history has killed millions of people. Many were Muslims. Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past.’

Police stopped the man in his car near a local church, and Le Parisien reports that he was in possession of a knife. The car was searched, but nothing else was found.

Meanwhile in Lyon, an Afghan man in his 20s was arrested while trying to board a tram carrying a long knife. The man was known to French intelligence services.

In the Nice attack, the first victim – a woman in her seventies – was attacked after coming there early to pray and was found ‘almost beheaded’ close to the church font.

A 45-year-old sacristan, named locally as Vincent L, a father-of-two, was then attacked and also beheaded.

A third woman – described as of African origin and aged in her 30s – was then stabbed ‘multiple times’ and managed to flee to a bar across the street, where she died.

Police were called and arrived at 9.10am. They stormed the basilica, shooting and arresting the attacker.

The attacker is a man in his 20s who gave his name as Brahim while being arrested, Le Figaro reported. His identity is being checked by police.

Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi said the attacker ‘kept shouting Allahu Akbar even after being medicated’, and that ‘the meaning of his gesture is not in doubt’.

‘Enough is enough,’ he said. ‘It’s time now for France to exonerate itself from the laws of peace in order to definitively wipe out Islamo-fascism from our territory.’

Estrosi said the victims had been killed in a ‘horrible way’. ‘The methods match, without doubt, those used against the brave teacher in Conflans Sainte Honorine, Samuel Paty,’ he said.

He also called for churches around France to be given extra protection or closed as a precaution.

In Avignon, a man armed with a handgun began threatening people in the Montfavet around 11.15am while shouting Allahu Akbar, France1 reported.

Police rushed to the scene and confronted the man, who refused to drop his weapon. Police then shot the man with a Taser, which failed to stop him, so they opened fire with live ammunition, killing him.

French anti-terror investigators have announced they are leading the probe into the attack in Nice, but have not yet taken up the investigation in Avignon.

Meanwhile in Saudi Arabia, a man was arrested after stabbing a guard at the French consulate with ‘a sharp tool’. The attacker was arrested while the guard was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

France’s embassy in Riyadh condemned the ‘attack on diplomatic premises which can never be justified’.

French diplomats also called on Saudi authorities to ‘shed light on this attack’ and ensure the safety of French people in the kingdom.

‘We call on our colleagues in Saudi Arabia to show maximum vigilance,’ the embassy said after Saudi security forces apprehended the suspect, who is said to be a Saudi national in his 40s.

The Nice attack happened less than half a mile from where another attacker plowed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in 2016, killing dozens.

Emmanuel Macron led an emergency cabinet meeting on the attack before leaving for Nice, where he is expected to arrive shortly.

French politicians were taking part in a debate on the country’s new coronavirus restrictions when news of the attack reached them.

They observed a minute of silence before the debate broke up so an emergency security meeting could be held.

After the meeting, Prime Minister Jean Castex moved the threat level from ‘risk of attack’ to the ’emergency level’, meaning threats are imminent.",JustBadNews,0

Nepal bans Indian news channels for running propaganda,http://thenations.co.uk/news/nepal-bans-indian-news-channels-for-running-propaganda,"Nepal has banned all Indian news channels except the state-run Doordarshan, reports in Indian media said on Thursday.

The Nepal government is yet to release an official order on the move but sources quoted by a number of media organizations say that the move has come in the wake of unfounded reports on Nepal carried by some of the Indian news channels, including their defamatory shows on the Nepali Prime Minister.

We have turned off the signals of the Indian Channels from this evening, Dhruba Sharma of Mega Max TV, a Nepal channel operator told news agency ANI.

Nepali Cable TV providers tell ANI, signals for Indian news channels have been switched off in the country. No official government order of the same till now. — ANI (@ANI) July 9, 2020

The upper house of Nepal’s Parliament last month approved a new map for the country, including some land controlled by India.

India, which controls the region a slice of land including Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh, and Kalapani areas in the northwest had rejected the map, saying it is not based on historical facts or evidence.

Since the development, some Indian channels have done anti-Nepal shows including one which insulted Nepal’s Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli.

Amazon says it will not ban TikTok from employee phones,http://theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320196/amazon-employees-tiktok-uninstall-email-trump-administration-pompeo-ban,"Amazon says that it will not ask employees to remove popular social video-sharing app TikTok from their mobile devices, despite sending an email calling for workers to delete the app earlier on Friday.

As first reported by The New York Times on Friday, Amazon asked employees to remove TikTok from their mobile devices, citing security risks. An Amazon spokesperson told The Verge on Friday that the email was “sent in error.”

“This morning’s email to some of our employees was sent in error,” the Amazon spokesperson said. “There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok.”

“Due to security risks, the TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email,” the company said in the initial email to employees on Friday morning. “If you have TikTok on your device, you must remove it by 10-Jul to retain mobile access to Amazon email. At this time, using TikTok from your Amazon laptop browser is allowed.” The email was obtained and independently published by multiple reporters on Twitter.

TikTok was recently caught accessing user clipboard data when running in the background, potentially exposing passwords or other sensitive data. The behavior was revealed because of a new feature in iOS 14, and it’s unclear how long it had been present in the app. TikTok has since removed the feature, but the privacy scare underscored long-standing privacy concerns over the app, which is owned by China-based ByteDance.

Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the Trump administration is “looking at” banning TikTok. It’s not entirely clear how the administration could go about banning the app, and it has yet to act on Pompeo’s statement. Still, the confusion and recent glitches have thrown the TikTok community into a state of confusion worrying about whether the app will be removed in the US.

A TikTok spokesperson responded to Amazon’s decision to order employees to remove the app, saying in a statement: “While Amazon did not communicate to us before sending their email, and we still do not understand their concerns, we welcome a dialogue so we can address any issues they may have and enable their team to continue participating in our community.”

Update July 10th, 4:56PM ET: An earlier version of this piece reported that Amazon had banned TikTok from employee phones based on an email sent out to employees. The company confirmed the authenticity of that email, but told The Verge after publication that the message was “sent in error.” Large portions of this article have been changed to reflect our new understanding of the company’s policy.",JustBadNews,0
Three LAPD officers face felony charges for falsely labeling people as gang members,http://nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/three-lapd-officers-face-felony-charges-falsely-labeling-people-gang-n1233412,"LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles County prosecutors have filed dozens of felony charges against three LAPD officers suspected of falsely labeling innocent motorists and pedestrians they stopped as gang members.

Braxton Shaw, Michael Coblentz, and Nicholas Martinez were notified Thursday that they were to surrender in court early Friday, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

According to a 59-count criminal complaint, the three were charged with conspiracy, filing false reports, and preparing fraudulent documents for court. It was not immediately clear how many of each of the charges applied to each officer.

The three defendants are accused of falsifying cards used by officers to conduct interviews while in the field.

In some instances, the defendants allegedly wrote on the card that a person admitted to being a gang member even though body-worn camera video showed the defendants never asked the individual about gang membership, prosecutors said.

In other instances, the defendants allegedly wrote that a person admitted to being a gang member though the person had denied gang affiliation.

Shaw is accused of falsifying 43 field interview cards. Coblentz is accused of falsifying seven cards and Martinez is accused of falsifying two cards.

If convicted, Shaw faces up to 31 years and eight months in county jail, while Coblentz faces up to seven years and eight months and Martinez faces up to four years and four months.

“Public trust is the bedrock of community policing and these allegations shake that foundation,"" said LAPD Chief Michel Moore in a statement. “The actions of these few tarnish the badge we all wear. The Department is committed to continuing this comprehensive investigation in our effort to restore the confidence of the people we protect and serve.”

There are currently 21 additional officers under investigation by detectives from the LAPD's Internal Affairs Group. Ten are assigned to home pending the outcome of the investigation, eight are assigned administrative duties and five remain in the field. One has retired since the investigation began.

NBC Los Angeles first reported in January that more than a dozen LAPD officers were under investigation for allegedly submitting field interview reports that falsely labeled people they questioned as gang members, data that was later added to a statewide law enforcement database of gang intelligence information called ""CalGang.""

Chief Moore ordered officers last month to stop using the system, and was expected to announce a reorganization of the department that included changes to the Metropolitan Division, where two of the charged officers worked, and the size of its staff.

""Based on recent audits and ongoing complaint investigations, the accuracy of the database has been called into question,"" Moore wrote in an internal memo obtained by NBC News.

""To strengthen community trust and avoid any adverse impact on individuals, particularly in communities of color, the Department has enacted a complete moratorium on the use of the CalGang System,"" Moore wrote.

CalGang is managed by the California Department of Justice and the office of the state attorney general. Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced in February his office would begin to ""independently review"" LAPD submissions to the database, and said the LAPD could potentially lose its access to the system if widespread problems were detected.

""As we learn more, we may need to do more,"" Becerra said in February. ""We can, and will, take further steps as authorized under AB-90, including suspending or revoking LAPD's access to the CalGang database.""

AB-90 was the bill that gave Becerra's office oversight of the system. The state is also in the process of revising and limiting the criteria for when a person's profile can be added to the database.

The LAPD was also expected to announce organizational changes Friday following the false entry investigation and complaints from community groups and activists that Metropolitan Division officers had been pulling over a disproportionate number of Black and Hispanic drivers during crime suppression patrols in South L.A.

The law enforcement sources said those changes could include the removal of large groups of officers, called platoons, from Metro Division and their reassignment to neighborhood police stations or other roles.

In internal memo obtained by KNBC, Capt, LeLand Sands told Metro Division officers, ""I want you to know that no decisions have been made for the future of Metro.""

""At this point, it's simply speculation on the part of everyone.""

Only one officer suspected in the falsified data investigation had been publicly identified before now. A criminal case against officer Braxton Shaw was submitted to prosecutors early in 2020 and Chief Moore confirmed that the same officer would be sent to an internal administrative trial, called a Board of Rights.

Shaw was previously investigated in 2016 after his courtroom testimony in an unrelated matter appeared to conflict with a video recording from a camera mounted in a patrol car. No action was taken against Shaw in that case.

Shaw and the other officers under investigation were assigned to the ""C-Platoon"" of the LAPD's Metro Division. The unit was rapidly expanded in 2015 and often dispatched to conduct street patrols in areas of South Los Angeles that had experienced spikes in crime.

Multiple law enforcement sources told KNBC that Metro Division officers had been pressured by their commanders to show that their patrols were productive.

Officers assembled daily statistics about the number of people they stopped and questioned, the number of contacts with gang members, the number of arrests, and other metrics. Each day's statistics was captured for analysis by LAPD executives, and the sources said officers were told, ""the more gang contacts the better.""

Chief Moore and other LAPD officials have denied there was pressure to produce any particular type of statistics, and Moore has said the motive behind submitting the alleged false reports wasn't clear.",JustBadNews,0
California man who posted regret for attending party died a day later of coronavirus,http://nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1232675,"A California man posted his regret on Facebook about contracting the coronavirus after he attended a party in June. A day later, he died from COVID-19.

On June 20, Thomas Macias, wrote an impassioned message on Facebook in which he lamented ignoring social distancing guidance.

Thomas Macias died of complications from the coronavirus.

""Some of you may know, but most don't,"" Macias, 51, wrote. ""I ... went out a couple of weeks ago"" and contracted the coronavirus.

Macias, who was a truck driver, expressed guilt for having possibly exposed his family to the virus.

""Because of my stupidity I put my mom and sisters and my family's health in jeopardy,"" he wrote. ""This has been a very painful experience.""

""Hopefully with God's help,"" he added, ""I'll be able to survive this.""

He died the next day.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

An official from the Riverside County Office of Vital Records told NBC News on Wednesday that Macias died from COVID-19.

From late March through early June, Macias was going out only when necessary, Gustavo Lopez, his brother-in-law, said in a phone interview Wednesday.

""He was quarantining because he was overweight and had diabetes,"" Lopez said.

Lopez said that sometime in early June, however — after Gov. Gavin Newsom indicated that he would loosen social distancing restrictions — Macias attended a party in Lake Elsinore, about 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, where he lived.

Afterward, a friend of Macias' who was also at the party contacted him to say he had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, Lopez said.

The friend told Macias that he was aware of the diagnosis when he attended the gathering but that because he was not showing symptoms, he did not believe he could infect anyone else.

The friend advised everyone who attended the party to get tested.

Naturally, Lopez said, Macias was upset. Still, he said, Macias took accountability for his actions, as evidenced in his Facebook post.

Lopez said that he was unsure how many people went to the party but that Macias was among more than a dozen people who contracted COVID-19.

Macias visited his sister Veronica, who is married to Lopez, at the couple's home on June 11, before he was tested. Lopez remembers being concerned for Macias after the visit.

""He did not look right,"" Lopez said. ""He was really sweaty.""

Macias, who did not marry and did not have children, soon started to feel sick and believed it was related to his diabetes.

He was tested for COVID-19 on June 16 and received a positive diagnosis on June 18. In his Facebook post two days later, Macias implored people to take the coronavirus seriously.

""This is no joke,"" he wrote. ""If you have to go out wear a mask and practice social distancing.""

He was rushed to the hospital at about 11 a.m. on June 21. He was put on a ventilator sometime from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. and died by 9 p.m., Lopez said.

""I think what he wanted people to know, this is a real thing,"" Lopez said. ""It's serious, and it kills people.""

Macias is remembered by his family as a ""good guy"" with a lot of friends.

""He would do anything for everybody,"" Lopez said. ""No questions asked.""

He is survived by his mother, two sisters, four nieces and two great-nieces.

A 14-year-old girl who fought off two rapists in India died after her two enraged attackers set her on fire, The Times of India has reported.

The middle school student was admitted to Ambedkar hospital in Raipur with burns covering 80 per cent of her body. She told police the two attackers were her school seniors before dying from injuries yesterday.

The teenager was reportedly only 650 feet away from her home, and was looking after the family goats in a field in the town of Bemetara, Chhatarpur, when she was attacked.

Bemetara Superintendent of Police, Divyang Patel, told the paper: ""As there was no one at home, the two accused approached her and tried to force themselves upon her.

""The girl was alert and she resisted with all her strength.The duo realised they failed raping her and, angered over the resistance as well as fearing she would report to police, they set her on fire.""

The two accused — aged 14 and 22 — then fled the scene, leaving the girl engulfed in flames.

Mr Patel said: ""The two accused have been taken into custody and their interrogation was underway. Further action will be taken accordingly.""

The girl's parents returned home to discover her lying unconscious in the field with burnt skin from the blaze, and immediately rushed her to hospital.

She underwent treatment and was able to give a statement to the police, in which she said the duo dragged her into a corner of the field to rape her but were aggravated by her resistance.

Medical staff were unable to save her due to the severity of her burns.

Earlier this month, in the same city of Chhatapur, the body of a four-year-old girl was dumped in a well after she was raped and murdered.

According to the most recent official figures, there were approximately 40,000 rapes reported in India in 2016; in 2018 the Indian government caved to public pressure and approved capital punishment for repeat offenders and individuals who rape children aged under 12.

Nevertheless, activists claim 40,000 is a severe underestimation, with many victims too scared to report crimes because of the threats of perpetrators, as well as the social stigma of being sexually assaulted

Activists claim the 40,000 number is just the tip of the iceberg as many victims are afraid to report the crimes due to threats by perpetrators or the social stigma attached to sexual assaults.

"Florida man charged for pointing gun, unleashing racist tirade against Black homeowner",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-man-charged-pointing-gun-unleashing-racist-tirade-against-black-n1232651,"A white man in Florida was arrested Tuesday for pointing a gun at and unleashing a racist tirade on a Black man, accusing the homeowner of stealing from his own mailbox.

Joseph Max Fucheck, 58, was booked on charges of aggravated assault with a firearm with prejudice and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, both of which are second-degree felonies, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said in a statement.

Joseph Max Fucheck. Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation

The victim, Dwayne Wynn, was across the street from his home in Miami-Dade talking to a neighbor on June 14 when Fucheck pulled up and placed something in Wynn's mailbox, the state attorney's statement said. Wynn walked across the street to see what it was and found a business card that read: “We Buy Houses…CASH!” and “We Buy Houses… FAST!” He then returned to his conversation with his neighbor.

Fucheck circled back toward Wynn in his Jeep, ""jumped out of his vehicle, and began a profanity-laced rant, stating, 'That’s not your property motherf---er! I saw you! I was down the street watching you! I saw you take that out of there. You’re just a motherf---ing nosy neighbor! Give me my card, that’s my property!'"" the statement said.

Fucheck twice lunged at Wynn before pulling out a firearm and pointed it at Wynn, the statement said. After he lowered the gun, Wynn began filming the encounter.

In the video Wynn recorded, Fucheck continued to wave the gun, referring to it: “Damn right I carry a motherf---ing gun.” He also continued to accuse Wynn of not owning his property, apparently slurring at times.

As he drove away, Fucheck shouted the N-word at Wynn and yelled: ""This is why you people get shot.” Witnesses and children watched the incident unfold.

""After speaking with all the involved witnesses and reviewing the evidence, we are alleging that but for the fact that Mr. Wynn is a black male, the entire incident would not have occurred,"" the state attorney's statement said. Fucheck is being charged under the state's hate crime law.

I’m very proud of the investigative work by our Northside District Detectives & thankful for the collaboration with @KathyFndzRundle & @fdlepio’s Miami Office in helping to bring justice to the victim in this terrible case. There’s no place for hate in #OurCounty. https://t.co/5ueB0jldfQ — Alfredo ""Freddy"" Ramirez III (@MDPD_Director) June 30, 2020

“It is sad that racism can turn the most mundane act into a confrontation with potentially violent overtones,” Rundle said in the statement. “All Mr. Wynn wanted to do was go into his mailbox for his mail. Suddenly, as the video shows, Mr. Fucheck accosted him with a barrage of ugly statements and racial slurs. This incident was about much, much more than the obnoxious behavior of an irate man arming himself and screaming at someone he did not know and had no reason to fear. With this arrest, we are alleging today that the incident was about hate and intimidation, pure and simple.""

“There is no place in our diverse County for hate and the violence that too often spawns from it,” Miami-Dade Police Department Director Alfredo Ramirez said in the statement.

Fucheck was jailed at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami-Dade County. Jail records do not indicate if bond has been set. A representative for Rundle's office could not say if Fucheck had a lawyer since he has not yet been arraigned.

Rundle's office said Fucheck is a ""convicted felon,"" but did not immediately say what crime or crimes he has previously been convicted of.

Attempts to reach Fucheck by phone were not successful Wednesday. A person who answered the phone at a real estate office he is listed as working for said Fucheck did not work there.",JustBadNews,0
"Life in prison for secession, subversion and terrorism under Hong Kong security law imposed by China",http://news.sky.com/story/life-in-prison-for-secession-subversion-and-terrorism-under-hong-kong-security-law-imposed-by-china-12018207,"China will punish anyone found guilty of secession, subversion and terrorism in Hong Kong to life in prison under the territory's new national security law.

Details of the controversial new law released today reveal those found guilty of ""colluding with foreign forces"" will also face the harshest possible sentences.

The legislation came into effect at 3pm GMT on Tuesday and will be presided over by mainland China and not Hong Kong, Chinese state media said.

It can also be used against people who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong and will ban anyone found guilty of the four crimes from standing in local elections, they added.

Critics have repeatedly expressed fears that the law will be used to target protesters and opposition politicians seen as disloyal to Beijing.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said China has ""chosen to break their promises to the people of Hong Kong"" and ""go against their obligations to the international community"" by pushing ahead with the legislation.

He previously urged China not to adopt the law and vowed to make it easier for the millions of people in Hong Kong who hold or are eligible for a British National Overseas Passport to become UK citizens.

Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong's group Demosisto, and others who led protests that overran the territory last year, have said they will dissolve as a result.

Mr Wong wrote on Twitter: ""It marks the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before.""

It sets the stage for the most radical change to life on the island territory since Britain handed it back to China in 1997.

World leaders have warned it will see the beginning of a new authoritarian era and will crush the freedoms of the global financial hub.

Details of new security law worse than the most pessimistic feared

Analysis by Tom Cheshire, Asia correspondent

Beijing kept the details of its national security legislation for Hong Kong secret. Now they are published - only at the moment the law takes effect - it is easy to understand why.

The legislation is perhaps more far reaching than the most pessimistic feared. Secession, subversion, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces now all carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.

But they are drawn incredibly widely. Terrorism includes disrupting public transport. Subversion includes disrupting and preventing central Chinese government agencies or Hong Kong government agencies from performing their duties.

And a national security committee will be established under the control of Beijing. Its operations will not be made public and its decisions cannot be challenged by Hong Kong courts.

Many of last year's protests in Hong Kong easily meet the definitions of the new national security law.

That is of course the point, to significantly raise the cost of further protests. We will see how the people of Hong Kong respond.",JustBadNews,0
"Michigan restaurant closes dining room, says angry customers not worth it",http://freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/06/29/restaurant-closes-dining-room-says-angry-customers-not-worth/3280869001/,"Dearborn Heights restaurant closes dining room, weary of battling customers over face masks

Susan Selasky | Detroit Free Press

A popular Mexican restaurant in Dearborn Heights has closed its dining room after two weeks of battling customers over rules requiring them to wear face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Mexican Fiesta went back to carryout only Monday, just two weeks after reopening its dining room. It had been closed under the state's stay home orders during the pandemic.

""Unfortuately, there were multiple situations where our staff was disrespected and treated rudely,"" the restaurant said in announcing the decision on its Facebook page. ""The safety of our customers and staff is our No. 1 priority so we have made the tough decision of closing our doors to the general public until further notice.""

The Facebook post has more than 500 comments with many saddened, but praising the restaurant for its decision.

Sam Alvarado, manager of the family-owned and operated restaurant, said its staff has encountered verbal insults, mainly stemming from people upset about and not wanting to wear a mask into the building.

Alvarado said the verbal run-ins including customers being generally insulting, using foul language, accusing the restaurant of infringing on their rights or saying it's not medically safe.

""A very small minority of people just became really aggressive with foul language and pushing,"" Alvarado said. ""Most of our customers have been amazing. ""

The decision to close the dining room came from the owners over the weekend because everything was getting too tense, he said.

The Free Press reported last week that restaurant owners in metro Detroit say they are finding it difficult to police face mask wearing and social distancing rules as they try to keep customers and their staffs safe. The wearing of face masks in public — meant to stem the spread of the virus — has become a contentious and somewhat political issue across the country. President Donald Trump, notably, has refused to wear one.

Meanwhile, some restaurant workers say they are worried about their safety as COVID-19 case numbers have recently started spiking in other states, such as Florida and Texas.

Alvarado said he ended up calling the police on Saturday after a third-party delivery driver got physical with him when he was told he had to wear a mask.

""He didn't want to abide by the regulations we had in place,"" Alvarado said.

Alvarado said he was working the door, monitoring the number of people to come into the restaurant, directing customer traffic and ensuring that everyone was wearing a mask when the driver came in.

""He was not happy because he came into the lobby without a mask and I asked him to wait on the porch, but then he was barging through the front door.""

Third-party delivery drivers, Alvarado said, have to wait on the porch, not inside the building, and wear a mask.

Tempers flared.

""He got physical, really close and pushing. He was trying to barge through the doors,"" Alvarado said.

Dearborn Heights police confirmed officers were sent to the restaurant on Saturday but no report was taken.

Alvarado said the officers asked the driver to leave the property.

""I didn't press charges and didn't want to pursue it,"" Alvarado said.

The restaurant will remain open for carryout and curbside, as it has been doing during the pandemic. Alvarado said, hopefully, the restaurant will get back to dine-in as soon as possible. They plan on trying to come up with a way to handle everything that's easier on everybody.

Mexican Fiesta was founded in 1962 by Sam and Frances Alvarado. The restaurant grew, opening locations in Canton and Hartland and operated by family members.

The Dearborn Heights location is the largest with four dining rooms and seating capacity of about 300 people.

Under the reopening guidelines, Alvarado said they are operating at less than the 50% capacity permitted and they are short-staffed.

""It's really difficult to do just what we are doing as it is and trying to keep everybody safe,"" he said.

JK Rowling deletes praise for Stephen King after he declares unequivocally that trans women are women,http://pinknews.co.uk/2020/06/29/stephen-king-jk-rowling-harry-potter-trans-women-rights-andrea-dworkin-transphobia/,"A tweet from JK Rowling praising Stephen King mysteriously disappeared after he declared ""trans women are women"". (Samir Hussein/WireImage and Astrid Stawiarz/Getty)

JK Rowling has removed a tweet praising horror author Stephen King, after he unequivocally declared that trans women are women.

Rowling posted a thread on Twitter on Sunday, June 28, addressing accusations by MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle that she had “used” her experience of domestic abuse to attack trans people.

In the thread, she quoted writer Andrea Dworkin, who said: “Men often react to women’s words – speaking and writing – as if they were acts of violence; sometimes men react to women’s words with violence.”

King retweeted the quote, to which Rowling responded that her love for the The Shining author had reached “new heights”.

She wrote: “It’s so much easier for men to ignore women’s concerns, or to belittle them, but I won’t ever forget the men who stood up when they didn’t need to. Thank you, Stephen.”

Stephen King was pressed to clarify where he stood on trans rights after JK Rowling retweet.

Fans of Stephen King were alarmed by his apparent support of JK Rowling, who has doubled down on her anti-trans rhetoric in recent weeks, using Pride Month to assert that trans women are men.

But, asked by a follower to clarify his stance, King declared: “Trans women are women.”

Yes. Trans women are women. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 28, 2020

Shortly afterwards, Rowling’s tweet expressing her love for King mysteriously disappeared.

Four writers decided to leave the writing agency that represents Rowling last week after it refused to “reaffirm their stance to transgender rights and equality”.

One of the four, non-binary author Fox Fisher, told BBC Radio 4 they thought Rowling had “fallen in with the wrong crowd”.

Fisher added: “She is very scared and fearful of things when she just needs to spend some time with some transgender people who might also have been her fans.

“I think when we are not transgender we get our information from other sources including non-transgender people and I think that information can be very flawed.

“I just think that if she opened her eyes and saw that transgender women are women then we’d be able to move forward.”",JustBadNews,0
Kylie Jenner refusing to pay her starving workers in Bangladesh,http://unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/kylie-jenner-refusing-to-pay-bangladeshi-workers/53669,"Model and businesswoman Kylie Jenner has come under fire after reports emerged that the company behind her clothing line has cut work orders and reportedly refused to pay its Bangladeshi factory workers.

Kylie’s representer Global Brand Group, and rapper Cardi B’s FashionNova, cancelled orders due to the ongoing pandemic, and have cut workers in both Bangladesh and Los Angeles off with no pay, and no promise of when they'll return, reports popbuzz.com.

Reports suggest that the companies behind their clothing lines are refusing to pay workers, leaving thousands around the world ‘starving’.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles factory has so far impacted up to 50,000 women who are also ineligible for government assistance due to their immigration status.

Rick Darling, CEO of Global Brands Group, defended the move, saying that due to the pandemic, their retail partners have cancelled orders and the existing products in stock, like the products that are still in production, are not sold.

""Consequently, we’ve no other option but to make the difficult decision to cancel all S/S 2020 orders from all suppliers (without liability),"" he said.

Although it is a decision by Global Brands Group, the Jenners sisters are still the centre of criticism.

Splash Mountain's Replacing Its Racist Heritage With A Black Disney Princess,http://laist.com/2020/06/25/splash-mountain-change-theme-princess-and-the-frog-song-of-the-south.php,"Concept art for the Princess and the Frog reimagining of Splash Mountain. (Courtesy Disney)

Is it time to say so long to ""Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah""? Following renewed attention on Black representation and an online petition from fans, Disney announced that Disneyland/Disney World log ride Splash Mountain will be getting re-themed.

The ride currently uses story, characters, and songs drawn from 1946's Song of the South — a film widely seen as using racist stereotypes and which Disney has kept locked in its vault and off its Disney+ streaming service (though many of the most problematic elements aren't included in the ride).

Fans had petitioned to change the theme to that of Disney animated movie The Princess and the Frog, hitting 20,000 supporters as of two weeks ago. It looks like the Disney Imagineers were already thinking along the same lines — they've been working on the project for a year or more, according to a D23 interview with Disney Imagineer Bob Weis, though Imagineers explored a variety of new themes. The film features a Black lead in Princess Tiana, set in the New Orleans bayou — a natural fit given Splash Mountain's placement at Disneyland right next to the park's New Orleans Square.

""There is a huge need for diversity in the parks and this could help fill that need,"" the petition reads.

While already underway, conceptual design work is still in progress, according to Disney. The next step is for Imagineers to conduct preliminary reviews and develop a timeline for beginning Splash Mountain's transformation. Timelines are also still affected by the extended COVID-19 closures, Weis said.

In a press release, Disney wrote:

""The new concept is inclusive — one that all of our guests can connect with and be inspired by, and it speaks to the diversity of the millions of people who visit our parks each year.""

Weis acknowledged that not all fans may support the change. A rival petition to keep the ride the way it is has even more supporters than the original — almost 35,000 digital signatures.

""There is nothing wrong with the ride,"" the petition to keep things the same reads. ""The controversy from these stories and Song of the South comes from the depiction of the slaves and their relationships with slaveowners on the plantation. Splash Mountain removes these elements and focuses solely on the fun stories that are not racist, but merely taken from oral tales of slaves. ... The want to change the ride to be themed to something more politically correct is foolish.""

""We completely understand that these decisions aren't always popular, but I think our biggest fans know that we care as much as they do,"" Weis said.

The ride opened in 1989. Former Imagineer Tony Baxter, who's working as a creative advisor on planning and design with the Imagineering team, cited the opportunity to use animated stories that have been created since the ride's opening. It opened before the modern wave of Disney animation, Baxter noted — including 2009's The Princess and the Frog.

""Following conversations with Imagineering's leaders about the new attraction's scope and resources, I had a great sense of reassurance — the attraction will be one to be proud of,"" Baxter said.

""It's important that our guests be able to see themselves in the experiences we create,"" Walt Disney Imagineering executive Carmen Smith said in a statement.

The revamped ride's storyline will still be musical, themed around a Mardi Gras performance by Tiana, Louis, and friends that takes place after the events of the movie. It will feature music from the film.

""It is really exciting to know that Princess Tiana's presence in both Disneyland and Magic Kingdom will finally be fully realized,"" the character's voice actress Anika Noni Rose said in a press release.

And while Splash Mountain will be seeing some change, Disney still plans to reopen with the ride operating as it currently exists.

""As someone who grew up in Florida and had to endure bullying from white classmates on every field trip to Disney, this needs to be changed as soon as possible,"" a commenter on the original post wrote.

Sri Lankan soldiers kill Tamil youth in Jaffna,http://wsws.org/en/articles/2020/06/23/jaff-j23.html,"Army soldiers shot and killed Thiraviyam Ramalingam, a 24-year-old Tamil youth, last Saturday evening at Muhamalai near Pallai. The killing took place about 30 kilometres south of Jaffna, in Sri Lanka’s military-occupied and war-ravaged north.

The young man, who was from Kilali, was taken to the Pallai Divisional Hospital where he was pronounced dead. The Tamil Guardian reported that witnesses said a doctor was not sent to treat Ramalingam at the scene “for at least 45 minutes.”

Angry residents organised a sit-down protest, blocking the Kandy-Jaffna A9 highway, and outside the hospital. When protesters demanded to know the whereabouts of other Tamil youth arrested by soldiers during the incident, the police showed them a video in an attempt to convince people that the youth were in their custody.

Police and Special Task Force commandos were deployed to disperse the demonstrators and block others from joining the protest.

There are many conflicting reports about the killing. The Sunday Times on June 21, citing police sources, reported that a “motorcyclist was killed… after soldiers opened fire when he defied orders to stop.” The newspaper said “soldiers felt he was going to knock them down and ordered him to stop. They then opened fire when he tried to flee.”

Citing Pallai police, Lankadeepa published a different version on June 21. It reported that a conflict developed after soldiers cracked down on a group of illegal sand miners in the Muhamalai area. The confrontation resulted in a soldier killing one sand “racketeer.”

The newspaper claimed that the men had tried to flee in vehicles, running over the soldiers, while another group attempted to attack the soldiers and grab their firearms. The story appears to have been concocted by the police or military to justify the killing.

Yesterday, the Jaffna-based Udayan newspaper reported that four arrested youth had given evidence at Ramalingam’s post-mortem. They said they had been travelling in a vehicle with the deceased when an army soldier demanded that they halt. They stopped the vehicle and came toward the soldiers with their arms raised in the air. When one of them panicked and tried to run away, a soldier shot him.

According to the post-mortem, there were injuries on the young man’s body—one above the knee and one where a bullet had entered from behind and damaged his lungs, causing his death.

Ramalingam’s funeral was held yesterday amid tight security. Police in Kodikamam, which is close to Ramalingam’s home village, took out a court order banning all protests in the area. To deflect the anger of residents, Northern Province Governor M. S. Charles yesterday called for a report into the shooting.

Like all previous official inquiries, this report will not punish those responsible for the death of the young man but will cover up and justify the fatality, which is part and parcel of Colombo’s ongoing military occupation of the North and East of the country.

Sri Lankan police and the military are notorious for cooking up stories to validate their actions. Irrespective of whether Ramalingam was involved in “illegal sand mining” or not, he was shot and killed by a soldier, one of numerous fatalities perpetrated by the military occupation forces.

The shooting also occurred under conditions of President Gotabhaya Rajapakse’s intensifying militarisation of the country and a mounting anti-Tamil racialist campaign orchestrated by Colombo and the media. Rajapakse has given a clean slate to the military, encouraging its repressive actions and repeatedly insisting that the army be given immunity from any war crime allegations.

While workers, young people and the poor in the North and East face continuous police and military harassment, surveillance and anti-Tamil chauvinist rhetoric, these authoritarian conditions have worsened under Gotabhaya Rajapakse.

Colombo’s nearly 30-year war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ended in May 2009 with the death of tens of thousands of Tamil civilians and the disappearances of hundreds who surrendered. Rajapakse oversaw these bloody assaults as the country’s defence secretary.

Eleven years after the LTTE’s defeat, the military occupation of the North and East continues. The Colombo establishment and the media are whipping up claims that “terrorism” and the LTTE are reemerging in order to impose even more repressive measures.

On June 12, the media reported that two people on a motorbike dropped a parcel with a doll near Velliveli Army camp, 20 kilometres from Jaffna. A military officer and two soldiers walking along the road saw the parcel and it blew up, injuring one of the soldiers, who tried to open it. On June 17, the media claimed that Kopay police had arrested a 25-year-old suspect following a search operation the previous day.

On June 15, the pro-government Hiru TV channel reported that a parcel of explosives had been found and deactivated near the Army Brigade headquarters in Kandavalai, Kilinochchi.

The channel said “security forces suspect that somebody may have brought the parcel in front of the camp for the purpose of sabotage.” A report in Divaina claimed it was a “large bomb” that had been “manufactured in Sri Lanka.” The media has not explained how it was possible to plant a sizeable bomb in a high-security zone.

Police and military violence, however, is not limited to the North and East. After coming to power late last year, Rajapakse began rapidly militarising his administration, appointing serving and retired generals to key government positions.

This year he has seized on the COVID-19 pandemic to mobilise soldiers in large numbers to Colombo and its suburbs. Early this month, Rajapakse established a 13-member taskforce with far-reaching powers, answerable only to him and chaired by the defence ministry secretary, retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne.

In the name of suppressing the underworld and the drug mafia, the government has also renewed its deployment of police commandoes in raids to target specific areas, accompanied by the extrajudicial killing of “suspects,” a practice that began long ago in Sri Lanka.

The Rajapakse government faces an escalating foreign debt, growing unemployment and a deepening economic crisis intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. It fears the eruption of unified political and industrial action by the working class, across all ethnic and religious lines.

Rajapakse’s moves toward a military-based dictatorship and the increasing state violence against the population are clear warnings of how the ruling elite is preparing for the bitter class struggles that lie ahead.",JustBadNews,0

Maureen Groppe | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption Bolton book gets go ahead despite Trump administration's efforts The judge wrote that it was too late to halt Bolton's book titled, ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir.""

WASHINGTON – Former National Security Adviser John Bolton mercilessly criticizes President Donald Trump in his new book but writes that he had a White House ally in the vice president.

From China and Russia to Syria and Venezuela, Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence wanted to take hard lines against oppressive regimes while Trump sought to cut deals and appease totalitarian leaders, Bolton says in his memoir scheduled for release Tuesday.

“As Vice President, Pence maintained the strong views on national security that he’d had during his years in the House of Representatives, and I regarded him as a consistent ally,” Bolton wrote in “The Room Where it Happened: A White House Memoir.”

Bolton argued for keeping Pence on the 2020 ticket when Trump asked if he should replace him with Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador.

Bolton called it a bad idea to jettison someone so loyal without a guarantee that it would pay off at the ballot box.

“That seemed to be Trump’s thinking as well,” he wrote.

Pence's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bolton defends Pence on Ukraine

Bolton also backs up Pence’s previous refutation that he’d been warned that the delay in aid to Ukraine – the issue at the center of Democrats’ impeachment inquiry – had become tied to politically-motivated investigations Trump wanted.

Diplomat Gordon Sondland testified under oath last year that he mentioned his concern to Pence in a briefing in Warsaw shortly before Pence met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in September.

Pence has disputed Sondland’s account of raising concerns about the aid and has broadly denied knowing about the allegations.

Bolton, who was aware of efforts by Sondland and others to get Ukraine to investigate, wrote that he doesn’t recall “Sondland saying anything at that meeting” with Pence.

But when Pence and Bolton discussed the issue without Sondland, the vice president “acknowledged we still didn’t have a good answer to give” Zelensky for why the assistance hadn’t been released.

Pence “ducked as adroitly as possible,” when reporters asked about it. He danced around the issue with Zelensky and the “lack of `yes, it’s definitely coming’ statement was impossible to hide,” Bolton wrote.

A few days later, Pence told Bolton that he’d told Trump the money should be released.

“Pence also pressed Trump to meet Zelensky at the UN General Assembly and said that `just between us girls,’ he thought Trump was looking for a news peg to make what we hoped was the right decision,"" Bolton wrote.

Democrats and other critics of Bolton pointed out that he refused to testify during their impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine, and only agreed to testify during the Senate trial when he knew it was unlikely Republicans would call him forward.

Trump attacked book

Trump’s Justice Department had gone to court to block publication of the memoir, saying it contained classified information.

A federal judge cleared the way Saturday, ruling that with numerous copies already distributed, it would be futile to stop it.

But the judge also sharply rebuked Bolton for not following the government's prepublication clearance protocols regarding potentially classified material and suggested he could lose his $2 million advance.

Bolton and his supporters described the lawsuit as an effort to suppress the book and punish the author over the many criticisms of Trump.

Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview last week that Bolton ""is a liar” and adding “everybody in the White House hated John Bolton.”

While Trump has also tweeted this month that Bolton is wacko, despicable and a “disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war,” Pence has not recently mentioned Bolton on Twitter.

Bolton: Pence `stunned' by some of Trump's actions

Bolton is critical of Trump team operations from the beginning, including the transition, which Pence led. But Pence is a rare top White House official not skewered by Bolton.

The two had known each other when Pence served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Bolton calls Pence a “solid supporter of a strong national security policy” with whom he could easily converse on a range of foreign and defense policy issues.

He describes the vice president as trying to influence policy in private conversations with Trump but being as taken aback as Bolton was at some of Trump’s actions. That includes Trump’s Oval Office meeting in early 2019 with Kim Yong Chol, the then-lead negotiator for North Korea, which Trump conducted without Pence and Bolton.

“I was still stunned at being excluded, but not more stunned than Pence, who was stoical throughout,” Bolton wrote. (A few months later, during a meeting with Japan’s prime minister, Trump laughed that the North Koreans “hated” Bolton, Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, “but they loved him,” according to the book.)

When, during negotiations over U.S. troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, Trump wanted to invite the Taliban to Washington, Pence “replied carefully,” Bolton wrote.

“We should reflect before we make that decision,” Bolton quotes Pence telling Trump. “They have abused and repressed their people. Have they actually changed?”

After Trump called off a military strike to retaliate against Iran for shooting down an American surveillance drone, Pence was as “dumbfounded” as Bolton, according to the book.

“He agreed to go down the hall to see Trump and find out if there was any way to reverse the decision, but there obviously was not,” Bolton wrote.

Bolton credits Pence with influence

Bolton, Trump’s third national security adviser, does give Pence credit for influencing the administration’s push for the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. During a meeting to discuss possible sanctions, a Pence aide said the vice president thought the administration should be “going all out” against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company.

“That had enormous effect since Pence rarely offered his views in such settings, to avoid boxing in the President,” Bolton wrote.

He also credits Pence with “persuading Trump to overcome Treasury’s objections to sanctioning a major Venezuelan government financial institution and four of its subsidiaries.”

Pence had the difficult task of going after China without saying anything that might damage Trump’s “prized personal relationship” with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Before Pence gave a 2018 speech accusing the Chinese government of orchestrating an aggressive military, economic and political campaign to expand its influence inside the United States and across other regions of the world, Trump went over the text “line by line,” according to Bolton.

Everyone was “delighted” with how the speech was covered in the press. Pence remarked to his chief of staff and to Bolton that it was “the boldest China speech ever.”

“Which I think is true,” Bolton wrote.

While Pence may have pushed Trump to take a harder line against totalitarian regimes, the president relied on his No. 2 to make his comments more palatable to traditional allies.

Bolton describes a National Security Council meeting in which Trump railed against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and instructed Pence to tell NATO’s secretary general that the organization – and not the U.S. – should help Ukraine.

When Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., continued the discussion with Trump after the meeting, Trump finally responded: “Pence will soften my message.”

Police officers shoot and kill Los Angeles security guard: 'He ran because he was scared',http://news.yahoo.com/police-officers-shoot-kill-los-153601372.html?.tsrc=jtc_news_index,"After sheriff’s deputies chased and shot dead a security guard at an auto repairs shop in Los Angeles on Thursday evening, family members have identified the dead man to local media as Andres Guardado, 18.

The killing came amid national protest and unrest over the deaths of African Americans, and other people of color, at the hands of law enforcement.

Related: California: half-brother of black man found hanged killed in police shooting

On Wednesday, Los Angeles county sheriff’s deputies also shot dead Terron Jammal Boone, 31, who the department said was “the half-brother of Robert Fuller, who [was] discovered hanging from a tree on 10 June 2020 and is currently the subject of a death investigation”.

Describing the Thursday shooting of Guardado at the auto shop, a police department spokesman told reporters deputies saw the man produce a handgun before running away.

“Deputies engaged in a short foot pursuit between the two businesses, at some point the deputies contacted the suspect and that’s when the deputy-involved shooting occurred,” the spokesman said, adding that it was not immediately clear how many officers were fired.

Andrew Heney, owner of the Freeway autoshop, told a local CBS affiliate: “We had a security guard that was out front, because we had just had certain issues with people tagging and stuff like that.”

“And then the police came up, and they pulled their guns on him and he ran because he was scared, and they shot and killed him. He’s got a clean background and everything. There’s no reason.”

The sheriff’s department said a handgun was found where the man, who died at the scene, was shot. Family members disputed that Guardado was armed. It was not clear if he had been wearing a uniform.

Guardado’s sister told reporters: “I lost a part of me, it’s empty, and I’m never gonna have him back. I’m never gonna see him, he’s never gonna talk to me, I’m just, I can’t, I just can’t believe this happened to my brother. It really hurts me.”",JustBadNews,0
A $100 PS4 Firesale Goes Horribly Wrong as Police Tear Gas Gamers,http://ccn.com/a-100-ps4-firesale-goes-horribly-wrong-as-police-tear-gas-gamers/,"Lidl in Orgeval, France, has canceled a 95€ PS4 offer after chaotic scenes outside the store this morning.

Hundreds gathered, some even camping out the night before ahead of opening causing mayhem in the area.

The offer was canceled and police intervened, firing teargas to dispel the crowd.

A 95€ (approx $105) PS4 offer at a Lidl store in France ended in tears earlier today as police fired teargas to dispel a chaotic crowd of eager shoppers.

95€ PS4 Special Offer

To celebrate the grand opening of the store in Orgeval, in the Yvelines department northeast of Paris, Lidl planned to flog the Slim 500 GB model of Sony’s popular PS4 console at a price the likes of which we’ve rarely seen before. The console typically sells for roughly 300€ in France.

Yet, news of the PS4 offer leaked out early yesterday courtesy of a picture shared by a store employee before spreading far and wide on social media.

Tempted by the offer, crowds amassed at the store hours before opening. Some even camped out in scenes reminiscent of a console launch day. By dawn, hundreds of people had reportedly gathered in front of the store.

Chaos Ensues

Traffic came to a standstill on the adjacent interstate. Nearby roads teamed with hastily parked cars spilling onto pavements. Reports suggest some even drove from as far afield as the northern French town of Lille to bag a cheap PS4.

As opening time approached, tensions bubbled over as a lone security guard attempted to control an ever-expanding, impatient, and tightly-packed crowd.

Store management then informed shoppers that Lidl had opted to cancel the PS4 promotion. The official Twitter account of Lidl France explained:

Today, we believe that the security conditions are not met to keep the supermarket open. The sale of PS4 is also permanently canceled. We were very surprised by this enthusiasm, and we apologize for the inconvenience caused.

Crowds Teargassed

Local police intervened shortly after and employed tear gas to dispel the shoppers, managing to hit some of their own in the process.

A loudspeaker announcement beamed from a police squad car revealed Lidl had ostensibly sent the PS4 units back to the supplier. Police asked shoppers to calmly leave the area as the store would not open today.

According to social media, crowds have since thinned, but some remain hopeful that the store will open.",JustBadNews,0
These 5G coronavirus conspiracies are getting out of hand: Villagers in Bolivia have destroyed several cell towers (that didn't have 5G capabilities) in an effort to stop the rollout,http://bgr.com/2020/06/16/5g-conspiracy-coronavirus-attack/,"5G conspiracy theorists continue to believe that the wireless technology is causing or spreading the coronavirus.

Villagers in Bolivia have destroyed several cell towers (that didn’t have 5G capabilities) in an effort to stop the rollout.

The idea that 5G is dangerous has been debunked time and time again, but that hasn’t seemed to matter to the conspiracy theorists.

The coronavirus pandemic has everyone a little on-edge at the moment. It’s perfectly understandable, as an invisible virus sweeps across the globe, and it’s okay if you’re feeling a little weird and more stressed-out than normal. Some have chosen to let their conspiracy freak flags fly, however, and they’ve decided that 5G technology is somehow to blame for the pandemic.

I’ve reported on this a couple of times before. At first, it was just a curious oddity. Then, some of the more unhinged members of the “5G coronavirus” began sabotaging cellular communications towers, which is obviously far more serious. Now, in South America, authorities are reporting what they describe as a “terrorist attack” on multiple cell towers in Bolivia.

As Free Malaysia Today reports, villagers in Bolivia have begun to target cell towers with the misguided belief that the communications equipment is somehow spreading illness. The villagers attacking the towers mistakenly believe that 5G is dangerous, but there’s another wrinkle to this whole saga that is even more bizarre: Bolivia doesn’t even have 5G technology yet.

Prior to the attempted destruction of the towers, villagers held protests and demanded that local officials take down the communications towers. When that didn’t work — and even after being told that 5G isn’t even available in the country — a total of four towers were “destroyed,” according to police. A local police chief named Franklin Villazon is quoted as saying the destruction was akin to “a terrorist attack.”

We were overwhelmed,” Villazon is quoted as saying.

This should absolutely go without saying, but just to be sure we’re all on the same page here: There’s no way that a 5G wireless signal could cause a viral pandemic. Even if you believe that the virus itself was faked to cover up damage caused by 5G radiation, that’s also been debunked by a myriad of sources.

The 5G wireless bands aren’t even close to the range that is considered dangerous to life. It’s even more ludicrous to think that wireless companies would be rolling out new technology that kills its potential customers. Not exactly a solid business model, right? It’s just plain false.

It’s unclear exactly how this problem can be solved. Facts don’t really work against conspiracy believers, as they brush them off as misinformation or a deliberate attempt to deceive. Perhaps once a coronavirus vaccine is developed and people stop getting sick at such a high rate — and 5G continues to roll out — the obviousness of the truth will become clear.",JustBadNews,0
"Brother and sister, aged 3 and 4, found dead in car 'after dad locked them inside car for five hours'",http://thenations.co.uk/news/brother-and-sister-found-dead-in-car/,"Two young children have died in their father’s care after he left them locked in his truck for five hours in 90-degree heat.

The bodies of Teagan, 4, and her little brother Ryan Dennis, 3, were found in the footwell of their dad’s truck in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday.

Their dad, Dustin Lee Dennis, 31, was arrested Saturday and charged with two counts of second-degree murder after his children were pronounced dead at his home, according to an arrest report.

Dennis told police he drove to QuikTrip with his children around midday and then returned to his home in the 1700 block of East 61st Street South, according to an arrest report.

He then fell asleep for four to five hours and couldn’t find his children when he woke up, police said.

He found his children in the floorboard of the truck and then moved them to the living room where paramedics pronounced the children dead, according to an arrest report.

Dennis is up for two counts of second degree murder for killing his kids. Credit: Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office

The cause of the children’s death has not yet been released.

A neighbor had footage of Dennis leaving, then locking his truck and going inside without getting the children out, police said.

The arrest report states – The children had not been checked on for nearly five hours during the time they were locked inside the vehicle.

According to the National Weather Service, Saturday’s high temperature in Tulsa reached the low 90’s.

A child can begin to suffer the life-threatening symptoms of heatstroke within minutes of being trapped in a hot car according to kidsandcars.org.

The inside of a vehicle acts much like a greenhouse trapping in heat, causing the temperature inside to rise rapidly.

Dennis is currently in the Tulsa County jail on a $1 million bond.

TIL that apparently in the US you need a judge to tell you you can't fire gay or transgender people based on their sexuality. And that this is a 'defeat for Trump's administration'.,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/15/politics/supreme-court-lgbtq-employment-case/index.html,"The landmark ruling will extend protections to millions of workers nationwide and is a defeat for the Trump administration, which argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act that bars discrimination based on sex did not extend to claims of gender identity and sexual orientation.

The 6-3 opinion was written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's four liberal justices.

""An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids,"" Gorsuch wrote.

""There is simply no escaping the role intent plays here: Just as sex is necessarily a but-for cause when an employer discriminates against homosexual or transgender employees, an employer who discriminates on these grounds inescapably intends to rely on sex in its decisionmaking,"" the opinion read.

""Today's decision is one of the court's most significant rulings ever with respect to the civil rights of gay and transgender individuals,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""On its terms, the decision is only about discrimination in the workplace,"" Vladeck added. ""But it inevitably opens the door to a host of other challenges to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or transgender status on the ground that it, too, is impermissibly based upon sex. In that respect, only the court's 2015 ruling recognizing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage may be equally as significant.""

Speaking at the White House, Trump called the decision ""very powerful"" and acknowledged it was surprising to some.

""They've ruled and we live with the decision,"" Trump said. ""We live with the decision of the Supreme Court.""

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called the ruling ""a momentous step forward for our country.""

""The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect and dignity. That everyone should be able to live openly, proudly, as their true selves without fear,"" Biden said.

The LGBTQ community is made of up of approximately 1 million workers who identify as transgender and 7.1 million lesbian, gay and bisexual workers, according to UCLA's Williams Institute.

Twenty-two states, plus the District of Columbia have statutes protecting workers based on sexual orientation, according to the Williams Institute. Twenty-one states plus DC have statutes protecting workers from discrimination based on gender identity.

Justice Samuel Alito, one of the court's conservatives, wrote in his dissent that ""even if discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity could be squeezed into some arcane understanding of sex discrimination, the context in which Title VII was enacted would tell us that this is not what the statute's terms were understood to mean at that time.""

Meanwhile, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative on the bench, acknowledged the social and political progress achieved by members of the LGBTQ community, but nonetheless dissented.

""They have advanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today's result. Under the Constitution's separation of powers, however, I believe that it was Congress's role, not this Court's, to amend Title VII. I therefore must respectfully dissent from the Court's judgment,"" Kavanaugh wrote.

A number of LGBTQ groups celebrated the court's ruling on Monday, including the Human Rights Campaign, whose president, Alphonso David, said in a tweet that the decision is a ""landmark victory for #LGBTQ equality.""

Sarah Kate Ellis, the president of the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD, said in a statement that the decision ""is a step towards affirming the dignity of transgender people, and all LGBTQ people.""

But the ruling was also sharply criticized by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, whose president issued a blistering statement about Gorsuch, who replaced the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

""Justice Scalia would be disappointed that his successor has bungled textualism so badly today, for the sake of appealing to college campuses and editorial boards,"" said Carrie Severino, a former clerk of Justice Clarence Thomas. ""This was not judging, this was legislating -- a brute force attack on our constitutional system.""

Gorsuch grounded his opinion in the plain text of the law. He acknowledged that when the law was passed, Congress may not have been thinking of gay, lesbian and transgender rights.

The conservative justice said Congress might not have ""anticipated their work would lead to this particular result,"" but, he said, the ""express terms of the statute give us one answer.""

""Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit,"" he wrote in the ruling.

An historic ruling

The court's ruling was on separate cases: one concerning whether the law encompasses claims of sexual orientation brought by Gerald Bostock, and the estate of Donald Zarda, and the other concerning a transgender woman, Aimee Stephens, whose challenge marked the first time the court heard arguments regarding the civil rights of a transgender individual.

Stephens, who died in May, mustered the courage back in 2013 to tell her co-workers about something that she had struggled with her entire life: her gender identity. Not long after, she was fired as the director of a funeral home.

Stephens' former boss, Thomas Rost, testified in the lower court that she was fired because she was ""no longer going to represent himself as a man."" (Rost refused to address Stephens with feminine pronouns).

A lower court ruled in her favor, holding it is ""analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee's status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee's sex.""

Aimee Stephens' wife, Donna Stephens, also welcomed the court's ruling on Monday, saying in a statement that Aimee was ""a leader who fought against discrimination against transgender people.""

""I am grateful for this victory to honor the legacy of Aimee, and to ensure people are treated fairly regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity,"" Donna Stephens said.

Bostock, a gay man from Georgia who claimed that despite receiving good performance reviews as a child welfare services coordinator, argued he was fired because of his sexual orientation. Another plaintiff was the estate of Donald Zarda, who had been employed as a sky diving instructor. Zarda has since died but he too claimed to be fired because he was gay.

FDA revokes authorization of drug Trump touted,http://cnn.com/2020/06/15/politics/fda-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus/index.html,"(CNN) The Food and Drug Administration has revoked its emergency use authorization for the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of Covid-19.

Hydroxychloroquine was frequently touted by President Donald Trump, and he has claimed to have used it himself

After reviewing the current research available on the drugs, the FDA determined that the drugs do not meet ""the statutory criteria"" for emergency use authorization as they are unlikely to be effective in treating Covid-19 based on the latest scientific evidence, the agency noted on its website on Monday.

""FDA has concluded that, based on this new information and other information discussed in the attached memorandum, it is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,"" FDA chief scientist Denise Hinton wrote in a letter to Gary Disbrow of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) on Monday. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been tied to serious cardiac events as well as other side effects among Covid-19 patients.

""Accordingly, FDA revokes the EUA for emergency use of HCQ and CQ to treat COVID-19,"" Hinton wrote in the letter, using abbreviations for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. ""As of the date of this letter, the oral formulations of HCQ and CQ are no longer authorized by FDA to treat COVID-19.""

Doctors can continue to legally prescribe the drugs off-label, as they can with any drug that's approved for other conditions. The FDA's emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine was narrow in scope, applying only to hospitalized Covid-19 patients and only to drugs donated to the Strategic National Stockpile.

The FDA on Monday also warned against giving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to patients who are also getting remdesivir, the one drug that has any authorization for use in treating coronavirus.

Mixing remdesivir, an infused antiviral drug made by Gilead Sciences Inc., and either controversial drug could reduce the effectiveness of remdesivir, the FDA warned.

""The agency is not aware of instances of this reduced activity occurring in the clinical setting but is continuing to evaluate all data related to remdesivir,"" the FDA said.

In an open letter published late last month, FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn appeared to defend the agency's decision to issue the authorization.

""This decision was based on evaluation of the EUA criteria and the scientific evidence available at that time. We continue to look at the data on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and we will make future determinations on these products based on available evidence including ongoing clinical studies,"" Hahn said in the letter last month.

The emergency use authorization, or EUA, made it easier for pills donated to the national stockpile to be distributed to coronavirus patients.

Hahn added in the letter that ""we also knew it was important to help ensure a stable supply of the drugs for patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis given the increased demand.""

In an interview with CNN last month, Hahn also defended his agency's handling of hydroxychloroquine. He acknowledged the political climate surrounding the drug, but said, ""I stand by our decisions because I think they are rooted in science and data, and we'll continue to reevaluate.""

The World Health Organization said on Monday that it is still reviewing the use of hydroxychloroquine in its Solidarity Trial, a multi-country clinical study of Covid-19 treatment options. The organization had temporarily paused the trial in May due to concerns surrounding the drug's safety and in order to review its own data, but resumed the program earlier this month.

Trump has been a frequent cheerleader for a combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin as a Covid-19 treatment. He promoted the drugs dozens of times, despite pleas from scientists to let studies decide if the treatment worked or not , and has said he took hydroxychloroquine to prevent being infected with coronavirus.

Despite the warnings from health experts, retail sales of the decades-old drug soared in recent weeks amid the growing public attention on the medication.

Facebook fires employee who protested its inaction on Trump tweets,http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-protests-firing/facebook-fires-employee-who-protested-its-inaction-on-trump-tweets-idUKKBN23J35Y?rpc=401&,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc fired an employee who had criticized Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s decision not to take action against inflammatory posts by U.S. President Donald Trump this month, citing his tweet challenging a colleague’s silence on the issue.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

Brandon Dail, a user interface engineer in Seattle, wrote on Twitter that he was dismissed for publicly scolding a colleague who had refused to include a statement of support for the Black Lives Matter movement on developer documents he was publishing.

Dail sent the tweet a day after joining dozens of employees, including the six other engineers on his team, in abandoning their desks and tweeting objections to Zuckerberg’s handling of Trump’s posts in a rare protest at the social media company.

“Intentionally not making a statement is already political,” Dail wrote in the tweet, sent on June 2. He said on Friday that he stood by what he wrote.

Facebook confirmed Dail’s characterization of his dismissal, but declined to provide additional information. The company said during the walkout that participating employees would not face retaliation.

Dail did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump’s posts which prompted the staff outcry included the racially charged phrase “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” in reference to demonstrations against racism and police brutality held after the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.

Twitter affixed a warning label to the same post, saying it glorified violence. Facebook opted to leave the post untouched.

Zuckerberg defended his decision at a tense all-hands meeting with employees that week. During the meeting, Dail tweeted that it was “crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us.”

Dail again voiced objections this week after both Facebook and Twitter declined to take action against a Trump post that contained an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about Martin Gugino, a 75-year-old protester who was critically injured by police in Buffalo, New York.

“Trump’s attack on Martin Gugino is despicable and a clear violation [of] Facebook’s anti-harassment rules. It’s again extremely disappointing that we (and Twitter) haven’t removed it,” he said.

Internal dissent is often encouraged at Silicon Valley tech giants, but the companies have been accused of penalizing workers who organise and air complaints publicly.

Biden calls Senate Republicans 'so damn stupid' over $3T coronavirus bill,http://nypost.com/2020/06/12/biden-calls-gop-so-damn-stupid-over-3t-coronavirus-bill/,"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Friday that Senate Republicans are “so damn stupid” for not passing a $3 trillion coronavirus bill approved last month by House Democrats.

The 1,800-page Democratic package was derided by Republicans as a “messaging bill” because it was unilaterally drafted, unlike four prior coronavirus packages that were the result of lengthy negotiations.

“It passed through the House,” Biden said. “Get state and local governments the funding they need to keep millions of people on the job. Because, here’s the — they’re so damn stupid, darn stupid. If you don’t have people on the job dealing with controlling the virus, then it’s just going to get worse.”

The former vice president’s remarks to members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) were first reported by The Hill.

“[House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats have been pushing hard as hell to fund local communities,” Biden said. “The fact of the matter is that every town you work in … they have a budget and they cannot deficit spend. The only operation in the world that can do that is the federal government.”

Some Democrats acknowledged that the bill, which passed in May, was merely an opening pitch for negotiations. The bill would give nearly $1 trillion to state and local governments, create a $200 billion “heroes fund” with hazard pay for medical workers, allocate $175 billion to rent and mortgage aid and spend $75 billion on virus testing and contact tracing.

The bill also would authorize another round of stimulus checks up to $1,200 and extend the $600-per-week federal boost in unemployment insurance payments through January 2021. The boost currently runs through July.

White House officials expect to begin negotiating on the next coronavirus package in July.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is pushing for legislation that includes liability protection as companies reopen from the pandemic that’s sickened more than 2 million Americans and killed more than 114,000.

President Trump wants legislation that includes a temporary payroll tax cut to stimulate the economy, and some Republicans oppose extending a boost in unemployment pay, saying that would incentivize people not to work.

After passing the fourth major coronavirus package in March, Republicans said they wanted to pause for reflection and criticized proposed state bailouts. A $670 billion small-business loan program exhausted funds more slowly than anticipated and a stock market rebound coupled with declining unemployment eased pressure to pass another bill.",JustBadNews,0

"Man charged with poisoning 8 homeless people, filming victims reactions to eating laced food",http://fox10phoenix.com/news/man-charged-with-poisoning-8-homeless-people-filming-victims-reactions-to-eating-laced-food?fbclid=IwAR37DPFuvgtQVACcVKQp2bh2aXhmvbS5TjfUL3RMWPk0p99z46SozEbqt10,"The Orange County District Attorney's office Thursday announced charges against a man accused of poisoning eight homeless people, including an elderly person, in a series of attacks that were videotaped to record the victims’ reactions to eating food laced with oleoresin capsicum, which is twice as strong as the pepper spray used by police.

William Robert Cable, 38, of San Andreas, was charged with eight felony counts of poisoning, one felony count of inflicting injury on an elderly person, eight misdemeanor counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and an infraction for consuming alcohol or smoking marijuana while driving.

The victims, who were all poisoned in the city of Huntington Beach, suffered a variety of symptoms including seizure-like symptoms, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and intense mouth and stomach pain, according to the prosecutors. Several of the victims required hospitalization.

Authorities are now asking for the public’s help identifying additional victims and suspects in connection with the series of poisonings which began in mid-May.

“These human beings were preyed upon because they are vulnerable,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “They were exploited and poisoned as part of a twisted form of entertainment, and their pain was recorded so that it could be relived by their attacker over and over again.""

Prosecutors said that many of the victims were unaware the food they were being given had been tampered with prior to eating it.

""Several victims were given other food and beer to entice them to eat the poisoned food,"" prosecutors wrote in a press release.

Cable was arrested on May 22 by the Huntington Beach Police Department.

He faces a maximum of 19 years and three months if convicted on all charges. Cable is currently being held at the Orange County Jail on $500,000 bail.

“The cruel nature of these crimes shocks the conscience of our community,” said Huntington Beach Mayor Lyn Semeta.

“The inhumane nature of the crimes combined with targeting a vulnerable population shocks the conscience,” said Huntington Beach Police Chief Robert Handy. “The fact an adult criminal would involve a juvenile is even more reprehensible.”

Prosecutors said some of the victims were told they were participating in a “spicy food challenge” before being given the food laced with oleoresin capsicum; others were not.

“Orange County has worked hard to address the homeless crises. It is unacceptable to see someone target these vulnerable people. These individuals do not deserve to become the target of acts of cruelty simply because they are homeless,” said Michelle Steel, Chairwoman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors.",JustBadNews,0
"'He's disabled,' the caregiver screamed. 'I'm with her,' Eyad cried. A detailed account of the murder of an autistic Palestinian.",http://haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-he-s-disabled-the-aide-yelled-i-m-with-her-eyad-cried-the-cop-still-shot-him-1.8896746,"UPDATE: Israeli cop who shot dead autistic Palestinian faces trial

Eyad Hallaq was shot to death in a roofless garbage room. According to the testimony of his caregiver, who was by his side and tried to protect him, he was executed. For long minutes she stood next to him and pleaded for his life, trying to explain to the police officers, in Hebrew and in Arabic, that he suffered from a disability. They shot him three times from close range with a rifle, directly into the center of his body, as he lay on his back, wounded and terrified, on the floor of the room.

The garbage room is located in a narrow courtyard in Jerusalem’s Old City, inside Lions Gate, exactly at the start of the Via Dolorosa, where Jesus walked from the site of his trial to the place of his crucifixion, on what's now called King Faisal Street. It's just a few dozen meters from the entrance to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. The sanctity of the area did not help Hallaq. Nor did the fact that he was someone with special needs, a 32-year-old autistic person, the apple of the eye of his parents, who devoted their lives to looking after him.

Hallaq was afraid of blood: His mother shaved him in the morning, for fear he would cut himself. Every scratch threw him into a panic, she says. He was also afraid of the armed police officers who stood along the route to the special needs center he went to, where participated in a vocational training program. His instructor taught him how to make his way there alone on foot – it took a month before he dared walk the route by himself – a little more than a kilometer from his home in the Wadi Joz neighborhood into the Old City.

He was afraid of the armed police who stood along the route to his special needs center. It took his instructor a month to teach him make his way there alone.

On his first days at the center the teacher stopped with Hallaq next to the police guard post at Lions Gate. She tried to explain to him that he had nothing to fear; they wouldn’t do him any harm, she promised. She also explained to the police officers that he was disabled and was attending the therapeutic institution where she worked – the El Quds center run by the Elwyn Israel organization, as part of its network of facilities for special-needs children and adults.

Hallaq passed the police post every day for six years, apparently without any problems. In his pocket he carried a certificate issued by the center, stating in Hebrew and in Arabic that he was a person with special needs, as well as a National Insurance Institute card confirming that he had a 100-percent disability. But nothing saved the young man from the hands of Border Policemen, quick on the draw, unrestrained, bloodthirsty.

Last Saturday, Hallaq left home a little after 6 A.M. The day at Elwyn El Quds, located at the entrance to the Al-Aqsa compound, begins at 7:30, but he always arrived early in order to prepare the kitchen for the cooking classes. Last week, for the first time in his life, he made a vegetable salad for his parents, slicing tomatoes and an onion, and dressing the result with olive oil. His father, Khairy, says it was the tastiest salad he’d ever eaten.

Eyad liked going to the special needs center. When the institution shut down for a month and a half during the coronavirus lockdown, his mother had to take him there a few times to prove to him that it was closed. Last Saturday, on the last day of his life, he set out tranquilly and in good spirits. He had a cup of tea, ate a sandwich his mother made for him, showered, dressed and left. Security camera footage shows him walking along the street, a garbage bag in his hands. Every morning on the way to school he threw out the garbage from home.

A little before 6 A.M., Warda Abu Hadid, Eyad’s caregiver, also set out from her home in the Jabal Mukkaber neighborhood, headed for the Elwyn center. At about 6:10, Abu Hadid, 47, passed by the Border Policemen who were manning the security post at Lions Gate and entered the Old City. She had not walked much more than 100 meters before she heard shouts behind her: “Terrorist! Terrorist!” Immediately afterward she heard three shots. She rushed to the garbage room nearby, taking shelter behind the iron closet on its right side. Just then her ward, Hallaq, ran into the room in a panic and collapsed on the floor. A sanitation worker was sitting there, drinking tea.

The garbage room is an open space, not very big, with a few chairs for sanitation workers and a large container that reeked unmercifully this week when we visited the site. On the iron closet is a metal plaque with verses from the Koran, which has been here a long time. There were three bullet holes in the tin wall.

Abu Hadid was trying to explain that Hallaq didn’t have a gun when one of the officers fired four shots with his M-16 into the center of the young man’s body, killing him instantly.

Abu Hadid noticed that Hallaq, lying on the floor, was bleeding, apparently from being shot in the leg by the Border Policemen as he fled. She later told Amer Aruri, of the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, that Hallaq lay there for between three and five minutes, wounded, before he was shot and killed.

The whole time she shouted, “He is disabled, he is disabled!” in Hebrew, and Hallaq shouted, “Ana ma’aha!” – Arabic for “I am with her” – as he attempted to cling to his caregiver for protection. It’s not hard to imagine what went through his mind in those last terrified minutes, as three officers ran into the room screaming, “Where is the rifle? Where is the rifle?”

The officers aimed their weapons at Hallaq. They were at point-blank range, standing over him at the entrance to the garbage room. Abu Hadid kept trying to explain that Hallaq didn’t have any sort of gun – he was only holding the surgical face mask that is required these days at the center, and rubber gloves – when one of the officers fired three shots with his M-16 into the center of the young man’s body, killing him instantly.

Suddenly the area was filled with Border Police, among them an officer who aimed her weapon at Abu Hadid’s head, ordering her to stand still while she subjected her to a body search. The caregiver, whose ward had just been killed before her eyes, was utterly distraught. She was then taken to the police position next to Lions Gate, stripped almost naked in a search for the nonexistent firearm, and then interrogated for three hours.

The officers wanted to know about Hallaq and the institution he attended. They then informed Abu Hadid that she would be taken for questioning to the notorious room No. 4 in the police station in the Russian Compound, in downtown Jerusalem. She balked, telling the police that she first had to call her director, which they allowed her to do.

The director of the center joined her, and Abu Hadid was interrogated for an additional three hours in the Russian Compound, until her family arrived. They took her to a clinic in her neighborhood, to calm her down and tend to her mental state. Later on this week she was summoned to the offices of the Justice Ministry unit that investigates police actions to give testimony.

In the meantime, the Elwyn center had called Hallaq’s father and told him his son had been shot in the leg. Khairy says now that he had a bad feeling: He knows that the regular police and the Border Police don’t injure people – they shoot to kill. He and his wife Rana rushed to Elwyn El Quds. A large group of officers blocked their way and told them that they were going to search their home. No one told the couple what had happened to their son. It was only when the officers raided their house and carried out a short search that one of them asked Khairy, “When do you intend to hold the funeral?”

The caregiver, whose ward was just killed before her eyes, was taken to the police position, stripped almost naked in a search for the nonexistent firearm, and then interrogated for hours.

That is how Eyad’s father learned that his beloved son was dead. That’s the way of police officers when it comes to Palestinians. Khairy says that the commander of the force acted humanely, but that one officer was vulgar and violent, telling Eyad’s bereaved sister, “If you were a man I would have already smashed you,” after she tried to grab his arm during the search.

Khairy Hallaq is a thin, gentle man of 64 who this week was living on tranquilizer injections, not eating or sleeping. His eyes, red from crying and exhaustion alike, said everything. He is disabled as a result of a work accident about 15 years ago in a marble factory he owned in Anata, near the Old City. He has been unemployed ever since. When Eyad was a boy he sometimes took him to work with him.

The couple has two daughters, Diana, 35, and Joanna, 34. When we visit, the latter, a special-education teacher, is sitting next to her weeping mother and looks no less tormented. Eyad’s parents devoted their lives to his care. This week Khairy and Rana, who is 58 and in poor health, mourned separately, as is the custom – he in the mourning tent that was erected at the end of their road; she in their home on Yakut al-Hamawi Street.

Eyad Hallaq’s small room is tidy and spotless. A wide bed covered with a brown velvet blanket, a television mounted on the wall, and a row of the cheap bottles of aftershave and other grooming products that he loved are on the chest of drawers, along with the de rigueur bottle of hand sanitizer. He was meticulous about his appearance.

“I don’t wear fine clothes like my son and I don’t have the kind of cellphone he does,” his father says. The mourning poster hanging at the top of the street shows a handsome young man. His mother tells us that she is convinced he will return.

“They took Eyad. I want Eyad. When will Eyad come back? When? When? When? All day long I am at the door – maybe he will come back,” she says. “Thirty-two years I raised him, step by step. I put so much into him. My health suffered. Everyone who took care of him said there was no Palestinian who was looked after like him. But your people think he was garbage. That’s why he was murdered.”

Both parents speak Hebrew. Their initial fears about their son first arose when he was 2. For two more years they made the rounds of doctors and clinics, until he was diagnosed as autistic. At first he was sent to a regular private school, but couldn’t integrate there; up until about six years ago he was home, not enrolled in any educational framework. The years at Elwyn El Quds were apparently the best years of his life. His parents are sorry that they only heard about the center when he was in his 20s. On Fridays, when it was closed, he would go out in the morning to buy his parents Jerusalem-style sesame-seed pretzels.

No one told the couple what had happened to their son. Only when the officers raided their house that one of them asked Khairy, 'When do you intend to hold the funeral?'

Hallaq never spoke to strangers, only to people he knew well. Once he got used to people, he liked to laugh with them. Walking on the street, his head was usually hung low. If he passed someone he knew he might wave hello but wouldn’t stop to speak. He spoke only with his close family and his friends, and with the caregivers at Elwyn.

“If you sat next to him, he would move away. He needed a lot of time to get used to you,” his father says. When he was not in the center he didn’t hang out with friends. In his room he liked to watch cartoons – Mickey Mouse, and Tom and Jerry on MBC3, the Arabic children’s channel. Rana says he didn’t always focus on the cartoons, only stared at them. “He was a baby,” she says, “a 2-year-old baby.”

Her husband adds later, “He was 32 but had the intelligence of an 8-year-old.”

Hallaq’s dream was to work as an assistant cook. In the meantime, he and others at the center would prepare food and go to the Beit Hanina neighborhood to give it to children with special needs there.

Sitting in the mourning tent is one of Eyad’s friends from Elwyn, wrapped in a black winter coat and a thick sweater. Pointing the friend out, the bereaved father says to us: “You asked me a lot of questions and now I want to ask you a question. Look at that person. Could you wear what he is wearing in this heat? What do you see in this person who dressed like that in the summer? What can you see? I will bring you a little boy, what will you see? A boy. A sick boy. That is what the officer who killed Eyad saw.”

Back at home, Rana says, “He was an angel while he was on the earth, and now he is an angel when he is under the earth” – and again bursts into tears.

The day before her son was killed, she says, she asked him not to go to the center the next day, but he insisted. As often happens with bereaved parents, Rana says she had a feeling that something bad was liable to happen to her son. “We saw in the United States the policeman who killed. He is under arrest. And in Israel? He should get at least 25 years. They killed him like he was a fly. My son was a fly.”

A sign at the entrance to the Hallaqs’ house requests people not to kiss or shake hands, because of the coronavirus, but no one pays any heed to it here. A delegation from the Hadash party, led by MKs Aida Touma-Sliman and Yousef Jabareen, arrives to pay condolences. The police haven’t yet returned Eyad’s disability card and his clothes. A cousin, Tareq Akash, an electrical engineer who was in high-tech and is now a doctoral student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, asks, “Can we go and demonstrate now? Burn police stations like in the United States? We don’t want to burn anything. But are we allowed to express anger? You know, they’ll open fire at us.”

We follow Hallaq’s route on his last day. Leaving the house, we turn right and walk up the street to Jericho Road. At the traffic lights we cross the busy street, above which is a poster: “Look drivers in the eye.” Behind us is the university’s Mount Scopus campus, in front of us is the Old City. After the young man crossed the street, he walked along the renovated stone path that follows the Old City wall to Lions Gate, next to the Yeusefiya Cemetery. Three cute puppies are hiding next to the wall. Here Hallaq walked down the slope, between the graves and the wall, moments before his death. Steps lead up to Lions Gate. Four Border Policemen armed and armored from head to foot, truncheons and rifles in their slings, stand at the entrance in a threatening posture as we pass by.

Here is where Warda Abu Hadid heard the shots, here is the garbage room, near the sign to the Via Dolorosa. Here she tried to take shelter from the shooting and here lay Eyad, her ward, until his death.

Elwyn El Quds is only a few dozen meters from here. An electric glass door protects the wards at the facility; there’s no entry to strangers during the coronavirus crisis. Young people emerge from the stone courtyard, it’s midday and the school day will soon be over. The director, Manar Zamamiri, says that about 100 people get training and therapy at this center, all of them 21 and above, but this is just one branch of the Elwyn network – there are several other centers with schools and other programs in the city, serving hundreds of disabled children and adults. The main effort here is invested in vocational training.

The Dome of the Rock glitters golden behind the entrance, where armed Israeli police officers are poised. The director breaks into a broad smile, visible even through her face mask, when we ask about Eyad. “He was so sweet. We loved him so much. And his mother is such a strong woman – mekudeshet” – holy – she says in Hebrew. This week she tried to explain to her wards what happened to Eyad.",JustBadNews,0

'Cops' canceled amid debate about policing,http://cnn.com/2020/06/09/entertainment/cops-column/index.html,"(CNN) After more than 30 years patrolling the airwaves, ""Cops"" has been canceled, with a spokesperson for Paramount Network stating that it has no ""current or future plans for it to return.""

The verite police show, which originated on Fox in 1989, had been pulled days before its scheduled season premiere, an action that came amid questions and protests about policing. Those same concerns prompted A&E to postpone ""Live PD,"" a newer iteration of the ride-along idea that's one of the network's most popular series.

Television's historic infatuation with cop shows , both scripted and unscripted, has prompted renewed conversation in the current moment. Have decades of TV crime drummed home a heroic image of the police, skewing public perceptions and providing cover for excesses?

It's too soon to know whether the last few weeks of mass protests will fundamentally alter how people see such programming, and more to the point, how networks approach scheduling them. The viewing audience is hardly monolithic, with an abundance of options catering to all sorts of tastes and niches.

These scheduling moves nevertheless felt like a tacit admission that TV has oversimplified the depiction of policing. While the effect of that can be debated in regard to scripted programs, the ""reality"" label borne by ""Cops"" and its ilk carries a thornier set of issues.

Like so much in TV, the success of ""Cops"" was a surprise to most concerned at the time -- representing a confluence of events more than some master plan. Still in its infancy, the Fox broadcast network basically stumbled into the genre, as networks explored programming alternatives due to a prolonged strike by Hollywood writers.

Beginning on local stations, Fox launched a law-enforcement block that began with ""America's Most Wanted"" in the final year of the Reagan administration, later joined by ""Cops.""

Those shows solved a problem for programmers, offering a low-cost way to fill time on Saturday night, while becoming an unexpected ratings winner.

The pro-law-enforcement message dovetailed with Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch's conservative bent. Still, the main impetus behind ""Cops"" was its ability to offer visceral thrills on a budget, back in the days before everyone became an amateur camera operator thanks to cellphones.

The deeper legacy of ""Cops"" (which moved from Fox to Paramount Network, then Spike TV, in 2013) was contemplated in a 2018 article by Tim Stelloh that called the series ""the most polarizing reality TV show in America."" In that piece Rashad Robinson, executive director of the advocacy group Color of Change, said ""Cops"" represented ""the very worst of the way poverty and crime and communities of color are shown on TV.""

As noted, ""Cops"" is hardly alone in focusing on the heroic aspects of policing. But unlike scripted TV and movies -- including those that sympathetically portray officers -- it came with the imprimatur of ""reality,"" despite editorial choices and cooperative agreements with police departments that undoubtedly shaped and skewed the content.

A&E attributed the ""Live PD"" decision to ""respect for the families of George Floyd and others who have lost their lives."" Paramount had been mum about the status of Fox until Tuesday, although the program had already been removed from its website.

Some critics have called for a purge of such shows, although that seems unlikely. Several cable networks have lineups heavily devoted to true-crime fare, and practically speaking, clearing those shelves can't happen overnight. (""Cops"" reruns, incidentally, could still be viewed on stations like WGN over the weekend.)

The logical next step would be to take sober looks at the images conveyed and whether they're presented responsibly. The ""Cops"" theme song famously asks, ""Whatcha gonna do?"" At a minimum, networks seeking to demonstrate that they grasp the movement should start by doing that.",JustBadNews,0
Anger and activism grow over abuse by French police,http://pbs.org/newshour/world/anger-and-activism-grow-over-abuse-by-french-police,"PARIS (AP) — With France confined to fight the virus, a video circulated online in April showing a young man lying on the bloody ground next to two police officers — and quickly set off protests in struggling neighborhoods around the Paris region.

Sometime before, the man had been on a motorcycle. Then, he crashed into a suddenly opened police car door. Whether the door was opened on purpose or not is unclear, but what was clear was the anger the video sparked. A protest that night in the town of Villeneuve-la-Garenne led to others in a dozen Paris suburbs and similar neighborhoods around France in the ensuing days.

The relationship between police and marginalized residents of France’s low-income neighborhoods, many of whom are Arab or black and trace their roots to former French colonies, has long been tense. Safety measures intended to curb the spread of COVID-19 further empowered police — but also empowered community activists using apps or online sleuthing to track and challenge what they see as an abuse of police power.

George Floyd’s death in the U.S. has resonated especially loudly in places like Villeneuve, one of many banlieues, or suburbs, where poverty and minority populations are concentrated in France. Floyd-related protests against police violence and racial injustice have been held around France.

Thousands of people gathered in Paris once again to pay tribute to Floyd as his funeral took place in Houston, Texas on Tuesday. Waving banners and signs with “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe” written on them, participants knelt and observed silence in his memory.

“To see so many people here fuels hope, but we have to fight because it’s never a victory,” a 42-year-old artist living in Paris who goes by the professional name Fhemann said.

Denouncing police violence in the United States and in France, he said, “It’s unacceptable that young people, when they’re in contact with the police, see their life expectancy melt like snow in the sun.”

In a pivotal moment for modern France, rioting engulfed the country for three weeks in 2005 after two boys who were running from police, Zyed and Bouna, were electrocuted while hiding in a generator in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. A state of emergency was declared and almost 3,000 people were arrested.

Despite billions of euros in government improvement programs for the banlieues since 2005, tensions with police persist, and the deaths of other young men periodically rekindles anger. Protesters marching in solidarity with Floyd notably called for justice for Adama Traore, whose death in police custody in 2016 is still under investigation.

“The anger (in those neighborhoods) is so present and police impunity so frustrating that we don’t need much for it to blow up,” said Ilyes Ramdani, editor-in-chief of the Bondy Blog, which was founded in 2005 to tell the stories of young black and Arab French people in the banlieues.

Under France’s strictest virus lockdown measures, from March 17 to May 11, the government restricted people’s movements to a kilometer (half-mile) around their homes and required anyone going out to carry a signed paper stating why. Punishments included fines starting at 135 euros (about $150), or even prison.

On the first day punishments were doled out, 10% of the fines handed out across the country were given in the region of Seine-Saint-Denis on Paris’ northern edge, where unemployment is twice the national average, almost one person out of three is an immigrant, and many others are the descendants of immigrants.

Government officials defended the fines as necessary to fight the virus in a region with especially high infection rates.

But police union leader Yves Lefebvre lamented that the lockdown measures “again made the police a repressive tool.”

“Public services have deserted these neighborhoods,” and police are the only presence left, which “necessarily leads to confrontation,” he said.

Lefebvre, general secretary for Unité SGP Police-Force Ouvrière union, said trust has been broken because “police only enter those neighborhoods to restore order.”

The Villeneuve incident is being investigated by prosecutors and by the French state police watchdog agency, which said it received 166 citizen reports of problematic police behavior and seven formal complaints of police abuse during the 54-day lockdown.

Under pressure to act, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner pledged Monday to ban police chokeholds and said more officers will be equipped with cameras to help ensure that identity checks don’t lead to discrimination against minorities.

Frustrated activists are taking matters into their own hands.

At the start of the lockdown, Sihame Assbague, an anti-racial profiling activist and journalist, started to collect reports of police harassment, citing “a multiplication of police violence videos on social media.”

She’s cross-referencing and verifying about 40 cases, most of them from videos she’s received.

“I don’t expect much from the state or public authorities, but what I know is they respect strength. That’s why it’s important to organize,” she said.

Amal Bentounsi, whose brother Amine was shot in the back and killed by the police in 2012, founded a group to support families of victims and to provide legal help to bring abusive police to court. The officer who killed her brother was sentenced to a 5-year suspended prison sentence, regarded as a rare legal victory for families like hers.

In March, Bentounsi and three other families launched an app called Emergency-Police Violence designed to record abuses.

“The idea is for people to develop the habit of filming, not to make buzz, but to create a tool for citizens to contradict the police’s version of events and dissuade police who will be filmed” from abusing their authority, Bentounsi said.

Users can record arrests live, and the videos are directly uploaded onto the app’s server so they can be salvaged if the phone is seized or broken.

Since March, the app has been downloaded more than 30,000 times.

Ten shot dead in attack on Mexican drug rehab center,http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mexico-violence/ten-shot-dead-in-attack-on-mexican-drug-rehab-center-idUKKBN23E06Q?il=0,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Ten men were killed on Saturday when gunmen opened fire on a drugs rehabilitation center in the Mexican city of Irapuato, the government of Guanajuato state said.

Guanajuato, a region in central Mexico, has become one of the principal flashpoints of surging gang violence which President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to quell.

But despite lockdown measures imposed to combat the coronavirus outbreak, homicides continue to test record levels.

The state government said in a late Saturday statement that according to preliminary findings, three unidentified assailants shot up the rehab center in Irapuato, an industrial hub south of the state capital, also named Guanajuato.

Meanwhile, police are also investigating the killing of three men shot dead in a separate attack on Saturday in the city of Celaya, southeast of Irapuato, the state government said.

Rehab centers have previously been targeted by criminal gangs waging turf wars for control of the drug business.

In September 2017, at least 14 people were killed and several wounded in an attack by suspected gangsters on a drug rehab center in the northern city of Chihuahua.",JustBadNews,0

Man who pointed bow and arrow at Salt Lake City protesters charged with assault,http://cbsnews.com/news/man-who-pointed-bow-and-arrow-at-salt-lake-city-protesters-charged-with-assault/,"A Salt Lake City protest went viral on Saturday when a man got out of his car, grabbed his bow and arrow, and started to point it at a group of protesters. Now, he's facing felony charges.

Brandon McCormick has been charged with two counts of possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person, one count of aggravated assault, and one count of threatening or using a dangerous weapon in a fight, District Attorney Sim Gill said Thursday.

""These are allegations, Mr. McCormick is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law,"" Gill's statement said. ""The Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office continues to gather evidence regarding this incident.""

In a video of the incident, McCormick can be heard saying ""I'm an American. All lives matter,"" as he loads the bow. After he pointed it at the protesters surrounding his car, at least 15 people retaliated by punching, kicking, and throwing things at him, according to CBS affiliate KUTV. His vehicle was flipped and caught fire. It's unclear in the video if he fired at the group before he was attacked.

How are you gonna scream “ALL LIVES MATTER” and then proceed to shoot people with your bow and arrow

Immediately after the incident, McCormick participated in an interview with Fox affiliate KSTU. He appeared to have a black eye and a cut along his forehead. He told the Fox reporter that ""he got beat up"" when he yelled 'all lives matter,' and then again after he pulled out his weapons.

""I back up the law enforcement. I know some cops are bad. I know all racists are bad,"" he said. ""I have been marching with these people all the way down here, and all the way down here trying to convince them all lives matter.""

He said in the interview that he pulled out his bow and arrow after he was beat up through his car window, but various other videos do not appear to show such an incident happening. He does not appear to be visibly injured prior to aiming his bow at protesters.

The Salt Lake Tribune reported that McCormick has a criminal record, including charges related to a road rage incident in May. The 57-year-old spent nearly two decades in jail in California, and has been convicted of battery against a public safety officer, the Tribune reported.",JustBadNews,0
"Kensington man charged with assaulting group on Capital Crescent Trail, as seen in video",http://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/police-fire/kensington-man-charged-with-assaulting-group-on-capital-crescent-trail-as-seen-in-video/,"Kensington man charged with assaulting group on Capital Crescent Trail, as seen in video

Anthony Brennan III turned himself in Friday night; later apologized in a statement

By Dan Schere

Anthony Brennan III Photo from Park Police

This story was updated at 11:50 p.m. June 5, 2020, to include a statement released by attorneys for Anthony Brennan III.

Maryland-National Capital Park police on Friday arrested a Kensington man who they say was the bicyclist who accosted a group of young people on Monday on the Capital Crescent Trail in Bethesda.

Anthony Brennan III, 60, was arrested and charged with three counts of second-degree assault, Park Police wrote in a press release on Friday evening.

The group Brennan is accused of accosting was putting up flyers about the death of George Floyd, the black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer pinned him to the ground with his knee for almost nine minutes.

A video posted to social media shows a male bicyclist accosting a young woman while another young woman screams at him to “get off of her.” The man then grabs his bike and rushes toward the young man who is filming. He then appears to fall to the ground.

Park Police wrote on Friday that detectives received hundreds of tips from the community over the last few days and used “various sources” to develop Brennan as a suspect. Police wrote that they got in touch with Brennan and his “legal counsel” earlier on Friday.

Brennan consented to have Park Police and the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s office search his home. Police then obtained and served an arrest warrant before Brennan turned himself in to police, the press release says.

Statement

Friday night, attorneys Andrew Jezic and David Moyse released a statement, in which they speak on Brennan’s behalf, then Brennan apologizes for what happened. It starts:

“Anthony Brennan recognizes that his outrageous behavior toward the young adult victims on the Crescent Trail was unacceptable and wrong.

“The outrage felt in our community and across our country is completely justified.

“Unfortunately, several innocent people were also victimized by having been erroneously identified online, and their reputations were tarnished.

“Mr. Brennan understands that his apology will not be enough to right his wrongs:”

Then, in a section in which comments from Brennan are quoted, it says:

“I am sick with remorse for the pain and fear I caused the victims on the trail, and online. I am cooperating fully with authorities. I am committed to making amends by addressing, through counseling, the underlying issues that led to my abhorrent behavior.

“I am dedicated to working with the Montgomery County State Attorney’s Office to provide peace to our community and justice to the victims in the video, as well as to all victims of racism and police brutality.”

Viral video

Park Police said that around 12:45 p.m. on Monday, three “young adults,” including one male and two females, were walking near the Dalecarlia Tunnel near the Brookmont area. The press release said a bicyclist started arguing with the three people, who were posting flyers.

In addition to Park Police, Maryland State Police, Montgomery County State’s Attorney John McCarthy and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh all became involved in the case.

The video has gone viral on social media, garnering about 27 million views as of 7:30 p.m. Friday. Multiple national media outlets have picked up the story, and various theories were floated as to who the bicyclist is.

Speculation first circulated on Twitter Thursday that the bicyclist was Peter Weinberg, a Bethesda resident and head of an investment firm.

Weinberg, on Friday, shared a report from Park Police that stated he had been ruled out as a suspect. He also wrote on social media that “I recently learned I have been misidentified in connection with a deeply disturbing attack. Please know this was not me. I have been in touch with the authorities and will continue to help any way possible.”

Later on Friday, Montgomery County police disputed rumors that the bicyclist was a former department employee.

Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Chief David Huchler wrote in a tweet on Friday that there was speculation that the bicyclist is a former employee.

“This person has not worked for MWAA since August 2018,” he posted, directing all questions to park police.

In an interview with NBC 4, the young man who videotaped the encounter, said the bicyclist grabbed his bike, ran it into him and pinned him to the ground.

NBC 4 reported that the young man was part of a project in which people post “flyers in affluent neighborhoods to bring attention to racial injustice.”

The news segment flashed to a sign reading “A man was lynched by the police. What are you doing about it”?

The young man told NBC 4 that the bicyclist — who was wearing a helmet, cycling shorts and sunglasses — swore at him, accused the group of inciting riots and called them “deviants.”

Floyd’s death has sparked numerous protests in cities across the country, including several in Montgomery County.

A 16-second version of the Capital Crescent Trail video was posted in the online community Reddit on Monday. The person who posted it wrote that two friends who were also there did not want the full version posted.

However, by Thursday, a 34-second version also was posted in Reddit and was circulating widely.

The longer clip starts with the bicyclist turning to walk away from one young woman as he focuses on the other and walks toward her. The first young woman yells, “Do not touch her! Do not touch her!” as a male voice says, “Leave her alone.”

As the man gets close to the second young woman, the first young woman screams, “She has nothing! Do not touch her, sir!” The male tells the man, “Walk away.”

The bicyclist confronts the other young woman and tries to grab something in her hands, forcefully using both of his hands on her. The first young woman jumps in, pushes the bicyclist’s arm and screams, “Get off of her!” The bicyclist takes a few steps back.

Within seconds, he grabs a bicycle and comes rushing at the young man who is filming. Shortly after that, the young man was on the ground and the camera was aimed at the ground. As the clip ends, there was one last exchange, with a male voice demanding, “Give me the f—— tape.”

"Death of man in Tacoma, Wash., who said 'I can't breathe' in police custody ruled a homicide",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/death-man-tacoma-wash-who-said-i-can-t-breathe-n1225601,"The mayor of Tacoma, Washington, called for the city manager to fire four police officers after the death of a black man in custody was ruled a homicide.

Manuel Ellis, 33, died on March 3 after being handcuffed and restrained by officers. He could be heard on police scanner traffic saying “I can’t breathe,” after he was handcuffed, and he died at the scene, according to NBC News affiliate KING in Seattle.

A Pierce County Medical Examiner’s Office ruling released this week said Ellis died of respiratory arrest due to hypoxia as a result of physical restraint, KING reported. Contributing factors included methamphetamine intoxication and dilated cardiomyopathy, commonly known as an enlarged heart.

Manuel Ellis died in Tacoma, Wash., in March while in police custody. via GoFundMe

Mayor Victoria Woodards called for the officers' firing at a news conference streamed on Facebook on Thursday. ""Today, it stops in Tacoma,"" Woodards said. ""We live in a nation where too many black lives have been lost, and I don’t want to see another one,""

Referring to a video that surfaced of the arrest, the mayor said, ""As an African American woman, I didn’t need a video to believe,"" she said, adding, ""It does take a video for so many people to believe the truth about systemic racism and its violent impact on black lives.""

Tacoma is among the many cities across the country that have seen waves of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody more than a week ago.

The video that appears to show Ellis' detainment was taken by an anonymous passerby from a vehicle and seems to show two officers punching and then slamming a man to the ground.

The footage was posted on social media by the Tacoma Action Collective and contains profanity and images that viewers might find disturbing. NBC News does not know what occurred before the events in the video.

Police have said that two officers encountered Ellis at 11:22 p.m. as he was walking home and allegedly harassing a woman at an intersection.

When the officers asked what he was doing, police said Ellis claimed he had warrants and wanted to talk to them. Then Ellis repeatedly struck their patrol car, prompting the officers to call for backup before engaging in a struggle to detain him, police said.

“He picked up the officer by his vest and slam-dunked him on the ground,” said Ed Troyer, spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department.

There was a struggle before police got Ellis handcuffed on the ground and officers called for paramedics at 11:25 p.m.

Ellis stopped breathing and lost consciousness within a minute of firefighters' arriving, and he was pronounced dead at the scene. His cause of death was initially listed as pending while medical examiners ran toxicology tests.

The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the incident and plans to turn the case over to the county prosecutor next week, KING reported.

The four officers involved were initially placed on administrative leave after Ellis’ death, but were later allowed to continue working. After the medical examiner’s results were released, the officers were again placed on administrative leave, KING reported.

Tacoma Police Chief Don Ramsdell could not immediately be reached Friday morning to comment on the mayor's call for the officers to be fired.

Ramsdell said in a statement Thursday that the department put the officers on leave while the agency waits for the sheriff's office to complete the investigation.""We are committed to the investigative process and the integrity of the findings,"" the police chief said. ""Our hope is that any investigations bring with them answers for everyone involved.""

Tacoma police identified the four officers involved in restraining Ellis as Christopher Burbank, Matthew Collins, Masyih Ford and Timothy Rankine.

In a statement sent to NBC News, union representatives expressed concern that a decision was made on the officers’ fate before the investigation is complete.

”Without any facts, without an investigation, without due process, and with less than a minute of short, blurry, partial Twitter videos in hand, the mayor passed judgment on the actions of four Tacoma Police Officers,” the statement said. “She called them criminals. She called for their prosecution. She called for their termination from employment. And she called for all of these things without an ounce of evidence to support her words beyond misplaced rage.”

Ellis's family spoke at a news conference flanked by community organizers and civil rights leaders to demand an investigation by the state attorney general.

His mother, Marcia Carter, gave an emotional account of her last conversation with her son: “Those were the last words I heard my son say to me: ‘I love you, Mom. I love you, Mom.’ And I can't hear that ever again. I won't be able to hear that.""",JustBadNews,0
This is Huge': Move to Defund Police Gains Support Nationwide,http://commondreams.org/news/2020/06/04/huge-move-defund-police-gains-support-nationwide,"As law enforcement officers across the country continue to brutalize peaceful demonstrators in the nationwide protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week, support for defunding the police is rising as Americans become increasingly fed up with the institution's racism and violence.

""In moments of crisis, people want services and resources that go directly to help people rather than police that surveil, brutalize, and kill us,"" Black Lives Matter LA co-founder Melina Abdullah told the Guardian.

The murder of Floyd by four Minneapolis police officers on May 25 served as the catalyst for the uprising that has filled city streets around the nation with unprecedented numbers of protesters.

As Common Dreams reported Wednesday, polling this week shows a majority of Americans believe both the anger and the actions of the protesters are at least partially justified—including the burning of the Minneapolis Police Department Third Precinct building last week.

Activists have long called for defunding the police as part of the solution to the institution's myriad problems. Long seen as a fringe position by more mainstream liberals and conservatives, the call to defund is now seeing widespread support among the public and politicians alike.

Some folks are genuinely trying to understand what we mean when we say “Defund Police”. Examples below https://t.co/0ryDrHximN — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) June 4, 2020

""We need to defund the police and make sure that money goes back into the communities that need it,"" said Cori Bush, a progressive candidate running for Missouri's 1st District House seat, in a statement.

""We have to end the militarization of police, stop the racial profiling,"" Bush added. ""Throwing money at the problem will not solve it.""

According to Rolling Stone:

As the protests continue around the country, activists in New York, where the police department’s budget is poised to swell to nearly $6 billion in 2021, and Los Angeles, where LAPD's funding was increased this year to $1.8 billion, are mounting their own defunding campaigns. The first step for anyone interested in pushing for a re-thinking of their city's priorities is to get involved in the budgeting process by attending city council meetings and speaking. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human rights had a toolkit, praised earlier this week by former President Barack Obama, with more resources and information on how to get involved.

The increasing support comes as images and videos of police attacking peaceful protesters and innocent bystanders continue to spread across social media as demonstrations entered their tenth consecutive day Thursday.

Alex Vitale, writer of the book ""The End of Policing,"" said in an interview with The Nation Thursday that he believes the funding for police departments should instead be put toward community service jobs.

""The police department and the corrections department are always hiring and community centers aren't,"" said Vitale. ""And when they do hire, it's at half the salary and half the benefits. So this budget battle is about getting cities to reprioritize how they deal with the very real needs of the most disadvantaged communities that are subjected to the most intensive policing.""

The speed with which public opinion has turned on the issue didn't surprise Tony Williams, a member of Minneapolis-based abolitionist group MPD150, who noted the increasing nationwide anger over the high number of police killings of unarmed black men since 2015.

"Australia's Great Barrier Reef suffers most extensive coral bleaching.

February 2020 was the hottest month on record since records began in 1900, Terry Hughes, Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, told Reuters.

“We saw record-breaking temperatures all along the length of the Great Barrier Reef, there wasn’t a cool portion in the north, or a cool portion in the south this time around,” Hughes said.

“The whole Barrier Reef was hot so the bleaching we have seen this year is the most extensive so far.”

Hughes added that he is now almost certain that the Reef is not going to recover to what it looked like even five years ago, not to mention thirty years ago.

If the global warming trends continue the Great Barrier Reef will be destroyed, he said.

“We will have some sort of tropical ecosystem, but it won’t look like coral reef, there might be more seaweed, more sponges, a lot less coral, but it will be a very different ecosystem.”

As anti-Muslim hate speech is on the rise in the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a recent video of a doctor making Islamophobic comments has gone viral on social media.

Dr Aarti Lal Chandani, the Dean of Kanpur’s Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College can be seen ranting against Muslim patients of COVID-19, saying ‘it is useless wasting medical resources, manpower and testing kits on them.’

Support TwoCircles



The video, originally a camera recording from the hospital premises appears to be a discussion on solutions to curb the virus infection where Dr Aarti is using insulting and Islamophobic comments against Muslims calling them “terrorists” and that they should be “beaten” instead of being taken care of in hospitals and fed or treated. According to her, this is an example of how India’s energy being wasted on Muslim patients while they “deserve to be kept inside solitary confinements and not in quarantine centres.”

Adding to the shock is when Aarti, a doctor on the frontline at the time of a global health crisis, can be seen making no objections with the idea of “killing Muslim patients” by injecting them with some kind of drugs when another person suggests the procedure (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvDvF-Ck7sE).

She says that the BJP government should not give “VIP treatment” or “exhaust our resources on them,” revealing that in a conversation with the health minister, Dr Harshvardhan, she was informed that the Centre “was appeasing Muslims by arranging for their medical requirements.”

Dr Aarti had earlier accused the Tablighi Jamaat members of misbehaving with medical staff.

Israel renews racist marriage law,http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/israel-renews-racist-marriage-law,"Israel’s version of apartheid can be more subtle than South Africa’s, but the goal is fundamentally the same: ethno-racial gerrymandering, segregation and domination. Picture-Alliance/DPA

Israel this week renewed one of the most overtly racist of the dozens of laws on its books that discriminate against Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel.

The “Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law” prohibits Israeli citizens who marry Palestinians from the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip, or nationals from several other regional states, from living with their spouse in Israel.

“The law affects tens of thousands of Palestinian families on both sides of the Green Line between Israel and the West Bank, preventing Palestinians from legally moving into Israel to join their spouses,” according to Adalah, an advocacy group that has mounted unsuccessful court challenges to the law.

Originally passed as an emergency measure in 2003, the provision has been renewed annually ever since.

The law is part of Israel’s efforts to prevent the growth of the Palestinian population, a fundamentally racist measure justified by Israeli leaders as necessary to maintain a Jewish majority.

Zvi Hauser, the head of the foreign affairs and defense committee of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, said the renewal was justified by Israel’s recently passed Nation-State of the Jewish People law, which legal advocates say violates international prohibitions on apartheid.

In intent and effect the Israeli citizenship law is no different to the laws that used to exist in apartheid South Africa to prevent miscegenation, the “interbreeding” of people of different races, and to control where Black people could live – laws such as the Group Areas Act and the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act.

While the Israeli law does not ban marriages outright, it does effectively prevent Israeli citizens and Palestinians from exercising their right to family life.

It aims to achieve precisely the same goal, albeit by slightly more subtle means than used by the white supremacists in South Africa, as I explain in my 2014 book The Battle for Justice in Palestine.

Racial gerrymandering

Israel initially justified the marriage law on the grounds of “security,” an excuse dismissed by Human Rights Watch.

Human Rights Watch said in 2012 that the “sweeping ban” without “any individual assessments of whether the person in question could threaten security, is unjustified” and “imposes severely disproportionate harm on the right of Palestinians and Israeli citizens to live with their families.”

The discrimination in the law could be measured “by its effects on Palestinian citizens of Israel as opposed to Jewish citizens,” it added.

Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister at the time, admitted the true purpose of the law in 2005.

“There is no need to hide behind security arguments,” Sharon said. “There is a need for the existence of a Jewish state.”

“National suicide”

The racist demographic purpose of the law was reaffirmed in 2012 when the Israeli high court threw out Adalah’s challenge.

“Human rights are not a prescription for national suicide,” wrote Judge Asher Grunis for the 6-5 majority.

Effectively endorsing racial gerrymandering, the court’s ruling added that “the right to a family life does not necessarily have to be realized within the borders of Israel.”

Note the stark similarity of the terms used by Israel’s highest court to the words of South Africa’s apartheid Prime Minister Daniel Malan, who said in 1953 that “equality… must inevitably mean to white South Africa nothing less than national suicide.”

Palestinians affected have campaigned to raise awareness of the racist law by talking about the challenge it poses to “Love in the Time of Apartheid.”",JustBadNews,0
"According to Minnesota Felony Murder Law, all four officers should be indicted for murder",http://open.lib.umn.edu/criminallaw/chapter/9-4-felony-murder/,"9.4 Felony Murder

Learning Objectives Define the criminal intent element required for felony murder. Compare the criminal intent element of felony murder to implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life. Explain the rule of co-felon liability for felony murder. Explain an exception to the rule of co-felon liability for felony murder. Analyze criminal responsibility for felony murder when someone other than a co-felon kills the victim. Analyze criminal responsibility for felony murder when someone other than a co-felon kills a co-felon. Describe concurrence of the felony and the homicide for felony murder. Analyze felony murder grading and ascertain the felonies that typically classify felony murder as first degree.

Felony murder is a criminal homicide that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a felony. Most states and the federal government include felony murder in their penal codes (18 U.S.C., 2011). However, it has not been universally adopted. The Model Penal Code does not include felony murder per se. It does suggest a rebuttable presumption that killings that occur during the commission of specified dangerous felonies exhibit recklessness under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life (Model Penal Code § 210.2(1)(b)).

Felony Murder Intent What distinguishes felony murder from murder is the absence of the typical murder intent. The criminal intent element required for felony murder is the intent required for a felony that causes a victim’s death. Explanation of Felony Murder Intent When the defendant commits a felony that is inherently dangerous to life, he or she does so knowing that some innocent victim may die. In essence, this awareness is similar to implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. What is difficult to justify is a conviction for felony murder when the felony is not inherently dangerous to life. Thus most jurisdictions limit the felony murder doctrine to felonies that create a foreseeable risk of violence or death. States that include nonviolent felonies in their felony murder statutes generally grade them as second- or third-degree felony murder (Fla. Stat. Ann., 2010). Example of Felony Murder Intent Joaquin, who has just lost his job, decides to burn down his apartment building because he can’t afford to pay the rent. Joaquin carefully soaks his apartment with lighter fluid, exits into the hallway, and throws a lit, lighter-fluid-soaked towel into the apartment. He then runs outside to watch the entire building burn down. Several tenants die of smoke inhalation because of the fire. In jurisdictions that recognize felony murder, Joaquin can probably be charged with and convicted of murder for every one of these deaths. In this example, Joaquin did not intend to kill the tenants. However, he did most likely have the criminal intent necessary for arson. Therefore, felony murder convictions are appropriate. Note that Joaquin exhibited extreme indifference to whether the tenants in the building lived or died, which could also constitute the criminal intent of implied malice or depraved heart.

Liability of Co-Felons for Felony Murder It is common for more than one defendant to cooperate in the commission of a felony. Group participation in criminal conduct could constitute more than one crime—for example, conspiracy—and could also place criminal responsibility squarely on a defendant who did not commit the criminal act. The general rule for felony murder in many jurisdictions is that if one defendant kills a victim during the commission or attempted commission of a specified felony, all defendants involved in the felony are guilty of felony murder (State v. Hoang, 2011). Example of Co-Felon Liability for Felony Murder Joe and Jane dream up a plan to rob a local bank. Joe is designated as the primary robber and is supposed to enter the bank and hand a note to the teller demanding all the money in her station. Jane’s role in the felony is to drive the getaway vehicle to the bank, wait outside the front door with the motor running, and transport Joe and the money back to their apartment after the bank transaction is completed. Joe takes a handgun hidden beneath his jacket into the bank. He passes the note to the teller, and she frantically summons a security guard. As the security guard starts to approach, Joe pulls out the gun. An elderly lady standing to the left of Joe suffers a heart attack and dies at the sight of the gun. In this case, Joe and Jane can probably be convicted of felony murder. Note that Jane did nothing to directly cause the victim’s death from a heart attack. However, Jane did drive the getaway vehicle with the criminal intent to commit robbery, so Jane is criminally responsible for the consequences in many jurisdictions. Exception to Co-Felon Liability for Felony Murder Some jurisdictions provide an exception to co-felon liability for felony murder if the defendant did not actually commit the act that killed the victim and had neither knowledge nor awareness that a death might occur (N.Y. Penal Law, 2010). Example of the Exception to Co-Felon Liability for Felony Murder Review the example with Joe and Jane in Section 9 “Example of Co-Felon Liability for Felony Murder”. Change this example so that Jane is a teller at the local bank. Joe and Jane plan the “robbery” so that Jane is to pretend Joe is a customer, and hand Joe all the money in her station after he enters the bank unarmed and passes her a phony check made out to “cash.” Without informing Jane, Joe brings a gun into the bank, “just in case.” The security guard observes Jane handing Joe large amounts of cash. Suspicious, he begins to approach the station. Joe notices and frantically pulls out the gun and points it at the security guard. The elderly lady standing to the left of Joe suffers a heart attack and dies at the sight of the gun. In this example, Jane may have a valid defense to co-felon liability for the elderly lady’s death in some jurisdictions. Although Jane had the intent to commit theft, a trier of fact could determine that Jane had neither the knowledge nor awareness that a death might occur because she believed she was cooperating in a nonviolent offense. Thus it is possible that in certain jurisdictions only Joe is subject to a conviction of felony murder in this case.

Liability When Someone Other than the Defendant Kills the Victim Generally, if the felony is inherently dangerous to life, and the defendant or defendants intentionally create a situation that is likely to result in death, if death does result, each and every defendant is guilty of felony murder. In some jurisdictions, this criminal liability exists even when someone other than a co-felon kills the victim (People v. Hernandez, 2010). Review the bank robbery committed by Joe and Jane, as discussed in Section 9 “Example of Co-Felon Liability for Felony Murder”. If the security guard takes a shot at Joe but misses and kills the bank teller instead, both Joe and Jane are guilty of the bank teller’s death pursuant to this interpretation of the felony-murder doctrine. Some jurisdictions relieve a defendant from criminal liability for felony murder if the death is the death of a co-felon, rather than a completely innocent victim (State v. Canola, 2010). In the case of Joe and Jane discussed in Section 9 “Example of Co-Felon Liability for Felony Murder”, if the security guard shoots and kills Joe in a jurisdiction that recognizes this exception, Jane is not guilty of felony murder.

Concurrence of the Felony and the Death of the Victim Another important aspect that must be analyzed in any felony murder case is the concurrence of the felony and the death of the victim. The felony and the death must be part and parcel of the same continuous transaction. Therefore, there must be a determination of (1) when the felony begins and (2) when the felony ends. If the death occurs before or after the commission or attempted commission of the felony, the defendant might not be guilty of felony murder. Example of a Death That Occurs before the Felony Begins Carlos shoots and kills his drug dealer in a fit of temper because the drugs he bought are placebo. After the killing, it occurs to Carlos that the drug dealer might be carrying significant amounts of cash. Carlos thereafter steals some cash from the drug dealer’s pockets and runs off. Although this killing is probably murder, it is not felony murder. Carlos stole money from his drug dealer, but the theft occurred after the murder. Thus the killing did not happen during a robbery. If premeditation is proven, this could still be first-degree murder, but it is not first-degree felony murder. Death That Occurs after the Felony Ends More commonly, the issue is whether the killing occurs after the felony ends. The general rule is that the felony ends when the defendant has reached a place of temporary safety (People v. Young, 2010). This place does not have to be the defendant’s residence; it could simply be a hiding place. Pursuant to this rule, a death that occurs during a car chase as the defendants flee the scene of the crime is considered felony murder (Del. Code Ann. Tit. 11, 2011). Figure 9.5 Diagram of Felony Murder

Felony Murder Grading Felony murder can be first, second, or third degree (Fla. Stat. Ann., 2010). Some common examples of felonies listed in first-degree murder statutes are arson, rape, carjacking, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, and certain forcible sexual felonies (Cal. Penal Code, 2010). Key Takeaways The criminal intent element required for felony murder is the intent required for the underlying felony, not murder intent.

If a felony is inherently dangerous to life, the defendant may act with implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly manifesting extreme indifference to human life when committing or attempting to commit the felony.

If more than one defendant commits or attempts to commit a felony, all defendants are guilty of felony murder if a victim is killed during the commission or attempted commission of the felony.

Some jurisdictions will not find a co-felon criminally responsible for felony murder if the co-felon did not commit the act of killing and was unaware that there was a risk of death.

In some jurisdictions, all co-felons are criminally responsible for felony murder when someone other than a co-felon kills a victim during the commission or attempted commission of a felony that is inherently dangerous to life.

In some jurisdictions, all co-felons are not criminally responsible for felony murder when someone other than a co-felon kills a co-felon during the commission or attempted commission of a felony.

The killing must take place during the commission or attempted commission of a felony for the felony murder rule to apply.

Felony murder can be first, second, or third degree. Typical felonies that classify felony murder as first degree are arson, rape, carjacking, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, and certain forcible sexual felonies. Exercises Answer the following questions. Check your answers using the answer key at the end of the chapter. Read People v. Anderson, 666 N.W.2d 696 (2003). Did the Minnesota Supreme Court uphold a charge of second-degree felony murder when the underlying felonies were possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a stolen firearm? The case is available at this link: http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/6/628.html. Kurt robs a convenience store at gunpoint. As the cashier hands him money out of the cash register, Kurt hears a siren and runs outside, stuffing the money in his pockets. He sees a dark alley and dashes into it. While he crouches there waiting for the police to leave, a homeless person living in the alley taps him on the shoulder. Startled, Kurt spins around and shoots and kills the homeless person. Is this felony murder? Explain your answer. Read Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982). In Enmund, the US Supreme Court held that the death penalty is unconstitutional in a felony murder case for one who neither took life, attempted to take life, nor intended to take life. On which part of the Constitution did the Court rely in reaching this holding? The case is available at this link: http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0458_0782_ZO.html.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam’s most gravely-ill COVID-19 patient, a British pilot who works for its national airline, has started to recover from the illness and may no longer require a lung transplant, state media said on Wednesday.

Vietnam, which has reported no deaths from the coronavirus, has mounted an all-out effort to save the 43-year-old man, who has been identified officially by the government as “Patient 91”.

Until recently, the Vietnam Airlines pilot was thought by doctors and officials to be in urgent need of a lung transplant.

The fate of “Patient 91” has received unprecedented national attention, with more than 50 people in Vietnam offering themselves as potential lung donors, according to state media.

The man, who is being treated at a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, can now smile, shake hands and respond to commands from hospital staff, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said on Wednesday.

His reliance on artificial life support has also been reduced but he is still on a ventilator to allow his badly-damaged lungs to recover, VNA said.

He has tested negative for the coronavirus, and Vietnam has spent more than $215,000 treating him, the report added.

Through aggressive testing and a mass, centralised quarantine programme, Vietnam has successfully contained the spread of the novel coronavirus, putting it on course to revive its economy much sooner than most others.

Vietnam’s second most serious case, “Patient 19”, was discharged from hospital on Wednesday. Of Vietnam’s 328 coronavirus cases, 90% have recovered.",JustBadNews,0

EU official calls Floyd's death an abuse of power,http://ctvnews.ca/world/eu-official-calls-floyd-s-death-an-abuse-of-power-1.4964851,"PARIS -- Tear gas choked Paris streets as riot police faced off with protesters setting fires Tuesday amid growing global outrage over George Floyd's death in the United States, racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics around the world.

French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody.

Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading ""Restaurant Open"" -- on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown.

Chanting ""I can't breathe,"" thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday.

Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death.

Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond.

As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries.

""This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,"" Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, ""all blacks live this to a degree.""

Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden.

But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice.

As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille.

The demonstrations were held in honour of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death.

The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened.

The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition.

Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe.""

""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards.

As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere.

""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here.""

Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere.

""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. ""But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.""

More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday.

The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power.

Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.""

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate.""

""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said.

More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd.

""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught.

Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.""

Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin colour ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""

Blame game

The Washington Post and the New York Times are still maintaining double standards in their reporting on Hong Kong and US turmoil.Reporting on an illegal assembly in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the Washington Post quoted a few lines from Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam before one-sidedly reporting from anti-government protesters' perspective on clashes between anti-government protesters and police, and the report used many pictures to show ""the violence"" used by the police without introducing the violence done by the rioters.Reporting on the Minneapolis events that same day, the Washington Post quoted Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urging protesters to be calm and warning against violence. That report didn't include interviews with US protesters.""The police law enforcement in Hong Kong is much more civilized and restrained than what the US police and National Guard do to American protesters,"" as the US police even arrested CNN reporters and even used armored vehicles to confront the civilians, Lü Xiang, a research fellow on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, said, ""The nationwide riots caused by a racial problem once again proved the US is unqualified to criticize other countries on human rights issues.""Some US politicians and media outlets always use human rights to interfere in other country's domestic affairs, said Diao.""Their interferences always worsened the peace and stability for the region. When it comes to their own country, they are showing their hypocrisy.""Under the chaotic situation across the country, some US officials even tried to play the blame game again just as what they said to blame others on COVID-19. US leaders at federal, state and local levels alleged ""outsiders"" had seized upon protests begun by Minnesotans to advance their own political agendas, the Washington Post reported as unrest continued in Minneapolis on Saturday US time.However, US officials offered little evidence to show who was responsible and they contradicted one another on who was to blame, the report noted. Some observers believed that US officials are trying to blame China and Russia again.Lü said, ""The riots in Hong Kong have impacted by foreign forces and separatism, and encouraged by the US and its allies. But the demonstrations in the US are caused by the people's natural anger on long-standing racial problems and the White House's failure in handling over the COVID-19 that has caused more 100,000 deaths.""""US politicians won't stand with the protesters but criticize their own government too much this time as the riots are harming their own economy,"" he noted.

US got sick

Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television commented on the US riots in its daily 7 pm news show, calling the current situation in the US ""a glass of bitter wine brewed by the US itself.""Lü said, ""When US politicians and mainstream media comment on riots in another country, they should notice their words might inspire or encourage their own people, so when they praised the moves to attack the police and burned public facilities and national flags, Americans are also listening.""Next time, when Pelosi and other US politicians comment on Hong Kong, they should think twice.""US President Donald Trump has threatened to send in the military, warning the ""thugs"" involved in the riots that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" on his Twitter account on Friday.Lü said Trump was actually using the riots to eke out support as the more riots on the streets, the more Americans want tough action. ""So he is actually provoking the protesters.""Lü further said that with the impact of COVID-19 and the riots, the US economy will be largely damaged this year and the Trump administration's hostile moves against China will lessen as the sanctions against Chinese firms in the US and Hong Kong will worsen the US economy.""Trump will talk more, but do less on challenging China,"" he said.",JustBadNews,0
"China's rich skirting Hong Kong to seek asset safety elsewhere.More than half of Hong Kong's estimated private wealth of over $1 trillion is from mainland individuals who have parked money there, according to bankers.",http://reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-china-wealth/chinas-rich-skirting-hong-kong-to-seek-asset-safety-elsewhere-idUSKBN2340QC?il=0,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Rich Chinese are expected to park fewer funds in Hong Kong on worries that Beijing’s proposed national security law for the city could allow mainland authorities to track and seize their wealth, bankers and other industry sources said.

More than half of Hong Kong’s estimated private wealth of over $1 trillion is from mainland individuals who have parked money there, according to bankers.

The city has benefited from its proximity to China and separate legal system, as well as its dollar-pegged currency, but there are now worries about it losing its edge as a global financial centre due to capital and talent flight.

Interviews with half a dozen bankers and headhunters have revealed that some Chinese clients are looking for other hubs as their main offshore wealth base with Singapore, Switzerland and London high on the list.

One Chinese client who had been scouting investments in Hong Kong instead bought five apartments this week in Singapore via a newly set up family office, said the person’s adviser with a European wealth manager.

“Singapore has been on their radar for a while now, but Hong Kong has been the default booking centre for them,” said the Singapore-based banker, who, like his industry colleagues, declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter.

He said his bank had begun receiving inquiries from Chinese high net worth individuals (HNIs) about opening accounts outside Hong Kong.

“Chinese HNIs like the law from the perspective of their love for the Chinese flag, but not from their asset protection perspective.”

In another example, the founder of a Hong Kong-based boutique wealth manager focused on helping Chinese clients set up family offices said his firm was in partnership talks with two Dubai-based banks after receiving inquiries about setting up investment vehicles there.

The expected shift has led some wealth managers to tap corporate recruiters to help hire Mandarin-speaking client advisers in other locations including Singapore and Switzerland, said the sources.

SECOND IN WEALTH

Globally, Hong Kong ranked second in wealth per adult after Switzerland in mid-2019, and 10th in the number of people with more than $50 million in assets, according to a Credit Suisse report.

The city competes with Singapore to be considered Asia’s premier financial centre. Global private banks including Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and UBS, as well as Asian wealth managers have operations in both hubs.

A planned law last year that would have allowed extradition to China from Hong Kong was shelved after months of increasingly violent protests, but it sent shivers through the city’s wealthy who feared Beijing could have used it to freeze assets. Some went so far as to move funds.

Now the proposed security law is triggering concerns about the semi-autonomous city’s freedoms and particularly, the legal protections it offers.

The specifics of the new bill remain unclear. It is meant to tackle secession, subversion and terrorism and it could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in Hong Kong.

China has previously targeted mainland citizens in Hong Kong, mostly as part of corruption investigations, but there hasn’t been a large public seizure of assets in the city.

“Now, it may just be that there will be more of a process around these things (after the imposition of the law),” said a wealth manager, whose firm manages over $200 billion in assets.",JustBadNews,0
Minneapolis mayor calls for white police officer to be charged in black man's death,http://reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police/minneapolis-mayor-calls-for-white-police-officer-to-be-charged-in-black-mans-death-idUSKBN2332G9,"MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Protesters clashed with riot police firing tear gas for a second night in Minneapolis on Wednesday in an outpouring of rage over the death of a black man seen in a widely circulated video gasping for breath as a white officer knelt on his neck.

The video, taken by an onlooker to Monday night’s fatal encounter between police and George Floyd, 46, showed him lying face down and handcuffed, groaning for help and repeatedly saying, “please, I can’t breathe,” before growing motionless.

The second day of demonstrations, accompanied by looting and vandalism, began hours after Mayor Jacob Frey urged prosecutors to file criminal charges against the white policeman shown pinning Floyd to the street.

Floyd, who was unarmed and reportedly suspected of trying to pass counterfeit bills at a corner eatery, was taken by ambulance from the scene of his arrest and pronounced dead the same night at a hospital.

The policeman shown kneeling on Floyd’s neck and three fellow officers involved were dismissed from the police department on Tuesday as the FBI opened an investigation.

Hundreds of protesters, many with faces covered, thronged streets around the Third Precinct police station late on Wednesday, about half a mile from where Floyd had been arrested, chanting, “No justice, no peace” and “I can’t breathe.”

The crowd grew to thousands as night fell and the protest turned into a standoff outside the station, where police in riot gear formed barricade lines while protesters taunted them from behind makeshift barricades of their own.

Police, some taking positions on rooftops, used tear gas, plastic bullets and concussion grenades to keep the crowds at bay. Protesters pelted police with rocks and other projectiles. Some threw tear gas canisters back at the officers.

Television news images from a helicopter over the area showed dozens of people looting a Target TGT.N store, running out with clothing and shopping carts full of merchandise.

Fires erupted after dark at several businesses, including an auto parts store. Eyewitnesses said the blazes appeared to be the work of arsonists. Media said a smaller, peaceful protest was held outside the home of one of the police officers.

ANGER ON THE WEST COAST

Outrage at Floyd’s death also triggered a rally in his name against police brutality by hundreds of people in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon.

That demonstration turned violent after a crowd marched onto a nearby freeway and blocked traffic, then attacked two California Highway Patrol cruisers, smashing their windows, local media reported. One protester who clung to the hood of a patrol car fell to the pavement as it sped away, and was treated at the scene by paramedics, news footage of the incident showed.

The video of Monday’s deadly confrontation between Minneapolis police and Floyd led Mayor Frey to call on Wednesday for Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman “to charge the arresting officer in this case”.

The city identified the four officers as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. It did not say who knelt on Floyd’s neck, and gave no further information.

The local police union said the officers were cooperating with investigators and cautioned against a “rush to judgment”.

“We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner’s report,” the union statement said.

The county attorney’s office said it would decide how to proceed once investigators had concluded their inquiries.

The case was reminiscent of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City who died after being put in a banned police chokehold.

Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement calling attention to a wave of killings of African-Americans by police using unjustified lethal force.",JustBadNews,0

Blokes from Aussie hippie town accidentally become a Russian sensation - How Australia's 'fake genuine Russian choir' Dustyesky went viral during the coronavirus pandemic,http://abc.net.au/news/2020-05-25/australian-fake-russian-choir-dustyesky-goes-viral-mullumbimby/12270670,"On the breakwater at the surf beach in Brunswick Heads a group of men are reverently singing a rousing Russian revolutionary song. They are dressed as Russian workers, in cloth caps.

There is emotional conviction and Russian passion in this song about solidarity. But, in fact, none of these comrades have ever been anywhere near the Motherland, seen a windswept steppe, or traversed a frozen tundra. Nor do any of them speak Russian (although they do like a vodka).

In his impressive fake Russian accent, master of ceremonies for the choir, Mark Swivel, explains: ""Dustyesky is the leading genuine fake Russian choir in southern hemisphere.

""We are 28 men, middle-aged, very hairy, and we all live outside the tiny little hamlet of Mullumbimby or, as we call it, Mullumgrad.

""And all of us singing like we know the language and the words.""



These comrades may not be Russian, but they have the patriotic passion to sing the traditional folk songs. ( Supplied: Jeff Dawson )

Mullumbimby is a small, subtropical town near Byron Bay in northern New South Wales. A freewheeling place of yoga, marijuana, veggies and decidedly alternative ways of being.

Not an easy place, then, to summon the suffering in the songs of the battlefields, the despair of the proletarian worker. But Mark says the songs ""pick you up, they make you sing them, they sweep you away"".

A choirmaster and vodka headache

It all began as a bit of a sing and a few beers at the RSL on Tuesday nights.

""They had to come up with these elaborate excuses to leave the house,"" local writer and comedian Mandy Nolan tells Australian Story.

""They all live in relationships where they have to co-parent and do half the cooking. You don't just go out to the pub with these dudes, you've got to have an excuse. And a Russian choir, that’s it.""

But then they accidentally went viral, were picked up by Russian television and are now known to millions of Russian people.

The idea came from ""comrade"" Glenn Wright, a former co-owner and talent booker for Sydney's Harbourside Brasserie, who moved to Byron Shire and started the Mullum Music Festival.

""I've had a longstanding love affair with the music of Russia, the great Russian composers and also the marching army songs,"" he says.

Glenn wanted a Russian choir for the festival but couldn't afford to fly one out, so he hatched the idea of creating one locally.

It was 2:00am at a party when they were drinking vodka that Glenn ran into Andrew Swain, an actual choirmaster. ""That was when he asked me. Well, I was pretty much anybody's at that stage,"" Andrew says.

Singing ability was not a high priority when Andrew put the call out.

""I didn't audition anybody, I do believe that everybody can sing,"" he says.

It was about looking the part. ""We looked for hairy people, so hairy men, woolly men, men that you could find at the bar late at night.""

Mark points out that singing ability is subjective.

""I have heard some people say that Dustyesky has three type of men: one with excellent voice, two, kind of hold a tune, and three, good to have a drink with. We sing perfect four-part harmony, even though some of us cannot sing.""

Getting carried away by the music is the point, Andrew says. ""When I'm teaching an amazing song to a bunch of people who aren't accomplished singers and we're also drinking beer, usually at the same time, you know, pretty much anything can happen.""

Although ""comrade"" Swivel likes to say all the choir members live in shipping containers, work in a typewriter factory, are salmon smokers and make gherkin liqueur, he is in fact a lawyer.

""They're from all walks of life,"" Andrew says of the men. ""They're nut farmers, teachers, plumbers, carpenters, musicians and builders.""

Dustyesky hits the big timeski

From their inaugural gig at the Bangalow Hotel in Byron Shire, competing, Mark says, with ""greyhounds on television, people playing on the poker machines, and the men in hi-vis vests drinking Tooheys New"", they knew something special was happening.

""Everybody dancing and behaving in quite a silly fashion,"" he says in his trademark faux Russian accent.

Perhaps it was the toasts with Russian vodka to make the performance more culturally appropriate, maybe it was Mark announcing that, ""now we look forward to meeting your womens and livestocks"", after the performance, but suddenly they were in demand at festivals at a time when they only had three songs.

After an inaugural performance at a Byron Bay pub, Dustyesky were quickly overwhelmed by offers. ( Australian Story: Vanessa Gorman )

Over time the stages got bigger. They sang at festivals in Melbourne and Sydney, and for thousands at Adelaide's Womadelaide Festival.

""You could always spot the Russians in the audience because they were the ones crying or singing along to every verse,"" Andrew says.

The Russian ambassador and his entourage came to see them, the ambassador looking, Mark says, like a Bond villain.

The Russian impostors were ""terrified"", Andrew says, when the real Russians started noticing them and their journalists came to interview them.

""We were really nervous about whether they would like us or hate us,"" he says.

Then ""out of the blue"" the Russia-1 TV network picked up a clip they had made and played it at the end of every news bulletin.

It was possibly the only time the word Mullumbimby had been spoken by a Russian broadcaster.

""Suddenly my phone started getting messages from Russia in the middle of the night,"" Andrew says. They were a hit. Big timeski.

A love letter from Russia

Then came the call from the Russian Ministry of Culture inviting them to sing in Red Square for the Immortal Regiment at the Grand Victory Day Parade on May 9. The full Russian display, ""250,000 people and [President Vladimir] Putin and the tanks and all the stuff,"" Andrew says incredulously.

The Russian Government were flying 28 men half-way round the world to sing for four minutes. ""Most of men not last that long,"" jokes Mark as his Russian alter ego. ""We give it a crack anyway.""

Victory Day parade celebrations usually attract a quarter of a million people. ( Reuters: Alexander Natruskin )

However, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped the event and Dustyesky's big trip to the Motherland.

Instead, Russian television reporters helped the choir to put a clip together. Filmed on their iPhones in isolation, the group of Aussie men recorded a beautiful yet tragic song about tanks on the battlefield, and a soldier who will not make it home to his family.

The Russia Today TV network edited the clip and broadcast it during the Victory Day telecast.

Did you know? The Russian Red Army choir, or Alexandrov Ensemble choir, was founded in 1926

The Russian Red Army choir, or Alexandrov Ensemble choir, was founded in 1926 The choir represents the ""mass voice of the people""

The choir represents the ""mass voice of the people"" For most of its history, the choir was made up of tenors and basses, but since the 1990s, female Army personnel have occasionally been included as sopranos

The men of Dustyesky were amazed.

""Millions of people have watched it and I've been getting hundreds and hundreds of comments from Russian people saying, 'you guys are amazing, this is incredible',"" Andrew says.

""It turns out that Russian people are really generous and are quite forgiving about pretty crappy accents.""

Mark isn't letting COVID-19 restrictions stop the choir singing.

""We are choir born for pandemics, most infectious choir on the planet right now,"" he says.

As Dustyesky's popularity surged, a Russian choir sent back a love letter. The Choir of Udmurtia in the Volga responded with a rendition of Waltzing Matilda. The respect worked both ways.

Mark has also extended an invitation to the Kremlin to come share a brew or two and sing a few songs.

""We invite President Putin to come to Mullumgrad to hang out in the river together. We take off our shirts and cover ourselves in macadamia butter and see what happens,"" he says.

Mullumbimby Russian folk choir Dustyesky aren't afraid to poke fun at their concept, with images like this of Vladimir Putin. ( Supplied: Mark Swivel )

It has taken a motley choir from Mullumbimby to return ancient folk songs and classic songs that were not often sung anymore to Russian culture. And still have a drink and a laugh.

Dustyesky is proof you can have Russian soul if you really want to. ""The songs of Russia are actually the songs of entire world,"" Mark says.

""That is the lesson, if you want one, of Dustyesky. That there is no particular culture, there is just the song, and it holds all of us within it.""

Netflix will start cancelling inactive members' subscriptions,http://cnbc.com/2020/05/21/netflix-will-start-cancelling-inactive-members-subscriptions.html,"The move is extremely unusual among companies that charge an annual subscription, and shows a measure of confidence in Netflix's value proposition for customers. It may also help Netflix stand out against an influx of new competitors, including Disney +, NBCUniversal 's Peacock (which has a free ad-supported tier), and WarnerMedia 's upcoming HBO Max.

Netflix will start asking customers who haven't used its platform in the past year if they want to keep their subscriptions, the company announced Thursday. If a customer doesn't respond, Netflix will automatically cancel the subscription.

""We're asking everyone who has not watched anything on Netflix for a year since they joined to confirm they want to keep their membership. And we'll do the same for anyone who has stopped watching for more than two years,"" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, said in a statement.

Inactive customers will start seeing the feature roll out via in-app notifications or emails this week.

Netflix said that its inactive accounts represent less than a half of one percent of its overall member base and are already factored into its financial guidance. The company saw a huge uptick in subscribers in the past quarter, as the coronavirus pandemic has kept many at home. Netflix reported 183 million subscribers at the end of the first quarter.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico’s government opened a drive-up service on Monday to handle applications from thousands of people seeing pandemic unemployment assistance after weeks of delays and confusion over the program aimed largely at self-employed people stung by COVID-19 restrictions.

The U.S. territory’s government said it has processed only about 3,000 of of 87,000 requests it has received since the online application platform launched on April 28, and officials have feuded with a technology provider about who is to blame for the delays.

Among those who have tried to apply multiple times online and via phone but received no answer is Olga Cortés, who owns kiosks offering cellphone service and maintenance.

“This is incredibly frustrating,” she said. “I don’t understand how someone has not made the platform work like it’s supposed to in all this time. We’re in the middle of a crisis. We are people who fulfill all our obligations with the government. Now we need them.”

Puerto Rico Labor Secretary Briseida Torres said the drive-up center in front of the department’s headquarters in San Juan would help speed up claims.

“The high volume of cases and inquiries we receive daily has caused a delay in addressing these claims and processing payments,” she said Sunday.

Torres said other drive-up centers might open elsewhere on the island in upcoming days.

Labor Department spokesman Christopher Domenech told The Associated Press that a total of $5.3 million has been distributed so far to those seeking pandemic unemployment assistance, with beneficiaries getting $600 a week or more. He said he did not have data on how many people received payments or when the first payment was made.

Tech difficulties also have affected thousands of people who rely on a federal nutritional assistance program and reported their card was declined, forcing some to abandon their groceries because they were unable to pay for them. Evertec, the same company overseeing the online platform for unemployment assistance, said it was hit with a high volume of transactions and is working to fix the issue.

The lockdown has hit especially hard in Puerto Rico, whose economy is still reeling from Hurricanes Irma and Maria and a recent string of strong earthquakes, as well as a debt crisis that led the island to declare a sort of bankruptcy. Economists have warned the unemployment rate could reach more than 30% on the island of 3.2 million people that has a more than 40% poverty rate, higher than any U.S. state.",JustBadNews,0
The end of plastic? New plant-based bottles will degrade in a year,http://theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/16/the-end-of-plastic-new-plant-based-bottles-will-degrade-in-a-year?CMP=fb_gu&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR2FbV1-flnP19w57BIlI5XQR5tfkWc_uu2tvlGEOGQsZQvsAnYKXL-M_A8#Echobox=1589644993,"Beer and soft drinks could soon be sipped from “all-plant” bottles under new plans to turn sustainably grown crops into plastic in partnership with major beverage makers.

A biochemicals company in the Netherlands hopes to kickstart investment in a pioneering project that hopes to make plastics from plant sugars rather than fossil fuels.

The plans, devised by renewable chemicals company Avantium, have already won the support of beer-maker Carlsberg, which hopes to sell its pilsner in a cardboard bottle lined with an inner layer of plant plastic.

Avantium’s chief executive, Tom van Aken, says he hopes to greenlight a major investment in the world-leading bioplastics plant in the Netherlands by the end of the year. The project, which remains on track despite the coronavirus lockdown, is set to reveal partnerships with other food and drink companies later in the summer.

The project has the backing of Coca-Cola and Danone, which hope to secure the future of their bottled products by tackling the environmental damage caused by plastic pollution and a reliance on fossil fuels.

Globally around 300 million tonnes of plastic is made from fossil fuels every year, which is a major contributor to the climate crisis. Most of this is not recycled and contributes to the scourge of microplastics in the world’s oceans. Microplastics can take hundreds of years to decompose completely.

“This plastic has very attractive sustainability credentials because it uses no fossil fuels, and can be recycled – but would also degrade in nature much faster than normal plastics do,” says Van Aken.

Avantium’s plant plastic is designed to be resilient enough to contain carbonate drinks. Trials have shown that the plant plastic would decompose in one year using a composter, and a few years longer if left in normal outdoor conditions. But ideally, it should be recycled, said Van Aken.

The bio-refinery plans to break down sustainable plant sugars into simple chemical structures that can then be rearranged to form a new plant-based plastic – which could appear on supermarket shelves by 2023.

The path-finder project will initially make a modest 5,000 tonnes of plastic every year using sugars from corn, wheat or beets. However, Avantium expects its production to grow as demand for renewable plastics climbs.

In time, Avantium plans to use plant sugars from sustainable sourced biowaste so that the rise of plant plastic does not affect the global food supply chain.",JustBadNews,0
2 Missouri officers accused of assaulting transgender woman,http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/missouri-officers-accused-assaulting-transgender-woman-70723815,"2 Missouri officers accused of assaulting transgender woman Two Kansas City, Missouri, police officers face assault charges for allegedly slamming a transgender woman’s face into a concrete sidewalk during an arrest that was captured on video

MISSION, Kan. -- Two Kansas City, Missouri, police officers face assault charges for allegedly slamming a transgender woman's face into a concrete sidewalk during an arrest that was captured on video.

A grand jury indicted Matthew Brummett, 37, and Charles Prichard, 47, on one misdemeanor charge each of fourth-degree assault related to the May 24, 2019, physical encounter, the Jackson County prosecutor's office announced Friday.

The video, recorded by a passerby outside a beauty supply store, shows the officers kneeing the woman in the face, torso and ribs and forcing her arms over her head while handcuffed. The woman was black; the officers are white.

The woman has since died after being shot in October at a Kansas City home, and a man has been charged in her death. She went by various first names, including Brianna or Brionna, Bebe, and Briya. Her surname was Hill.

Prosecutors said police arrested Hill after she got into a dispute with someone at the beauty supply store. Both she and the store's owner called 911, and the owner asked officers to remove Hill. The officers said Hill was resisting arrest when they took her to the ground outside the store.

Hill was ticketed for trespassing, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Brummett and Prichard maintain that they used reasonable force, according to a statement from their attorneys.

“They vehemently dispute the basis of these charges and believe they will be ultimately exonerated in Court,"" the statement said.

Police Chief Rick Smith announced late Friday that both officers have been placed on “administrative assignment until the outcome of the proceeding.""

A Kansas City Police Department investigation determined the officers did nothing wrong, according to the police union. The Jackson County prosecutor's office said it brought the case to a grand jury because police declined to provide prosecutors with a probable cause statement, which is normally submitted by a detective at the conclusion of an investigation.

An attorney who represents Hill’s family, David Smith, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview on Saturday that he believes the police chief mishandled the investigation and he called for him to resign. David Smith and Rick Smith are not related.

“You don’t treat this woman like a piece of trash because you think she is a freak,” David Smith said.",JustBadNews,0
Trump threatens new taxes on companies that make goods outside United States,http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-taxes/trump-threatens-new-taxes-on-companies-that-make-goods-outside-united-states-idUSKBN22Q2HS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to impose new taxes on American companies that produce goods outside the United States, another move his administration could make to push supply chains away from China and raise new trade barriers.

Trump said in a Fox Business Network interview that taxation was an “incentive” for companies to return manufacturing to the United States. He did not specify whether these would be new across-the-board tariffs or another form of taxes, which would require an act of Congress.

“You know, if we wanted to put up our own border, like other countries do to us, Apple would build 100 percent of their product in the United States. That’s the way it would work,” Trump said.

U.S. officials say that Trump’s administration is “turbocharging” efforts to push companies to move production of away from China, partly as a way to punish Beijing for its early handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

Asked whether Trump would consider giving companies tax breaks to return manufacturing operations to the United States, he said he may tax them if they don’t and suggested they had a duty to re-shore operations.

“One incentive, frankly, is to charge tax for them when they make product outside. We don’t have to do much for them. They have to do for us,” Trump said.

The former real estate developer spent much of his first three years in office waging a trade war against China over its trade practices, technology transfer and industrial policies, imposing punitive tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese imports.

By January, before the coronavirus spread globally, Trump’s new tariffs had cost American companies $46 billion, according to Commerce Department data.

Many business groups and economists are calling for Trump to cut tariffs, at least temporarily, to ease cost pressures on U.S. companies facing severe drops in revenues.

The International Monetary Fund has warned that raising new trade barriers will prolong the worst recession since the 1930s Great Depression.

On Thursday, Trump, who is seeking re-election in November and needs to win key manufacturing battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, called global supply chains “stupid” and said the coronavirus has exposed their weaknesses as critical products are cut off.

“I said we shouldn’t have supply chains. We should have them all in the United States. We have the companies to do it. And if we don’t, we can do that,” he said.",JustBadNews,0
Suburban Chicago woman mauled to death by French bulldog,http://fox13news.com/news/suburban-chicago-woman-mauled-to-death-by-french-bulldog,"A suburban Chicago woman who recently adopted a French bulldog mix that had been bred to fight was fatally mauled by the dog over the weekend, a coroner said.

A friend found Lisa Urso unresponsive on the patio behind her Ingleside, Illinois, home on Saturday evening. Investigators determined she had been attacked by the French bulldog mix. Toxicology results are pending.

Lake County Coroner Dr. Howard Cooper said Urso, 52, had recently adopted the dog, which had been bred to fight. The dog attacked Urso inside her home, but she made it out to her patio, where she died

Lake County animal care and control spokewoman Hannah Goering said they categorized the dog as a ""French bulldog-bulldog mix.""

Cooper said Urso suffered many bite wounds and scratches on her legs, arms and torso.

“I hate to say it, but unfortunately, it was a vicious attack,” Cooper said, adding that although French Bulldogs are a smaller breed, they can deliver powerful bites.

“You don’t really think about it happening with a smaller dog breed, but we forget animals can be powerful,” he said. “This animal has a lot of jaw strength.”

Cooper said the dog recently attacked Urso’s boyfriend. After that attack, she had gone to animal control to get the dog back.

Urso owned two other dogs, including a second French bulldog, which was found with some blood on it, and a border collie, he said.",JustBadNews,0
"Arrested Hong Kong protesters are tortured regularly, says human rights group",http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1525899-20200513.htm?spTabChangeable=0,"Arrested protesters tortured regularly: rights group

The Civil Rights Observer says it interviewed dozens of protesters arrested last year and was told of widespread abuses by the police. File photo: AFP

A human rights group, the Civil Rights Observer, has issued a report accusing the police of systematically torturing protesters arrested during Hong Kong's unrest last year, saying interviews it did with some of those detained show they were subjected to ""cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment"".



The group said it will submit its findings to the United Nations and relevant international civil society groups.



It interviewed 45 people arrested or detained at protest sites between July and November during the anti-government agitation that was sparked by the now-abandoned extradition bill.



The report said 13 of the interviewees reported they were severely assaulted or injured after they'd been arrested, while 15 of them said their access to medical care was delayed, and 16 claimed they couldn’t see their lawyers as quickly as they wanted.



The rights group said three arrestees complained of sexual assault, and nine talked of irregularities during evidence gathering, like being forced to sign and record statements without a lawyer present or being stopped them from giving their names to witnesses at the scene.



None of the interviewees gave their real names in the report to avoid potential retribution.



The group highlighted seven cases, including a man who claimed officers repeatedly slammed his head on the door frame of a police van.



It also said the man said he was subjected to more physical abuse while at the police station and denied a request for a lawyer and to be sent to hospital. The man was eventually taken to hospital, six hours after his arrest and he was admitted to a neurosurgery ward, the group said.



The report also flagged up the case of a man who said he was pinned down to ground though he wasn’t taking part in protests. An officer elbowed him in the throat, leaving him struggling for breath for almost half a minute, the report quoted him as saying.



He was later arrested, and his requests to go to hospital and to see a lawyer were repeatedly ignored, the report said.



In light of its findings, the group urged the government to propose legislative amendments in full conformity with the UN's Committee against Torture.



It said there should be an independent body empowered to carry out effective unannounced visits at all places of police detention, and to safeguard the fundamental rights of detainees.



The founder of the group, Icarus Wong, said the report's findings indicate that Hong Kong has some of the characteristics of a ""police state"".



""Our human rights and liberty is not guaranteed under the law, and the law enforcement agencies do not respect human rights. So they can do anything they want,"" Wong said.



He said the government has to launch an independent investigation into alleged police brutality and this would be a first step towards rebuilding trust between the people and the authorities.

India: Toxic gas leak in Visakhapatnam kills 11 people and puts thousands in danger,http://wsws.org/en/articles/2020/05/09/vish-m09.html,"Eleven people died and around 800 were hospitalised by a poisonous gas leak early Thursday morning at an LG Polymers India plant in Visakhapatnam, a port city in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The company is owned by South Korean-based LG Chem.

Toxic gas leak at LG Polymers near Visakhapatnam [Source: Twitter @BanaudhaSarika]

The majority of victims, including two children, were from the Gopalapatnam area near the chemical plant. Eight people died after inhaling large amounts of toxic styrene gas while three others were killed in accidents as they tried to escape the area. Around 15,000 people have now been evacuated from affected villages.

The leak began at about 2.30 a.m. as employees were about to resume work at the plant following the Modi government’s easing of some COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. When police reached the area they found residents who live near the plant unconscious on their beds. Shocking television footage showed unconscious people in backyards and others collapsed in narrow streets as they tried to escape. The residents reported eye irritation, breathlessness, nausea and skin rashes.

Some of those who tried to drive away became unconscious in their vehicles and crashed. One motorcyclist collapsed and drove into a ditch, tragically killing both himself and a pillion passenger. Two people became so dizzy from the gas that they collapsed into a well and died while one woman fell off the second floor of her building. Video footage showed parents running up and down streets carrying their breathless children and people collapsing on roads.

The terrifying pictures are reminiscent of the 1984 Bhopal tragedy in Madhya Pradesh state when thousands were killed by a gas leak at a Union Carbide plant, the worst industrial accident in history. More than 40 tons of deadly methyl isocyanate gas and other unknown poisons used in the manufacture of pesticides were released from the US multinational owned facility, turning the plant and surrounding areas into a virtual gas chamber.

Thursday’s toxic gas disaster at Visakhapatnam has again revealed the criminal negligence of the Indian ruling elite. The poisonous gas spread in a three-kilometre circle from the original source and was not closed off for four hours after the leak it began.

An official statement from LG Polymers India plant indicated that management was fully aware there could be a disaster. “[S]tagnation and changes in temperature,” it said, “could have resulted in auto polymerization which could have caused vaporization.”

The Vishakhapatnam gas leak, in fact, is just one of many thousands of examples of major capitalist corporations determined to maintain their dangerous production processes irrespective of the consequences for the lives of their workers and the impact on neighbouring communities. It has also revealed the widespread practice by factory managers of using hazardous and dilapidated machinery to maintain production and maximize profits.

Investigators told the media that gas pressure may have built up during the national COVID-19 lockdown; the temperature of the styrene was not maintained at less than 20 degrees because of failed refrigerants, and a wrecked valve, or a burst pipe, could have caused the leak.

Thursday’s disaster occurred as the Modi government was telling state governments and district authorities to begin lifting the lockdown, pushing millions into a premature return to work, even as COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise.

In a perfunctory and utterly routine statement, Modi tweeted: “Spoke to officials of MHA [Ministry of Home Affairs] and NDMA [National Disaster Management Authority] regarding the situation in Visakhapatnam, which is being monitored closely. I pray for everyone’s safety and well-being in Visakhapatnam.”

Modi’s real concern is not the lives of the victims but that the gas leak disaster will undermine the government’s demand that workers should return to their jobs.

Notwithstanding phony rhetoric about the “safety and well-being” of gas leak victims, India is one of the most dangerous places in the world to work.

According to Labour and Employment Ministry data, 3,562 workers died in factory accidents in India between 2014 and 2016 and more than 51,000 were injured in the same period—an average of three deaths and 47 injuries every single day. A 2017 study by the British Safety Council painted an even bleaker picture, reporting that 48,000 workers die of occupational accidents in India every year.

The Bhopal disaster, however, remains India’s worst industrial accident with 8,000 immediate fatalities and the hospitalization of some 170,000 residents. The total number of deaths from the accident is estimated to have been between 16,000 and 30,000. Thousands of survivors continue to suffer health problems.

More than 15 years after the event, around 150,000 people were still chronically ill and suffering from a range of health problems, including breathing difficulties, persistent coughs, ulcerations of the cornea, early-age cataracts, recurrent fevers, burning of the skin and depression from the tragedy. An estimated 10 to 15 Bhopal disaster victims still die every month.

The Visakhapatnam gas leak is a warning to all workers returning to inactive plants and badly maintained machinery shut down during the COVID-19 lockdown. These dangers were further confirmed by a similar gas leak at a paper mill in Chhattisgarh, hours before the Visakhapatnam incident. Up to seven workers at the paper mill were hospitalised after being exposed to toxic gases while they were cleaning the paper pulp tank in preparation for a resumption of operations at the facility.

Successive Indian governments have worked to transform the country into a cheap labor haven for giant multinational corporations and international investors, who have sabotaged workers’ health and safety conditions whilst reaping billions in profits.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy responded to Thursday’s disaster by awarding 10 million rupees ($US133,000) to the families of those who died and a meagre 100,000 rupees ($1,330) for those injured. This will do nothing to alleviate the loss of lives and prolonged suffering of those exposed to the toxic gas.

Andhra Pradesh Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy blandly described the gas leak as an “industrial failure” by the company. “It’s for the company to prove that there was no negligence on its part,” he declared.

Reddy’s statement is empty posturing. If the response of India’s ruling elite to the Bhopal disaster is anything to go by, nothing will happen to LG Polymers India.

In 2010, amid widespread public anger and disgust over the 1984 Bhopal disaster, an Indian district court ordered eight executives of Union Carbide to be sentenced to just two years’ jail. They were fined a meagre 100,000 rupees ($US2,100) each and the company just 500,000 rupees ($US10,600), with the American CEO of the company remaining an “absconder” until his death.

"A chemical gas leak at an LG Polymers plant in southern India on Thursday killed at least six people, and led to more than 120 people being admitted to hospital and the evacuation of three nearby villages, a local official in Andra Pradesh state said.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-india-disaster/gas-leak-at-lg-polymers-plant-in-india-kills-six-over-120-hospitalised-idUKKBN22J07Q,"CHENNAI (Reuters) - At least 11 people were killed in India in a gas leak at a South Korean-owned factory making polystyrene products that made hundreds of people sick and led to the evacuation of villagers living nearby, officials said.

The accident occurred some 14 km (9 miles) inland from the east coast city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh state, at a plant operated by LG Polymers, a unit of South Korea’s biggest petrochemical maker, LG Chem Ltd.

Srijana Gummalla, commissioner of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, said gas from styrene, a principal raw materials at the plant, leaked during the early hours of the morning, when families in the surrounding villages were asleep.

Yashwanth Saikumar Ambati, 23, who lives about 300 metres away from the plant, said he woke up around 4.30 a.m. because of a strong smell.

“I went back to sleep and I woke up around 6 because the smell got stronger. My eyes were itchy, and I was feeling drowsy, light-headed and slightly breathless,” he told Reuters, adding that neighbours also complained of eye irritation and stomach aches.

In a statement issued from Seoul, LG Chem said that the gas emitted in the leak can cause nausea and dizziness when inhaled, adding that it was seeking to ensure casualties received treatment quickly.

Video from Reuters partner ANI shot later on Thursday showed emergency workers in the area rushing to help victims, some of whom appeared to be listless and disoriented.

A number of victims lay unconscious on the streetside, as volunteers fanned them and others carried them to ambulances.

A spokesman for LG Chem in Seoul said the leak was discovered by a night shift maintenance worker and has been brought under control.

According to both the company spokesman and Gummalla, the plant was being reopened after India relaxed a nationwide lockdown that had been imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Thursday’s incident brought back bad memories of a gas leak at an factory of U.S. chemical firm Union Carbide that killed thousands in the central Indian city of Bhopal in 1984, but thankfully it was on a far smaller scale.

“I pray for everyone’s safety and well-being in Visakhapatnam,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.

S.N. Pradhan, director general of the National Disaster Response Force, said that at least 11 had died after around 1,000 people living near the plant were exposed to the gas.

FALLING, RUNNING AWAY

B.V. Rani, a revenue official in the district, said she received a call at around 4 a.m. from a police officer near the facility, who sounded panicky. “He asked me to come to the spot immediately,” Rani told Reuters.

When Rani went there, she saw that people had collapsed unconscious in the village adjoining the 60-acre site of the plant.

“I personally helped more than 15 people get to an ambulance who had tried to run away from the village but dropped down within a few metres,” she said.

At least one child was among the dead, a policeman at the site told ANI, whose video showed at least two other children being lifted into an ambulance.

Between 300-400 people were hospitalised, Swarupa Rani, an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Visakhapatnam told Reuters. Another 1,500 people had been evacuated, mostly from a neighbouring village.

Areas within approximately 3-kilometre (nearly 2-mile)radius of the plant were evacuated, he said, with emergency services going from door-to-door to find anyone left behind.

TOP PETROCHEMICAL MAKER

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy said in a televised address that the gas leak occurred because raw material was stored for a long period of time.

The state government will give 10 million rupees ($131,900) compensation to the families to those who died, and it will also form a panel to investigate the cause of the accident, said P.V. Ramesh, a senior aide to the chief minister.

“Obviously something has gone wrong,” Ramesh told Reuters. “Nobody will be spared.”

LG Chem’s share priced closed nearly 2% weaker on Thursday, in a Seoul market that was broadly flat.

South Korea’s top petrochemical maker by capacity, LG Chem acquired the plant in 1997 and established LG Polymers India Private Limited (LGPI), according to a company website.

The LG Polymers plant makes polystyrene products which are used in manufacturing electric fan blades, cups and cutlery and containers for cosmetic products such as make up.

“LG Polymers is a multi national, reputed company, and it is sad that the incident has happened in their plant,” Chief Minister Reddy said in a televised media address.

Residents complained that the gas leakage, which reportedly started at around 2:30 am from the plant at RR Venkatapuram near Naiduthota area, caused burning sensation in the eyes, rashes on the bodies, and extreme difficulty in breathing.

“We woke up to the smell of gas. When we went outside, the whole air was filled with gas. It entered our homes and caused breathing problems and burning sensation in the lungs,” said DVSS Ramana, a resident of Naiduthota. “We are being evacuated. We are going to our relative’s place,” added Ramana, who has two children aged 8 and 12.

Industries Minister M Goutham Reddy said that the factory was to reopen today after the lockdown. “We have issued guidelines and protocol to all industries for safe reopening of factories. Our initial information is that workers were checking a gas storage tank when it started leaking. Only a thorough investigation will reveal what exactly happenned,” Reddy said.

Emergency services personnel who were evacuating people also fell unconscious because of the gas leak. Many children have been affected. A doctor at KGH said that children below age of 10 years were the most seriously affected. Officials said that they have not been able to contact anyone at the LG polymers unit.

Although police officials made announcements asking people to come out of their houses and leave the area, many people remained locked up in their homes. “Some people listened to us and came out and we took them to safety but many locked themselves in. we also do not know if some people fell unconscious inside their homes,” an official said.

The LG Polymers was established in 1961 as Hindustan Polymers for manufacturing polystyrene and its co-polymers in Vizag. It was merged with MCDowell &Co of the UB Group in 1978 and was taken over by South Korea-based LG Chem in 1997 which renamed it as LG Polymers. The factory manufactures general purpose polystyrene and high impact polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, and engineering plastics compounds.

New Campus Sexual Assault Rules Bolster Rights of Accused,http://nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/new-campus-sexual-assault-rules-bolster-rights-of-accused/2267585/?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_CHBrand&amp&__twitter_impression=true,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Wednesday issued a new policy that will reshape the way schools and universities respond to complaints of sexual misconduct, bolstering the rights of the accused and narrowing the scope of cases colleges are required to investigate.

“We released a final rule that recognizes we can continue to combat sexual misconduct without abandoning our core values of fairness, presumption of innocence and due process,” DeVos said in a call with reporters.

In announcing the new policy, which carries the weight of law, DeVos condemned the Obama administration for adopting a “failed approach” that turned campus disciplinary panels into “kangaroo courts.”

DeVos' changes narrow the definition of sexual harassment and require colleges to investigate claims only if they're reported to certain officials. Schools can be held accountable for mishandling complaints only if they acted with “deliberate indifference.” Students will be allowed to question one another through representatives during live hearings.

The regulation largely mirrors a proposal DeVos issued in November 2018 but tempers some measures that drew some of the heaviest criticism.

The earlier proposal, for example, suggested that colleges would not be required to handle complaints arising beyond campus borders, but the final rule clarifies that their duties extend to fraternity and sorority houses, along with other scenarios in which the college exercises ""substantial control” over the accused student and the “context” where the alleged misconduct occurred.

DeVos also clarified for the first time that dating violence, stalking and domestic violence also must be addressed under Title IX, and she added new language ordering schools to provide special support for victims regardless of whether they file a formal complaint.

Title IX is the 1972 law barring discrimination based on sex in education. The law and DeVos’ regulation apply to the nation’s colleges and universities, along with elementary and secondary schools.

Devos said the new rule ""takes historic steps to strengthen Title IX protections for all students and to ensure all students can pursue an education free from sex discrimination.”

The changes take effect Aug. 14. The Education Department finalized them after reviewing more than 120,000 public comments submitted in response to DeVos' proposal.

The final policy was quickly condemned by opponents who say it weakens protections for victims and will discourage many from reporting misconduct. The National Women’s Law Center promised to take legal action.

“We refuse to go back to the days when rape and harassment in schools were ignored and swept under the rug,” said Fatima Goss Graves, the group’s president and CEO. “We won’t let DeVos succeed in requiring schools to be complicit in harassment, turning Title IX from a law that protects all students into a law that protects abusers and harassers.”

Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House education committee, said the policy “creates new barriers to justice” for victims.

“While the department’s stated intent was to secure due process for those accused of sexual misconduct, the actual effect of its rule will be to erode protections for students, weaken accountability for schools and make it more difficult for survivors seeking redress,” he said.

The overhaul drew praise from Republicans and from groups that represent the accused. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate’s education committee, said it “respects and supports victims and preserves due process rights for both the victim and the accused.""

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group, called it an “important victory.”

“Students shouldn’t have to relinquish their basic rights when they step foot on a college campus, but at almost every top college in this country, that’s exactly what happens,” said Samantha Harris, the group's senior fellow.

Among the most hotly contested changes is DeVos' rule allowing students to question one another at live hearings. Advocates for victims say it’s a “cruel” policy that forces victims to relive the trauma of sexual violence.

DeVos added new limits around the hearings in her final rule, saying students must never be allowed to question one another directly, and she said only questions that campus officials deem “relevant” can be asked.

The Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, an association of more than 200 public universities, said it still has significant concerns about cross examinations, saying the requirement will likely discourage reporting.

“Some will worry about an anguish-inducing process that includes requiring them to face direct questioning by respondents’ aggressive counsel in a live hearing courtroom-like setting,” said Peter McPherson, the group's president.

While cross examinations will be required at the college level, the final rule makes it optional for primary and secondary schools.

Under the new rules, the definition of sexual harassment is narrowed to include “unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive” that it denies a person access to a school’s education programs or activity.

The Obama administration, by contrast, used a broader definition that included any “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” including “sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”

Colleges now will be required to dismiss complaints that fall short of the updated definition, although any allegation of rape or sexual assault will be deemed to have met the definition.

Opponents also take issue with a measure in the final policy allowing schools to choose a higher standard of proof when deciding cases of sexual misconduct.

The Obama administration encouraged schools to use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard, meaning that the allegation is more likely than not true. But the new rules allow schools to use a “clear and convincing” standard, meaning the claim is highly probable.

Democrats and some education groups had asked DeVos to postpone the final rule until after the coronavirus pandemic, saying schools were too busy responding to the crisis to implement complex federal rules.

The American Council on Education, an association of college presidents, urged DeVos on Wednesday to delay the policy until summer 2021, saying the timing reflected “appallingly poor judgment.”

“This is irrational, unrealistic and completely at odds with the Trump administration’s oft-repeated statement to tread lightly when imposing complex new regulations,” the group said in a statement.

DeVos said schools had been given fair warning.

“Civil rights really can't wait, and students’ cases continue to be decided now,” she said. “We’ve been working on this for more than two years, so it’s not a surprise to institutions that it’s been coming.”",JustBadNews,0
Mount & Blade 2 bans all contents that violate China's 'Interests',http://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-bans-allegedly-given-for-violating-chinese-law,"Update: TaleWorlds has replied to us and updated us on the situation. For the moment, they are thoroughly investigating these issues before taking any definitive action.

Original story continues below

Several Asian players are alleging that Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord bans are being handed out by a Chinese administrator for people who are violating Chinese law. These alleged violations include political speech such as ""Free Hong Kong"" and more innocuous (but equally banned) words like ""coronavirus,"" and the allegations only get worse from there.

These allegations were made in two separate locations that we've found thus far. The first comes from TaleWorlds own forums in a topic that is now locked. This discussion opens by alleging that any ""anti-PRC"" (People's Republic of China) discussion should be reported, in regards to the East Asian servers, which are allegedly moderated by Chinese administrators, although it is not believed the servers are hosted in China.

One player is said to be reported simply for saying ""Coronavirus"". Other mentioned incidents include using the player name ""#HongKong."" Furthermore, some people are reporting that players are being banned without warning.

Similarly, a submission to the /r/MB2Bannerlord subreddit warns players not to ""play with china"", presumably meaning to avoid playing with Chinese players. This submission further alleges that admins have the right to ban people on official servers for violating Chinese law and that these bans will last until 2029.

The Reddit submission on the Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord bans notes that one player got banned for ""inappropriate behavior"" for having the name 国武汉共产党肺炎, which they say translates to ""China Wuhan CCP virus."" The OP claims that this ban authority is in force on all servers.​

"China lied about origin of coronavirus, leaked intelligence report says",http://nypost.com/2020/05/02/intelligence-report-says-china-lied-about-origin-of-coronavirus/amp/,"News

China lied about origin of coronavirus, leaked intelligence report says

Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.

A damning dossier leaked from the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance claims that China lied to the world about human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, made whistleblowers disappear and refused to hand over virus samples so the West could make a vaccine.

The bombshell 15-page research document also indicated that some of the five intelligence agencies believe that the virus may have been leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a claim initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory because Chinese officials insisted the virus came from the local wet markets, according to the Australian Daily Telegraph.

At the same time, a senior intelligence source told Fox News that while most intelligence agencies believe COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan lab, “it was thought to have been released accidentally.”





The report from the intelligence-sharing alliance of the five leading English-speaking countries — the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada — called China’s shady handling of the virus “an assault on international transparency.”

The paper described how China downplayed the outbreak around the world while wildly scrambling to bury all traces of the disease at home, including bleaching wet market stalls, censoring the growing evidence of asymptomatic carriers of the virus and stonewalling other countries’ requests for samples.

Beijing started censoring search engines as early as December to stop internet surfing related to the virus, according to the report. The World Health Organization went along with China’s claims and also denied human-to-human transmission of the virus despite concern from neighboring countries.

Intelligence showed that China had “evidence of human-human transmission from early December,” but continued to deny it could spread that way until Jan. 20, according to the dossier.

The document pointed out that China imposed travel bans on people throughout the nation, but continued to tell the rest of the world travel bans were unnecessary.

China has released a cartoon taunting the US for its response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The 90-second animation - called ""Once Upon a Virus"" - uses Lego-like figures to represent the two countries.

Posted online by Xinhua, China’s state news agency, the video shows red curtains opening to reveal a stage featuring a terracotta warrior wearing a face mask and the Statue of Liberty.

The warrior alerts the New York symbol to the worrying spread of a new illness, saying: ""We discovered a new virus.""

In a response echoing comments made by US President Donald Trump, the statue then replies ""So what? It's only a flu.""

The warrior counts off the grim milestones in China's outbreak and advises the statue to stay at home, only to receive the answer: ""It’s violating human rights.""

""Are you listening to yourselves?"" asks the warrior as the statue begins to turn red with fever and gets hooked up to an intravenous drip.

""We are always correct, even though we contradict ourselves,"" the statue replies.

""That's what I love about you Americans, your consistency,"" says the warrior.

Washington and Beijing have been locked in a war of words over the origins of Covid-19, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year.

Since then, the deadly virus has swept across the world and the US now has more cases than any other country by far, with more than 1.1m.

More than 67,000 Americans have now lost their lives to the killer bug, a death toll greater than that suffered during the Vietnam War.

China has suffered 4,633 deaths from the virus, and has officially recorded 82,877 cases.

It is widely believed that the coronavirus first jumped from animals to humans at a live animal market in Wuhan, a transport hub in Hubei province.

However, alternative theories have begun to surface and Trump said on Thursday that he is confident Covid-19 may have in fact originated in a Chinese virology lab.

The US President declined, however, to describe the evidence behind his claim.

China has been accused of misleading the world about the severity of the outbreak, and there are growing calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the virus.

In an interview with Reuters, Trump said he believes China's handling of the pandemic is proof that Beijing ""will do anything they can"" to make him lose his re-election bid in November.

Lego's press office has confirmed it had no involvement in the video.

The company said in a statement: ""We weren't involved in making the animation in any way.""",JustBadNews,0
"How Boeing went from appealing for government aid to snubbing it. In just six weeks, Boeing Co went from seeking government aid to announcing it no longer needed it.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-boeing-debt-investors-analysis/how-boeing-went-from-appealing-for-government-aid-to-snubbing-it-idUKKBN22E029,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In just six weeks, Boeing Co BA.N went from seeking government aid to announcing it no longer needed it.

FILE PHOTO: A worker leaves the Boeing Everett Factory, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Everett, Washington, U.S. March 23, 2020. REUTERS/David Ryder/File Photo

The company’s $25 billion bond issue this week made all the difference.

The upsized deal, this year’s largest investment-grade bond issue and the sixth largest on record, surpassed Boeing’s expectations. It underscores how the Chicago-based company capitalized on U.S. government support, even without having to accept taxpayer money as aid.

On March 24, Boeing’s Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told Reuters in an interview that the credit markets were “essentially closed” to the largest U.S. plane maker, and that the entire U.S. aerospace industry urgently needed capital to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

A $2.3 trillion U.S. stimulus package, enacted into law at the end of March to provide relief to the U.S. economy which was hit hard by the pandemic, subsequently carved out $17 billion in aid for Boeing and other companies critical to national security.

Boeing itself had lobbied extensively for aid and had called for at least $60 billion in government loans for the entire aerospace manufacturing sector. “We can’t let anything happen to Boeing,” U.S. President Donald Trump said last month, in one of the many instances he expressed support for the company.

Several bond investors in interviews with Reuters cited the U.S. government’s backstopping of Boeing, as well as the Federal Reserve’s support of the credit markets in the aftermath of the pandemic, as reasons for the success of the capital raise.

“Boeing is pretty vital to, not just the U.S. economy, but to national security interests. Also, you can’t argue (with the fact that) the Fed support is what has been the primary driver of what is allowing risk assets to boom,” said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management.

Already saddled with $39 billion in debt as of the end of March, Boeing started the week searching for cash, to cope not just with impact of the coronavirus outbreak on air travel, but with the long grounding of its flagship 737 Max aircraft as well, following a string of accidents.

Smith and Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun had taken what they called a “balanced” approach, reiterating on Wednesday that they were exploring a mix of government aid and commercial funding.

One potential source of government aid, the $17 billion national security-related fund administered by the U.S. Treasury Department, came with significant strings, including the possibility of the U.S. government getting a stake in Boeing. That could have led to Boeing’s shareholders getting diluted.

Then Boeing had a breakthrough. Its plan was to gauge investor interest for a bond issue of between $10 billion and $15 billion, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Yet demand for the bonds on Thursday peaked at more than $70 billion from over 600 investor accounts, according to the sources.

Credit rating agencies told Boeing it could borrow as much as $25 billion through a bond issue and just about retain its investment-grade rating, according to the sources.

This was important for Boeing, to reign in its borrowing costs and attract more investors to the bond offering, the sources said. Investors that traditionally invest in junk-rated debt, such as hedge funds, also flocked to Boeing’s bond issue, because it was priced at premium to investment-grade deals, according to the sources.

Boeing priced different bond tranches spanning several maturities at between 450 basis points and 593 basis points, whereas the average spread for bonds of Boeing’s credit rating is 306 basis points, according to ICE BofA Data.

“Let’s face it, Boeing is not an investment-grade company by any stretch of the imagination,” said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors.

Boeing declined to comment on its internal planning for the capital raise.

But Boeing announced on Thursday that as a result of the strong response to its bond offering, it did “not plan to seek additional funding through the capital markets or the U.S. government options at this time.”

CONCESSIONS

Boeing had to make concessions to cajole the credit rating agencies and bond investors. It agreed to increase interest payments by 25 basis points each time the two biggest credit rating agencies lowered its rating by one level into junk, according to the bond issue’s prospectus. It capped these concessions at 100 basis points per credit-rating agency and 200 basis points in total.

Boeing expects the money from the bond issue to cover its funding needs for the year, barring any unexpected event. Before announcing it would no longer seek government aid, it stress-tested its financial assumptions and considered numerous scenarios to ensure it has liquidity for the remainder of the year, according to the sources.

Boeing has also had to take several cost-cutting measures, including announcing plans to shed about 16,000 jobs this year, about 10% of its workforce, through early retirements and likely layoffs.

On Friday, Smith told Boeing employees in a message he wanted “to thank the administration for the actions they have taken to support our economy and the credit markets.”",JustBadNews,0
"Covid-19 outbreaks at Irish meat plants raise fears over worker safety Third of workers at factory in Tipperary test positive, while McDonald's supplier forced to temporarily halt production",http://theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/covid-19-outbreaks-at-irish-meat-plants-raise-fears-over-worker-safety?CMP=twt_a-environment_b-gdneco,"An outbreak of Covid-19 among workers in a meat factory in Tipperary has raised fears that the virus is spreading through abattoirs and meat-processing plants in Ireland.

Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on agriculture, Brian Stanley, told the Irish parliament last night that 120 workers at the Rosderra Meats plant in Roscrea had tested positive for the virus. He also said that of 350 workers at the plant, up to 140 were off sick last week. Rosderra is the largest pork-processing company in Ireland.

Michael Creed, Ireland’s agriculture minister, told MPs that he was aware of six meat-processing plants with two or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 among workers, although he did not name them.

A spokesperson for Rosderra Meats confirmed to the Guardian that a number of employees had tested positive for coronavirus. They said that the company had implemented stringent measures to ensure the safety of employees, and added that production will be scaled down until all staff return to work.

The news came as one of Ireland’s biggest beef companies announced a Covid-related shutdown. Dawn Meats said on Friday that it had temporarily closed its plant in Westmeath after four workers tested positive for coronavirus. Dawn Meats produces more than 400 million burgers a year for McDonald’s outlets in the UK and Europe. In a statement, the company said that the plant had been closed “out of an abundance of caution”. It has yet to decide if it will reopen next week.

Workers at other meat plants, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said they were frightened of contracting the virus, and expressed deep concern that social distancing is not being enforced on some factory floors. One said that “people are on top of each other, it’s like a cattle mart”. A complaint made to a line manager was ignored, they say.

The closure has raised deep concerns that Ireland’s export-driven agri-food sector will be severely hit by the pandemic. Agri-food is the most important domestic industry in the country, employing more than 170,000 people. Produce is exported to more than 180 countries and the sector is worth €14bn (£12.3bn) to the economy.

The US, another country where the meat industry is a vital economic component with a powerful lobby, has been hit so hard by coronavirus-related closures that President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order to keep meat plants open. There are fears that prices and supply may be seriously disrupted.

In Northern Ireland, union representatives are pushing owners to undertake full health and safety risk assessments at meat plants, following concerns that factories are not putting workers’ safety first. “Companies are not enforcing social distancing and definitely not providing enough PPE,” said Brian Hewitt of Unite, who said he was aware of positive cases of the virus in workers at meat plants in Armagh and Tyrone. “Workers are afraid of getting infected,” he said.

In March, workers at the poultry processor Moy Park in Portadown walked out over fears that the company was putting employees at risk of infection. Sean McKevitt of Unite, who represents the workers, said on Friday that following negotiations with the company there was an “improved picture” for staff at Moy Park’s Dungannon and Portadown plants. Social distancing was in place, and workers had secured an additional £30 a week payment.

There are more than 20,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, and 1,232 people diagnosed with the virus have died. The lockdown restrictions that were put in place to manage the spread of the virus are expected to remain for the coming weeks.",JustBadNews,0
"Chinese produced CS (tear gas) munitions recently employed by the Hong Kong police are more dangerous than the munitions produced in the West- poor build quality and quality control by the manufacturers, which cause the submunitions to burn at dangerously high temperatures.",http://hongkongfp.com/2020/05/01/explainer-why-china-made-tear-gas-is-more-dangerous/,"It is no secret that the Chinese produced CS (tear gas) munitions recently employed by the Hong Kong police are more dangerous than the munitions produced in the West and employed at the beginning of the democracy protests. But what is less known is exactly why this is the case.

The real danger of CS munitions is the result of poor build quality and quality control by the manufacturers, which cause the submunitions to burn at dangerously high temperatures. This causes a far greater risk of inducing serious burns in targets, combusting upon impact, and degrading the CS into far more dangerous compounds.

Photo: Studio Incendo.

In the case of the Norinco NF01, a 38mm CS round produced on the Chinese mainland, magnesium and aluminium power are used as accelerants to aid combustion. Both of these serve to raise the temperature of the submunitions to 500°C or higher after being discharged. These temperatures degrade the CS gas discharged by the submunitions and release poisonous carcinogenic dioxins.

This temperature alone makes the submunitions dangerous if touched, and hot enough to burn through asphalt. And chemical analysis of spent NF01 cartridges shows that the carcinogens within also include cyanide gas.

The danger of this cartridge has also been demonstrated by its use in other countries. In October 2008, the munition resulted in the deaths of several protestors in Bangkok, Thailand, and the Thai authorities destroyed their entire stockpile in response.

The Jing An KF-302-20 is a CS grenade that Hong Kong police began to purchase last August to replace their rapidly diminishing stocks of British N225 Rubber Bursting CS Grenades, which were no longer available for purchase after the British government revoked the manufacturers export license in June of the same year.

The KF-302-20 has all the same chemical and thermal dangers of the NF01 previously discussed, heating up to 3000°C during combustion in confined, laboratory conditions and reaching 500°C in normal usage, and also produces cyanide gas as a consequence.

On November 2, a volunteer medic standing at the Percival Street Tram Stop in Causeway Bay suffered third-degree burns after a submunition fell down his back and ignited his shirt.

This danger of ignition poses another danger, as attempting to extinguish the flames with water will produce hydrogen, and risks causing a second detonation of the submunition. The KF-302-20 is also excessively loud at detonation and could cause permanent hearing loss.

The KF-302-20 also has very unreliable fuses and often detonates early. The manufacturer claims that it detonates 1.2 seconds after release, but examples have been documented detonating as early as 0.5 seconds after release. This makes the control of the munition far more difficult, and subsequently dangerous.

Indeed, while certainly “less-lethal,” CS is far from non-lethal even when manufactured correctly, as user error by the operator can still create the potential for lethality.

Early in the protests, when the Hong Kong Police Force exclusively used American manufactured NonLethal Technologies MP-6M5-CS 38mm cartridges, and British manufactured N225 Rubber Bursting CS Grenades, which both burn at a low enough temperature to not degrade into cyanide gas nor combust on impact, the munitions were still employed in dangerous manners that endangered the protestors and civilians they were fired at.

In particular, CS gas should not be fired indoors, as ventilation is required to prevent suffocation. This guideline was infamously disregarded by the Hong Kong police on August 11, when CS gas was deployed inside Kwai Fong Metro Station.

CS munitions also should not be fired directly at the head, as the submunitions are powerful enough to cause kinetic (impact) damage , and hot enough to cause thermal damage (burns). Notably, this guideline was disregarded on August 5 and 11 when Hong Kong police fired CS munitions at protesters from rooftops, which guaranteed hits to the head.",JustBadNews,0
Bleach poisoning calls on the rise.,http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/494744-poison-control-centers-report-increase-in-calls-pertaining-to-exposure-to,"Poison control centers in a number of states have reported a rise in calls about exposure to household cleaners since President Trump Donald John TrumpHillary Clinton responds to Chrissy Teigen tweet: 'I love you back' Police called after Florida moms refuse to wear face masks at school board meeting about mask policy Supreme Court rejects Trump effort to shorten North Carolina mail-ballot deadline MORE made remarks suggesting that disinfectants should be looked into as a possible treatment for the coronavirus.

New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene confirmed to NPR that the poison control center saw a rise in calls specifically pertaining to exposure to household cleaners within 18 hours of Trump’s remarks on Thursday.

Department spokesman Pedro Frisneda told the outlet that the center had recorded nine cases during that window that were “specifically about exposure to Lysol, 10 cases specifically about bleach and 11 cases about exposures to other household cleaners.”

That is more than double the number of cases the center recorded during the same period last year, according to NPR.

The report comes as Trump continues to face backlash over comments he made at a White House briefing held by his coronavirus task force on Thursday. During the briefing, Trump suggested that light, heat and disinfectants be studied as potential treatments for the coronavirus.

“So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that hasn't been checked but you're going to test it,” Trump said then. “And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside of the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that too. Sounds interesting.”

“I see the disinfectant — where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?” he asked at the briefing.

Trump has since walked back his comments, saying on Friday that he was being sarcastic during the briefing.

""I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,"" Trump said at the time.

“I was asking a sarcastic — and a very sarcastic question — to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside,” he continued. “But it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters.”

In a video message posted on Twitter that same day, NYC Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot urged residents against ingesting disinfectants as a possible treatment against COVID-19.

“Very clearly, disinfectants are not intended for ingestion either by mouth, by ears, by breathing them in — in any way, shape or form. And doing so can put people at great risk,” she said in the clip.

Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike issued a similar warning to residents in the state in the wake of Trump’s remarks during a briefing on Friday.

“There has been a significant increase in calls to the Illinois Poison Control Center in association with exposure to cleaning agents [since Thursday],” Ezike said at the briefing, according to NBC Chicago.

Ezike said a person even recently tried to gargle mouthwash mixed with bleach, the news outlet reported.

“Injecting, ingesting or snorting household cleaners is dangerous. It is not advised, and it can be deadly,” she added.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) also said on Sunday that emergency hotlines in their states recorded an increase in calls from people looking for guidance since Trump’s controversial remarks.

“We have seen an increase in numbers of people calling poison control, and so I think it’s really important that every one of us with a platform disseminate medically accurate information,” Whitmer said.

“I want to say, unequivocally no one should be using disinfectant, to digest it to fight COVID-19,” she continued. “Please don’t do it. Just don’t do it.”

Hogan said his state saw “hundreds of calls come into our emergency hotline at our health department asking if it was right to ingest Clorox or alcohol cleaning products, whether that was going to help them fight the virus.”

“So, we had to put out that warning to make sure that people were not doing something like that, which would kill people actually to do it,” he said Sunday, pointing to a recent warning issued by the Maryland Emergency Management Agency advising resident not to ingest disinfectants.

""The president's got to focus on the message, stick to a message and make sure that these press conferences are fact-based,"" he added.",JustBadNews,0
Saudi Arabia ends death penalty for minors and floggings,http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/saudi-arabia-ends-death-penalty-minors-floggings-70353516?cid=social_twitter_abcn,"Saudi Arabia ends death penalty for minors and floggings Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has ordered an end to the death penalty for crimes committed by minors

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia's King Salman has ordered an end to the death penalty for crimes committed by minors, according to a statement Sunday by a top official.

The decision comes on the heels of another ordering judges to end the practice of flogging, replacing it with jail time, fines or community service and bringing one of the kingdom’s most controversial forms of public punishment to a close.

King Salman's son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is seen as the force behind the kingdom’s loosening of restrictions and its pivot away from ultraconservative interpretations of Islamic law known as Wahhabism, which many in the country still closely adhere to.

The crown prince has sought to modernize the country, attract foreign investment and revamp Saudi Arabia’s reputation globally. He's also overseen a parallel crackdown on liberals, women's rights activists, writers, moderate clerics and reformers. The 2018 killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey by agents who worked for the crown prince drew sharp criticism internationally.

The latest royal decree by King Salman could spare the death penalty for at least six men from the country’s minority Shiite community who allegedly committed crimes while under the age of 18, including Ali al-Nimr, who had participated in anti-government protests. Such activity carries terrorism-related charges in the kingdom for disturbing order and disobeying the ruler.

In a document seen by The Associated Press, the royal decree orders prosecutors to review cases and drop punishments for those who've already served the maximum 10 years.

However, the decree states that terrorism-related cases of minors will be tried differently. It was not immediately clear whether these cases would be bound by the 10-year prison limit.

Last year, Saudi Arabia executed a young man convicted of crimes that took place when he was 16 years old. Amnesty International said Abdulkareem al-Hawaj was found guilty of offences related to his participation in protests in Shiite-populated areas of Saudi Arabia.

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have long called on the kingdom to abolish the use of the death penalty, particularly for crimes committed by minors.

The president of the Saudi government's Human Rights Commission, Awwad Alawwad, confirmed the latest decision in a statement Sunday, saying it helps the kingdom establish “a more modern penal code and demonstrates the kingdom’s commitment to following through on key reforms.”

He said “more reforms will be coming,” and that the two decisions “reflect how Saudi Arabia is forging ahead in its realization of critical human rights reforms even amid the hardship imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.""

The decree expands on a previous order by King Salman issued in late 2018, which set a maximum 10-year prison term for minors in certain cases, except for crimes punishable by death. Now the 10-year maximum applies to all crimes by minors, with the possible exception of terrorism-related crimes.

“This step, if true, needs to nullify current death sentences of all children,” Ali al-Ahmed, a Saudi rights activist in Washington, said.

Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court recently issued a directive to end flogging as a form of punishment sometime in April, according to another document seen by The Associated Press.

The public spectacle of whipping a handcuffed prisoner for often non-violent crimes had drawn some comparisons to the types of punishment carried out by extremist groups like the Islamic State. Saudi authorities had argued it was a form of deterrence against potential criminals. Rights groups criticized the practice as inhumane.

The Supreme Court document said the decision was in line with the kingdom's reforms and developments in the realm of human rights as directed by King Salman and overseen by the crown prince.

Five years ago, prominent Saudi blogger Raif Badawi was given 50 lashes before hundreds of spectators in the metropolitan city of Jiddah. It drew outrage and condemnation from around the world, including from many of Saudi Arabia's Western allies. Badawi’s feet and hands were shackled during the flogging but his face was visible.

Badawi is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence and was ordered to pay more than $266,000 in fines on charges related to his criticism of Saudi Arabia’s powerful clerics on the liberal blog he founded.

While some crimes, such as murder, may carry fixed punishments under Saudi Arabia’s interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, many other offenses are considered “tazir,"" meaning neither the crime nor the punishment is defined in Islam.

Discretionary judgments for “tazir” crimes, such as flogging, have led to arbitrary rulings with contentious outcomes. Muslim countries generally do not practice public flogging.

“This is a good step but we are still waiting to see if existing lashing sentences will be reversed and expunged,” al-Ahmed said.

China exploits Facebook delays over advertising rules to spread coronavirus propaganda,http://telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/26/china-exploits-facebook-delays-advertising-rules-spread-coronavirus/,"Chinese state media is exploiting a delay in Facebook's new advertising rules to spread coronavirus propaganda in strategically significant countries, including British allies.

The social media giant had planned to crack down on political adverts in 32 nations, bringing them into line with the stricter rules it already imposes in sensitive markets such as US, the UK, the European Union and Taiwan.

But the pandemic has forced Facebook to delay that plan, allowing China's state-backed spinners to continue bombarding those countries with unlabeled political ads that might otherwise be taken down.

Earlier this month The Telegraph revealed how Chinese state media outlets had sidestepped and sometimes evaded Facebook’s ad rules, running anti-American attack ads without carrying any political disclaimer.

Yet further analysis by the Telegraph found significant differences in China's tactics between different countries, with ads shown in places where the rules are not yet in force being far more likely to criticise the US, attack Donald Trump or focus personally on China's president, Xi Jinping.

In particular, China Global Television Network (CGTN), a state-controlled broadcaster currently under investigation by Ofcom, has repeatedly bought suites of more aggressive ads that seem to never to have run in any market protected by Facebook's stricter standards.

The “delayed” countries targeted by CGTN included Western allies such as Japan and Australia, and countries where China has diplomatic designs such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico and the Philippines. Some ads were also shown in some British overseas territories, including Anguilla, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.

Although it is difficult to know CGTN's true intent, the pattern suggests that it may be deliberately tailoring its output to skirt Facebook’s rules by reserving certain messages for countries where they will not break the rules.",JustBadNews,0
Amazon Loses Appeal of French Order to Stop Selling Nonessential Items: The ruling is another court victory by French unions against Amazon in a battle over workplace safety.,http://nytimes.com/2020/04/24/business/amazon-france-unions-coronavirus.html,"PARIS — Amazon lost an appeal on Friday of a French court decision ordering the e-commerce giant to stop delivering nonessential items in France during the coronavirus crisis to protect workers, raising questions about the immediate future of its business in the country.

The Versailles Court of Appeals upheld a lower-court ruling from last week that prompted Amazon to shutter its six mammoth warehouses around France for a week and put its 10,000 workers on paid furlough.

Under the ruling, Amazon can deliver only health items, food, pet food and electronics until it carries out a risk evaluation of its sites with French unions, which have clashed with Amazon for refusing to engage with them on health protocols to protect employees from the threat of the virus at Amazon’s warehouses.

The court said Amazon would be fined 100,000 euros, or around $108,000 for every delivery not meeting the requirement. The court said it would review Amazon’s progress in a month.",JustBadNews,0

"Family of man killed by police in Walmart angered by lack of notification, calls for investigation",http://abcnews.go.com/US/family-man-killed-police-walmart-angered-lack-notification/story?id=70284327,"Family of man killed by police in Walmart angered by lack of notification, calls for investigation The victim was having a ""mental health crisis,"" the family's attorney said.

The grandmother of a bat-wielding man, who was shocked by two stun guns, and fatally shot by police officers inside a Walmart, is still waiting for notification from authorities to find out what happened to her grandson.

Steven Taylor was seen on cellphone video holding a green bat in what a 911 caller described as threatening inside of a Walmart in San Leandro, California, on April 18 as he was encountered by a police officer. Two of the videos captured by bystanders ended with Taylor bleeding to death in front of several frantic shoppers.

A departmental investigation was launched shortly after the shooting, according to a San Leandro Police Department spokesman.

The police department issued statements about the shooting on their social media page on April 19. The department's police chief posted a video about the incident on April 20, refuting some bystanders' accounts.

But, Taylor's family said they have not been notified about Taylor being shot or his death prior to the social media postings.

""I started seeing things on Facebook and heard a report on the news. I wasn't sure if it was about him,"" said Addie Kitchen, Taylor's grandmother.

Kitchen, 78, said she called the police department three times and the Alameda County Coroner's Bureau after seeing the social media post about the shooting.

It wasn't until the following afternoon that Taylor's mother was contacted by the coroner to confirm he died.

Police did not identify Taylor publicly until Tuesday.

""I'm angry. I'm upset. I still don't know what happened. No one has called us to say anything ... I still haven't heard from anyone,"" said Kitchen who says she refuses to watch any of the videos of the shooting.

Kitchen retained attorney S. Lee Merritt who has represented the families of victims of alleged police brutality. Merritt says that Taylor's siblings nor the mothers of his children were notified about the shooting.

The San Leandro Police Department released the two responding officers' body camera footage and a separate bystander's cellphone video on Wednesday evening. Request for comment from San Leandro Police Department Chief Jeff Tudor was not received.

""We know that this incident has garnered much attention in our community and that's why we are releasing this video now to provide as much information to our community as this investigation process continues,"" said Tudor in the community briefing video.

An unidentified man called 911 to report that a man was allegedly attempting to steal merchandise in the store while holding a bat and threatening to hit an associate and customers with it, according to the police video.

The first unidentified officer responded around 3:12 p.m. and asked Taylor to drop the bat, police said.

Taylor, a father of three, was seen on cellphone video and on the officer's body camera allegedly refusing to drop the bat and becoming confrontational.

Taylor, 33, was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHA) since he was a preteen, Kitchen told ABC News on Thursday.

""I never had to discipline Steven, just talking to him you can get his attention,"" said Kitchen, who raised Taylor and his two brothers. ""When he is off his medication in school, the principal would take care of him.""

""You just have to talk to him,"" Kitchen said about her grandson.

About 15 seconds into the verbal altercation, the officer drew his service weapon into his right hand and then his stun gun into his left hand, the videos show.

While holding both weapons simultaneously, the officer fired the stun gun, which shot electric prongs at Taylor. Police said the stun gun was ineffective since Taylor still did not drop the bat.

Throughout the escalating situation, a woman is heard on the cellphone videos repeatedly screaming ""put it down.""

As the stun gun's prongs pierce into Taylor's body, the officer fired one bullet into Taylor's chest, the videos show.

The sound of the metal bat hitting the store floor can be heard on the video, as it shows a second responding officer arriving on the scene.

Taylor's back is turned to the officers, and he puts his hands in the air as the second unidentified officer fires his stun gun, in another bystander's video.

""No more! Don't shoot him no more!"" another woman is heard screaming on the video.

The wounded man dropped face first to the ground as officers handcuffed him, the video shows.

""Officers called for paramedics and provided first aid until they arrived,"" police said in a statement. ""Despite life-saving measures, the man died from his injuries at the scene. Our thoughts are with the man’s family during this time.""

A preliminary autopsy report showed that Taylor died from ""a single gunshot wound to the chest,"" police said.

An internal investigation has been launched and the officers involved placed on administrative leave -- standard protocol in any officer-involved shooting, police said

""The District Attorney’s Office’s Officer Involved Shooting Team is conducting an independent and parallel investigation into this incident,"" said Alameda County Assistant District Attorney Teresa Drenick in an email to ABC News on Wednesday. ""Because it’s an active investigation, I am not able to discuss any of the details.""

It's unclear if the officers involved with Taylor's death received training from San Leandro's Community Assessment Transport Team (CATT), a mobile crisis team comprised of a behavioral health provider and an Emergency Medical Technician.

According to the San Leandro Police Department's 2018 annual report: ""Officers are limited in options when interacting with individuals in crisis. The CATT program will give officers additional options that may be better suited for those individuals. We anticipate the program will be in place by fall, 2019.""

Merritt also claimed that the second responding officer used excessive force when he fired his stun gun at Taylor who, at that point, was already wounded, he said.

The coroner released Taylor's body to the family, but Merritt said they cannot properly grieve because of social distancing guidelines related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Only 10 family members can view his body inside the funeral home, Kitchen said.

""Steven had so many friends and hung out with so many people. He loved to dance and was in a singing group,"" said Kitchen. ""He always kept you laughing.""",JustBadNews,0
Study shows that frozen poop knives don't work very well,http://discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/frozen-poop-knives-dont-work-very-well-in-case-you-were-wondering,"This story appeared in the May 2020 issue as ""Feces Fable."" Subscribe to Discover magazine for more stories like this.

This is a tale about a poop knife. As the story goes, an old Inuit man refused to relocate to a government settlement camp. His family, fearful of the repercussions, took away his tools in hopes that he’d be compelled to go. Instead, in the midst of winter, he honed his own feces into a frozen blade. With his fecal knife, he killed a dog, used its rib cage as a sled, used its hide to harness another dog and escaped into the night.

Wade Davis, an anthropologist who’s been called a “real-life Indiana Jones,” has been telling and retelling this story, in multiple books and even a TED Talk with more than 3.8 million views. When asked about the story’s veracity in a 2008 interview with Discover, Davis responded, “True or not, it’s a wonderful metaphor for the resilience of the Inuit people.”

Last winter, researchers at Kent State University tried to test whether the story could be true.

“No grad students were harmed in the production of this paper,” said assistant professor of anthropology Metin Eren. For eight “very difficult” days, Eren subjected himself to a high-fat, high-protein diet —mimicking the Arctic diet — and collected the raw materials in a plastic bag at home.

The researchers shaped the feces into knives using their hands or ceramic molds. Then they froze the knives in dry ice and sharpened them.

Eren was surprised by how hard the feces got. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, this might work,’ ” he says. But when the team tested the blades on pig hide, they melted on contact. “It was like a brown crayon,” says Eren. “Just left nasty skid marks.”

Davis, meanwhile, says he initially thought the study was a hoax when he was asked to review it for a scientific journal. “It just seemed beyond imagining that any sort of scientist… would take research funds and exhaust their own time to conduct such an experiment at a time when the Inuit are dealing with such serious issues,” he says. He also points out his disappointment that the team used skin from pigs, instead of a dog as in the original tale — pig skin is much thicker and therefore would be harder to pierce.

That said, Davis is, overall, amused. “I just think it’s funny and wonderful,” he says.

The results of Eren’s experiments won’t stop Davis from telling the anecdote in the future: “It just adds to the mix of the humorous story, the fact that a team of scientists set out to prove whether this could be true or not.

Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jews take to internet in coronavirus lockdown - One company has offered heavily filtered internet that will cancel automatically after the coronavirus crisis is over,http://reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-israel-ultraorthod/israels-ultra-orthodox-jews-take-to-internet-in-coronavirus-lockdown-idUSKCN225265?il=0,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel’s religiously devout Jews, who traditionally shun the use of internet or smartphones, are increasingly going online to shop, study and video chat as the coronavirus outbreak forces them to stay largely home.

Ultra-Orthodox rabbis restrict internet use among their followers to avoid exposure to sexually explicit and other religiously objectionable material, a policy that helps to keep their communities largely isolated.

But densely populated ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods have been particularly hard hit by the virus, with the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak forced into a complete lockdown to prevent the spread of the disease.

The result is a 40% surge in online traffic in these neighbourhoods since March 15, according to Bezeq, Israel’s largest telecoms group.

One company that markets solely to the ultra-Orthodox has offered deals for heavily filtered internet that will cancel automatically after the coronavirus crisis is over.

More than half of ultra-Orthodox Jews surveyed by Bezeq have increased use of digital media, while 8% of Bezeq’s new internet users are ultra-Orthodox, triple the normal average.

When asked whether they would continue using the internet for video calls after the crisis, 53% said they would.

“An existential need is leading to one of the fastest processes of internet adoption we have seen,” said Bezeq’s vice president for marketing and innovation, Keren Leizerovitch.

“DEEP CHANGE”

“We see in our survey that ultra-Orthodox will continue to use these tools even after the end of the crisis so we are talking about a deep change that may impact their way of life, expand their connection to the general population and contribute to economic growth.”

Gilad Malach, head of the Israel Democracy Institute’s ultra-Orthodox programme, noted that while the ultra-Orthodox did not use internet at home, many did use it at work for specific needs and with filters. “Regarding the coronavirus, the damage from not using the internet was clear. People realize that they are not updated about the situation like others,” he said, noting that members of the community were using not just special ultra-Orthodox sites but general news sites, something their rabbis have long feared.

Malach said nearly 60% of ultra-Orthodox Jews use the Internet - up from 50% before the outbreak and versus 90% in the rest of Israel.

Benjamin Fox, a father of 10, said he still does not have internet at home in Ramat Bet Shemesh, an ultra-Orthodox town in central Israel. But he noted that his study partner just got the internet because his wife, a computer programmer, has been forced to work at home.

“That’s one of the reasons why the rabbis permit people to have internet,” he said.

Shoshana Schwartz, an ultra-Orthodox addiction counsellor from Bet Shemesh, said she previously used internet for email and work, with occasional online purchases and Zoom sessions.

Now she uses Zoom extensively for clients. That, she said, had increased her internet use by “1,000%”.

Israel has reported nearly 14,600 cases of COVID-19 and 191 deaths. Restrictions imposed on public life to stem the spread of the virus have forced many Israeli businesses to close and sent unemployment above 26%.

The death toll is considerably lower than in many countries, however, and Israel is already easing some curbs to revive the economy.",JustBadNews,0

The funeral for Maulana Zubayer Ahmad Ansari, an Islamic teacher, broke the country's ban of no more than five people attending prayers at one time, sparking fears of a new coronavirus outbreak emerging from the event.

Tens of thousands of people flooded the roads to Brahmanbaria district, walking from the surrounding areas to attend the funeral, according to Mohammad Mamunul Haque, the joint secretary general of the Islamist party.

The police were unable to control the crowd, resulting in the officer in charge and assistant superintendent being withdrawn from the event and a ""three-member probe committee"" being formed to start an investigation into the congregation activity, according to Sohel Rana, the Bangladesh Police Central spokesperson.

Gay men in Morocco living in terror after trans influencer urged her followers to use dating apps to hunt them and out them,http://pinknews.co.uk/2020/04/18/morocco-gay-men-terror-naofal-moussa-sofia-talouni-ltrans-woman-outed-gay-dating-apps/,"Naofal Moussa's Instagram Live video where she instructed her followers to make fake accounts on gay dating apps. (Screenshot/Supplied)

Gay men in Morocco are living in terror after a beauty influencer instructed her hundreds of thousands of followers to use gay dating apps to identify them, in a country where homosexuality is illegal and violent homophobia is rife.

Naofal Moussa, also known as Sofia Talouni, is a trans woman based in Turkey who – before her verified account was deleted on Friday – had more than 627,000 Instagram followers.

Starting on Monday this week, she used her nightly Instagram Live series – watched by over 100,000 people – to instruct the straight women following her to download gay dating apps from the app store and use them to find gay men in their vicinity.

Any form of same-sex intimacy – including kissing – is illegal in Morocco and punishable by up to three years in prison.

There is also no law against harassment or discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Multiple gay men PinkNews spoke to described how they are now living in a state of absolute terror: watching other gay men get outed on social media, beaten up by their families, kicked out of their homes, disappear and, in several, unverified, cases, die by suicide.

All while wondering if they will be outed next.

Naofal Moussa: trans woman told her followers how to find gay men online.

In now-deleted Instagram Live videos seen by PinkNews, and translated by queer activists in Morocco, Moussa – who is mainly known as a beauty influencer – says: “I feel bad for those f****ts but I don’t care.”

“So girls you will go on the app store. You will type in the word ‘gay’. And then a lot of gay apps will show up.”

“These gay apps will show you all the people who are near you. But you girls should create fake profiles and choose that you’re bottoms,” she continues. “Which means you want someone to f**k you.”

“You girls should create fake profiles and choose that you’re bottoms.”

Telling her followers that the three “famous” gay dating apps are Grindr, Planet Romeo and Hornet, she added: “Listen girls and women that think they have manly gay husbands and sons…. these apps will show you the ‘gay’ people who are near you.

“100 metres, 200 metres or even one metre. Just near you in the living room since everyone is home now.

“It could even show you your husband, your son. It could show you your neighbour from next door. It could show you your cousin, your uncle.

“Everyone.”

Naofal Moussa did not explicitly tell her followers to use the information she shared about gay dating apps to hunt down and out gay men.

But that is exactly what happened.

‘You f*****s are ruining this country.’

This week, pictures of gay men began circulating in closed Facebook groups, with homophobic captions.

And in a later Instagram Live, Moussa held up her phone and showed screenshots her followers had taken of gay men’s dating app profiles (PinkNews has seen these screenshots but is not republishing them here due to safety concerns for the men).

Messages sent to gay men on dating apps, from people who had tracked them down using Moussa’s instructions, were extremely homophobic and threatened violence.

“If I catch you, I’ll cut your throat,” one message read.

“You f****ts are ruining this country.”

Other messages sent to gay men on dating apps, from people who claimed to be women, read: “You got caught, f****t”, “I’ll deal with you later” and “I’m just trying to find all the f****ts in my neighbourhood”.

Pictures of gay men in Morocco circulate on Facebook.

“I woke up to my friends’ and people I know’s pictures all over Facebook with the most horrible and homophobic captions,” a 19-year-old gay man living in Morocco told PinkNews.

“I was in a constant state of fear and panic wondering if my pictures were there too, and when will this reach my parents.”

He explains that he lives with his parents and has hidden his sexuality from them ever since the day they found out he had commented on a picture of a gay Moroccan man.

“They beat me up because I was engaging with ‘deviant’ people,” he said, “and from that day on I’ve hiding everything about my sexuality.”

A friend of his who was outed this week has not replied to his messages for three days.

Others, he says, have also disappeared from social media after being outed.

And out queer people have received death threats, he adds, while the number of gays rumoured to have been kicked out of their homes onto the streets – during national lockdown – is growing.

Gay men in Morocco kicked out onto the streets.

“She has ruined the lives of so many people just in the past four days,” says Nassim*, a gay man who lives in Casablanca.

Nassim knows of at least 40 gay men who’ve been exposed and kicked out of their homes in Casablanca alone, as a result of Moussa’s videos.

“You can imagine how dangerous that is during a lockdown,” he says. “They basically will have nowhere to go.”

Nassim, who is closeted, explained how dangerous it is in Morocco to be outed as gay: “If our parents know that we’re gay they will immediately kick us out, abuse us or if you’re very lucky and your parents have a little bit of humanity in them, they will keep you but your life will never be the same.

“They will always see you as sick, and they’ll keep constantly trying to talk you into changing and maybe go to a therapist.”

“Moroccans hate gays with all their hearts.”

The queer community in Morocco had been “living in peace for a while”, he said, because “as long as nobody knows you’re gay you’re fine”.

“But because of Sofia [Moussa] now, there’s hundreds of Facebook groups run by Moroccans just to find gay people and expose them… Moroccans hate gays with all their hearts.”

Suicide and ‘torture’.

Hamza Makhchoune, an openly gay Moroccan photographer, has filed a report with the public prosecutor’s office in Casablanca about Moussa’s videos.

“The dangers that the live stream resulted was exposing many homosexuals who are still in the closet or still not yet sure about his sexual orientation and trying to figure that out,” Makhchoune says.

“Some people got threatened on messenger by neighbours and others are getting blackmailed.”

Makhchoune says he knows of a gay youth who is being “tortured” by his family, who are also beating him up and spitting on him, after he was outed in one of the Facebook groups.

Because the boy is under 18, the queer community is unable to help him, Makhchoune says.

“Sometimes I wish I am the one to be exposed instead of others such as the teenager,” he continues.

Details about the number of the gay men who have killed themselves this week as a result of being outed remain unclear, but almost every gay man PinkNews spoke to was aware of at least one person who had died by suicide.

If they were kicked out and killed themselves without speaking to anyone then “it is hard to know what happened”, Makhchoune says.

“So far, I know only the results.”

Why did a trans woman target gay men?

Makhchoune said: “I think that considering what Sofia [Moussa] has passed through in her life and it was not easy for her that her father does not accept her and she has not seen him for about 20 years.

“That has created a dark stone in her heart. She was angry and she did what she did. Maybe she wanted not to be the only one rejected and kicked out.”

Nassim added that Moussa “always wanted to be accepted by the Moroccan public”.

“In order to gain that acceptance from that, she sold us out and started giving them every way possible out there on how to find gay people and expose them and ruin their lives, and because also it increases her following and also brings her financial gain, since she lives in Turkey and she has a beauty/cosmetic business over there.”

Moussa’s Instagram account was taken down on Friday after efforts from Moroccan queer and feminist groups, as well as international queer organisers like Adam Eli.

But the damage and violence caused by her videos continues.

“She basically announced a war on gay people,” Nassim says. “We’re really scared and she has ruined the image of the queer community forever.”

The 19-year-old gay man, who had to remain anonymous for safety reasons, said: “This means a total loss of our underground queer culture.

“We are wondering if there is any safe space for us to go to after all of this ends.”

"Sorry, Immunity to Covid-19 Won't Be Like a Superpower",http://wired.com/story/sorry-immunity-to-covid-19-wont-be-like-a-superpower/,"There are signs that the pandemic peak has passed in New York City, and maybe in other hot spots of infection too. While there will be much more suffering to come, both in these places and elsewhere, talk has turned in recent days to how we’re going to get people back out into society. Central to these discussions has been the notion of immunity. Which of us is safe from Covid-19, and how might that be measured? Are existing antibody tests good enough to clear people for going back to work? Should we put in place a nationwide system of immunity passports or certificates? What about raising an army of the recovered to lead the nation’s fight against the virus?

SUBSCRIBE Subscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.

The answers to these questions come with considerable caveats. As many have pointed out, we can’t assume that any prior exposure to the virus will make it so a person can’t get sick again. Even if our bodies learn to fight off the illness, we don’t know how long this protection might endure. “Immunity after any infection can range from lifelong and complete to nearly nonexistent,” the epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said in The New York Times on Sunday. “So far, however, only the first glimmers of data are available about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.”

But public debates about immunity to Covid-19 could still be subject to a treacherous misapprehension, even once the caveats above have been acknowledged. The problem starts with just the word, immunity. It tends to conjure something binary: Either you have it or you don’t; either you’re a member of the superpowered legion of recovered, or you’re a vulnerable normie like the rest of us. The wisest commentators point to all the factors that remain unknown; they warn us that it’s possible that protection from Covid-19 will be short-lived or that it will go only to some of those who get infected. Yet a crude assumption can still be hiding in this miasma of uncertainty: that at any given point in time, people are perfectly immune to Covid-19—or else they’re not.

The truth is, our immune responses to this virus aren’t likely to be permanent or perfect.

The truth is far less black and white. There may be many unanswered questions about how our bodies fight off SARS-CoV-2 infection, but one broader point is very clear: Adaptive immunity is not an on/off switch. Instead of treating it as such, we should learn to think in terms of an immunity continuum. At one end is what’s called sterilizing immunity, in which exposure to a pathogen tends to induce a lifelong, fail-safe protection from it. (That’s the case with measles.) At the other end is no immunity at all, where a history of prior illness doesn’t seem to matter—or, indeed, where it could even make things worse. Having an immune response to one strain of the virus causing dengue fever, for example, can worsen your reaction to the other types.

Experts say that SARS-CoV-2 likely falls somewhere in the middle, such that people who get exposed are neither sterilized against further illness nor left utterly defenseless. Instead, they enter into a state you might think of as “immunishness,” an intermediate level of protection that dwindles over time. The robustness of this immunish state—whether it prevents all reinfection or merely makes a second round of sickness less intense—and the period of time for which it lasts will depend on multiple factors, such as a patient’s genetics and sex (women tend to have stronger immune reactions than men), the strength of their initial immune response, and the characteristics of the virus itself as it continues to evolve.

Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.

Where, exactly, might responses to the new coronavirus fall on this continuum of induced immunishness? That’s still unknown. We don’t even know which types of antibodies are most crucial for preventing SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cells. Without that information, it will be very hard to design blood tests that deliver reasonable estimates of the strength of someone’s immunity, in the sense of how likely they are to become infected or how severe their symptoms might be.",JustBadNews,0
Anthony Fauci doesn't 'feel confident at all' about China's coronavirus data,http://nypost.com/2020/04/17/fauci-doesnt-feel-confident-about-chinas-coronavirus-data/,"Dr. Anthony Fauci is doubting China’s coronavirus data, saying he’s not certain the country of 1.3 billion has reported an accurate death toll.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has been at the forefront of the country’s COVID-19 response, shared his suspicion Thursday during an appearance on Fox News, saying he doesn’t “feel confident at all” regarding the official COVID-19 fatality count being reported by the Chinese Communist Party.

“I mean I think any of us who have been dealing with this now for the last few months don’t feel confident at all that we have all of the data of the originally infected individuals, how long there were people in the circulation or even now, how many deaths there really are in China,” Fauci said. “That number’s really rather a low number, that number surprises me, that that number is so low.”

Fauci’s comments came just hours before the death toll in Wuhan, China – where the global outbreak originated – was revised to show an increase of 50 percent, from 2,579 to 3,869 fatalities. China had yet to update national totals as of early Friday, but the new count pushed the country’s total death toll to 4,632, up from a previously reported 3,342.

The revised death toll in Wuhan follows reports that the Communist Chinese government waited six days before warning citizens of the severity of the outbreak in Wuhan, a city of 11 million.

Success model Singapore has worst day of infections as cases double over a week,http://theprint.in/world/success-model-singapore-has-worst-day-of-infections-as-cases-double-over-a-week/403443/,"Text Size: A- A+

Singapore/London: Singapore — seen as a success model in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic — is reporting its biggest number of new cases in a single day, doubling its infection count over the past week as an outbreak at dormitories housing foreign workers intensifies.

A record 728 new infections were reported late Thursday, bringing the total in the past seven days to 2,517. The island has a total of 4,427 cases since the infections broke out earlier this year, according to data from the Ministry of Health.

Of those affected by Covid-19 so far, six in 10 lived in dorms, the data showed. That ratio is expected to change quickly, with these tightly packed living facilities housing thousands of foreign workers becoming Singapore’s latest challenge in its fight to contain the spread.

Among the cases on Thursday, these workers — coming from countries such as Bangladesh, India and Pakistan — made up nine in 10 of new infections reported, a trend that has emerged in the past week. Authorities have moved to isolate the clusters.

The number of new cases among workers “residing in dormitories has increased significantly, in line with our continued efforts to actively test and isolate the infected workers,” the ministry said in its statement. Workers in about 20 dorms have been affected by outbreak, according to a government data compiled by Bloomberg.

It also threw a spanner into the city’s containment strategy, where it had earlier resisted a lockdown with a stabilizing of infections elsewhere across the country. Before imposing its version of a shutdown — called a “circuit breaker” — more than a week ago, it had tightened entry rules for travelers and poured billions of dollars into the economy.

Foreign workers have helped Singapore build its public housing towns, mass transit lines, airports and ports, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post Thursday. They also work through midnight shifts in factories, and take care of the sick and elderly in hospitals and nursing homes, he said.

“Hundreds of thousands of Singapore households depend on domestic workers from neighboring countries,” Lee said. “We will work with them, especially those living in the dorms, to see through this difficult period.”

A total of 10 people have died in Singapore from the coronavirus. Imported cases — those that were infected overseas or visitors traveling to the city-state — have been cut to zero in the past week, while daily numbers of community spread have largely leveled off in the last two weeks. Globally, infections have topped 2.1 million and deaths exceeded 140,000.

Close to 80% of Singapore’s workforce is now working from home as the country enters its second week of “circuit-breaker” measures, including the closure of schools and most workplaces. –Bloomberg

Amazon told investors on Thursday that it has suspended more than 6,000 seller accounts on its platform from around the world for price gouging on essential items during the pandemic.

In his annual letter to shareholders, Bezos said the company has also removed more than 500,000 listings from Amazon’s website for price gouging. And, he said, Amazon has ramped up its reporting of price gougers to the authorities.

""To accelerate our response to price-gouging incidents, we created a special communication channel for state attorneys general to quickly and easily escalate consumer complaints to us,” Bezos wrote.

Some context: In a blog post last month, Amazon said it’s suspended 3,900 sellers on its US website alone.

But Amazon has battled rising criticism from policymakers over the availability of critical goods such as hand sanitizer and toilet paper as more people shop for essentials from home.

The company received probing letters in March from US lawmakers — and attorneys general representing nearly three dozen states and the District of Columbia. The attorneys general in particular accused Amazon of failing to prevent price gouging, despite efforts to apply automated and manual reviews of its platform.",JustBadNews,0

The consulate said local officials had launched a round of mandatory tests for coronavirus, followed by mandatory self-quarantine, for anyone with ""African contacts"" regardless of their recent travel history or previous quarantine completion.

African-Americans have also reported that some businesses and hotels refuse to do business with them, it added.

""The US Consulate General advises African-Americans or those who believe Chinese officials may suspect them of having contact with nationals of African countries to avoid the Guangzhou metropolitan area until further notice,"" it said.

Fired researcher Mauro Ferrari denounces EU inaction on COVID-19: I have lost faith in the system itself,http://wsws.org/en/articles/2020/04/13/ferr-a13.html,"Last week, on April 7, distinguished nanomedicine researcher Mauro Ferrari was forced to resign as European Research Council (ERC) president. The ERC’s Scientific Council opposed his efforts to mobilize scientists across the European Union (EU) in a coordinated fight against COVID-19.

The ouster of Ferrari provides a devastating indictment of the political and, one might add, moral bankruptcy of European capitalism. In his resignation letter, Ferrari denounced the EU’s calculated inaction in the pandemic, which is still surging with nearly one million cases and over 80,000 deaths in Europe, long after coordinated public health measures contained outbreaks in China and South Korea. Worldwide, there are already over 1.8 million COVID-19 cases and 113,000 deaths.

Ferrari begins his letter, “Please forgive me, but I believe that the priority now is to stop the pandemic. The priority is to save millions of lives. ... I believe in science at the service of society, especially when it counts the most. And now it does count the most, since it is only through science that COVID-19, and its successor pandemics, will ever be defeated.”

He became ERC president in January 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic began. Hailing from a working class area of Udine in Italy, Ferrari earned his doctorate in mechanical engineering and did research in America, moving into biomedical science after his first wife Mariluisa suddenly died of cancer in 1995. Last year, the ERC said it “wholeheartedly” supported his nomination as president, praising Ferrari’s “career as an accomplished scientist and leader in the USA, with a rich and diverse background in the field of research and its applications.”

Ferrari returned to Europe to lead the ERC, he writes in his resignation, based on a “commitment to the idealistic dream of a United Europe and my belief in serving the needs of the world.”

However, he adds, “Those idealistic motivations were crushed by a very different reality, in the brief three months since I took office. Disquieting early warning signs gave way to the painfully icy, cold recognitions of a world entirely different from what I had envisioned. The COVID-19 pandemic shone a merciless light on how mistaken I had been. In time of emergencies people, and institutions, revert to their deepest nature and reveal their true character.”

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the EU as a corrupt tool of the capitalist aristocracy, indifferent to the fate of millions. While the European Central Bank gave a €750 billion bailout to the banks, followed by multihundred-billion-euro bailouts by each major euro zone country, EU officials insisted they would not stop the spread of this deadly disease. Instead, they would allow it to infect the population, hoping surviving masses of workers would acquire what UK officials called “herd immunity.” With stunning indifference to human life, German Chancellor Angela Merkel calmly predicted that 70-90 percent of Germans (56-72 million people) would fall ill.

The EU adopted beggar-thy-neighbor policies, with Berlin and Paris refusing to export key medical supplies to countries like Italy worst hit by COVID-19. This placed the EU on a collision course with scientists who argued for a coordinated international struggle against COVID-19 and for treating the sick. Ferrari explains:

As it became evident that the pandemic would be a tragedy of possibly unprecedented proportions, I moved that the European Research Council should establish a special program directed at combating Covid-19. I believed this was justified by the expected burden of death, suffering, societal transformation, and economic devastation, especially striking the less fortunate, the weakest in the societies of the world. I thought that at a time like this, the very best scientists in the world should be provided with resources and opportunities to fight the pandemic, with new drugs, new vaccines, new diagnostic tools, new behavioral dynamic approaches based on science, to replace the oft-improvised intuitions of political leaders.

His proposals, Ferrari writes, were “passed on to different layers of the European Commission administration, where I believe they disintegrated upon impact. I have been extremely disappointed by the European response to COVID-19 ... the complete absence of coordination of health care policies among member states, the recurrent opposition to cohesive financial support initiatives, the pervasive one-sided border closures, and the marginal scale of synergistic scientific initiatives.”

The fact that Ferrari had illusions in the EU as he became ERC president gives his judgment of the EU today, based on the bitter experience of the last three months, all the more force.

While pledging to “continue to provide my most conscientious advice, in a public and transparent manner,” Ferrari writes, “I am afraid that I have seen enough of both the governance of science, and the political operations at the European Union. In these three long months, I have indeed met many excellent and committed individuals at different levels of the organization of the ERC and the EC. However, I have lost faith in the system itself.”

An examination of the ERC’s statement on its ouster of Ferrari vindicates his criticisms. Turning 180 degrees from its earlier praise of Ferrari’s scientific record, it claims he “displayed a complete lack of appreciation for the raison-d’être of the ERC” to fund research proposed by researchers themselves. At the same time, it issues insinuating criticisms of him for spending “extensive time in the USA,” making “personal initiatives” to the EU Commission, and meeting with “external enterprises, some academic and some commercial” to discuss the pandemic.

The ERC statement also defends its own record, claiming that it is “already very active in developing new programs,” including one on COVID-19.

This is a pathetic dodge. The ERC statement estimates that its support for coronavirus research over the years has reached “a total value of about €100 million.” This means that though COVID-19 threatens to kill millions and make hundreds of millions jobless worldwide, the ERC is dedicating about 0.1 percent of its €100 billion Horizon Europe fund to fighting it. In the meantime, the EU is plunging countless hundreds of billions of euros into the pockets of the superrich.

Sorbonne University President Jean Chambaz, a leading supporter of French President Emmanuel Macron’s unpopular university reforms, penned a letter as head of the League of European Research Universities (LERU) attacking Ferrari. In it Chambaz, the son of a central committee member of the Stalinist French Communist Party (PCF), lectured Ferrari on “the significance of independent bottom-up research” and the ERC’s role to “support this open and free research.”

Chambaz also took the opportunity to defend the ERC’s record on COVID-19 and appeal for more EU funding for the ERC. “It is admired worldwide for its success. It should be supported even more in the investment plan that the European Union is framing to exit the present crisis.”

Ferrari’s ouster testifies to the impossibility of fighting for a rational, scientific and international policy against COVID-19 through the existing European institutions. It is the working class that imposed public health measures to stop the pandemic in Europe. Mass wildcat strikes and walkouts in factories led to the initial shelter-at-home policies in Italy and France. Mobilizing all society’s scientific and industrial resources to fight COVID-19 will require the mobilization of the working class across Europe against the EU in a struggle for state power.",JustBadNews,0
China defends WHO and calls Taiwan 'venomous' in row over racist abuse towards Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,http://independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-china-who-taiwan-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus-latest-a9459481.html,"China has defended the World Health Organisation and its chief in a row with Taiwan over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Taiwan, which is not a member of the UN’s health agency because of Beijing’s objections, has accused the WHO of leaving it to tackle the spread of Covid-19 without access to crucial and timely information.

The argument took an ugly turn this week after the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he had faced months of “racist slurs” online that originated in Taiwan, as well as death threats, adding: “I don’t give a damn.”

China said Taiwan was “venomously” attacking the agency and trying to use the pandemic to advance its agenda of seeking independence. China claims Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory, though the island is practically run by its own democratically elected government.

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement that: “The [Taiwanese] DPP authorities are unscrupulously using the virus to seek independence, venomously attacking the WHO and its responsible people, conniving with the green internet army to wantonly spread racist comments. We strongly condemn this.” Green is the colour of the DPP – Taiwan’s ruling party.

On Thursday and Friday, messages started to emerge on social media purporting to be from Taiwanese people expressing remorse for the abuse of Tedros and the WHO. Most had similar wording, along the lines of: “As a Taiwanese, I feel extremely ashamed that we attacked Tedros in such a malicious way. I apologise to Tedros on behalf of the Taiwanese and beg for his forgiveness.”

In a statement, Taiwan’s justice ministry said the posts actually appeared to be a coordinated campaign from the mainland, designed to drive a wedge further between the WHO and Taiwan.

At a briefing, the ministry’s investigations team said the posts were suspicious because of the similarity of their wording, and the fact that they mainly feature the simplified Chinese characters more common to the mainland.

“There is a concern it is a deliberate operation by overseas forces,” the ministry said. “Falsely claiming to be Taiwanese, and openly admitting to racist attacks on WHO director general Tedros and begging forgiveness, seriously damages our country’s international reputation.”

Also on Friday, Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, issued a “strong protest” against Tedros’s suggestion that the abuse he had been receiving came from Taiwan.

“Taiwan always objects to discrimination in any form,” she wrote on her official Facebook page. “We know how it feels to be discriminated against and isolated more than anyone else as we have been excluded from global organisations for years.

“So I’d like to invite Tedros to visit Taiwan, to see how Taiwanese commit to devote to international society despite being discriminated and isolated.”

Taiwan is not the only country to have criticised the WHO over its handling of the coronavirus crisis. Donald Trump threatened this week to withdraw US funding from the agency, calling its approach “China-centric”.

“They’ve been wrong about a lot of things,” he told a daily briefing, where he suggested the WHO was influenced by Beijing in downplaying the severity of the outbreak when it first began. “They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. They would have known and they should have known and they probably did know,” Mr Trump said.

Other countries, like India, have diverged from WHO recommendations in a number of ways, formulating their own strategies for dealing with the virus. While Tedros said “test, test, test” was the best policy, India instead aggressively shut down first international travel and then movement within the country, while testing remained at minimal levels.

Recently, it has started rolling out mandatory use of face masks, and ramped up production of the untested malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. One Indian national described the country as “politely sidestepp[ing]” WHO advice on key aspects of virus management.

In Taiwan, some internet users have used the WHO row to draw attention back to the positive ways it is seen as having responded to the coronavirus pandemic.

Thanks to an early and effective prevention strategy – Taiwan was one of the places to start screening passengers from Wuhan in January – the island has reported just 382 cases of the virus to date, and on Friday confirmed its sixth death, an elderly patient with underlying health conditions.

Under the English hashtag #ThisAttackComesFromTaiwan, Twitter users wrote about all the good things that come from the island, including its democratic system and being the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.",JustBadNews,0
"Some 'Animal Crossing' players in China are using the game to protest government policies, and now the Chinese government is banning the game",http://businessinsider.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-banned-in-china-protests-2020-4?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds,"""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" is Nintendo's latest smash-hit success for its latest console, the Nintendo Switch.

Though the game isn't officially approved for sale in China, people have been able to buy the game through importers and by changing their console's region setting. ""The game has become extremely popular in China,"" Niko Partners senior analyst Daniel Ahmad said of the news. ""Even places like the Shanghai Fire dept used ['Animal Crossing'] to create some in-game messages.""

But the Chinese government is cracking down on the game, and it looks like censorship may be to blame: Some players involved in the Hong Kong protest movement have shared images from the game, like the one above, voicing opposition to Chinese government policies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" is a massive hit, and the latest blockbuster for Nintendo's wildly popular Switch console.

It's popular all over the world, even in places where it hasn't officially been released — like China, for instance, where some users are using their ""Animal Crossing"" island to protest government policies.

Joshua Wong, a Hong Kong-based activist, offered one example on Twitter earlier this month:

—Joshua Wong 黃之鋒 😷 (@joshuawongcf) April 2, 2020

Because ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" has a feature that enables players to create their own designs, people can decorate their islands however they please — including with protest slogans.

Between user-generated content and the game's massive popularity, red flags within the Chinese government appear to have been raised: Sellers on Chinese re-selling marketplace Taobao have been banned from selling the game as of this week.

The ban comes directly from Chinese regulators, who cited an old policy that's rarely enforced, according to Niko Partners senior analyst Daniel Ahmad, who covers the gaming industry in China.

Games that do get hit with bans ""usually fall under two criteria,"" Ahmad said. ""The game has content or user generated content that is deemed to be too offensive or violent,"" or, ""The game has become very popular and caught the attention of regulators.""

""Grand Theft Auto 5"" is cited as an example as the kind of game that might get flagged by Chinese government regulators. Rockstar Games

In the case of ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons,"" the game fits both criteria.

""The game has become extremely popular in China,"" Ahmad said. ""Even places like the Shanghai Fire Dept. used ['Animal Crossing'] to create some in game messages.""

Notably, the game isn't officially approved for sale in China.

The Nintendo Switch was only recently approved for sale by the Chinese government, and a limited trio of games were approved for sale alongside it: ""New Super Mario Bros. U,"" ""Super Mario Odyssey,"" and ""Mario Kart 8 Deluxe."" But Chinese Switch owners are apparently able to skirt those restrictions pretty easily.

""The imported version of 'Animal Crossing' is basically just the [Japanese] or [North American] or [European] version imported into China,"" Ahmad said. Moreover, the game can be purchased by simply changing the region of your Nintendo Switch to reflect a region where the game is available.

Still, the game's ban on Taobao is notable — it is the ""main platform"" for buying imported versions of games in China that are otherwise not approved for sale. It's unclear if Nintendo intends to bring ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" to China at some point in the future, and Nintendo representatives didn't respond to a request for comment as of publishing.",JustBadNews,0
"Fact check: Trump makes false claims about his coronavirus record and voter fraud, misleads about the WHO - CNNPolitics",http://cnn.com/2020/04/07/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus-briefing-april-7/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday made inaccurate claims about the World Health Organization and delivered more of the false statements that have become a signature trait of his daily coronavirus briefings.

We are still reviewing some of Trump's comments at the daily White House coronavirus briefing. We'll update this article with additional fact checks.

Trump continues touting unproven drugs

The President continued his weeks-long embrace of two anti-malaria drugs as a potential treatment for Covid-19, even though there isn't conclusive scientific proof that they are safe and effective.

The Food and Drug Administration recently gave doctors emergency authorization to use the medicines, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, to treat Covid-19 in hospitals but not at home. The FDA has not fully ""approved"" the drugs for Covid-19, which requires a much higher scientific standard.

""You are not going to die from this pill,"" Trump said, before acknowledging that he isn't a doctor but has reviewed some of the medical studies, adding, ""I really think it's a great thing to try.""

Facts First: There is no conclusive scientific evidence to support what Trump is saying. Clinical trials are underway, but the FDA and top public health officials have not endorsed Trump's view that the drugs are already known to be effective against Covid-19 and can be taken safely.

Doctors have contradicted Trump's specific comment that ""you are not going to die"" from these drugs. Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association, recently told CNN ""you could lose your life"" from this unproven treatment, echoing warnings from other experts.

Over the past few weeks, there has been a glaring messaging gap between Trump and top public health officials about these drugs. While Trump touts them as miracle drugs that are on the brink of saving lives, the medical experts are cautiously waiting for scientific evidence.

CNN reported earlier on Tuesday that Trump's comments have triggered a run on the drugs, with doctors and worried Americans emptying out pharmacies. These shortages pose potentially deadly risks to people with autoimmune diseases like lupus, who rely on hydroxychloroquine as a clinically proven treatment to reduce mortality, but are struggling to refill their prescriptions.

Some medical research suggests that the drugs could work against coronavirus, but the study most commonly cited by Trump was incredibly small and didn't follow typical procedures for randomized trials. A more robust, large-scale clinical trial is underway now in New York.

On Tuesday, Trump also referenced a Democratic state lawmaker in Michigan who tested positive for the coronavirus but recovered, and now credits hydroxychloroquine for her success.

Moments before arriving in the White House briefing room, Trump tweeted a Fox News clip of an interview with the lawmaker. Like Trump, anchors and guests on Fox News have repeatedly touted the potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine in recent weeks.

The lawmaker's story is compelling, but anecdotal. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has said that at this point, there is only anecdotal evidence that the drugs work.

Revisionist history on the flu

Reminded Tuesday that he had likened the coronavirus to the flu , Trump suggested that he was not downplaying the coronavirus when he did so.

""You said I said it was just like a flu. So the worst pandemic we ever had in this world was a flu, and it was called -- you know that -- it was in 1917, 1918. And anywhere from 50 (million) to a hundred million people died. That was a flu. OK. So you could say that I said it was a flu, or you could say the flu is nothing to -- sneeze at,"" he said.

Facts First: Trump was inaccurately portraying his own comments. When he likened the coronavirus to the flu in February and March, he was saying or strongly suggesting that the virus was like a conventional flu -- a ""regular flu"" or ""common flu"" -- not warning Americans that they could be facing something equivalent to the catastrophic flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919.

At a coronavirus briefing on February 26, for example, Trump said, ""It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner."" He also said : ""The flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year.""

As Trump has subsequently noted , the 1918-1919 flu pandemic killed tens of millions of people. Trump clearly was not suggesting in these February 26 comments that the coronavirus would be a devastating pandemic.

Again, Trump was invoking a conventional flu season that killed tens of thousands of people, not a pandemic that killed tens of millions. And until mid-March, Trump also downplayed the virus in comments in which he did not specifically mention the flu

At a Fox News town hall on March 24, Trump specifically rejected a comparison between the coronavirus pandemic and the 1918-1919 pandemic because of the high mortality rate in that pandemic more than a century ago -- a mortality rate he was exaggerating , but nonetheless.

""You can't compare this to 1918 where close to 100 million people died,"" he said.

European travel ban

Trump again exaggerated the travel restrictions he imposed on some European countries in March.

Trump claimed Tuesday that he had ""closed it down to Europe"" and then that he had ""closed it down to all of Europe.""

Facts First: Trump never closed the US to travelers from ""all of Europe."" Rather, he imposed restrictions on travel from most European countries but exempted others. And his restrictions did not apply to some people traveling from Europe: US citizens, permanent US residents, certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents and some other groups of travelers.

Trump's restrictions initially applied to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area, a European zone in which people can move freely across internal borders without being subjected to border checks. Trump later added the United Kingdom and Ireland. That still left out some European countries, including Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Ukraine and Russia.

The World Health Organization

During Tuesday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, Trump claimed that the World Health Organization downplayed the coronavirus and criticized his January 31 order restricting most travel between the United States and China.

""Take a look, I mean go through step by step, they said there's no big deal, there's no big problem, there's no nothing, and then ultimately when I closed it down they actually said that I made a mistake in closing it down, and it turned out to be right.""

Facts First: Trump is correct that the World Health Organization organization didn't support his travel restrictions with China -- the WHO opposes most international travel restrictions and sees them as ineffectual -- but he overstated the case when he insinuated that the WHO downplayed the virus.

The WHO has been criticized for a January 14 tweet noting that preliminary investigation by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, but the WHO did not say the virus was ""no big deal"" before Trump announced his travel restrictions. The WHO declared the virus a ""public health emergency of international concern"" on January 30 , the day before Trump announced the restrictions, out of concern that the virus could pose a threat to other countries beyond China.

On January 30 , the WHO said that it did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions, saying that ""such measures may have a public health rationale at the beginning of the containment phase of an outbreak"" but that they should only be short in duration if over 24 hours because they are not very effective.

As recently as February 29 , the WHO reiterated its opposition to blanket travel bans.

The WHO has been criticized for relying on official Chinese government figures relating to the virus, numbers which many officials doubt are accurate. Specifically, the WHO sent out a tweet on January 14 that stated ""Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus"".

Trump overstates when he insinuates that the WHO knew about the global threat the virus posed, but downplayed it. The WHO defines an emergency of international concern as ""an extraordinary event"" that constitutes a ""public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease"" and ""to potentially require a coordinated international response,"" meaning that the organization recognized that the virus posed an international threat beyond China.

On Tuesday, February 4 , the organization said that, while the virus had not yet reached pandemic levels, it was considered to be an epidemic with multiple locations; an epidemic being more than a normal number cases of an illness.

On March 11 , the WHO declared the virus a pandemic, meaning the worldwide spread of a new disease.

Trump denies something he had just said

Trump announced at the briefing that he planned to ""look into"" the US contribution to the World Health Organization, which he claimed had mishandled the coronavirus. Then, after continuing to criticize the WHO, he said, ""We'll be looking into that very carefully. And we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it and we're going to see.""

Trump was asked about 16 minutes later whether a pandemic is a good time to freeze funding for WHO. He responded that he is not saying he is going to do that, merely that he will look. When another reporter interjected that Trump had indeed said he would freeze funding, Trump said, ""No I didn't. I said we're going to look at it.""

Facts First: Trump was denying something he had plainly said. Though he had originally announced he would look into US spending on the WHO, he then announced he would impose a ""very powerful hold"" on the spending.

Trump opens new front in lies about voter fraud

Trump used Tuesday's briefing to launch baseless attacks against voting-by-mail, which many experts say is one fair and effective solution to holding a presidential election amid a pandemic.

""Mail ballots, they cheat, people cheat,"" he said. ""Mail ballots are very dangerous thing for this country because they're cheaters. They go and collect them. They're fraudulent in many cases.""

He added, ""the mail ballots are corrupt, in my opinion,"" and said that ""you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room signing ballots all over the place.""

Facts First: Trump is lying about voter fraud. Multiple studies over the years have confirmed that there is no widespread voter fraud in this country. Additionally, Democratic and Republican state officials routinely oversee elections where millions of people vote-by-mail without systematic problems.

Trump has long embraced conspiracy theories about voter fraud. After taking office, Trump set up a commission to investigate the issue, but the panel disbanded without uncovering any evidence supporting Trump's claims that millions voted illegally in 2016.

An expansive study in 2017 from the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning think tank, found that the rate of voter fraud in the United States was somewhere between 0.00004% and 0.0009%.

Voting-by-mail has become increasingly popular in US federal elections, and nearly a quarter of all voters cast mail ballots in 2016, according to the Election Assistance Commission. This year, the solid Republican state of Utah will conduct all-mail elections, which undercuts Trump's claims.

It's true that voting-by-mail poses some risks that don't exist with in-person voting, which Trump noted on Tuesday. But the most recent example of absentee ballot fraud involved Republican operatives in North Carolina who allegedly rigged an election for the House of Representatives in 2018.

Trump cast an absentee ballot last month in the Florida Republican primary, per local reports. Asked about this contradiction, Trump said it was OK ""because I'm allowed to"" vote by mail.

The vote-by-mail discussion came up at the White House briefing because of Tuesday's elections in Wisconsin, where the Democratic governor tried unsuccessfully to delay the vote, but was thwarted by the GOP-led legislature and the state Supreme Court's conservative majority.

In addition to the presidential primaries, there is a general election for a spot on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Trump has backed an incumbent justice who was appointed by Republican.

At the briefing, Trump said, ""All I did was endorse a candidate,"" but that's not a complete portrayal of his involvement in the Wisconsin elections. He tweeted four times in the past few days about the judicial race and urged people to vote Tuesday, saying, ""Wisconsin, get out and vote NOW.""

Public health experts have warned that the election could put voters and poll workers at risk.

Joe Biden and Trump's travel restrictions on China

Trump claimed Tuesday that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden admitted having been incorrect in his initial stance on Trump's travel restrictions on China.

""In all fairness to Joe Biden, he called me xenophobic, like I don't like China. I like China. Like, the Chinese people are phenomenal people. So I was called xenophobic, I was called racist, how could I do a thing like this? Now since then, Joe said that he was wrong and he said that I was right,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Biden's campaign did say last week that Biden Biden's campaign did say last week that Biden supports Trump's travel restrictions on China . But Biden has not said that he was wrong about anything related to the travel restrictions; Biden's campaign has maintained that his accusations of xenophobia were not specifically about those restrictions, and Biden did not take a firm position on the restrictions until his expression of support last week. ""Never happened,"" campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said Tuesday of Trump's claim that Biden has made an admission of error.

As PolitiFact reported, Biden said on January 31, the day Trump announced the restrictions on China, and again in a tweet on February 1 that ""science"" should lead the way in the response to the coronavirus outbreak, not Trump's ""record"" of ""xenophobia.""

Given the timing of Biden's remarks, it's not unreasonable for Trump to have inferred that Biden was claiming that the travel restrictions were an example of xenophobia. But Biden never specifically said that -- and Biden's campaign says the former vice president had been making a general statement about Trump's record and Biden's hopes for the response, not an accusation about the restrictions in particular.

Despite the campaign's explanation, we can't say that Trump's claim that Biden called the restrictions xenophobic was inaccurate; Biden left his words open to interpretation. But Trump was incorrect when he said Biden has acknowledged having been wrong.

Trump touts small business lending program

The President claimed the progress of the small business lending program -- the Payroll Protection Program -- was ""way ahead of schedule"" and touted figures that ignored serious challenges the program is facing. He said the Small Business Administration (SBA) has ""processed more than $70 billion in guaranteed loans and will provide much needed relief for nearly a quarter of a million businesses already.""

Facts first: The program has been fraught with The program has been fraught with delays since Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the program had started five days ago.

Some lenders claim the Treasury Department and SBA didn't give banks all the tools and guidance they need to make the loans available quickly. Some big banks have made little to no progress disbursing funding to small businesses as of Tuesday night.

For example, although Wells Fargo has processed some applications, it hasn't yet funded any companies, according to a person familiar with the bank's activity. Chase has funded ""a number"" of companies through PPP, but that number is so small relative to the number of requests it's not worth citing, according to a person familiar with Chase's activity. Citi has processed a ""limited number"" of applications but hasn't yet funded any businesses through PPP, said a person familiar with Citi's activity.

As for the $70 billion in loans Trump and other administration officials keep citing, that number only represents the amount of loans approved and doesn't reflect actual cash advanced to businesses.",JustBadNews,0

WASHINGTON (AP) — Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly resigned Tuesday, bringing to a climax an extraordinary drama that he advanced by delivering a profanity-laced upbraiding of the officer he fired as captain of the coronavirus-stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt.

In announcing the resignation, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Modly quit on his own accord, “putting the Navy and the sailors above self,” so the Navy and the Roosevelt can move forward. The Roosevelt is sidelined in port at Guam as members of the crew are tested for the coronavirus and moved ashore.

“His care for the sailors was genuine,” Esper said.

Esper said he briefed President Donald Trump on his conversation with Modly, and with the president’s approval he is appointing James McPherson as acting Navy secretary. McPherson, a Navy veteran, is currently serving as undersecretary of the Army. He was confirmed in that position by the Senate last month.

Esper called McPherson a “smart, capable and professional leader who will restore confidence and stability in the Navy during these challenging times.”

Esper said he also met with Navy leaders and emphasized three priorities, including putting the health, safety and welfare of the Roosevelt crew first, and working to get the ship back out to sea as soon as safely possible.

Modly had created a combustible controversy by firing the Roosevelt’s skipper, Capt. Brett E. Crozier, last week, saying Crozier had shown “extremely poor judgment” in widely distributing by email a letter calling for urgent help with the COVID-19 outbreak aboard his ship.

Modly then flew to the ship, at port in Guam, and delivered a speech to the crew Sunday in which he lambasted Crozier, saying he was either “too naive or too stupid” to be in charge of an aircraft carrier.

According to a senior defense official, Esper spoke to Modly Monday evening, directing him to apologize for his remarks about Crozier and setting a phone meeting for Tuesday morning. The official said Esper did not request or demand Modly’s resignation, but instead discussed the situation and the way forward. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Modly came to his own conclusion and offered his resignation. Modly’s options were few. Officials said it would have been difficult for him to rebuild his relationship with sailors in the fleet, and equally hard to restore his reputation among senior military leaders and retired naval officers who believed his sharp remarks on the Roosevelt crossed a line.

Asked about the resignation, Trump said Tuesday that he didn’t know him or speak to him but credited Modly for resigning “to end that problem.” It was, he said, an “unselfish thing to do.”

By the time Modly issued his public apology Monday night, the calls among Democrats in Congress for his resignation were mounting. On Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Modly must go.

“Sadly, Acting Secretary Modly’s actions and words demonstrate his failure to prioritize the force protection of our troops,” Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a written statement. “He showed a serious lack of the sound judgment and strong leadership needed during this time. Acting Secretary Modly must be removed from his position or resign.”

Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Modly had fired Crozier against the advice of Navy military leaders.

“The new leadership of the Navy must do better in leading and protecting sailors, Marines and their families in this unprecedented crisis,” Reed said.

As of Tuesday, the Navy said 79% of the Roosevelt crew had been tested for the coronavirus, and 230 of them were positive. About 2,000 of the 4,865 crew members had been taken off the ship.

The episode began when the Roosevelt reported its first COVID-19 case among the crew on March 22, two weeks after making a port visit in Vietnam. The outbreak has sidelined the warship indefinitely and created conflict at the highest levels of the Pentagon.

Esper had publicly expressed his support for Modly’s decision to fire Crozier, but after Modly’s speech aboard the ship, Esper grew unsettled. Just hours after Modly issued a statement Monday defending his words, Esper compelled Modly to reverse course and issue a public apology.

“I want to apologize for any confusion this choice of words may have caused,” he wrote, referring to his speech aboard the Roosevelt. “I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused.”

Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that he might get involved, agreeing that Modly’s criticism of Crozier was “a rough statement.” He said Crozier made a mistake when he sent a memo to several people laying out his concerns about the crew and the virus. In the memo, which was leaked to the media, Crozier said: “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die.”

Trump said Crozier had a good career prior to this incident, adding, “I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day.”

Modly, in his apology, reframed his earlier remarks that Crozier was “too naive or too stupid” to command. Instead, he said he believes Crozier is “smart and passionate.”

“I believe, precisely because he is not naive and stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship,” Modly wrote.

Aboard the ship, Modly had urged the crew to stop complaining.

“It is the mission of the ship that matters,” he said. “You all know this, but in my view your Captain lost sight of this and he compromised critical information about your status intentionally to draw greater attention to your situation.”

Modly, a 1983 Naval Academy graduate, became the acting Navy secretary last November after Richard Spencer was ousted from the position. Trump last month nominated retired Rear Adm. Kenneth Braithwaite, the current ambassador to Norway, to be the next Navy secretary.",JustBadNews,0
Retailers allegedly cancelling 2.4bn orders in 'catastrophic' move for Bangladesh,http://theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/02/fashion-brands-cancellations-of-24bn-orders-catastrophic-for-bangladesh?fbclid=IwAR0RJhRfsIfnMljYIExImY6CWtBIHtZY6YG3Hf6lH_HAUT3IghBS7zehOZ0,"More than a million Bangaldeshi garment workers have been sent home without pay or have lost their jobs after western clothing brands cancelled or suspended £2.4bn of existing orders in the wake of the Covid-19 epidemic, according to data from the Bangladeshi and Garment Manufacturers Exporters Association (BGMEA).

Primark, Matalan and the Edinburgh Woollen Mill are among retailers that have collectively cancelled £1.4bn and suspended an additional £1bn of orders as they scramble to minimise losses, according to BGMEA. This includes nearly £1.3bn of orders that were already in production or had been completed.

Other brands included in the data, including Next, Marks & Spencer and Tesco have since said they will honour existing orders that have been placed with Bangladeshi suppliers.

The BGMEA said the impact of the cancellations has already been “catastrophic” for Bangladesh. More than one-quarter of the country’s 4 million garment workers have already lost their jobs or have been furloughed without pay because of order cancellations or the refusal of brands to pay for cancelled shipments.

A survey of nearly 300 Bangladeshi garment suppliers by the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) and Penn State University, found that western retailers have been using force majeure clauses in their contracts to cancel or suspend orders in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

Factory owners in Bangladesh told the Guardian that brands and retailers are postponing the delivery of orders that have already been produced by garment factories so invoices can’t be raised. They are also cancelling all upcoming orders and refusing to pay the cost of raw materials already purchased by suppliers.

“We have had to temporarily close our factory for the health and safety of our workers but we are facing ruin because brands and retailers are cancelling orders that we have already produced and if they don’t pay, I can’t pay the workers,”said Mostafiz Uddin, the chief executive of the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and managing director of Denim Expert, a clothing company that supplies international brands including Peacocks in the UK.

“We have to pay upfront for all of our materials and banks are blocking my accounts. I can’t even pay the utility bills. We can’t do anything because after this is over we will need to work with these brands again so we are powerless to fight them,” he said.

I have 2,000 workers who are supporting 10,000 family members. What shall I tell them about their work and pay? Mostafiz Uddin

“I can’t sleep at night. I have 2,000 workers but they are all supporting another 10,000 family members. What will I tell them about their jobs and their pay?”

More than 97% of the suppliers surveyed by the WRC and Penn State University said brands had offered no financial assistance in covering the cost of furloughing workers or helping to pay severance costs.

“What we’re seeing is a wholesale abandoning of workers and suppliers,” said Scott Nova, executive director of the WRC.

“The way that the garment supply chain is set up, the suppliers take all the risk. They buy the cloth, hire the workers and make the clothes but can’t raise an invoice until the order is shipped. If brands cancel existing orders and refuse shipment then invoices can’t be sent and nobody in Bangladesh gets paid.”

In a statement, Primark said that, while it recognised and was “deeply saddened” by the effect this would have further down its supply chain, it had had “no option” but to cancel orders that had been placed with their Bangladeshi suppliers.

“If we had not taken this action, we would be taking delivery of stock that we simply could not sell,” Primark said in a statement. “This has been unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times”

Edinburgh Woollen Mill also confirmed it has cancelled all existing orders saying, “Our relationships with suppliers are absolutely fundamental to our business, and this is not what we would ever normally wish to do but the current circumstances are such that this is a necessity.”

Matalan would not confirm whether they had cancelled orders. By email, they said the company was “looking at multiple ways of repurposing or postponing, rather than cancelling wherever possible.”

After the BGMEA data was published, Tesco and Marks & Spencer said they were now working with Bangladeshi suppliers to honour existing orders. Tesco is also refuting the figure published in the BGMEA data that it cancelled £50m of orders.

In a statement, Next said that as all its shops are currently closed it is cancelling some orders, but will honour existing agreements that are in place up to 10 April.

Other brands including H&M, Next and Zara said they would also honour existing financial arrangements with their Bangladeshi suppliers and pay invoices in full for orders already placed.

Aruna Kashyap, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch said that the situation in Bangladesh exposed the lack of any sort of protection for workers who make huge profits for international fashion brands.

Workers who have been furloughed or lost their jobs would struggle to find any way to support their families throughout a Covid-19 lockdown and it could take years for the garment industry to recover, Kashyap said.

“The brands are trying to minimise their losses but the impact on the ground in Bangladesh has already been catastrophic and will spell disaster for millions of families,” she said.

“Retailers are calling on the governments of garment-producing countries to provide support for workers, but if you’re going to base your hugely profitable supply chain in countries where you know no such social safety net is available, you have to take responsibility when things go wrong.”",JustBadNews,0
"Hundreds of researchers attempted to predict children's and families' outcomes, using 15 years of data. None were able to do so with meaningful accuracy.",http://technologyreview.com/s/615434/ai-machine-learning-social-outcome-prediction-study/,"Policymakers often draw on the work of social scientists to predict how specific policies might affect social outcomes such as the employment or crime rates. The idea is that if they can understand how different factors might change the trajectory of someone’s life, they can propose interventions to promote the best outcomes.

In recent years, though, they have increasingly relied upon machine learning, which promises to produce far more precise predictions by crunching far greater amounts of data. Such models are now used to predict the likelihood that a defendant might be arrested for a second crime, or that a kid is at risk for abuse and neglect at home. The assumption is that an algorithm fed with enough data about a given situation will make more accurate predictions than a human or a more basic statistical analysis.

Now a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences casts doubt on how effective this approach really is. Three sociologists at Princeton University asked hundreds of researchers to predict six life outcomes for children, parents, and households using nearly 13,000 data points on over 4,000 families. None of the researchers got even close to a reasonable level of accuracy, regardless of whether they used simple statistics or cutting-edge machine learning.

“The study really highlights this idea that at the end of the day, machine-learning tools are not magic,” says Alice Xiang, the head of fairness and accountability research at the nonprofit Partnership on AI.

The researchers used data from a 15-year-long sociology study called the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, led by Sara McLanahan, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton and one of the lead authors of the new paper. The original study sought to understand how the lives of children born to unmarried parents might turn out over time. Families were randomly selected from children born in hospitals in large US cities during the year 2000. They were followed up for data collection when the children were 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15 years old.

McLanahan and her colleagues Matthew Salganik and Ian Lundberg then designed a challenge to crowdsource predictions on six outcomes in the final phase that they deemed sociologically important. These included the children’s grade point average at school; their level of “grit,” or self-reported perseverance in school; and the overall level of poverty in their household. Challenge participants from various universities were given only part of the data to train their algorithms, while the organizers held some back for final evaluations. Over the course of five months, hundreds of researchers, including computer scientists, statisticians, and computational sociologists, then submitted their best techniques for prediction.

The fact that no submission was able to achieve high accuracy on any of the outcomes confirmed that the results weren’t a fluke. “You can't explain it away based on the failure of any particular researcher or of any particular machine-learning or AI techniques,” says Salganik, a professor of sociology. The most complicated machine-learning techniques also weren’t much more accurate than far simpler methods.

For experts who study the use of AI in society, the results are not all that surprising. Even the most accurate risk assessment algorithms in the criminal justice system, for example, max out at 60% or 70%, says Xiang. “Maybe in the abstract that sounds somewhat good,” she adds, but reoffending rates can be lower than 40% anyway. That means predicting no reoffenses will already get you an accuracy rate of more than 60%.

Likewise, research has repeatedly shown that within contexts where an algorithm is assessing risk or choosing where to direct resources, simple, explainable algorithms often have close to the same prediction power as black-box techniques like deep learning. The added benefit of the black-box techniques, then, is not worth the big costs in interpretability.

The results do not necessarily mean that predictive algorithms, whether based on machine learning or not, will never be useful tools in the policy world. Some researchers point out, for example, that data collected for the purposes of sociology research is different from the data typically analyzed in policymaking.

Rashida Richardson, policy director at the AI Now institute, which studies the social impact of AI, also notes concerns in the way the prediction problem was framed. Whether a child has “grit,” for example, is an inherently subjective judgment that research has shown to be “a racist construct for measuring success and performance,” she says. The detail immediately tipped her off to thinking, “Oh there’s no way this is going to work.”

Salganik also acknowledges the limitations of the study.

But he emphasizes that it shows why policymakers should be more careful about evaluating the accuracy of algorithmic tools in a transparent way. “Having a large amount of data and having complicated machine learning does not guarantee accurate prediction,” he adds. “Policymakers who don't have as much experience working with machine learning may have unrealistic expectations about that.”

Desperate hunt for food by Peru's poor amid virus quarantine,http://thestar.com/news/world/americas/2020/04/06/desperate-hunt-for-food-by-perus-poor-amid-virus-quarantine.html,"LIMA, Peru - Pushing a shopping cart with two children, César Alegre emerges from the large, deteriorated house near Peru’s presidential palace that is shared by 45 families to search for food. Sometimes he begs in markets. Sometimes he sells candies.

It is a task that was hard at the best of times, but with a month-long quarantine that has forced 32 million Peruvians to stay home and closed restaurants and food kitchens, it has become much harder.

“We eat once or twice a day,” said the 52-year-old, who says he has spent time in six different prisons for theft. Many among the 100 or so residents of the three-story house are ex-convicts who can’t find work. The old building is opposite Lima’s San Lazaro church, which was founded in 1650 as a hospital for refugees from a leprosy outbreak.

Alegre and his children, accompanied by a handful of neighbours, normally start out by walking about 2 miles (3 kilometres) to a market where they ask for food. The merchants give them potatoes, meat bones and overripe fruit that nobody wants to buy.

But these days the merchants are refusing to give them as much food, if any at all, because their sales have fallen amid the pandemic and strict measures that have kept people at home and shuttered the restaurants that would buy their goods.

“They’re vagrants,” said a meat vendor of the inhabitants of Alegre’s building, which has earned the nickname “Luriganchito,” or “Little Lurigancho,” after Peru’s most-populous prison, for the number or ex-convicts who reside there. The vendor said two weeks ago a young man from the building stole a bag of fish.

Besides begging in markets, Alegre also sells candy on buses. Nowadays, passengers wear face masks and don’t like strangers coming near them.

“The virus has highlighted the selfishness that man carries inside,” he said.

The pandemic has spotlighted the wide gap between rich and poor in Peru and elsewhere in Latin America, and economists say a looming recession worse than any since World War II could push the continent’s long-suffering poor into even more dire circumstances.

“The economic impact of what is happening is unprecedented,” said Peru’s economy minister, María Alva.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

As of Monday, Peru had 2,561 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 92 deaths, The government has steadily tightened bans and lock-downs to slow the spread of the virus. This past week it ordered that only men can leave the house on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while only women can go out on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The trips can only be to the market, pharmacy or bank.

To try to address the humanitarian disaster, Peru has begun distributing about $400 million to feed 12 million poor people for one month.

But the money doesn’t seem to be reaching most of the families in Alegre’s sprawling shared house. The building in Lima’s Rimac district is a relic from the area’s historic era and still has balconies from its better days. But inside its now-cracked walls is a warren of narrow, dark passageways that smell of damp clothing and marijuana. Children run through them barefoot as cockroaches scatter to avoid being crushed.

Its residents have stories of hard luck and tough living.

Santos Escobar, a 68-year-old former mug seller, ended up living in “Luriganchito” after his house burned down twice. In the first fire, two of his six daughters died. In the second, both his legs were burned.

'Shameless': anger as China quarantines freed human rights lawyer 400km from home,http://theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/china-quarantines-human-rights-lawyer-wang-quanzhang-400km-from-home,"Wang Quanzhang released from jail but sent far from his wife and son in Beijing

Prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, who was jailed for four and a half years for subversion, has been released from prison but barred from reuniting with his wife and son in Beijing amid the coronavirus pandemic.

His wife, Li Wenzu, fears that the authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to hold him under de facto house arrest indefinitely. She said Wang has been released from prison but authorities had sent him to his home town, Jinan, in the north-eastern province of Shandong (400km south of Beijing) for quarantine.

Chinese authorities have been using compulsory quarantine as a pretext to detain or restrict the movements of government critics.

“The government is continuing to restrict his personal freedoms and forcing us to be separated,” Li told the Guardian. “This behaviour is shameless, I’m absolutely opposed to this and am very angry.

“I fear the government is using the pandemic as an excuse to detain him. Would it be just 14 days as they say? I can’t trust them. So long as my husband has no freedom, I’ll continue to fight until he comes back.”

Wang called his wife from the prison yesterday telling her to refrain from going to meet him in prison. In a recording she posted on Twitter, Wang said he had to be quarantined “for some time” due to the pandemic. When Li, who has been frequently harassed by the authorities, angrily asked whether he was prompted to say that under duress, he said: “We’ll be back together, but there’ll be a process.”

“The Linyi prison… forced Quanzhang to ‘persuade’ me into accepting the arrangement of sending him to Jinan. I absolutely oppose it,” Li said on Twitter: “Wang Quanzhang needs real freedom, our family needs to be reunited.”

In a practice dubbed “non-release release” by respected China law expert Jerome Cohen at the New York University, Chinese rights activists are often released from prison into de facto house arrest or enforced restriction to their native village, where they remain for years.

“What will Wang Quanzhang’s ‘release’ on April 5 amount to?” asked Cohen in his blog.

Wang, a lawyer who had taken on politically sensitive cases and defended activists and members of the banned religious group Falun Gong, was sentenced to jail in January 2019 on the blanket charge of “subversion of state power”.

He was one of more than 300 lawyers and activists detained in a wave of crackdowns that started in July 2015. He was the last lawyer of the group to be convicted, with his trial taking place three-and-a-half years after he was taken away by the authorities.",JustBadNews,0
Crazed knifeman 'shouts Allahu Akbar' before stabbing two people to death and injuring 'at least seven others' outside a bakery in France,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8187235/Crazed-knifeman-shouts-Allahu-Akbar-stabbing-two-people-death-France.html,"A Sudanese refugee was in custody in France today after stabbing two people to death and wounding seven others in a suspected lone wolf terrorist attack during the coronavirus lockdown.

The bloodbath took place in the town of Romans-sur-Isère, which is south of the eastern city of Lyon, late on Saturday morning.

It corresponded to numerous suicidal knife attacks carried out by Islamic State-linked terrorists in France in recent years.

This time, the 33-year-old - who has been identified as Abdallah A.O - was heard to shout 'Alluhu Akbar' - Arabic for 'God is the Greatest' - before lashing out with a blade.

When police arrived the man screamed 'Kill me! Kill me!', but the officers were able to arrest him without harming him.

France's Interior Minister Christophe Castener later described how the man - who arrived from Sudan a few months ago but who was not previously known to police - attacked his victims in a bakery, a tobacconist and then out on the street, before police intervened at around 11am.

France's anti-terrorism prosecutors said Abdallah had been seeking asylum in the country despite 'complaining about living in a country of non-believers'.

A spokesman for the office said: 'During a search carried out at his home, police found handwritten documents with religious connotation in which the author of the lines complains in particular of living in a country of non-believers.'

The spokesman said an enquiry had been launched into 'two assassinations and attempted assassinations in relation to a terrorist enterprise.'

He confirmed that Abdallah was said to have murdered two unnamed victims with a knife, and severely wounded seven others.

The Sudanese are one of the biggest groups seeking asylum in France, with many feeling violence and extreme poverty in the Darfur region, as well as political persecution.

One of the wounded is in critical condition in hospital. Pictured: Police at the scene

The UK was there preferred destination for many years, but the closure of the so-called 'Jungle' refugee camp in Calais made it more difficult to cross the English Channel.

Counter-terrorism prosecutors have launched an investigation into 'murder linked to a terrorist enterprise'.

'He was found on his knees on the pavement praying in Arabic,' the prosecutor's office said.

'Anyone who had the misfortune to find themselves in his way were attacked,' town mayor Marie-Helene Thoraval told AFP.

The attack in broad daylight, which President Emmanuel Macron called 'an odious act', took place with the country on lockdown in a bid to stem the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

Among the injured, two are in intensive care in hospitals in the Lyon area.

One was stabbed in the bakery, before the attacker discarded his original knife, and then went into the butchers to pick up another one.

He then continued with his lethal rampage, jumping over a shop counter and sticking the butcher's knife into a victim's neck.

The man then ran out into the street and appeared to lash out at random at anyone in his way.

When police arrived he put his hands in the air and then asked to be shot.

'He shouted at the police to kill him,' said David Oliver, a spokesman for the Alliance national police union. 'All the ingredients for a terrorist act are there for us.'

Without identifying the attacker or his victims, Mr Castaner confirmed that investigators were working 'in conjunction with national anti-terrorist prosecutors, to shed light on this drama.'

President Emmanuel Macron added his voice to the outrage, saying: 'My thoughts are with the victims of the Romans-sur-Isère attack, the injured, and their families.

'All the light will be shed on this odious act which cause mourning in our country, which is already hit hard in recent weeks.'

The attack took place during a hugely strict Coronavirus lockdown, which only permits essential shops including bakeries, food shops and tobacconists to stay open.

Anybody caught on the streets without valid documentation faces a first fine of at least £120.

The attack comes on France's third week of lockdown due to the coronavirus, which has killed more than 6,500 people in the country alone. Pictured: Police at the scene after the attack

Saturday's murders follow a series of bomb, gun and knife attacks carried out by Islamic State and al-Qaeda operatives in France, dating back to early 2015

The deadliest single terrorist attack ever in the country came in November 2015 when 130 people were killed in Paris.

Suicide bombers pledging allegiance to ISIS targeted the Stade de France, cafes, restaurants and the Bataclan music venue, where 90 died.

Earlier in the year, two Paris-born gunmen linked to Al-Qaeda broke into the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine, leaving 17 people dead inside and three outside.

In July 2016, 86 people were called and more than 400 injured when a 19-tonne truck was deliberately driven into crowds on the seafront promenade at Nice, in the South of France.

The assailant is said to have shouted 'Allahu Akbar' before knifing 'at least nine people' who were queuing to go into the bakery in Romans-sur-Isère, southern France, local media reports. Pictured: The scene after the attack

The terrorist turned out to be a Tunisian immigrant who was shot dead by police.

During the same month, two Isis terrorists murdered an 86-year-old Catholic priest during a church service in Normandy.

There have been frequent knife attacks on the forces of law and order, leading to the deaths of serving police.

In October of last year, a radicalised computer operative working at the Paris Prefecture stabbed four of his colleagues to death.

The attacker - who was also shot dead - turned out to be a Muslim convert who kept extremist Al-Qaeda and Islamic State literature and images on his computer.",JustBadNews,0

Stock image The United States has angered Germany and France after allegedly seizing millions of masks set to be shipped to the European nations amid the coronavirus crisis.

On Friday, German officials hit out at America for 'intercepting' 200,000 masks they had ordered from a 3M factory in China.

As 3M is an American-owned company, the US was able to 'confiscate' the shipment of special FFP2 and FFP3 masks which were on their way to healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 outbreak in Berlin.

'We consider that an act of modern piracy,' Berlin's interior minister Andreas Geisel blasted.

'You don't treat your transatlantic partners like that,' he is further quoted as saying in The Financial Times.

Geisel called on Germany's government to 'press the US to stick to international rules', while Berlin's mayor accused President Trump of 'lacking solidarity' following the seizure of the shipment.

President Trump is desperately trying to secure masks and other personal protective equipment for Americans as the nation's emergency stockpile depletes.

On Thursday, the Commander-in-chief ordered 3M to manufacture more masks for Americans as the coronavirus infection rate in the US soared above 258,000. More than 6,600 have died.

Meanwhile, Germany has clocked 90,964 cases and 1,234 deaths as of Friday afternoon.

The United States has also earned the ire of France, where 64,338 people have tested positive to COVID-19, and 6,507 have died.

© Provided by Daily Mail Boxes being unloaded from an Antonov 124 aircraft transporting 10 million face masks ordered by France from China at the Paris-Vatry Airport in Bussy-Lettree, eastern France, 30 March On Thursday, US buyers paid three times the going rate to secure a shipment of face masks from China that were due to be dispatched to France, two French officials claim. The US has denied the allegation.

Paying cash to divert the air cargo to the US, the buyers are said to have commandeered the shipment of masks as they sat on a plane at Shanghai airport ready for take-off.

The order of several million masks had been due to arrive in part to the Grand Est region in north-west France, an area where intensive care facilities are already struggling to cope with the volume of coronavirus patients.

Jean Rottner, a doctor and president of the GrandEst regional council, told RTL radio that the US buyers had turned up on the tarmac offering cash.

He said: 'On the tarmac, they arrive, get the cash-out… so we really have to fight.'

The leader of the Ile-de-France region, which includes Paris, also accused unidentified Americans of swooping in with cash at the last minute to secure shipments already promised to French buyers.

Valerie Pecresse, the chief of France's most populous region, said: 'We lost an order to the Americans who outbid us on a shipment that we had lined up.'

Pecresse claimed that while France pays on delivery for such supplies - crucial in the global fight against the pandemic - 'Americans pay cash' without bothering to see the goods.

They 'are just looking to do business on the back of the whole world's distress,' she told LCI television.

France has ordered 1 billion face masks due to be delivered within the next 14 weeks and has deployed an air-bridge flight with China to deliver them amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Shipping company Geodis is responsible for the organisation of 16 flights by two chartered cargo planes, reports World Cargo News.

A senior US official on Thursday rejected allegations from French politicians that Americans had accroached the French shipment during the coronavirus crisis, calling the stories 'completely false.'

In Washington, a senior administration official told AFP 'the United States government has not purchased any masks intended for delivery from China to France.'

'Reports to the contrary are completely false,' said the official, asking not to be named.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday asked officials to look into similar claims that masks were being diverted from his country, calling such reports 'concerning.'

'We need to make sure that equipment that is destined for Canada gets to and stays in Canada, and I've asked ministers to follow up on these particular reports,' he told a press conference.

Ottawa has recognized that its stockpiles of protective medical equipment are not enough to meet demand, as it looks to care for a surge of infected patients and slow the spread of the virus.

Canada has earmarked US$1.4 billion to buy medical equipment while asking local companies to pivot assembly lines to make masks, medical scrubs and ventilators.",JustBadNews,0
Boeing software engaged repeatedly before crash,http://reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-airplane-software/exclusive-boeing-software-engaged-repeatedly-before-crash-sources-idUSKCN1RF0YU,"ADDIS ABABA/SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Investigators will release on Thursday a keenly awaited report on the deadly crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet, Ethiopia’s Transport Ministry said, giving the first official clues to the second crash of a new Boeing 737 MAX in five months.

Some 35 nationalities were among the 157 passengers and crew who died when the nearly full plane crashed six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, in clear conditions.

The March 10 disaster prompted a worldwide grounding of Boeing’s best-selling plane and scrutiny of its certification process.

“The 10:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) press conference is to present the preliminary report,” Ethiopian Transport Ministry spokesman Musie Yehyies said.

The report may shed light on how a piece of cockpit software came back to life after pilots initially switched it off as they tried to save the doomed jet, people familiar with the matter said, placing both technology and crew in the spotlight.

Boeing said on Wednesday it successfully tested an update of the MCAS anti-stall software that is at the center of probes in both the Ethiopian crash and October’s Lion Air accident in Indonesia that together killed 346 people.

Boeing said its CEO Dennis Muilenburg joined the Wednesday test flight and that the flight crew performed different scenarios to test failure conditions. “The software update worked as designed, and the pilots landed safely at Boeing Field” near Seattle, the company said in a statement.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it is launching a new review of the 737 MAX.

The Ethiopian-led investigation has begun piecing together details of flight 302, starting with faulty sensor data on take-off from Addis Ababa, questions over the Boeing 737 MAX’s high speed and a nosedive coinciding with the software re-activation.

The aircraft’s high speed and initial climb suggests the engines were running at a higher than usual thrust, experts say.

MCAS was designed to help prevent an aerodynamic stall by issuing commands to push the plane’s nose lower. However, in both cases it is suspected of firing up in response to faulty airflow data from a single sensor designed to measure the “angle of attack,” a parameter needed to avoid stalling or losing lift.

SENSOR PROBLEMS

Echoing the fate of the Lion Air jet, initial evidence suggests the Ethiopian Airlines jet experienced sensor problems shortly after take-off, causing the MCAS software to begin lowering the nose to grab air under the wings.

Unlike the Lion Air crew, who were flying at a time when pilots had been told little about the MCAS software, the Ethiopian crew used switches to turn the automatic system off but it later re-engaged, people familiar with the matter said.

Although aircraft experts say MCAS cannot turn back on by itself, the report is expected to shed light on whether and why the crew chose to restore electrical power to the system at the risk of setting off more automated nose-down movements.

Aerospace analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in a blog post for Leeham News that pilots may have deliberately re-activated the system in order to make it easier to control the aircraft only to be overwhelmed by rapid counter-moves from MCAS.

Investigators will also look at whether the crew carried out all necessary procedures, including a recommendation to stabilize the plane using the control system before turning the crucial software off.

The pilots maneuvered the plane upwards at least two times before hitting the stabilizer cut-out switches to disable the system, one person familiar with the matter said.

However, initial flight data indicates the aircraft was flying nose-heavy and not in a “neutral” attitude when pilots hit the cut-out switches, the person added, making the situation harder to manage.

Cockpit procedures call for pilots to leave the MCAS system off for the rest of the flight once it has been disengaged.

GLOBAL GROUNDING

Safety experts stress the investigation is far from complete and most aviation disasters are caused by a unique combination of human and technical factors.

In a statement, Boeing said: “We urge caution against speculating and drawing conclusions on the findings prior to the release of the flight data and the preliminary report.”

The 737 MAX is Boeing’s top-selling jet with almost 5,000 on order. Ethiopian Airlines is also in the midst of an expansion drive, while other 737 MAX customers and victims’ families want answers, and potentially compensation.

Boeing shares closed down 1.5 percent. They have lost more than 8.5 percent since the Ethiopian crash.

Getting the planes flying again depends partly on the role that Boeing design features are found to have played in the crash, though investigators are also paying attention to airline operations, crew actions and regulatory measures.

The chief executive of Norwegian Air, Bjoern Kjos, who is a former fighter pilot, said on Wednesday he tested the old MCAS flight control system versus the new one in a MAX simulator “under a malfunction,” and said it appears to be foolproof.

The FAA’s review of the MAX will be headed by former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart and include experts from the FAA, NASA and international aviation authorities, including Canada.

A spokeswoman for the Canadian government said it will be a part of the review to ensure safety of the MAX.",JustBadNews,0
"Facebook admits error in marking videos of Hong Kong police storming MTR station as 'false,' reverses decision",http://hongkongfp.com/2020/04/02/exclusive-facebook-admits-error-marking-videos-hong-kong-police-storming-mtr-station-false-reverses-decision/?fbclid=IwAR2FIiQbz0hHy_i-Z3cfDljPX0n-4bufJa9R99YhYrWhhElZqWWIzWP5rW8,"Facebook has acknowledged it was a mistake to mark Instagram videos of Hong Kong police storming Prince Edward MTR station last year as false information.

Last Saturday, multiple users of the social media app shared footage of the incident to mark seven months since the attack. Third-party fact-checkers subsequently applied a warning display, marking the clips as “false information.” Users were only allowed to view the content of the posts after tapping through the notice.

Baton-wielding riot police stormed Prince Edward MTR station during protests on August 31 last year, leaving dozens injured and triggering public outrage. The force has repeatedly denied accusations of brutality.

Users took to social media to express anger over the misinformation label and identified Boom Live, as well as Fact Crescendo, as two of the fact-checking partners involved in the decision.

An article published on Boom Live’s website on March 15 said the video had been shared with a false claim that it showed Chinese police “trying to nab suspected Covid-19 patients.” It cited several posts in Hindi as promoting the allegation.

Alert: We are aware that our fact check on a video from Hong Kong is incorrectly being applied to flag several posts on Instagram. We are trying to understand how this happened. We regret the inconvenience and are working to resolve this at the earliest. — BOOM Live (@boomlive_in) March 28, 2020

Boom Live said in a tweet last Saturday that it was aware its fact check label had been incorrectly applied to videos of the attack: “We regret the inconvenience and are working to resolve this at the earliest.”

‘Mistake’

A spokesperson for Facebook told HKFP that the platform had reversed the tag: “If a fact-checker rates a photo or video as false or partly false, we will take action by labelling the content and filtering it from surfaces like Explore and hashtags.”

“In this case, we verified with the fact-checker and confirmed the video was labelled as false by mistake, and have since removed the interstitial.”

Two separate Instagram users told HKFP that neither were informed of the decision to reverse the label.

Last December, Facebook expanded its global fact-checking partner system to Instagram, which it owns. Information is gathered using a combination of technology and human intervention to detect and demote “false news stories” which, in turn, feed into a machine learning model, according to the social media giant.

Identical content rated false or partly false on Facebook is automatically labelled as such on Instagram feeds, profiles, stories and direct messages, and vice versa. Users have also been given an option to report content they considered to be false.",JustBadNews,0
EU cancels April Fool's 'fake news',http://euobserver.com/news/147951,"The EU has urged media not to publish April Fool's 'fake news' this year to help combat Russian propaganda.

""Protecting our democratic processes and institutions from Russian disinformation has become a major challenge in the modern era,"" the European Commission said on Tuesday (31 March).

""To help tackle this, the commission recommends the suspension, for the time being, of the common tradition of April Fool's 'fake news' in European media,"" it said.

The move came after the EU recently accused Russia of ""polluting"" Europe's information ecosystem with deceptions which had ""real-world consequences"".

Russian news agencies have falsely claimed the US was using ants as biological weapons, for instance, that Western countries practiced gay cannibalism, and that Swedish former foreign minister Margot Wallström advocated mass-castration of white men.

At the same time, many EU media published hoax articles on 1 April each year in a European custom which goes back to medieval festivities, but which now risked making matters worse.

EUobserver's fake news of 1 April 2015, for example, saying EU institutions had confiscated two Russian warships, was reported as real news by Russia's top media at the time.

That kind of thing was not funny any more, Tuesday's EU statement indicated.

But the EU commission added, in a key proviso, that it had no legal mandate on cultural policy, leaving European newspapers ""free"" to dupe their readers.

""While bearing responsibility to guarantee factual news, free and independent media are the basis of a pluralistic and open society,"" the commission said.

""The suspension, with full respect for EU fundamental rights, of targeted April Fool's practices, is to be adopted on a voluntary basis,"" it noted.

And the hoax ban should be treated ""with respect for Europe's shared April Fool's spirit,"" it said.

True and false

Asked by EUobserver if that was a loophole which made the EU ban 'no more than a joke', a commission spokesperson said: ""It's like asking whether the same man can say what is at the same time both true and false"".

For its part, Russia's EU embassy accused the commission of ""cheapjack confabisculations [sic]"".

But top Russian officials have, in the past, also boasted of how Kremiln fake news was ""playing with Western minds"" to create ""paranormal preferences"".

""It's like looking in a mirror with another mirror behind you,"" the EU spokesperson said.

Krolczyk was initially placed on administrative leave by the hospital after conservative commentator Michael Caputo posted screenshots of an exchange between Krolczyk and another top official at the hospital, Lisa LaTrovato.

According to screenshots posted by Caputo, the exchange between the two women began after Krolczyk posted a link to a news article suggesting Trump did not want the federal government to pay General Motors for ventilator production.

""But will waste more than that on a wall and space force,"" LaTrovato replied.

""Trump supporters need to pledge to give up their ventilators for someone else ... and not go to the hospital,"" Krolczyk, who previously worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia this week arrested hundreds of people for violating restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of coronavirus, a senior minister said on Sunday, amid a spike in the number of deaths linked to the outbreak.

The death toll rose from 27 to 34 within a 24-hour period, the biggest daily rise so far, while the number of reported cases was up to 2,470, the highest in Southeast Asia.

Malaysia has closed schools and non-essential businesses and imposed restrictions on travel and movement until April 14 to try to contain the spread.

Defence minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob told reporters 649 people were detained on Saturday, while 73 people have plead guilty to offences such as gathering in groups, obstructing public officials, and breaking through police blockades.

This was in addition to 614 people arrested since the movement curbs were imposed on March 18.

“Some people gave the excuse that they were just going out to buy food,” Ismail said.

“But they were caught outside up to four times a day, to the point at which police recognized their faces... clearly, they were not being genuine.”

Those who flout the restriction of movement order can be fined or face up to six months’ jail.

Someone also replied with a meme.

This isn’t the first time Elon Musk has come in spotlight for improper behavior. In 2018, he called a British diver “pedo guy” who helped rescue the boys trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand.

In this time of crisis, we should stand by our doctors, commend them for their bravery, not rebuke them.

This surely won’t be the last foolish statement by a man who claims of “saving the world” with his electric cars, given his track-record.

The missing six weeks: How Trump failed the biggest test of his life,http://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster,"When the definitive history of the coronavirus pandemic is written, the date 20 January 2020 is certain to feature prominently. It was on that day that a 35-year-old man in Washington state, recently returned from visiting family in Wuhan in China, became the first person in the US to be diagnosed with the virus.

On the very same day, 5,000 miles away in Asia, the first confirmed case of Covid-19 was reported in South Korea. The confluence was striking, but there the similarities ended.

In the two months since that fateful day, the responses to coronavirus displayed by the US and South Korea have been polar opposites.

One country acted swiftly and aggressively to detect and isolate the virus, and by doing so has largely contained the crisis. The other country dithered and procrastinated, became mired in chaos and confusion, was distracted by the individual whims of its leader, and is now confronted by a health emergency of daunting proportions.

Within a week of its first confirmed case, South Korea’s disease control agency had summoned 20 private companies to the medical equivalent of a war-planning summit and told them to develop a test for the virus at lightning speed. A week after that, the first diagnostic test was approved and went into battle, identifying infected individuals who could then be quarantined to halt the advance of the disease.

Some 357,896 tests later, the country has more or less won the coronavirus war. On Friday only 91 new cases were reported in a country of more than 50 million.

The US response tells a different story. Two days after the first diagnosis in Washington state, Donald Trump went on air on CNBC and bragged: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

‘A fiasco of incredible proportions’

A week after that, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion article by two former top health policy officials within the Trump administration under the headline Act Now to Prevent an American Epidemic. Luciana Borio and Scott Gottlieb laid out a menu of what had to be done instantly to avert a massive health disaster.

Top of their to-do list: work with private industry to develop an “easy-to-use, rapid diagnostic test” – in other words, just what South Korea was doing.

It was not until 29 February, more than a month after the Journal article and almost six weeks after the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in the country that the Trump administration put that advice into practice. Laboratories and hospitals would finally be allowed to conduct their own Covid-19 tests to speed up the process.

Today, 86,012 cases have been confirmed in the US, pushing the nation to the top of the world’s coronavirus league table

Those missing four to six weeks are likely to go down in the definitive history as a cautionary tale of the potentially devastating consequences of failed political leadership. Today, 86,012 cases have been confirmed across the US, pushing the nation to the top of the world’s coronavirus league table – above even China.

More than a quarter of those cases are in New York City, now a global center of the coronavirus pandemic, with New Orleans also raising alarm. Nationally, 1,301 people have died.

Most worryingly, the curve of cases continues to rise precipitously, with no sign of the plateau that has spared South Korea.

“The US response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort,” Ron Klain, who spearheaded the fight against Ebola in 2014, told a Georgetown university panel recently. “What’s happened in Washington has been a fiasco of incredible proportions.”

Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the US government’s response to international disasters at USAid from 2013 to 2017, frames the past six weeks in strikingly similar terms. He told the Guardian: “We are witnessing in the United States one of the greatest failures of basic governance and basic leadership in modern times.”

In Konyndyk’s analysis, the White House had all the information it needed by the end of January to act decisively. Instead, Trump repeatedly played down the severity of the threat, blaming China for what he called the “Chinese virus” and insisting falsely that his partial travel bans on China and Europe were all it would take to contain the crisis.

‘The CDC was caught flat-footed’

If Trump’s travel ban did nothing else, it staved off to some degree the advent of the virus in the US, buying a little time. Which makes the lack of decisive action all the more curious.

“We didn’t use that time optimally, especially in the case of testing,” said William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University medical center. “We have been playing reluctant catch-up throughout.”

As Schaffner sees it, the stuttering provision of mass testing “put us behind the eight-ball” right at the start. “It did not permit us, and still doesn’t permit us, to define the extent of the virus in this country.”

Though the decision to allow private and state labs to provide testing has increased the flow of test kits, the US remains starkly behind South Korea, which has conducted more than five times as many tests per capita. That makes predicting where the next hotspot will pop up after New York and New Orleans almost impossible.

In the absence of sufficient test kits, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially kept a tight rein on testing, creating a bottleneck. “I believe the CDC was caught flat-footed,” was how the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, put it on 7 March. “They’re slowing down the state.”

The CDC’s botched rollout of testing was the first indication that the Trump administration was faltering as the health emergency gathered pace. Behind the scenes, deep flaws in the way federal agencies had come to operate under Trump were being exposed.

In 2018 the pandemic unit in the national security council – which was tasked to prepare for health emergencies precisely like the current one – was disbanded. “Eliminating the office has contributed to the federal government’s sluggish domestic response,” Beth Cameron, a former senior director of the office, wrote in the Washington Post.

We didn’t use that time optimally, especially in the case of testing. We have been playing reluctant catch-up William Schaffner

Disbanding the unit exacerbated a trend that was already prevalent after two years of Trump – an exodus of skilled and experienced officials who knew what they were doing. “There’s been an erosion of expertise, of competent leadership, at important levels of government,” a former senior government official told the Guardian.

“Over time there was a lot of paranoia and people left and they had a hard time attracting good replacements,” the official said. “Nobody wanted to work there.”

It was hardly a morale-boosting gesture when Trump proposed a 16% cut in CDC funding on 10 February – 11 days after the World Health Organization had declared a public health emergency over Covid-19.

Schaffner, who describes himself as the “president of the CDC fan club”, said he has been saddened by how sidelined the CDC has become over the past two months. “Here we have the public health issue of our era and one doesn’t hear from the CDC, the premier public health organization in the world,” Schaffner said.

Under Trump, anti-science sweeps through DC

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates the diagnostic tests and will control any new treatments for coronavirus, has also shown vulnerabilities. The agency recently indicated that it was looking into the possibility of prescribing the malaria drug chloroquine for coronavirus sufferers, even though there is no evidence it would work and some indication it could have serious side-effects.

The decision dismayed experts, given that Trump has personally pushed the unproven remedy on a whim. It smacked of the wave of anti-science sentiment sweeping federal agencies under this presidency.

As the former senior official put it: “We have the FDA bowing to political pressure and making decisions completely counter to modern science.”

Highly respected career civil servants, with impeccable scientific credentials, have struggled to get out in front of the president. Dr Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert who has become a rare trusted face in the administration amid the coronavirus scourge, has expressed his frustration.

This week Fauci was asked by a Science magazine writer, Jon Cohen, how he could stand beside Trump at daily press briefings and listen to him misleading the American people with comments such as that the China travel ban had been a great success in blocking entry of the virus. Fauci replied: “I know, but what do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let’s get real, what do you want me to do?”

Trump has designated himself a “wartime president”. But if the title bears any validity, his military tactics have been highly unconventional. He has exacerbated the problems encountered by federal agencies by playing musical chairs at the top of the coronavirus force.

The president began by creating on 29 January a special coronavirus taskforce, then gave Vice-President Mike Pence the job, who promptly appointed Deborah Birx “coronavirus response coordinator”, before the federal emergency agency Fema began taking charge of key areas, with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, creating a shadow team that increasingly appears to be calling the shots.

“There’s no point of responsibility,” the former senior official told the Guardian. “It keeps shifting. Nobody owns the problem.”

Trump: everything’s going to be great

Amid the confusion, day-to-day management of the crisis has frequently come directly from Trump himself via his Twitter feed. The president, with more than half an eye on the New York stock exchange, has consistently talked down the scale of the crisis.

On 30 January, as the World Health Organization was declaring a global emergency, Trump said: “We only have five people. Hopefully, everything’s going to be great.”

On 24 February, Trump claimed “the coronavirus is very much under control in the USA”. The next day, Nancy Messonnier, the CDC’s top official on respiratory diseases, took the radically different approach of telling the truth, warning the American people that “disruption to everyday life might be severe”.

Trump was reportedly so angered by the comment and its impact on share prices that he shouted down the phone at Messonnier’s boss, the secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar.

“Messonnier was 100% right. She gave a totally honest and accurate assessment,” Konyndyk told the Guardian. And for that, Trump angrily rebuked her department. “That sent a very clear message about what is and isn’t permissible to say.”

Konyndyk recalls attending a meeting in mid-February with top Trump administration officials present in which the only topic of conversation was the travel bans. That’s when he began to despair about the federal handling of the crisis.

“I thought, ‘Holy Jesus!’ Where’s the discussion on protecting our hospitals? Where’s the discussion on high-risk populations, on surveillance so we can detect where the virus is. I knew then that the president had set the priority, the bureaucracy was following it, but it was the wrong priority.”

So it has transpired. In the wake of the testing disaster has come the personal protective equipment (PPE) disaster, the hospital bed disaster, and now the ventilator disaster.

Ventilators, literal life preservers, are in dire short supply across the country. When governors begged Trump to unleash the full might of the US government on this critical problem, he gave his answer on 16 March.

In a phrase that will stand beside 20 January 2020 as one of the most revelatory moments of the history of coronavirus, he said: “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment – try getting it yourselves.”

To date, the Trump administration has supplied 400 ventilators to New York. By Cuomo’s estimation, 30,000 are needed.

“You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?” Cuomo scathingly asked on Tuesday. He added: “You pick the 26,000 who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.”

‘A total vacuum of federal leadership’

In the absence of a strong federal response, a patchwork of efforts has sprouted all across the country. State governors are doing their own thing. Cities, even individual hospitals, are coping as best they can.

In an improvised attempt to address such inconsistencies, charitable startups have proliferated on social media. Konyndyk has clubbed together with fellow disaster relief experts to set up Covid Local, an online “quick and dirty” guide to how to fight a pandemic.

“We are seeing the emergence of 50-state anarchy, because of a total vacuum of federal leadership. It’s absurd that thinktanks and Twitter are providing more actionable guidance in the US than the federal government, but that’s where we are.”

Valerie Griffeth is a founding member of another of the new online startups that are trying to fill the Trump void. Set up by emergency department doctors across the country, GetUsPPE.org seeks to counter the top-down chaos that is putting frontline health workers like herself in danger through a dearth of protective gear.

Griffeth is an emergency and critical care physician in Portland, Oregon. She spends most days now in intensive care treating perilously ill patients with coronavirus.

Her hospital is relatively well supplied, she said, but even so protective masks will run out within two weeks. “We are all worried about it, we’re scared for our own health, the health of our families, of our patients.”

Early on in the crisis, Griffeth said, it dawned on her and many of her peers that the federal government to which they would normally look to keep them safe was nowhere to be seen. They resigned themselves to a terrible new reality.

“We said to ourselves we are going to get exposed to the virus. When the federal government isn’t there to provide adequate supplies, it’s just a matter of time.”

But just in the last few days, Griffeth has started to see the emergence of something else. She has witnessed an explosion of Americans doing it for themselves, filling in the holes left by Trump’s failed leadership.

“People are stepping up all around us,” she said. “I’m amazed by what has happened in such short time. It gives me hope.”

California teenage dies of covid-19 after being denied treatment for lack of insurance,http://independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-teenager-death-california-health-insurance-care-emergency-room-covid-19-a9429946.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR00ZIa6DUVFgDL9kNXyowJGCvfJEhcSWkb7erWQ5YgF5K-Pm5WTChw_2S0&utm_source=reddit.com#Echobox=1585313812,"A 17-year-old whose death was initially linked to the novel coronavirus despite not having any previously reported health conditions was denied treatment at a California medical facility over his lack of insurance, according to the mayor.

R Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, California, confirmed the teen’s death in a video posted to YouTube on Wednesday, in which he warned residents to take the global pandemic seriously and practice self-isolation and social distancing measures.

“The Friday before he died, he was healthy,” the mayor said about the teenager. “By Wednesday, he was dead.”

The mayor said the teen “didn’t have insurance, so they did not treat him” when he arrived at an urgent care facility in the area. The medical staff then told the child to go to a local public hospital.

“En route to AV Hospital, he went into cardiac arrest,” the mayor said. “They were able to revive him and keep him alive for about six hours. But by the time he got there, it was too late.”

The teen’s death comes amid a wave of reports about young victims suffering deadly symptoms from Covid-19, defying previous assumptions that the novel virus was only fatal for some older patients and people with severe underlying conditions.

Another teen in Louisiana was reported to have passed away this after contracting the coronavirus, as well as a 21-year-old woman in the UK who also had no underlying health issues.

However, Los Angeles’ County Department of Public Health later said the teen’s death was taken off a list of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the area. The department said the CDC would complete an investigation into the teen’s death. It remained unclear what symptoms he may have been experiencing prior to his death.

As health officials warned the country’s hospital system was already reaching capacity, the US confirmed at least 85,000 cases of the coronavirus by Friday. The death toll has meanwhile risen to nearly 1,300, with those figures likely to continue soaring in the coming days.

New York has seen the vast majority of confirmed cases, with nearly 40,000 in total as the state managed to distribute a significant amount of testing kits despite challenges the federal government had procuring test to send to states across the country.

Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the unfolding crisis previously told The Independent the virus was impacting young people the same way it was older patients in some cases.

One resident physician from Mount Sinai in New York City issued a stark warning during a Thursday interview.

“Relatively young people — age 30 through 50 — often male, with little to no known past medical history are getting sick from this virus, getting intubated, [and] dying,” they said. “The principles of social distancing are not solely for protecting your grandparents.”

Another New York-area nurse said: “What I really want the public to know is that the old and sick are not the only ones who are getting severely ill and dying from this virus. Both of my patients I took care of over the weekend were in their 30’s. Both with no known past medical history.”",JustBadNews,0
An uninsured 17-year-old died after being denied care for coronavirus symptoms,http://mic.com/p/uninsured-17-year-old-died-after-being-denied-care-for-coronavirus-symptoms-22660440,"A teen in Lancaster, California died last week from what appeared to be coronavirus-related complications. Gizmodo reported that the 17-year-old boy is thought to have been the first person under 18 to die from the disease in the U.S. As if the death of a young, seemingly healthy person weren’t harrowing enough, there is cause to believe that the youth was denied care for COVID-19 because he did not have health insurance.

The teen reportedly felt ill and sought treatment at an urgent care clinic, but was denied. The staff at the facility told the teen to try the emergency room at the local public hospital, Antelope Valley (AV) Hospital, according to Gizmodo. While in transit to that hospital, he reportedly went into cardiac arrest. The hospital staff was able to keep the teen — who appeared to have no previous health conditions — alive for about six hours.

“He didn’t have insurance, so they did not treat him,” Lancaster Mayor Rex Parris said in a YouTube video Wednesday. “On the Friday before he died, he was healthy, he was socializing with his friends.” The name of the clinic that refused the teen treatment has not been released. Neither has the boy’s name, which has been removed from the U.S. coronavirus death toll as the CDC evaluates any possible extenuating factors. While both of the child’s parents tested positive for COVID-19, health experts say this case is complex and that they are still trying to nail COVID-19 down as the cause, according to CNN.

On Tuesday night, LA's County Department of Public Health issued this statement, as reported by CNN: ""Though early tests indicated a positive result for COVID-19, the case is complex and there may be an alternate explanation for this fatality."" They also cited patient privacy as a block from obtaining more details.

Mayor Parris said, in his YouTube address, that he is concerned for the folks who were shaking hands at the funeral of the boy, who may have been unaware that he died of COVID-19. In case you’re struggling with the timeline, let me break it down for you: The teen reportedly died on March 18, but the mayor said that he was not notified of his death until March 25. This kind of lengthy gap in public announcement serves as further reinforcement that the U.S. COVID statistics may be skewed.

Statistics aren’t the only thing crooked in this situation. Our current approach to “healthcare” is playing a bigger role in the pandemic that you might think. Countries like Taiwan, where 99% of citizens are insured, are recovering at lightning speed while we hem and haw as people die.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to London has said China had endangered the world by suppressing information about the coronavirus outbreak thus allowing it to spread far beyond the Communist republic’s borders.

“First it tried to suppress the news,” Ambassador Woody Johnson wrote in an article for The Times newspaper published on Thursday, adding that Beijing had then selectively shared critical information while stonewalling international health authorities.

“Had China done the right things at the right time, more of its own population, and the rest of the world, might have been spared the most serious impact of this disease,” the ambassador wrote.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said Beijing should have acted faster to warn the world after the outbreak of the disease there. He also dismissed criticism that his labeling it as the “Chinese virus” was racist.

Last week, he brushed aside a reporter’s question as to whether it was potentially harmful to Asian-Americans to give the disease that name, as well for an unnamed White House official to have privately termed it the “kung flu”.

On Monday, the president said Asian-Americans were not responsible for spreading the disease and needed to be protected.

“When the crisis finally abates we should take stock of the outcome and evaluate the costs of this breakdown in international collaboration,” Ambassador Johnson wrote in The Times.",JustBadNews,0
"A country with no coronavirus cases has declared a national disaster and shut schools, large gatherings",http://qz.com/africa/1824465/coronavirus-malawi-with-no-cases-declares-national-disaster,"As coronavirus infections in most countries worldwide continues to soar by the thousands daily, there has not been any confirmed Covid-19 case in Malawi so far. Despite this the country’s president Peter Mutharika declared coronavirus a national disaster as a measure to prevent cases of the virus in the country.

At the moment, all schools, colleges, both private and public universities have been closed since Monday (Mar. 23).

The country’s government is restricting public gatherings to less than 100 people. This restriction applies to all gatherings including weddings, funerals, church, congregations, rallies and government meetings. The national security has been ordered into action to enforce these restrictions.

There aren’t any registered coronavirus cases in Malawi yet according to the health ministry which is believed to be checking temperatures of everyone coming through its land borders and airports.

“Twelve people who showed signs and symptoms of the disease have been tested and the results showed negative through the government’s public health reference laboratory,” said Joshua Malango, spokesperson for the health ministry.

Despite there being no confirmed coronavirus cases, there are suspicions locally there’s a likelihood of cases in the country given the testing process has been making it near impossible to efficiently test people. Malango insisted the Malawi government is doing everything it can to effectively carry out tests.

But with most African countries affected by the virus, including neighbor country South Africa which now has the highest number infection cases in Africa and growing rapidly, there are fears the virus will easily find its way into the country. This is a very real possibility because of the high number of Malawians who live and work in their wealthier neighbor.

There are an estimated 100,000 Malawian migrant workers in South Africa, driven there by few employment opportunities and low wages at home.

Last week, Malawi Health Equity Network director George Jobe warned that the country should intensively prepare for the worst. “Now the virus is closer to home than we ever imagined. Many Malawians travel to South Africa daily and people of the two countries are constantly trading with each other, this means that Malawi should intensify screening in all airports and boarders across the country,” said Jobe.

South Africa alone has registered 554 cases so far. Another Malawi’s neighbor Tanzania is a concern as well, as the country has so far registered 12 cases as of Sunday. Tanzania shares a border and quite often, Malawians go to the east African country to collect shipped goods at Dar es Salaam port since Malawi is landlocked.

As Malawi is ranked among the world’s least developed countries with its GDP coming in at around $7 billion, a virus outbreak would only worsen its economic output.

Malawi has plenty of experience dealing with public health crisis given the high HIV incidence in the country over the last few decades. It still has one of the highest HIV prevalences in the world despite the impressive progress the country has made in recent years. There are concerns in medical community that HIV carriers could be particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. South Africa, which has the world’s largest HIV positive population, is taking key steps to protect this group.

China Permanently Bans Consumption of Wild Animals,http://vegnews.com/2020/2/china-permanently-bans-consumption-of-wild-animals,"This week, Chinese legislative body The National People’s Congress Standing Committee approved a permanent nationwide ban on the consumption and illegal trade of wild animals—an industry that is estimated to be worth $74 billion. According to CNN, the Chinese state media said the ban aims to “safeguard public health and ecological security,” with the mission to “completely ban the eating of wild animals” and “[to] crack down on illegal trade of wildlife.” The ban comes after China temporarily suspended the sale and consumption of wild animals on January 26 in an effort to stop the spread of the most recent strain of coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan and transmitted to humans by either civets, pigs, or pangolins—who were already protected under China’s Wildlife Protection Law that prohibits the consumption of endangered species. “There has been a growing concern among people over the consumption of wild animals and the hidden dangers it brings to public health security since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak,” China’s Legislative Affairs Commission spokesman Zhang Tiewei told Reuters. The exact species protected under the new permanent ban are not yet clear but it does not include aquatic animals, poultry, and “livestock”—even though pigs have not been ruled out as the species responsible for transmitting the latest coronavirus to humans. Under the ban, wild animals used for scientific and medical research will now have to go through a stricter government approval process. To date, more than 80,400 people worldwide have been sickened by the coronavirus and more than 2,700 people have died as a result.

The coronavirus crisis has sent demand for deliveries of medical and household items skyrocketing.

Sellers have tried to take advantage, charging extortionate prices for items such as hand sanitizer and toilet roll.

At the beginning of this month Amazon said it had banned 2,500 US seller accounts.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Amazon has booted almost 4,000 sellers off its platform for jacking up their prices during the coronavirus pandemic.

Amazon said in a company blog on Monday that it had removed 3,900 sellers for price gouging, and with them well over half a million extortionately priced items.

Earlier in March Amazon announced it had removed 530,000 listed products from site and suspended 2,500 US seller accounts.

""We are constantly monitoring our stores for unfair prices and listings that make false claims in regards to COVID-19. We have dynamic, automated systems in place that locate and remove unfairly priced items. In addition, we have deployed a dedicated team that's working continuously to identify and investigate unfairly priced products that are now in high demand, such as protective masks and hand sanitizer,"" the company said in its blog post.

Amazon didn't specify what the accounts were selling.

""We are also proactively sharing information with state attorneys general and federal regulators about sellers we suspect have engaged in egregious price gouging of products related to the COVID-19 crisis,"" the firm added.

On Monday President Trump signed an executive order specifically banning price gouging and hoarding of medical items like face masks.

Since the coronavirus started to spread across the globe, demand for Amazon deliveries has skyrocketed, and sellers have sought to benefit. Prices for items such as face masks, hand sanitizer, and thermometers have ballooned by hundreds of dollars.

Banner Health said the man and his wife consumed a version of the chemical that's used to clean aquariums.

""We saw Trump on TV — every channel — and all of his buddies and that this was safe,"" the woman, who is in critical care after taking the drug with her husband, told NBC News' Vaughn Hillyard. ""Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure.""

The president has repeatedly touted the pharmaceutical version of chloroquine as a ""very powerful"" treatment against the coronavirus and falsely claimed it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Asked what her message was to the public after what she and her husband went through, the woman told NBC News: ""Oh my God, don't take anything. Don't believe anything that the president says and his people ... call your doctor.""

The wife of an Arizona man who died after ingesting chloroquine phosphate to protect himself from the novel coronavirus spoke out Monday to urge the public not to ""take anything"" or ""believe anything"" without talking to a healthcare professional.

""We saw Trump on TV — every channel — and all of his buddies and that this was safe,"" the woman told NBC News' Vaughn Hillyard of President Donald Trump. ""Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure.""

NBC News reported that the man, 68, and his wife, 61, took chloroquine to guard against the novel coronavirus, which causes a potentially fatal disease known as COVID-19. It's not clear how much chloroquine the man consumed, and Banner Health said he and his wife ingested a version of the chemical that's used to clean aquariums.

Both of them needed to seek medical care within half an hour; the woman is in critical condition, and the man died.

The pharmaceutical version of chloroquine — known as hydroxychloroquine — is used to treat malaria, but there is no conclusive evidence it is effective against the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic earlier this month.

Trump has repeatedly touted the drug as a ""very powerful"" treatment for the disease and falsely claimed it had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

""It's shown very encouraging — very, very encouraging early results,"" Trump said last week. ""And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately. And that's where the FDA has been so great. They — they've gone through the approval process; it's been approved. And they did it, they took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we're going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states.""

The FDA came out with a statement after Trump's comments saying it had not approved chloroquine for the coronavirus and that much more research had to be done.

""Did you at any point hear that the FDA had not approved of it for coronavirus purposes?"" Hillyard asked the woman.

""Yeah,"" she said. ""But, you know, they kept saying that it was approved for other things.""

Asked what her message to the American public was after what she and her husband went through, the woman told NBC News: ""Oh my God, don't take anything. Don't believe anything that the president says and his people ... call your doctor.""

""Please educate the people,"" she added, according to audio of the conversation that Hillyard posted to Twitter. ""It feels like, like my heart is broken and it'll never mend. It's just broke, dead. Like my husband. My husband is 68. We're healthy. No underlying — no diabetes or lung issues. Nothing.""",JustBadNews,0
Man dies after ingesting chloroquine in an attempt to prevent coronavirus,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/man-dies-after-ingesting-chloroquine-attempt-prevent-coronavirus-n1167166,"An Arizona man has died after ingesting chloroquine phosphate — believing it would protect him from becoming infected with the coronavirus. The man's wife also ingested the substance and is under critical care.

The toxic ingredient they consumed was not the medication form of chloroquine, used to treat malaria in humans. Instead, it was an ingredient listed on a parasite treatment for fish.

The man's wife told NBC News she'd watched televised briefings during which President Trump talked about the potential benefits of chloroquine. Even though no drugs are approved to prevent or treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, some early research suggests it may be useful as a therapy.

""We were afraid of getting sick.""

The name ""chloroquine"" resonated with the man's wife, who asked that her name not be used to protect the family's privacy. She'd used it previously to treat her koi fish.

""I saw it sitting on the back shelf and thought, 'Hey, isn't that the stuff they're talking about on TV?'""

The couple — both in their 60s and potentially at higher risk for complications of the virus — decided to mix a small amount of the substance with a liquid and drink it as a way to prevent the coronavirus.

""We were afraid of getting sick,"" she said.

Within 20 minutes, both became extremely ill, at first feeling ""dizzy and hot.""

""I started vomiting,"" the woman told NBC News. ""My husband started developing respiratory problems and wanted to hold my hand.""

She called 911. The emergency responders ""were asking a lot of questions"" about what they'd consumed. ""I was having a hard time talking, falling down.""

Shortly after he arrived at the hospital, her husband died.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

On Monday, Banner Health, based in Arizona, said the couple took the additive called chloroquine phosphate.

The couple unfortunately equated the chloroquine phosphate in their fish treatment with the medication —known as hydroxychloroquine — that has recently been touted as a possible treatment for COVID-19, which has infected more than 42,000 people in the U.S. and killed at least 462.

Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of Banner Poison and Drug Information Center, said in a statement: ""Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so.""

On Friday, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control pleaded with its people not to engage in self-medication with chloroquine, as it ""will cause harm and can lead to death."" The country had reported at least two such poisonings.

#FactsNotFear@WHO has NOT approved the use of chloroquine for #COVID19 management. Scientists are working hard to confirm the safety of several drugs for this disease.

The Food and Drug Administration has not approved chloroquine to treat the coronavirus, and studies of its safety and effectiveness are just beginning.

The Arizona woman now warns others to listen to medical professionals for the best coronavirus advice.

""Be careful and call your doctor,"" she said.

""This is a heartache I'll never get over.""

Plastic Trash Kills Half A Million Hermit Crabs On Remote Islands Each Year,http://therising.co/2020/03/22/plastic-trash-killing-hermit-crabs/,"People often consider remote islands to be vestiges of pristine wilderness. But in stark contrast, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Henderson Island are drowning in plastic trash.

A recent study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials estimates that more than half a million hermit crabs perish in accumulated plastic pollution on the beaches of these heavily polluted remote islands alone each year.

Plastic Trash Coats Beaches

The Cocos (Keeling) Islands, made up of 27 islands, sit 2,760 kilometers (1,715 miles) northwest of Perth in the Indian Ocean.

A quarter-spin of the globe away, uninhabited Henderson Island is located in the Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.

The atoll, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is on the western perimeter of the South Pacific Gyre. It’s a major source of the marine trash that coats its beaches.

“The significant quantities of debris on the beaches, and throughout the coastal vegetation, create a significant barrier which strawberry hermit crabs (Coenobita perlatus) encounter during their daily activities,” the paper says.

“This is important for countless other islands worldwide where crabs and debris overlap, as crabs play a crucial role in the maintenance of tropical ecosystems.”

The Marine Debris Problem

Marine plastic trash is a growing concern, with significant plastic accumulation on the high seas. Further, researchers are documenting plastic items at depths of nearly 11,000 meters (36,100 feet).

The paper says plastics account for more than 95% of debris observed “at sea, on beaches and along river banks.”

It turns out, plastic trash can persist in the environment for decades, killing, maiming or sickening wildlife that become trapped or entangled or that mistake it for food.

While marine plastic pollution is widely studied, until now little published research directly links it to species decline and wider environmental damage. Traditional research also typically doesn’t investigates the risk it poses on beaches and in nearby vegetation.

“These results are shocking but perhaps not surprising, because beaches and the vegetation that fringes them are frequented by a wide range of wildlife,” lead author Jennifer Lavers, a marine eco-toxicologist at the University of Tasmania’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, said in a news release about the study.

“It is inevitable that these creatures will interact with and be affected by plastic pollution, although ours is one of the first studies to provide quantitative data on such impacts.”

How Researchers Approached the Study: the Process

The research team surveyed beaches on Henderson Island and the Cocos Islands in 2017 and 2019. Researchers were on the lookout for plastic containers that had openings and were positioned at an angle.

Doing so would allow them to figure out how many containers were potential entrapments for crabs. They then counted the number of both living and dead hermit crabs inside those containers.

The researchers then used the survey data to predict total entrapment rates across the islands.

On Henderson Island there were approximately 38 million pieces of trash trapping and killing an estimated 61,000 crabs each year. On the Cocos Islands there were 414 million pieces of trash entrapping 508,000 crabs each year.

That worked out to 239 pieces of trash per square meter on the beaches of Henderson Island. It also worked out to 713 pieces of trash per square meter on the Cocos Islands.

Plastic trash lures hermit crabs by the smell of decaying crabs — and the consequences are clear. In one particularly lethal container on Henderson, the team found 526 trapped hermit crabs.

Importance of Hermit Crabs

Humble hermit crabs are crucial to terrestrial and marine ecosystems. On land, they disperse seeds and create carbon-rich soil micro-habitats by burrowing and collecting leaf litter, which help forests thrive. Their contributions are particularly important on the Cocos Islands and Henderson Island, which lack native ground predators that would otherwise help with those tasks.

The paper also submits that hermit crabs are an important economic resource: the Cocos Islands are home to at least 26 crab species, including several hermit crab species, which could provide an opportunity for wildlife tourism. So a disruption of hermit crab populations could have both ecological and economic effects.

Hermit crabs are common in coastal environments worldwide. The paper hypothesizes that on beaches where the crabs coexist with heavy plastic pollution, there is a risk that they may meet the same fate.

“High concentrations of debris are now being encountered on beaches around the world, many of which are also home to hermit crabs that can be expected to interact with plastic pollution in the same way as those we studied,” Lavers said.

What The Results Mean, According to this Plastic Pollution Expert

Kristian Syberg, a marine plastic pollution expert at Roskilde University in Denmark, said the hermit crab study provides a comprehensive impact assessment of plastic trash in heavily polluted sites, or hotspots.

“Through this study it is feasible to say that ‘hot-spot’ areas of macro plastic pollution do pose a risk,” Syberg, who was not involved in the study, said.

Syberg said documenting the effect of plastic trash on wildlife populations is very difficult, particularly in remote locations. Nevertheless, he said, “widespread risk from both macro and micro plastics is likely within the next century if current patterns are not changed.”

"New study finds receptivity to bullshit, meaning people's willingness to endorse meaningless statements as meaningful, predicts the use of essential oils",http://psypost.org/2020/03/new-study-finds-receptivity-to-bullshit-predicts-the-use-of-essential-oils-56191,"People who misjudge meaningless sentences as profound statements are more likely to use essential oils and find them effective, according to new research that appears in the scientific journal PLOS One.

Essential oils extracted from plants are commonly used with massages and aromatherapy. But the oils are also marketed as natural remedies for a variety of conditions, including anxiety, autism, depression, stress, pain, insomnia, high blood pressure, bacterial infections, skin conditions, and even spiritual and relationship problems.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission recently took action against several companies for fraudulently claiming that essential oils and other remedies could prevent, treat or cure COVID-19.

“The essential oils industry is an enormous one. It is very popular among people and makes a number of claims about the mental and physical health benefits that they bring,” explained lead researcher William Chopik, an assistant professor of psychology at Michigan State University.

“We were more interested in who is the typical consumer of essential oils? Who thinks that they are most beneficial? And who spends the most money on them? To our surprise, no studies had really looked at these factors.”

Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and an undergraduate subject pool, the researchers surveyed a sample of 1,202 participants regarding their personality traits, bullshit receptivity, use of essential oils, and other factors. They found that 66% of participants said they were currently using essential oils. Women were more likely to be currently using essential oils than men.

A statistical analysis found that personality traits were mostly unrelated to use of essential oils, but those high in bullshit receptivity were 70% more likely to use essential oils and were more likely to find them effective.

“Of all the personality and personal variables we looked at, being high in receptivity to bullshit was the most consistent predictor. Bullshit receptivity reflects people’s willingness to endorse meaningless statements as meaningful,” Chopik told PsyPost.

In particular, people high in bullshit receptivity are more likely to view statements such as “As you self-actualize, you will enter into infinite empathy that transcends understanding” as profound.

“People high in this trait were more likely to believe that essential oils had magical healing properties, even if the essential oils were not marketed to solve those problems. They thought essential oils could improve their friendships and spiritual life in addition to all the other ailments that befall people,” Chopik explained.

High religiosity also positively predicted spending money on essential oils and finding them to be effective, while being conservative was associated with the use of essential oils for spiritual enhancement.

“We’re not exactly sure why people who are receptive to bullshit are more likely to use essential oils. On one hand, they could be naively taking the claims essential oil companies make at face value. On another hand, perhaps they trick themselves into actually perceiving benefits (or maybe they unconsciously do so),” Chopik added.

The study, “Individual differences in personality predict the use and perceived effectiveness of essential oils“, was authored by Lindsay S. Ackerman and William J. Chopik.",JustBadNews,0
B.C. couple who bought entire store's meat section says they're living in fear now,http://vancouverisawesome.com/bc-news/couple-buys-meat-section-video-death-threats-living-fear-lake-country-bc-2185549,"""I'm not feeling safe, and me and my girlfriend are scared.""

By Rob Gibson

The couple at the centre of a panic meat buying frenzy in Lake Country last weekend has reached out to Castanet to let us know that they are receiving death threats due to the community's negative reaction.

Dan Marcotte spoke with Castanet to try and explain his reasons for the massive purchase that cleaned out the Save On Foods meat section last weekend.

""Everybody knows who I am, because I put myself out there, (now) I'm getting death threats and I don't answer the phone so I'm losing business. My own mother is ashamed of me.""

Marcotte has a big heart and has used his Dan-Mel moving company to help others in the past, giving his moving services away free of charge to help those in need during the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons.

""Nobody remembers that now."" Marcotte also donated $1,000 to the Lake Country Food Bank after the incident, which he says was grateful and supportive. He feels now that his life could be in danger and he worries his business could go under if people stop calling for his services.

He says he got caught up in the anxiety most people are feeling about the coronavirus and made the large purchase for his own family.

""If me and my girlfriend had done this two months ago nobody would say a bloody word. We're getting crucified for buying two carts of meat. We might have gone overboard, but we didn't push people or laugh at anyone.""

""I'm not feeling safe, and me and my girlfriend are scared.""

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia’s president on Friday ordered a general lockdown, limiting citizens’ free movement in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

The government later said in a statement the lockdown would come into force on Sunday and last until April 4.

The North African country, which has already shut down cafes, restaurants and mosques, has so far reported 54 confirmed cases of coronavirus and one death.

Tunisian banks will postpone the repayment of loans by poorer citizens by six months to help alleviate the social and economic impact of the crisis, banking sources said.

“There is no need for fear or panic, the state will be with you,” President Kais Saied said in a televised broadcast.

“I call on Tunisians to stay at home and to go out only to meet the most urgent needs... The state will provide food and vital services such as health and security.”

Tunisia now expects an economic recession, prompting the central bank on Tuesday to cut its key interest rate by 100 basis points.

Amber Heard ridicules Johnny Depp for claiming he's the victim,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125967/Amber-Heard-seen-smirking-listens-admitting-clocked-Johnny-Depp.html#v-348010914929227130,"Amber Heard smirks, rolls her eyes and nibbles on cookies as she's forced to listen to herself admitting on tape that she 'clocked' Johnny Depp in the face.

The 33-year-old actress was confronted with the bombshell recording as she sat down for a deposition during their bitter 2016 divorce.

As DailyMail.com revealed on Tuesday, it captures the then-husband and wife discussing a violent incident in which Depp claims he was struck by a bathroom door and punched in the jaw.

Heard denies slamming the door into him intentionally but apologizes on tape for deliberately hitting the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, pleading: 'I just reacted and I'm sorry. It's below me.'

Today, DailyMail.com can reveal the dramatic moment Depp's attorneys confronted Heard with the recording and challenged her to come clean about attacking her Oscar-nominated ex.

In video footage obtained by this website, Heard looks increasingly uncomfortable - fidgeting, smirking and chewing on snacks - as her 'confession' is played back to a room full of lawyers.

In video footage obtained by this website, Heard looks increasingly uncomfortable - fidgeting, smirking and chewing on snacks - as her 'confession' is played back to a room full of lawyers

The 33-year-old actress was confronted with the bombshell recording as she sat down for a deposition during their bitter 2016 divorce. The then-husband and wife were discussing an incident in which Depp claims he was struck by a bathroom door and punched in the jaw

She shakes her head and rolls her eyes as Depp, 56, says on the tape: 'I'd just been hit in the head with a f**king corner of the door. And then I stood up and then you f**king clock me.'

'I was trying to escape from a room where Johnny was attacking me,' Heard protests as the recording is paused.

'And in order to escape, I was trying to get onto the other side of the door attempting to close the door and he was attempting to get in, despite my attempts to try and escape an assault.'

Attorney Blair Berk, representing Depp, asks Heard repeatedly if she ever hit the father-of-two – and if she didn't, why apologize?

But Heard denies being the aggressor during their toxic 18-month marriage and says the tape 'misrepresents what actually happened'.

'I'm trying to keep him out of, and then he runs the door over my toes trying to get into the room,' she goes on. 'I tried to push him out of it, which is what the hit is that is referred to.

'And Johnny, whenever he was hit or touched at all, referred to it in these ways of punching or clocked or whatever.

'And whether you discussed it with him or not, the last thing you do in talking to him afterwards or trying to reconcile with him is to get into what the definition of those words mean to him.'

Despite her denials, Depp's supporters say the audio is just one of several taped 'confessions' that proves Heard was the domestic abuser throughout the doomed union, contrary to her claims. Pictured: Heard nibbling on a cookie during the deposition

The bombshell tape suggests the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 56, was hit so hard by the bathroom door that it knocked him off his feet. 'I then stood up, I don't even know if I said, I mean, I might've said like, what the f**k, you know, whatever. Cause I'd just been hit in the head with a f**king corner of the door,' Depp protests. 'And then I stood up and then you f**king clock me.' As part of Depp's $50m defamation case against Heard, he included images of his own bruised and battered face (pictured ) following Heard's alleged attacks

Timeline of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's relationship February 3, 2015 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard marry in a private civil ceremony at their LA home, four years after they met as co-stars on the set of The Rum Diary. They celebrate with a lavish reception on a private island in the Bahamas that Depp bought in 2004 for $3.6 million. April 21, 2015 Heard breaches Australia's biosecurity laws after she and Depp fail to declare their two Yorkshire Terriers when they arrive on a private jet for the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Charges of illegally importing animals are dropped but Heard admits falsifying quarantine documents and is placed on a $1k one month good behavior bond. May 23, 2016 Heard files for divorce after 15 months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. Four days later a judge issues a temporary restraining order against Depp over domestic violence allegations. Pictures of Heard's alleged injuries hit the tabloids but the LAPD finds no evidence of a crime. August 16, 2016 Heard retracts her allegations as she and Depp reach a $7 million divorce settlement. Their marriage was 'intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,' the former actors say in a statement. 'There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm'. December 18, 2018 The Washington Post publishes an op-ed by Heard, an ambassador for women's rights at for the American Civil Liberties Union, urging support for women who suffer domestic violence. 'Two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out,' Heard writes. March 1, 2019 Despite not being named in the article, Depp files a $50 million defamation suit in Fairfax Circuit Court, Virginia saying it insinuated he was an abuser and got him fired from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Depp dismisses Heard's allegations as a 'hoax' and claims he was actually the victim of her violence. April 10, 2019 Heard files a motion to dismiss the complaint, cataloging more than a dozen instances of abuse between 2012, when she moved in with Depp, and the May 2016 bust up that preceded their divorce. She refers to him as 'the monster' in the 300-plus page filing. May 20, 2019 Depp hits back against the motion to dismiss claiming Heard painted bruises on her face, scrubbed metadata and fabricated evidence against him. He denies ever abusing any woman and says of her allegations: 'I will continue to deny them for the rest of my life.' January 31, 2020 #JusticeforJohnnyDepp becomes a top trending hashtag on Twitter after DailyMail.com publishes audio of Heard admitting she hit Depp and threw pots, pans and vases. Online petition urging Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment to ax Heard from the upcoming Aquaman 2 hits 130,000 signatures. Advertisement

She adds: 'If he was ever pushed, it was a clock - he called it a cold-clock. I mean, he was just very dramatic about everything about it.'

Despite her denials, Depp's supporters say the audio is just one of several taped 'confessions' that proves Heard was the domestic abuser throughout the doomed union, contrary to her claims.

It's not known when or where it was recorded, however the pair had a habit of recording their arguments, often consensually, as a form of DIY marriage guidance so they could play the tapes back later.

In a previous exchange, published exclusively by DailyMail.com in January, Heard admits 'hitting' the Oscar nominee, and pelting him with pots, pans and vases.

Weeks later we published a further clip in which Heard, an ambassador for women's rights and an outspoken domestic violence advocate, taunts Depp for fleeing a violent confrontation, telling him: 'You are such a baby. Grow the f**k up Johnny.'

The latest developments come as the warring A-listers prepare to square up again in two separate defamation lawsuits on either side of the Atlantic.

On March 23, Depp will take on News Group Newspapers in London over a 2018 article in The Sun newspaper that described him as 'wife beater' and allegedly damaged his standing as a globally famed movie star, with Heard scheduled to give testimony.

And, later this year, hostilities will switch to Virginia where Depp has filed a $50 million suit over a Washington Post op-ed in which Heard lamented her experiences as a domestic violence victim, an article that didn't mention her ex by name but allegedly led to him losing his role of Captain Jack Sparrow.

'Whatever Amber Heard is eating in her August 13, 2016 deposition, it is certainly not truth serum,' Depp's attorney Adam Waldman said of the newly-emerged video footage. 'And she ignores the fact that bathroom doors open in, not out.'

Waldman told DailyMail.com: 'We have assembled a giant, ever-growing body of evidence to expose her ever-growing abuse allegations as a hoax.

'But our star witness turns out to be the serially violent Amber Heard herself, perjuring remorselessly in a sworn 2016 video deposition that we've just obtained, and then exposing her diabolical lies with her own friends and employees' testimony, subsequently discovered audio recordings, text messages, CCTV footage, TV appearances, multiple frauds, attempts to suborn perjury and documented abuse of others.'

A spokesman for Heard's legal team hit back, however, saying: 'Ms. Heard's testimony is clear that, in the incident described, she was attempting to escape an assault at the hands of Mr. Depp.

'It is unfortunately common for men who have committed domestic abuse to present themselves as the 'victim' when nothing could be further from the truth.'

Depp and Heard met on the set of The Rum Diary, back in 2011 and married in February 2015.

However they split less than two years later when Heard filed for divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp for allegedly beating her up, an accusation he has repeatedly denied.

Amid a torrent of headlines and blood-curdling allegations, the pair agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement in August 2016 - which Heard says she donated to charity.

However their back-and-forth feud reignited when she wrote in her December 2018 op-ed: 'I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out.'

The article didn't mention Depp by name but he sued regardless, arguing he was the victim of an 'elaborate hoax' instigated by Heard to generate positive publicity and advance her career.

Heard responded with a lurid 300-page filing of her own, cataloging the 'horrific' abuse she claimed to have suffered at Depp's hands, describing him as 'the monster' and recalling many of the allegations she made during their divorce.

"Trump admin unlawfully axing LGBTQ discrimination protections, suit claims",http://nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-admin-unlawfully-axing-lgbtq-discrimination-protections-suit-claims-n1163756,"The Department of Health and Human Services plans to unlawfully stop enforcing nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans, a lawsuit filed Thursday claims.

The suit centers on a “notice of nonenforcement” and a proposed rule issued by the Trump administration in November that would reverse a 2016 Obama-era rule prohibiting discrimination in HHS-funded grant programs and permit federally funded organizations to turn people away claiming conflicts with religious beliefs. The suit was filed by civil rights group Lambda Legal and nonprofit Democracy Forward on behalf of three LGBTQ advocacy groups — True Colors United, SAGE and Family Equality.

“In conflict with HHS’s established rules and policy, Defendants have engaged in systematic efforts to undermine the civil rights of, and non-discrimination protections for, LGBTQ people in the United States,” the suit states. “HHS’s decision to walk away entirely from enforcing the still-valid 2016 Grants Rule is a glaring example.”

According to the lawsuit, there’s about $500 billion in HHS grant money at stake. This is the amount the department administers to fund organizations across the country who provide a variety of services, including child placement, homeless shelters and elder care.

The HHS Office of Public Affairs told NBC News it would “not comment on pending litigation.” However, in its November statement regarding the notice of nonenforcement, the department said it is “committed to fully enforcing the civil rights laws passed by Congress” and stated that this proposal would “better align” HHS grant regulations with “federal statutes, eliminating regulatory burden, including burden on the free exercise of religion.”

Civil rights advocates say the November measure is another example of the Trump administration prioritizing “religious freedom” at the expense of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans. In fact, a report issued in November by the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights claimed the administration is “undoing decades of civil and human rights progress” — especially when it comes to LGBTQ issues.

‘Heightened vulnerability’

Puneet Cheema, a Lambda Legal attorney working on the suit, said this HHS policy reversal will affect the most vulnerable within the LGBTQ community, notably youth and older adults. The current coronavirus pandemic, she added, will only make the impact more devastating.

“Youth who are experiencing homelessness, seniors who have difficulties accessing health care generally,” she said, “they may have heightened need for care and heightened vulnerability in this epidemic.”

LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the foster care system, and they are 120 percent more likely to experience homelessness, according to a study from Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago. Foster care and shelters are two essential services often funded by HHS grants.

“LGBTQ youth already more vulnerable because of discrimination,” Cheema said. “They have a right to get services that are free of discrimination. They have a right to shelter without being subject to verbal harassment. They have a right to loving and affirming families, all of which is at risk.”

""Defendants have engaged in systematic efforts to undermine the civil rights of, and non-discrimination protections for, LGBTQ people in the United States.""

Dylan Waguespack is the public policy and external affairs director at True Colors United, a national organization assisting LGBTQ homeless youth. Waguespack told NBC News that when HHS announced it would no longer enforce the nondiscrimination rule, the organization decided to take action by joining Thursday’s lawsuit.

“We immediately recognized it could cause a great deal of harm to young people,” he said, noting the department’s proposed rule could make a young person less willing to report discrimination or prompt them to leave a shelter altogether.

Echoing Cheema, he also noted the particularly perilous situation these vulnerable young people are in amid the current public health crisis.

“Making young people less likely to come inside is particularly dangerous right now when we are looking at this pandemic and expecting an increase in young people coming in to use these services because of home situations becoming more and more unstable and schools and campuses shutting down,” he said.

HHS’s decision may also negatively affect older LGBTQ adults, many of whom rely on services funded by the department, such as meal delivery or transportation.

“LGBTQ older adults are already more economically insecure because of the lifetime of discrimination they have experienced,” Cheema explained. “They have a right to age with dignity and HHS is denying them that.”

Cheema said HHS’s November nonenforcement notice and rule proposal is yet “another example of the Trump administration turning its back on LGBTQ people” and “flouting the rule of law.”

“It’s infuriating,” she added.

The most anti-LGBTQ Democrat in the House lost his primary last night,http://lgbtqnation.com/2020/03/anti-lgbtq-democrat-house-lost-primary-last-night/,"In the Illinois Democratic primary last night, Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-IL) – the lone House Democrat to refuse to co-sponsor the Equality Act – was defeated by Marie Newman.

He was defeated by Newman 47.7% to 43.6% with 90% of precincts reporting, effectively bringing an end to his 16-year-career.

Lipinski got scores of 58, 57, and 38 out of 100 in the last three HRC Congressional Scorecards, far below the near-perfect 100’s other Democrats from Illinois got on the most recent scorecard.

He also opposed other progressive priorities like women’s reproductive rights, the Affordable Care Act, and the DREAM Act.

Newman, a business consultant and founder of “Team Up to Stop Bullying,” ran to the left of Lipinski as “a state and national advocate for health care rights, income equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and common-sense gun safety,” according to her website. She had narrowly lost to Lipinski in 2018 before beating him last night.

During his race, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee refused to endorse Lipinski. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) both backed Newman, and Newman also received endorsements from several progressive organizations, like HRC, Emily’s List, and Planned Parenthood.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) endorsed Lipinski in 2018 even though he repeatedly voted against legislation she championed and even opposed the re-election campaign of then President Barack Obama.

Lipinski, who is Catholic, began serving in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2005. In 2006, he voted “present” on the proposed Constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and in 2007 he voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.

He was the only Democrat to co-sponsor the 2015 First Amendment Defense Act, which would’ve allowed Christian anti-LGBTQ discrimination under the guise of “religious freedom.” In 2016, he supported the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which would’ve permitted businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Lipinski was also supported by the anti-LGBTQ Illinois Family Institute for his voting record.

Lipinski opposed the Equality Act — federal legislation approved by the House that would add sexual orientation and gender identity to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, offering protections in housing, employment, public accommodations, education, credit, and several other areas. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) was the only other Congressional Democratic besides Lipinski to oppose it.

Lipinski eventually pledged to vote for the Equality Act in May 2019 after Newman started highlighting his opposition to it in her campaign ads. But even then, he said he’d only do so if the bill did “more to ensure religious liberty.”

Despite his anti-LGBTQ votes, Lipinski did vote in favor of repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the ban on out gay military members, and in favor of federal hate crimes for queerbashing.

In a statement, Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats, said of Newman’s victory, “This is a critical victory for the progressive movement in showing that voters are ready for a new generation of progressive leadership in the Democratic Party.”

Rojas continued, “This isn’t just a loss for one incumbent. It’s a defeat for machine politics and big corporate donors who want to stop our movement for ‘Medicare for all,’ a Green New Deal, and reproductive rights.”",JustBadNews,0
"TikTok 'tried to filter out videos from ugly, poor or disabled users'",http://theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/17/tiktok-tried-to-filter-out-videos-from-ugly-poor-or-disabled-users,"TikTok moderators were told to suppress videos from users who appeared too ugly, poor or disabled, as part of the company’s efforts to curate an aspirational air in the videos it promotes, according to new documents published by the Intercept.

The documents detail how moderators for the social video app were instructed to select content for the influential “For You” feed, an algorithmic timeline that is most users’ first port of call when they open the app. As a result, being selected for For You can drive huge numbers of views to a given video, but the selection criteria have always remained a secret, with little understanding as to the amount of automation involved.

TikTok’s moderators were instructed to exclude videos from the For You feed if they failed on any one of a number of categories, the documents show. Users with an “abnormal body shape (not limited to: dwarf, acromegaly),” who are “chubby … obese or too thin” or who have “ugly facial looks or facial deformities” should be removed, one document says, since “if the character’s appearance is not good, the video will be much less attractive, not worthing [sic] to be recommended to new users.”

Similarly, the documents show, videos were to be removed from the feed if “the shooting environment is shabby and dilapidated”, since “this kind of environment is … less fancy and appealing”.

A TikTok spokesperson said the goal was to prevent bullying on the platform, tying the document to a report from December that showed that the company was suppressing vulnerable users’ videos in a misguided effort to prevent them from becoming the centre of attention that could turn sour. The categories of video suppressed in the latest document are far broader than those revealed in December, however, nor is any mention of bullying, a discrepancy the company attributes to a local interpretation of the wider policy.

Other documents published by the Intercept show the extent of TikTok’s former rules requiring moderators to enforce Chinese foreign policy overseas. The site published the company’s livestreaming policies, which instruct moderators to take down “controversial content” that promotes Taiwanese independence or is “uglification” of history, such as the Tiananmen Square “incidents”.

The language is identical to that used in documents first reported by the Guardian in September 2019. At the time, TikTok said the documents were old, and had been out of use since May that year, but the Intercept cites a source who indicated that the policies “were in use through at least late 2019”.

In a statement, TikTok said:

“The livestream guidelines in question appear to be largely the same or similar to the guidelines the Guardian already reported on last year, which were removed both before the Guardian’s reporting and also prior to when the Intercept says the document was accessed. Over the past year, we have established trust and safety hubs in California, Dublin and Singapore, which oversee development and execution of our moderation policies and are headed by industry experts with extensive experience in these areas. Local teams apply the updated community guidelines that we published in January, all aimed at keeping TikTok a place of open self-expression and a safe environment for users and creators alike.

“Most of the guidelines the Intercept presented are either no longer in use, or in some cases appear to have never been in place, but it is correct that for live streaming TikTok is particularly vigilant about keeping sexualised content off the platform.”

TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech unicorn Bytedance, has been trying to separate its international efforts from its Chinese home for at least a year. But many staff, including moderators, are still based in China.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the last of those China-based moderators will be shifted to other work inside the company shortly, with locally-based moderators picking up the slack. TikTok had already succeeded in moderating all US content from outside China, but relied on China-based moderators for many other countries, in particular to provide 24-hour cover for much of Europe.",JustBadNews,0
Chinese-American CBS reporter claims White House official made racist coronavirus joke to her face,http://rawstory.com/2020/03/chinese-american-cbs-reporter-claims-white-house-official-made-racist-coronavirus-joke-to-her-face/,"A Chinese-American reporter was shocked by a racist term for the coronavirus used by a White House official.

Coronavirus is exposing America's shameful selfish streak,http://theweek.com/articles/902415/coronavirus-exposing-americas-shameful-selfish-streak,"During World War II, Americans of all stripes pitched in to win the war against the Axis powers. While soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines fought in Europe and the Pacific, the citizens who stayed home helped the effort by doing with a little less. In what might now be called an ""all of America"" approach, every family — even that of President Franklin Roosevelt — was subject to rationing. They accepted limits on the amount of meat, sugar, and other foodstuffs their families could buy, and they repaired car tires instead of buying new ones, so that those critical supplies could be used to feed and arm the troops. People made sacrifices for the sake of the greater good.

""Do with less so they'll have enough!"" pleaded a propaganda poster featuring a smiling soldier. ""Rationing gives you your fair share.""

That was the 1940s. These days, Americans can't even give up a Saturday night at the bar. We have forgotten how to make sacrifices for each other. We have forgotten that we should.

The coronavirus crisis facing both this country and the world might well end up being our biggest challenge since World War II. President Trump on Friday finally declared a national emergency, and health authorities pleaded continually with Americans to adopt ""social distancing"" measures like working from home and maintaining a distance of six feet from each other. The reason? Even young people — who don't face as much risk of death from the virus as older folks — can pass the virus along in crowded places. Self-isolation is the order of the day.

Saturday night, though, bars and restaurants across the country were full.

Reports spilled in from packed bars in Manhattan, crowds filling downtown Nashville, and busy restaurants in Oklahoma City. Some people said they were trying to help their local businesses survive the certain economic devastation that will accompany the coronavirus lockdown, but many folks were simply defiant.

""I just went to a crowded Red Robin and I'm 30,"" one young woman tweeted in response to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-N.Y.) plea for people to stay home. ""It was delicious, and I took my sweet time eating my meal. Because this is America. And I'll do what I want.""

Those are words — ""I'll do what I want"" — that could end up killing people.

To be fair, it is clear the young woman is far from alone in her conception that ""America"" means doing whatever you want, even if it risks harming your neighbors. She's far from alone in believing the animating idea of this country is a sort of freedom from any responsibility to our fellow citizens.

Just under half of Americans said they planned to stop attending large public gatherings, according to a poll conducted last week by NBC and the Wall Street Journal. Barely a third said they had canceled or planned to cancel travel. And just a quarter said they had stopped or planned to stop eating out at restaurants.

Those numbers are dramatically skewed by the numbers of Republicans who were refusing to make lifestyle changes: Just 30 percent said they were avoiding large gatherings, 23 percent were skipping travel and just 12 percent were staying away from restaurants.

Who could blame them? The Republican president keeps telling the country he's got everything under control, even as experienced health professionals warn the worst is yet to come. Officials like Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and Congressman Devin Nunes (R-California) spent the weekend encouraging people to go out. Some, like former Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., did so to ""push back"" against the liberals telling them to stay home. Why should Americans worry — why should they sacrifice a good time — if their leaders tell them otherwise?

It is our great fortune that we haven't much been called upon to make real sacrifices since World War II. We're not just out of practice, though — the concept of the ""greater good"" has taken a real beating in recent decades, in favor of a mythical rugged individualism that claims the virtue of self-sufficiency and dismisses any sense of responsibility to each other as a form of socialism.

The end result: ""This is America. And I'll do what I want."" And everybody else can go to hell.

In the absence of leadership to guide us, it has ended up the responsibility of individuals and business owners to look out for their communities. In my hometown of Lawrence, Kansas, a popular downtown eatery announced late Saturday it is voluntarily shutting down for two weeks — because customers were still filling the place. Other establishments soon followed suit, or cut back to delivery-only options. In New York, a Time correspondent ran past brunch hot spots in Brooklyn carrying a sign telling customers to ""Go the (bleep) HOME."" More mandatory restrictions are on the way this week, but too often, our elected leaders have been slow to do what is necessary, if painful.

This crisis is likely to get worse before it gets better. We Americans can better help each other if we are prepared to make sacrifices for each other over the next few months. It seems we have forgotten how. The time to relearn is now.

China Warns It Could Withhold Life-Saving Drugs To Plunge US into 'The Mighty Sea of Coronavirus',http://westernjournal.com/china-warns-withhold-life-saving-drugs-plunge-us-mighty-sea-coronavirus/,"China is raising the threat of cutting off drugs to the United States unless it receives what it considers to be the proper thanks for what it claims is the heroic role it played in fighting the coronavirus.

The threat is contained in an article in Xinhua, China’s state-run media agency, according to Fox News.

“We should say righteously that the U.S. owes China an apology, the world owes China a thank you,” an editorial in Xinhua read.

A different article in Xinhua’s English version praises the government for its transparency and efficiency in addressing the outbreak, which began in Wuhan, China, in December.

“As a responsible major country, China has also from the start acted openly and transparently in releasing relevant information to the world and seeking international cooperation to prevent the spread of the epidemic worldwide,” the article said.

The Chinese-language editorial, though, said China could impose controls on the export of medicine, plunging the U.S. into “the mighty sea of coronavirus.”

China’s bluster comes as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, without naming the drug, said that it has identified the first drug shortage related to the virus, Fox reported.

China’s hammerlock on the U.S. pharmaceutical trade was decried by Rosemary Gibson of the Hastings Center, a bioethics think tank, during testimony last year to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.

“National health security and national security are threatened by U.S. dependence on China for thousands of ingredients and raw materials to make our medicines. China’s aim is to become the pharmacy to the world, and it is on track to achieve it. China’s dominance is global,” she said.

Gibson is a co-author of “China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America’s Dependence on China for Medicine.”

She said that China has already shown it can flex its muscles when it chooses.

“As China gains more control over America’s supply of medicines, it could charge American consumers and patients higher prices, or extort concessions from the federal government to keep prices affordable,” she said. “This is not mere speculation. China’s domestic companies formed a vitamin C cartel in the early 2000s and increased prices up to 600 percent, which increased the cost to American consumers and businesses.”

“The nation’s health security is in jeopardy. The U.S. can no longer make penicillin. The last U.S. penicillin fermentation plant closed in 2004. Industry data reveal that Chinese companies formed a cartel, colluded to sell product on the global market at below market price, and drove all U.S. European, and Indian producers out of business. Once they gained dominant global market share, prices increased.”

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the possibility of China extorting leverage is very real.

“They could trigger a domestic problem here that would make it difficult or us to confront them,” Rubio told Fox on Thursday.

He agreed & his team led by by Peter Navarro are also working on an EO to help address this. https://t.co/WlX7u158rV — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 11, 2020

Gibson said the current situation is a national security risk.

“Medicines in the hands of an adversary can be weaponized,” she said.

“Supplies can be withheld. Medicines can be made with lethal contaminants or sold without any real medicine in them, rendering them ineffective. These products can be distributed to specific targets. Detection is time-consuming at best, and virtually impossible at worst.”

“The thousands of men and women on U.S. aircraft carriers in the South China Sea are dependent on the adversary for many of their essential medicines,” Gibson added.

“Combat readiness and force protection are at risk with the military vulnerable to disruptions in supply and contaminated and toxic medicines. In 2018, more than 31,000 active duty military personnel, veterans, and their family members were notified they may have been given blood pressure medicines containing a cancer-causing ingredient.”

“Here’s the deal,” he began. “We don’t know for sure that the virus is going to be less prevalent when the warmer weather happens — we don’t know that. You know, the speculation, this is true for some virus, this is a new virus, it is a novel virus. We don’t understand the behavior.”

“You were talking about the ability to control this in Hong Kong and Singapore, et cetera,” he continued. “It’s not just because they have a controlled society, in society. These are the places where is they started early testing and separating people. I want to give one piece of data: the United States of America has tested 5 people per 1 million compared to 3,600 people per million in South Korea.”

“I wish I could use the language but I’m on television, but this is a phenomenal disaster for us. Not only did we start late, which got me worked up eight weeks ago, but it’s still not fixed,” he added. ” This is a level of incompetence in the public health system that Americans have never seen before.

That was nothing compared to the problems we’re having right now in messaging and technology. This is an international embarrassment.”

A flood of cheap supply coming onto the market from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates compounded pressure on prices. The Gulf Arab producers are raising production as they go on the offensive in an oil price war with Russia.

Brent crude LCOc1 was down $2.57, or 7.2%, at $33.22 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate Texas crude CLc1 was down $1.48, or 4.5%, at $31.50.

Global equities plunged and the Dow Jones index was on course for its worst performance since Wall Street’s “Black Monday” crash of 1987 after Trump announced the travel restrictions.

Prices pared losses briefly after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it would increase Treasury purchases and introduce new repo operations, but the bounce faded quickly across markets.

“Global market carnage continues as Wall Street struggles to grasp how long the global pandemic will disrupt travel, trade and daily life,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

“Brent crude seems poised to sell off another 10% here as the demand outlook seems like it will only get worse.”

Global oil demand is set to contract in 2020 for the first time in more than a decade, with the International Energy Agency this week lowering its annual forecast by almost 1 million barrels per day, or 1% of global demand.

Demand in the first quarter has fallen sharply on the year, mostly because of the impact of the virus on economic activity in China.

Both Brent and WTI are down about 50% from highs reached in January. They suffered their biggest one-day declines since the 1991 Gulf War on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched a price war.

The six-month Brent contango spread LCOc1-LCOc7 from May to November widened to as much as $7.31 a barrel, a level not seen since January 2015.

Contango is where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the price to buy it now. That encourages oil firms and traders to pump oil into storage - either on land or in tankers at sea - with an aim to sell it later at a profit.

The cost to transport oil on supertankers soared as major producers scrambled to secure vessels to ship more crude and companies looked for vessels for storage.

As top oil exporter Saudi Arabia moved quickly to boost output, Russia stuck by the decision that led last week to the collapse of its alliance with Riyadh and other producers. Moscow said that there was no point cutting output because it would likely be too little to compensate for the virus’ impact on global demand.

For now, both sides are digging in for the price war, said Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA research and strategy at MUFG.

“We believe that both sides have enough financial capacity and sufficiently divergent goals to sustain the oil price war for many quarters, not months,” he said.

Saudi Arabia has already stepped up efforts to squeeze Russia’s Urals oil grade out of its main markets by offering its own cheap barrels to refiners worldwide that buy Russian crude, seven oil sources said.

With demand falling sharply and output rising quickly, the market is facing a big surplus in April. Estimates for the scope of the glut vary. It could be as much as 6 million bpd, said Kirill Tachennikov, director and senior oil analyst at BCS Global Markets in Moscow.",JustBadNews,0
"Climate change is disrupting life for millions, a report finds",http://cnn.com/2020/03/10/weather/climate-report-wmo-2019-wxc/index.html?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=84574476&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7rc60njtwMnW1Us_ASvklguHsuwJHjucloFDVhvetUch02xV2qNOX3MjNvcwt5siEPhMEPZ_3KjVK60OCca7hu1uXdQ&_hsmi=84574476,"(CNN) After declining for most of the last decade, hunger is once again on the rise around the world, and climate change is a primary cause. Over 820 million people suffered from hunger in 2018, the greatest number since 2010 according to findings from a new World Meteorological Organization report released today.

The wide-ranging State of the Climate report outlines the latest science and includes data from a variety of disciplines in order to evaluate the current and future impacts of climate change on everything from heath and global economies to food insecurity and refugee displacements.

Climate variability is one of the key contributors to this increase in global disruptions due to food insecurity, displacement, and deaths from disasters.

Food supplies in some of the most vulnerable regions in the world are being directly affected by impacts such as crop failures and locust swarms.

Exceptional drought followed by extremely heavy rainfall markedly decreased the seasonal crop yield in the Horn of Africa during 2019. These irregular weather and climate patterns also contributed to the worst desert locust invasion in 25 years , which further threatened the crop supply in the region.

As a result, by the end of 2019, over 22 million people in the Horn of Africa alone were estimated to be severely food insecure.

A picture shows houses in a flooded area of Buzi, central Mozambique, on March 20, 2019, after the passage of cyclone Idai.

Extreme weather spans the globe

High-impact weather events in 2019 were largely to blame for up to 22 million estimated displacements of people due to disasters, up more than 25% over 2018. Floods and storms contributed the most, including Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas -- each of which dropped unprecedented amounts of rainfall and displaced tens of thousands of residents.

During two separate summer European heatwaves, all-time record temperatures were notched in several countries across Europe and at least 1,462 deaths were recorded.

But the impacts on human health extend beyond just hunger and heat-related illness.

The dengue virus , a mosquito-borne illness, has seen its global incidence grow dramatically in recent decades and now threatens about half of the world's population, the report finds.

Australia experienced record warm temperatures and extreme drought, creating the perfect storm for the wildfires that burned over 7 million hectares (17 million acres) in New South Wales and Victoria alone. The fire activity wasn't just confined to Australia, though, Siberia and South America's Amazon rain forests saw massive wildfires as well.

Symptoms of the climate crisis

The extremes don't stop there, as the global thermostat continues to rise, along with many of the other tell-tale symptoms of global warming.

The global-average temperature was 1.1 degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial era, topping off 2010-2019 as the warmest decade on record.

The findings of this report are not surprising, as the WMO released another report in January stating that 2019 was the second-warmest year on record. Only 2016 was warmer, due to a strong El Nino event that heated the globe naturally.

In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on record, due to the melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica as well as continuing heating of the ocean, which the report notes once again reached it's highest levels of heat in the upper 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of ocean depth.

Kenya is on the frontline of climate change. Regular searing temperatures are leaving the Turkana people in the north-west suffering recurring and prolonged droughts.

""Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.

Climate change is making these extremes more common, This latest report serves as a valuable mile-marker of the climate crisis. Without climate action, populations around the globe can expect to see continued disruptions to their everyday lives.

""This report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it,"" according to Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College in London and not associated with the WMO State of the Climate.

""It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus -- we must not be diverted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.""",JustBadNews,0

It was mild. His greatest concern was not passing it on.

The journalist, who was isolated in Copenhagen away from his family until he was declared virus free by doctors, was the first person in Denmark to test positive for coronavirus after returning home from a holiday in northern Italy.

“I had very few symptoms, and it was only headache, stomach illness and cough, throat and pain in the throat. It took like five or six days to get rid of all the symptoms,” he said.

“I was never hospitalised. I didn’t receive any medicine, because I was fine, it was not like it was very bad for me, as it is for many other people.”

Coronavirus has been most dangerous for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Knowing it can be fatal for some made Ramlyng particularly anxious about passing it on.

“I don’t want to be the one that makes other people sick. So that was my greatest concern and I think that is the greatest concern for everybody, that we don’t want this thing to spread more than possible.”

“I prefer to stay home, a week or two more, or even longer, if I can prevent anyone from getting this disease.”

Nil Monro, 22, a Spaniard who defines himself as young and healthy, tested positive for coronavirus after returning to Barcelona from Milan Fashion Week.

Speaking to Reuters, he, like Ramlyng, wanted to reassure people the symptoms can be mild.

“The symptoms I’m having are like a normal cold, like a flu. I had a little bit of fever, headache, general discomfort, but anyone would have thought it was just a cold.”

He started noticing symptoms when he got back to Spain, called the emergency services who told him to go to hospital for a test. After testing positive he was quarantined.

“I would like to reassure people. If you are young - follow the authorities’ recommendations. And if you are an older person or a person with a previous illness - then take more precautions. Try not to attend big events and try to have very good hand hygiene,” he said.

Claudio Cancelli, 65-year-old mayor of the Italian town of Nembro in the province of Bergamo, near Milan, also has coronavirus. He says his town of 11,000 people has the most cases in the province.

“Luckily, my case was absolutely positive because, after three days of high temperatures and simply taking some antipyretic (fever remedy), I no longer have symptoms.”

“Today I’m well, and I have been well for six days so far, and I’m working for my town and I play my role as mayor.”

Every day the health authorities call him at least twice to ask his temperature and how he is feeling.

“I will stay in my house for about 14 days ... I live in a separate room in my home and I use a separate bathroom. My two family members - my wife and my son - live in the other part of the house but they are subject to the so-called quarantine too.

"Wall Street pounded by oil crash, virus fears. Wall Street's main stock indexes plummeted about 5% on Monday, as a slump in oil prices and the rapid spread of the coronavirus amplified fears of a global recession on the anniversary of the U.S. stock market's longest bull run.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-stocks/wall-street-pounded-by-oil-crash-virus-fears-idUKKBN20W1YH,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street roared back to life on Tuesday, rebounding from the brink of bear market confirmation as bargain-hunting and hopes of government stimulus calmed investors’ fears surrounding the coronavirus and growing signs of imminent recession.

All three major indexes jumped nearly 5% the day after equities markets suffered their biggest one-day losses since the 2008 financial crisis.

Still, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the session about 15% below the record closing highs reached on Feb. 19. Sinking beyond the 20% mark would confirm a bear market.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he will take “major steps” to allay market fears by asking Congress for a fiscal stimulus package to include a payroll tax cut, among other measures.

“Coming off yesterday, you’ve got short-term bargain-hunters coupled with potential fiscal stimulus hopes,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.

“It may be the biggest benefit is not actually what’s getting done - it’s that there appears to be a plan,” Carlson added. “There does appear to be a willingness to do something, and that’s probably what’s helping the market.”

Market participants largely expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the second time this month at the conclusion of next week’s two-day monetary policy meeting.

Outside the United States, major world economies took steps to cushion the effects of the fast spreading COVID-19.

Global markets have been rattled in recent weeks by the rapidly spreading coronavirus, which has caused widespread supply chain disruption, hobbled the travel industry and prompted drastic containment measures in Italy and elsewhere.

Market uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 were exacerbated over the weekend as Saudi Arabia and Russia scrapped their supply pact and pledged to increase crude oil production.

But oil prices rebounded from Monday's largest percentage drop since the 1991 Gulf War, with front-month Brent crude LCOc1 rising 10.0% after Russia indicated it was open to talks with OPEC.

World cannot afford to ignore Erdogan's bullying,http://gulfnews.com/world/mena/world-cannot-afford-to-ignore-erdogans-bullying-1.70238391,"A Turkish military convoy is seen parked near the town of Batabu near Idlib. In Syria, Erdogan has supported the mostly Islamist rebels with arms and training. Image Credit: AFP

Dubai: In his book, Erdogan’s Empire: Turkey and the Politics of the Middle East, Soner Cagaptay argues that Turkey today “faces a hostile world” due to its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s “imperial-style foreign policy”.

He says that policy, designed to “restore Turkey’s Ottoman-era reach into the Arabian Middle East and the Balkans”, has left the country with no friends. Furthermore, Turkey cannot rely on the unconditional support of its traditional Western allies because of its president’s policies.

Today’s Turkey is at war on two fronts: Syria and Libya. The threat of a military confrontation with Russia in Syria is real over their conflicting agendas in the Syrian civil war. In Libya, Turkey and the militias it supports are battling the Moscow-supported Libyan National Army, led by Khalifa Haftar. What drives Erdogan to wage those wars? He simply is a bully who tries to intimidate his neighbours.

It all goes back to the ideas of his one-time ally, foreign policy adviser and Prime Minister, Professor Ahmet Davutoglu who came up with the ‘neo-Ottoman’ idea that envisaged a greater role for Turkey in the Middle East, which the Ottoman Empire once ruled, and the world.

'Zero problems with neighbours'

Davutoglu explained his grand scheme in his book, Strategic Depth. Erdogan liked the book so much he hired its author as foreign policy adviser in 2002. Davutoglu proposed a pro-active foreign policy with “zero problems with the neighbours”. He wanted Turkey to play an influential role based on cooperation with regional powers, but from a point of strength. He argued that his country could leverage that regional role in its relationship with the rest of the world. He wanted to do it smartly. By using its “geopolitical and geostrategic position”, Turkey can become a key regional as well as international player. He advocated ending decades-old problems with Turkey’s neighbours, such as Syria, Iran, and Egypt. However, he still wanted a good relationship with the West, particularly Nato.

Erdogan, meanwhile, sought a more confrontational strategy for the same objectives. His personal political style - the autocratic one man show - cast heavy shadow on Turkey’s endeavours to realise that much-sought dream. Davutoglu replaced Erdogan as Prime Minister in 2014, but resigned after only 20 months in office amid increasing differences between the president and his premier over the former’s plans to tighten his grip on power and his seemingly individualistic governing style.

Davutoglu stepped down but his ideas remain the guiding principles for Erdogan, who thought he could bully his way into achieving the Ottoman dream.

When the so-called Arab Spring began in early 2011, Erdogan, given his strong ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, saw the protests in the Arab world as a chance to advance the Brotherhood case in the region, under which he could emerge as the ultimate powerbroker. When the Brotherhood’s leader Mohammad Mursi took power in Egypt following the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the Turkish president was welcomed as a ‘hero of the revolution’ in Cairo. But when Mursi was ousted by mass protests in 2013, Erdogan saw it as a hostile move that placed Egypt on the top of his ‘enemy-list’.

Pro-Brotherhood

In Syria, he supported the mostly Islamist rebels with arms, training camps in Turkey and safe routes between his country and Syria. Istanbul is still today the de-facto headquarters of the Syrian pro-Brotherhood opposition.

And more recently in Libya, as the LNA moved to oust the rule of Islamist militia-backed government of Fayez Al Sarraj in Tripoli, Erdogan entered the scene quickly with his own Syrian militia and heavy weapons to support the embattled Al Sarraj. While Davutoglu proposed a greater role for Turkey with a more subtle foreign policy, Erdogan is chasing the same objective with arms and mercenaries. As he bullies his way around the region, the rest of the world is seemingly unable to comprehend what he wants.

Intimidating Europe

Another bullying tactic is his use of Syrian refugees (there more than 3 million of them inside Turkey) to intimidate Europe into agreeing with him to stop the Syrian army, supported by the Russians, from overrunning the last enclave of the opposition in the northwestern Idlib province. He threatens to ‘drown’ Europe with Syrian refugees by opening the until recently controlled borders with Turkey’s European neighbours.",JustBadNews,0
"China's coronavirus recovery is 'all fake,' whistleblowers and residents claim",http://news.yahoo.com/chinas-coronavirus-recovery-fake-whistleblowers-191300391.html?soc_src=hl-viewer&soc_trk=fb,"China's claims of how it's handling coronavirus recovery should be taken with more than a few grains of salt.

Even before COVID-19 became a global crisis, Chinese leaders had been criticized for their handling of the situation and lack of transparency about the disease's progression. Things now look like they're on the upswing, and businesses even appear to be headed back to work — but whistleblowers and local officials tell Caixan that's just a carefully crafted ruse.

Beijing has spent much of the outbreak pushing districts to carry on business as usual, with some local governments subsidizing electricity costs and even installing mandatory productivity quotas. Zhejiang, a province east of the epicenter city of Wuhan, claimed as of Feb. 24 it had restored 98.6 percent of its pre-coronavirus work capacity.

But civil servants tell Caixan that businesses are actually faking these numbers. Beijing had started checking Zhejiang businesses' electricity consumption levels, so district officials ordered the companies to start leaving their lights and machinery on all day to drive the numbers up, one civil servant said. Businesses have reportedly falsified staff attendance logs as well — they ""would rather waste a small amount of money on power than irritate local officials,"" Caixan writes.

In Wuhan, officials have tried to make it appear that recovery efforts are going smoothly. But when ""central leaders"" personally survey disinfecting regimens and food delivery, local officials ""make a special effort"" for them and them alone, one resident told Caixan. And in a video circulating on social media, residents can be seen shouting at visiting leaders from the apartments where they're being quarantined — ""Fake, it's all fake."" Read more at Caixan.

Mormon Church delivers stinging rebuke to BYU students with letter stating homosexual behavior is 'not compatible' with its principles,http://cnn.com/2020/03/05/us/byu-homosexual-behavior-not-compatible-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Just two weeks ago, LGBTQ students at Brigham Young University were cheering after the school deleted a section in its honor code that banned ""homosexual behavior."" But on Wednesday, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints poured cold water on their celebrations after it clarified that same-sex romantic behavior is still ""not compatible"" with BYU's principles.

The announcement came in a letter penned by Elder Paul V. Johnson, the commissioner of the church's educational system. It was sent to all the students and employees at Mormon-owned schools, according to BYU, which tweeted out the letter.

""The moral standards of the Church did not change with the recent release of the General Handbook or the updated Honor Code,"" Johnson wrote. ""Same-sex behavior cannot lead to eternal marriage and is therefore not compatible with the principles included in the Honor Code.""

The code had previously prohibited ""all forms of physical intimacy that gives expression to homosexual feelings."" If same-sex couples were seen hugging, holding hands, kissing or dating in public, they'd risk an investigation by the feared Honor Code Office, as well as punishment at their church or expulsion from school.

Dry ice poured into pool killed 3 people at Russian influencer's party,http://insider.com/three-people-died-russian-influencer-party-dry-ice-pool-2020-3,"Three people died in Moscow on Friday after dry ice was poured into a swimming pool at the birthday party of Yekaterina Didenko, an Instagram influencer, the BBC reported.

Didenko's husband is said to be among the three people who died in the incident.

The BBC reported that the dry ice was dumped into a pool to help partygoers cool off after leaving a sauna.

But other reports say the dry ice may have been poured into the pool to create ""visual effects.""

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

Three people died Friday after dry ice was poured into a swimming pool at a party in Moscow, according to the BBC.

The party was hosted by Yekaterina Didenko, an Instagram influencer who was celebrating her 29th birthday at a pool complex, the BBC reported.

Didenko's husband is said to be one of the three people who died.

Guests of the party reportedly choked and several lost consciousness when they entered the pool. Dry ice is a solid form of carbon dioxide, which can suffocate people if there isn't proper ventilation.

It was not immediately clear why the dry ice was poured into the pool at the party venue.

The BBC reported that the ice was meant to cool the swimming-pool water to help guests cool off after exiting a sauna. The Daily Mail and the AFP news agency via The Moscow Times reported that the dry ice might have been put into the pool to create visual effects.

A New York State Department of Health web page about the dangers of dry ice says that symptoms of overexposure to dry ice include ""headache and difficulty breathing, and with greater exposure, nausea and vomiting.""

The Department of Health page also states that if enough carbon dioxide gas is present, a person can lose consciousness or die.

On Friday, Didenko posted an Instagram photo for her birthday. Following the party, Didenko apparently shared a video on Instagram indicating that her husband was at intensive care, the BBC reported.

Bernie as bad as coronavirus?! CNN host compares 'unstoppable' Sanders to deadly disease (VIDEO),http://rt.com/usa/482033-cnn-sanders-coronavirus-unstoppable/,"Radio personality and CNN host Michael Smerconish thought it fitting to compare Bernie Sanders and his surge in the Democratic polls to the coronavirus outbreak. The remark has sparked massive online anger and a storm of mockery.

Smerconish made the outlandish comparison while discussing the prospects of the Democratic forerunner in South Carolina – the last of the four early states – which is voting in the Democratic primaries on Saturday.

“Can either coronavirus or Bernie Sanders be stopped?” the host wondered.

The comparison between Sanders and the virus – which has killed nearly 3,000 globally – was apparently deemed to be fine by the network, since it also appeared in the channel’s chyron.

The presenter’s ‘unconventional’ way of describing Sanders’ solid lead in the Democratic polls has since been met with an overwhelmingly negative reaction online, with many condemning the remark’s extremely poor taste.

Even the ever-reliable anti-Semitism card has been invoked, with critics arguing that the comparison of a Jewish candidate to a virus closely resembles the propaganda purveyed by Nazi Germany. Ironically, Sanders’ opponents have repeatedly accused the candidate of being an anti-Semite over his criticism of Israel’s policies and support for the creation of a Palestinian state.

Trump rallies his base to treat coronavirus as a 'hoax',http://politico.eu/article/trump-rallies-his-base-to-treat-coronavirus-as-a-hoax/,"NORTH CHARLESTON, South Carolina — President Donald Trump on Friday night tried to cast the global outbreak of the coronavirus as a liberal conspiracy intended to undermine his first term, lumping it alongside impeachment and the Mueller investigation.

He blamed the press for acting hysterically about the virus, which has now spread to China, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and the U.S, and he downplayed its dangers, saying against expert opinion it was on par with the flu.

“The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. They’re politicizing it,” he said. “They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russian.’ That did not work out too well. They could not do it. They tried the impeachment hoax.”

Then Trump called the coronavirus “their new hoax.”

Trump’s comments came as the White House has struggled to adequately respond to and contain the coronavirus’ increasingly sweeping path. At the rally — held here on the eve of the Democratic primary in South Carolina — he sought to manage Americans’ expectations about the White House’s ability to fight it.

By undermining the news reporting on the virus and by trying to hold liberals responsible for a potential public health crisis that has little to do with politics, Trump did what he often does best: He sought to deflect blame at a time when many Americans sought leadership and scientific facts.

After Trump had downplayed the risks of coronavirus, he reassured supporters that the White House was “magnificently organized” in fighting it. In fact, Trump’s administration spent the week jockeying among themselves to lead the response, while the stock market tumbled with losses not seen since the global financial recession. White House officials and the president grew so concerned this week that Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the response effort, swapping out his beleaguered health secretary.

None of that came up on Friday night, as Trump trash-talked his Democratic opponents in 2020 and characterized the coronavirus as the latest issue touching on border security.

“Whether it is the virus that we’re talking about or many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and well-being of all Americans. Now, you see it with the coronavirus. You see it. You see it with the coronavirus. You see that. When you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in, it’s not the only thing that comes in through the border and we are setting records now at the order,” Trump said.

Earlier in the week, the Trump administration tried to allay Americans’ concerns about the virus by downplaying the coronavirus’s seriousness. Trump also congratulated himself for shutting down flights between the U.S. and China.

But by the end of the week, White House officials including the president had shifted to pushing back against anyone who expressed too much concern about the virus or its effect on the economy, repeatedly blaming the Democrats and the media for the growing concerns and the steep drop in the stock market amid the uncertainty.

“It’s the unknown, you know, they look at it, and they say how long will this last. I think they’re not very happy with the Democrat candidates when they see them, and I think that has an impact,” Trump said at the White House on Friday afternoon before traveling to the campaign rally.

Top White House officials kept up the same mantra all day Friday.

The director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow told reporters that “people should not overreact” from investors to everyday Americans. “Given what we know factually, it looks to me like the market had gone too far,” Kudlow said.

Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney talked about the ongoing coverage of the coronavirus as an attempt by the media to politically damage the president during an election year.

Health officials, meanwhile, spent the last two days trying to determine how a California resident became infected with coronavirus and who else the patient may have exposed to it. This was the first potential case of coronavirus in the U.S. that had not been contracted from traveling abroad and a potential sign that it could spread throughout the U.S.

That wasn’t the message on Air Force One on the flight down to South Carolina, with the televisions turned to Fox News. In the bubble the president travels in, the TV headlines told the world the president had a “firm grasp” on the coronavirus and that Democrats tried to score “political points” on it.",JustBadNews,0
"Iran coronavirus death toll rises to 34: health ministry. Thirty-four people have died so far in Iran because of coronavirus infections, a health ministry spokesman said on Friday.",https://reuters.com/article/us-china-health-iran/iran-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-34-health-ministry-idUSKCN20M1GQ,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Friday announced a three-day nationwide school closure as officials warned the country faced a “difficult week” in fighting a coronavirus outbreak that has killed 34 people.

The Islamic Republic had already cancelled Friday prayers in the capitals of 23 of its 31 provinces because of the outbreak, including in Tehran and the Shi’ite Muslim holy cities of Qom and Mashhad.

“We have a relatively difficult week ahead ... as we see the trend, the main peak of the disease will be in the next week and coming days,” Health Minister Saeed Namaki said on state television.

“Based on assessments it was felt that there was a need for closing all the schools in the country and for this reason all the schools in the country will be closed for three days starting from tomorrow,” Namaki said.

The health ministry’s spokesman, Kianush Jahanpur, went on state television to announce the latest death toll, the highest outside China, and said another 388 people were infected with the virus.

The vast majority of infections were in three provinces: Tehran, 128, Qom, 88, and Gilan, 65, according to a map published by the official IRNA news agency.

“We have tough but manageable days ahead. We all should take prevention, containment and treatment more seriously,” First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said on Twitter.

Those infected include Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi and Masoumeh Ebtekar, vice president for women and family affairs, and two members of parliament, where sessions have been suspended indefinitely, according to IRNA.

In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States had offered to help with the coronavirus response in Iran, and raised doubts about Tehran’s willingness to share information.

There was no immediate Iranian reaction to the U.S. offer of help.

The Islamic Republic is the only country in the Gulf region that has reported deaths from the coronavirus, which has spread from China, but people have been infected in Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

Five new cases reported on Friday in Bahrain took the total diagnosed with the coronavirus there to 38, and two new cases reported by Kuwait took the total infected there to 45.

All those infected in Bahrain and Kuwait had travelled to Iran or were contaminated by people who went there, according to officials in the two Gulf Arab states.

The United Arab Emirates has granted Iran permission to send a handful of flights to Dubai to fly home Iranians stranded at airports after flight cancellations, the ISNA news agency reported, citing information from Iran’s consulate in Dubai.

Saudi Arabia has reported no deaths or infections and has tightened travel restrictions to try to prevent it spreading across its borders.

The United States asked its military in Saudi Arabia to avoid crowded venues including malls and cinemas as coronavirus was reported spreading in neighbouring countries, according to a document from the U.S. embassy seen by Reuters on Friday.

Oman on Friday restricted the entry of citizens from other Gulf Arab states who had previously been able to enter by showing national identification cards.",JustBadNews,0
Clive Cussler has passed away at 88.,http://nytimes.com/2020/02/26/books/clive-cussler-dead.html,"Mr. Cussler also connected with readers by turning his love for scuba diving into an oceanic lifestyle that paralleled and validated his superhero.

He first created the National Underwater and Marine Agency as a fictional government organization that employed his hero in the Dirk Pitt books. Then, in 1979, he founded an actual National Underwater and Marine Agency as a private nonprofit group committed to “preserving maritime heritage through the discovery, archaeological survey and conservation of shipwreck artifacts.” It underwrote his maritime ventures.

With Mr. Cussler leading expeditions and joining dives, the organization eventually located some 60 wrecks. Among them were the Cunard steamship Carpathia, first to reach survivors of the lost Titanic on April 15, 1912, then itself sunk by German torpedoes off Ireland in 1918; Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt’s coastal steamer Lexington, which caught fire and went down in Long Island Sound in 1840; and Manassas, the Confederacy’s first Civil War ironclad, sunk in battle in the Lower Mississippi in 1862.

His first nonfiction book, “The Sea Hunters” (1996, with Craig Dirgo), was an account of his NUMA exploits, some of which were portrayed in television documentaries featuring Mr. Cussler as narrator. Valuable artifacts raised by his expeditions were given to museums or governments.

Mr. Cussler, who named his franchise hero after his son Dirk, acknowledged that Dirk Pitt’s character was his own alter ego. His later novels, many co-written by his son or others, often included himself as a character who saves the day. His son, a daughter and friends were also used as characters in his books.

“I’ve been doing Dirk Pitt for 30 years,” Mr. Cussler told The Times in 2000. “Maybe I can find another writer down the line to take him over. It’s not the money; it’s the fans.

“I’d like to retire,” he continued. “I’m toying with the idea of Pitt having a son who shows up. He’s getting a little long in the tooth. When we started out, we were both 36 years old. Now he’s a little over 40, and I’m pushing 70.”",JustBadNews,0
Pope Francis sick a day after supporting coronavirus sufferers,http://news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/pope-francis-sick-a-day-after-supporting-coronavirus-sufferers/news-story/e9ffeed4e3cb27a0b3db5d820a786c41,"Pope Francis has come down with a “slight indisposition,” forcing him to cancel a planned Mass in Rome, just a day after he expressed his solidarity with coronavirus sufferers around the world.

Pope Francis has come down with a “slight indisposition,” forcing him to cancel a planned Mass in Rome, just a day after he expressed his solidarity with coronavirus sufferers around the world — and as the disease continues to spread across Italy.

The illness has forced the 82-year-old pontiff to nix a penitential Mass, marking the start of Lent, that he’d planned to celebrate at the St. John Lateran Basilica across town with Roman clergy, the Vatican said.

Francis will proceed with the rest of his planned work Thursday, but “preferred to stay near Santa Marta,” the Vatican hotel where he lives, officials said.

The Vatican has not specified the nature of the pope’s illness, but he was seen coughing and blowing his nose during Ash Wednesday Mass, the New York Post reports.

Meanwhile, 400 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy, and 12 people have died. Most of the cases have been reported in northern Italy.

Three cases were reported in Rome, but each person has already recovered.

During a General Audience in St. Peter’s Square on Ash Wednesday, the pope expressed his support for coronavirus sufferers.

“I wish, again, to express my closeness to those who are ill with coronavirus and to health care workers who are caring for them,” he said, according to Vatican News.

Francis has not specifically met with coronavirus sufferers, but shook hands with the faithful in the front row during the audience. He also kissed a baby during his Popemobile spin through St. Peter’s Square and greeted visiting bishops.

But the clergy members appeared to refrain from kissing his ring or embracing him as they normally would.

How Alabama blocked a man from voting because he owed $4,http://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/27/alabama-voting-rights-alfonzo-tucker,"Alfonzo Tucker Jr is just one of millions of Americans who have been entangled in a racially biased system – and deprived of their democratic right

In 2018, with the midterm elections approaching, Alfonzo Tucker Jr was particularly eager to vote. The mayor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Tucker’s hometown, was running for governor, and the year before he had canvassed for Doug Jones, a Democrat running in a closely watched US Senate race.

But Tucker wasn’t able to cast a ballot – state officials refused to even let him register. It wasn’t until weeks later that he learned why he had been deprived of the right to vote.

He owed the state $4.

The US is founded on the promise of democracy and fair representation, but it is also the country where minorities are frequently disenfranchised for political gain. Among the most vulnerable are millions of Americans, disproportionately African Americans, like Tucker, who have been entangled in America’s racially biased criminal justice system, and lose civil liberties like voting as a result.

The barriers facing Americans like Tucker, advocates say, are modern adaptations of poll taxes and other devices which were designed to keep people from the voting booths during the Jim Crow era – when white politicians used the law to curb the civil rights of African Americans. Alabama is one of 30 states that requires people with felony convictions to pay back the financial obligations associated with their sentence before they can vote again.

Tucker’s case is particularly glaring. He lives less than a hundred miles north-west of Selma, the birthplace of the voting rights movement in America. This week, civil rights leaders are commemorating the 55th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches led by Martin Luther King Jr and civil rights activists as they protested against laws preventing African Americans from voting. Many were brutally beaten in Selma during the protests.

The specific policy that had ensnared Tucker dates back to the turn of the 20th century when Alabama leaders, openly seeking to preserve white supremacy, stripped anyone convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude”, among other offenses, of the right to vote.

“What is it that we want to do? Why, it is within the limits imposed by the federal constitution, to establish white supremacy in this state,” John Knox, the chair of the convention, said at the time. “If we would have white supremacy, we must establish it by law – not by force or fraud,” he added.

Tucker said the legacy of that discrimination affects the lives of people like him today.

“I read about the challenges during the 60s, 50s, that black people had to overcome just to vote,” Tucker said. “It’s the same thing going on in 2020.”

***

Tucker, who sometimes goes by Zo, speaks softly and deliberately. He has lived in Tuscaloosa his whole life, now in a modest house 10 minutes outside of downtown. He says he would have left the city where he grew up, but never had the money.

Sitting in his living room, surrounded by pictures of family, Tucker said things are much different now for him than they were in the early 1990s, when he was much more “aggressive”. In the late 1980s, he got into a fight at a club with a University of Alabama football player and wound up being convicted of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. A few years later, he fought with a police officer and was convicted of second-degree assault, a felony. He wound up going to prison for two years and serving several more on probation.

After he got out of prison, Tucker rebuilt his life, working at steel factories and in maintenance, and chipping away at the approximately $1,600 that the court had ordered him to pay. He had two more children, which made him want to stay out of trouble. He joined the Nation of Islam.

Before his conviction, Tucker had never voted. But in prison, Tucker had read about Medgar Evers, who fought for equal citizenship and was assassinated in Mississippi in 1963. When he got out, he started regularly voting in elections. He and his wife Narkita would bring his young children into the voting booth with them, wanting to teach them about the importance of a single vote, and the long struggle African Americans had faced to gain access to the ballot.

But in 2013, Tucker got a letter from his state officials saying he could no longer vote.

He was angry and upset, but didn’t act immediately – the letter didn’t tell him anything about how to get his voting rights back. Then came another letter, a few years later, this time addressed to his son, Alfonzo Tucker III, who had just turned 18, and claiming that he too was ineligible to vote. The younger Tucker, however, didn’t have a criminal record. It was a mistake, possibly because he shared his father’s name.

Tucker got his son registered to vote, but the episode lit a fire in him. As the 2018 midterm elections approached, he went to an event where activists were helping people with felony convictions learn about their voting rights, and called up the Alabama board of pardons and paroles to talk about his case. Two weeks later, the board sent him a letter saying he still owed $135.10 in connection with his conviction.

Tucker, who relies in part on disability income, borrowed money from his sister to pay off the debt. But just when he thought it was settled, a courthouse clerk told him he owed money for another decades-old criminal offense – an additional $5,535.47 which she said he had to pay back to gain back his vote.

Faced with the staggering amount, Tucker contacted Blair Bowie, an attorney at Campaign Legal Center, a Washington DC voting rights group. It took Bowie 15 minutes to realize Alabama officials made a huge mistake.

Under Alabama law, people with felonies only have to pay off the money originally assessed as part of their criminal conviction to regain their voting rights. By 2018, Tucker had paid back most of what he owed. But, unbeknown to him, the state had added an additional debt of $131.10, a fee that was irrelevant to whether he could vote because it was not part of his original conviction. And the $5,535.47 debt was from a misdemeanor offense, Bowie saw, which does not cause someone to lose their voting rights in Alabama.

All that Tucker actually owed in order to vote was $4.

“What is voter suppression if not officials wrongly telling you that you can’t vote?” Bowie said. “That’s been a classic way of disenfranchising people, particularly in Alabama.”

After he paid the $135.10, Tucker drove two hours to Montgomery, the state capitol, with a friend to hand-deliver the receipt to a staffer at the board of pardons and paroles.

But weeks later he had not heard anything back. The elections came and went, and Tucker couldn’t vote. The parole board declined to comment on Tucker’s case.

***

Bowie eventually referred Tucker to John Paul Taylor, an organizer with the Southern Poverty Law Center, who followed up with the board and got Tucker registered to vote in 2019.

Bowie and Taylor said Tucker shouldn’t have had to rely on experts to get his voting rights back.

“Here’s a very clear example of a person who has jumped through every single hoop that you’ve given them and they’re still being denied because of something that they really don’t even know about,” Taylor said.

Meanwhile, Tucker and Bill Foster, the friend he went to Montgomery with, helped start a group in Tuscaloosa to assist people with felonies get their voting rights back. Tucker’s story helps people understand that they can in fact vote once they complete their sentence, said Larry Tucker, his cousin. And Alfonzo said he’s met other people who have wrongly been told they owe the state money.

So far, Tucker estimates that they’ve been able to help about 10 people – people like Terrance Gray, 49, who learned he was eligible to vote last year. Gray believed he had been ineligible to vote since he was released from prison in 1996.

“He told me that it will make a difference if more people go and vote,” Gray said of Tucker. “He’s always been on me about that.”

Tucker plans to cast his first ballot since the ordeal this year (he says he likes Bernie Sanders). He thinks the state should give him back the extra $131.10 that he paid.",JustBadNews,0
Israel's Netanyahu pulls his punches after Sanders calls him a racist,http://malaymail.com/news/world/2020/02/27/israels-netanyahu-pulls-his-punches-after-sanders-calls-him-a-racist/1841319,"Isreali Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the Kohelet Policy Forum conference in Jerusalem, January 8, 2020. — AFP pic

JERUSALEM, Feb 27 — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday Bernie Sanders was wrong to call him a racist during a debate among contenders for the US Democratic presidential nomination, but shied away from attacking the senator in return.

“I am not intervening in the US election,” Netanyahu replied when asked on Israeli Army Radio about what an interviewer termed Sanders' personal attack on him at Tuesday's event in Charleston, South Carolina.

Sanders, who has been critical of the right-wing leader's policy towards Palestinians, described Netanyahu as “a reactionary racist who is now running” Israel.

Pressed further for his thoughts about Sanders, who if elected would be the first Jewish president in US history, Netanyahu said: “What I think about this matter is that he is definitely wrong. No question about it.”

Asked about possible confrontation with Sanders should the self-described democratic socialist win the White House, Netanyahu said that as prime minister he had stood up to US presidential opposition to his policies before and would be able to do so again.

Netanyahu had a contentious relationship with Barack Obama, Republican Donald Trump's predecessor as president, with the Iranian nuclear deal and Israel's settlement policy in the occupied West Bank main areas of friction.

Israel's longest-serving leader, Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival in a national election on Monday, the country's third in less than a year after inconclusive ballots in April and September.

During the campaign, Netanyahu has steered clear of commenting directly on the US election.

But he has praised Trump as the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House, noting the president's decisions to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the US embassy to the city.

Netanyahu has also tried to play on many Israelis' suspicions about the loyalty of Israel's 21 per cent Arab minority, political analysts say.

The right-wing Likud party leader says his main challenger, former general Benny Gantz, would need the support of an Arab party to form a governing coalition, effectively tying his hands in pursuing any military action in the region.

The tactic forced Gantz to deny that a government led by his centrist Blue and White party would rely on the Joint List, an Arab coalition mostly supported by descendants of Palestinians who lived in what became Israel after its creation in 1948.

Israel's Arab community has long accused Netanyahu, in power from 1996-1999 and since 2009, of fear-mongering. On election day in 2015 Netanyahu urged his voters to turn out, warning that Arabs were flocking to the polls ""in droves.""

Show Caption Hide Caption Will temperatures continue to rise in the U.S.? If you think it's hot now, just wait. Heat waves are becoming more frequent globally. But how do we measure heat waves? We explain.

No region of the world will be left unaffected.

Climate change is a pressing risk to national and global security.

The report recommends ""quickly reducing and phasing out greenhouse gas emissions.""

Climate change could turn into a ""catastrophic"" threat to national and global security in the coming decades, warns a report released Monday.

""Even at scenarios of low warming, each region of the world will face severe risks to national and global security in the next three decades,"" the report says. ""Higher levels of warming will pose catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks over the course of the 21st century.""

The report, titled “A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change: How Likely Warming Scenarios Indicate a Catastrophic Security Future,"" was released by the Center for Climate and Security, a nonpartisan security policy institute.

To avoid such dire impacts, the report recommends ""quickly reducing and phasing out greenhouse gas emissions.""

Human-caused climate change, aka global warming, is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. This has caused the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors, scientists say.

The globe has warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since preindustrial times, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.

Climate change: Why Trump’s panel on climate science is controversial President Trump’s pick for leading a climate change panel is notorious for denying the science behind human-caused global warming. We dive into the counter-arguments on climate change.

The report identifies major threats, including heightened social and political instability and risks to U.S. military missions and infrastructure, as well as security institutions across all regions of the world.

In North America, under a low-warming scenario (1.8 to 3.6 degrees by 2050), the region ""will experience more intense, extreme events like storms and wildfires, with significant impacts on life, property, security infrastructure and democratic institutions,"" the report said.

""The assessment is clear – climate change is a pressing risk to national and global security and will evolve to become a severe and systemic threat the more we allow global temperatures to rise,"" said report co-author Sherri Goodman, a former deputy undersecretary of defense.

""Our panel's analysis shows that no region of the world will be left unaffected, and climate impacts will interact in dangerous ways in even near-term, lower levels of warming,"" Goodman said.

The report says, ""Climate change will present significant threats to U.S. military missions across all of its geographic areas of responsibility as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure that are critical for maintaining global security.""

In addition to phasing out fossil fuels, the report says, ""the world must also 'climate-proof' environments, infrastructure, institutions and systems on which human security depends."" In the USA, ""we call for renewed efforts to prioritize, communicate and respond to climate security threats.""

Report co-author Rod Schoonover of the Center for Climate and Security said, ""It’s the job of the U.S. intelligence community to anticipate risks to national security and provide strategic warning to appropriate policymakers.

""The science has long been clear, and the security community is adding compelling analysis of the threats climate change poses to people and nations. It’s long past time for vigorous action to address them,"" he said.",JustBadNews,0
Italy put 12 towns on coronavirus lockdown after 215 cases and 5 deaths made it the most-infected country outside of Asia,http://businessinsider.com/coronavirus-italy-spread-death-toll-tries-to-control-5-2020-2,"Italy is scrambling to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus within its borders as cases of COVID-19 soar.

Italy has the most cases outside of Asia. As of Wednesday evening, 12 people there had died from the disease.

The country has put almost a dozen towns under lockdown, canceled major sporting events, and debated closing its borders with neighboring countries.

The two most infected regions are Lombardy and Veneto in the north of Italy, home to Milan and Venice. New cases are also being reported in southern Italy.

Italy is scrambling to fight a coronavirus outbreak after a sharp spike in cases and deaths made it the worst-hit country outside of Asia.

As of Wednesday evening, 12 people in Italy had died from the virus. Italian authorities reported at least 400 cases of COVID-19 in the country, according to the BBC.

All the people who have died in Italy were elderly or had other health complications, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica and the Associated Press reported.

The country has put 11 towns on lockdown to contain the virus' spread.

The two most infected regions are Lombardy and Veneto in the north, which contain the major cities of Milan and Venice. But the virus has also spread farther south, with regions including Tuscany and the island of Sicily also reporting cases on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced an emergency plan to quarantine towns late on Saturday, locking down the settlements by blocking most travel to and from them. He said the quarantine could last for weeks, the BBC reported.

Italian officials estimated on Monday that about 100,000 people in the country were affected by the travel restrictions. Schools, museums, and theaters across the region have been closed.

Police officers and members of the armed forces have been given the authority to enforce the lockdown, the BBC reported.

On Tuesday, Conte warned against panic and defended the country's response to the virus.

""Obviously I can't say I'm not worried because I don't want anyone to think we're underestimating this emergency,"" he said, according to the AP. ""But we trust that with the measures we've implemented there will be a containing effect in the coming days.""

He also told La Repubblica that ""we need to stop panic.""

Empty carnivals, fashion shows, and soccer stadiums

The virus has prompted the cancelation of the annual Venice Carnival and the closing of some major landmarks.

The fashion house Giorgio Armani also held its runway show at Milan Fashion Week in an empty theater as a precaution.

Major soccer games have been played in empty stadiums, including the clash between the league leaders Juventus and Inter Milan on Sunday.

Photos show stores packed with shoppers and shelves rapidly emptying.

Neighboring countries are worried

Italy's north has open borders with France, Austria, Switzerland, and Slovenia.

Italians or people who recently visited Italy have tested positive for the coronavirus in Algeria, Austria, Brazil, Croatia, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Switzerland, Reuters reported Wednesday.

Matteo Salvini, the former deputy prime minister of the country who leads the far-right Northern League party, called for the country's borders to be closed, but Conte dismissed the idea at a Saturday press conference.

""I don't think the conditions for such a move exist at this point,"" Conte said, according to Politico.

The European Union said on Monday that it was not considering any travel suspensions within the bloc's border-free area, also known as the Schengen Area.

France warned anyone visiting the Lombardy and Veneto regions to wear face masks, regularly check their temperature, and avoid nonessential travel, the AP reported.

Officials in France and Austria are monitoring their borders for visitors from Italy who could be carrying the virus, according to the AP. Ireland has also advised its citizens not to travel to affected areas of Italy, and the UK told people to avoid ""all but essential"" travel to affected towns.

Romania's health ministry on Sunday said all Romanian citizens coming back from Lombardy and Veneto would be quarantined for 14 days, Politico reported.

Austria temporarily halted rail traffic across its border with Italy on Sunday but later recommenced it.

Trains traveling out of the country from the north of Italy may also face delays and cancellations as train companies perform health checks, sanitize train carriages, and expect reduced demand for travel, La Repubblica reported.

The EU urged coordination during the outbreak

The EU on Monday said it was monitoring the spread of the coronavirus ""around the clock"" and said it would spend 232 million euros, or $252 million, to try to prevent a global outbreak.

Stella Kyriakides, the EU's Health Commissioner, told reporters Wednesday that EU countries have to have a coordinated response to tackling the virus.

""All member states need to inform us of their preparedness plans,"" she said, according to Reuters. ""Diverging approaches across the EU should be avoided.""

The coronavirus, thought to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has now infected more than 80,000 people and spread to at least 40 other countries, though most only have a handful of cases.

France recorded its first death from the coronavirus on Wednesday, though authorities say they do not yet know how or where the person contracted the virus.

Surfer fought off great white shark by punching it and telling it to 'f*** off',http://news.sky.com/story/surfer-fought-off-great-white-shark-by-punching-it-and-telling-it-to-f-off-11941050,"A surfer has told how he fought off a great white shark by punching it in the eye after it attacked him.

Nick Minogue, from the New Zealand city of Auckland, was bitten by the shark on Saturday at Pauanui Beach in the country's Coromandel region.

He told the NZ Herald: ""I was just paddling along and got hit on the side of my elbow and forearm.

""By the time I realised what was going on, its teeth were definitely latched on to the front section of the board.""

Mr Minogue, 60, said he had heard sharks don't like being punched in the nose or eye.

""So I actually shouted at it 'f***off!' and went to punch it in the eye and missed,"" he said.

""Then I pulled my fist back and shouted 'f*** off!' again and got it right smack bang in the eye. It's quite a big eye, about three knuckles across, and its eye kind of looked up and rolled up.

""In between the two punches it crunched down a bit more on the board and then disengaged its teeth, got its jaws off and then I got brushed by the dorsal fin and the tail fin and swam off.""

Mr Minogue said he had been alone in the water apart from a German surfer closer to shore, who heard him screaming before the two paddled as fast as they could to get out of the water.

Mr Minogue said: ""It was a grey shark with a white bottom, probably a great white. It was a big head and jaw. I kind of sat up in shock and decided to hit it. That was the only thing to do.""

Experts told the newspaper that the bite marks on Mr Minogue's surf board and his description led them to conclude the shark had been a great white.

Pauanui surf life-saving club captain Stuart Upjohn had also been on the beach and told Radio NZ: ""It turned out he was actually fine but just a bit shaken. [We] had a good look at his surfboard and it had a good bite mark in it.""

Mr Minogue was left with a cut on his arm but said his full-length wetsuit saved him from further injury.

""There was blood dripping out the sleeve of my wetsuit. Thankfully it wasn't too deep. Two teeth put holes in my wetsuit but only one punctured the skin,"" Mr Minogue said.

""I've still got an arm and fingers, it could have been a lot worse.""",JustBadNews,0
BBC hit with 115 complaints after Father Ted creator compares transgender children to 'Nazi experiments',http://metro.co.uk/2020/02/21/bbc-hit-115-complaints-father-ted-creator-compares-transgender-children-nazi-experiments-12280898/,"The BBC has been hit with viewer complaints after Father Ted creator Graham Linehan compared doctors treating transgender children to Nazis experimenting on kids in concentration camps.

The comedy writer appeared on the show to discuss why he had become involved in a public row with some members of the transgender community.

The 51-year-old was challenged about his controversial comments by Sarah Smith during an interview on Newsnight on 10 February.

According to the BBC complaints report which is published fortnightly, the BBC Two channel received 115 complaints because of the following, ‘Bias against Graham Linehan / felt Graham Linehan’s views on the transgender community were offensive.’

The interview began with Sarah questioning Graham on why he has made the trans debate ‘his issue’.

‘You say you have been vilified, and have even lost work because of speaking out in this trans debate,’ she began.

The 51-year-old was challenged about his controversial comments by Sarah Smith (Picture: BBC)

‘You’re not a trans person and you’re not a woman, so why have you made this your issue?’

He responded: ‘The main reason is, women can speak about this, I’ll admit I am not a great person to speak about this, I am a comedy writer and I am very blunt.

‘The thing is there are a lot of women, like Kathleen Stock, academics who are very compassionate but who protect their boundaries and the boundaries of young lesbians and women in general.

‘They do so in a respectful and quiet way, but when they are asked to speak, they get shut down. Kathleen Stock had a freedom of information request about her emails, it is insane the amount of abuse and harassment they face. So I thought I’d step in.’

The Father Ted creator tried to defend his controversial comments (Picture: BBC)

The journalist interrupted as she asked: ‘But has stepping in made the debate any better? They have said the language you have used has increased the toxicity. What about comparing people in the trans debate to speaking out against Nazis?’

The Father Ted writer defended his comments as he continued: ‘There are a couple of parallels, one is at the moment children are being experimented on with puberty blockers.’

Before he could finish his statement Sarah interjected: ‘Come on you’re not seriously trying to say that children going to the doctor and saying they’re worried about their gender is the same to children being experimented on in Nazi concentration camps?’

Graham answered: ‘I am afraid I am.’

Later in the interview, he tried to go back on his comments as he added: ‘No, no, no, don’t get me wrong, I’m not comparing it to Nazi concentration camps.’

‘That’s basically what you said, wasn’t it? Experimenting on children is what the Nazis did and what doctors are doing today?’ the journalist responded.

He continued: ‘Well, essentially, if you look at the Tavistock [and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, which offers gender identity service], 35 psychologists have quit the Tavistock in three years.

‘One of the other things that Tavistock whistleblowers reported was that homophobic parents were bringing in their gender non-conforming kids and telling them to fix them.

‘There was a dark joke that went around Tavistock that in a couple of years there would be no gay people left. That’s why I compare it to eugenics programmes and things like that. It is extremely serious.’

No trans person appeared on the programme, nor any doctor who has treated trans people. However, the BBC explained that LGBT+ rights charity Stonewall had been invited on the programme but declined, instead they did provide a comment.

Helen Belcher, co-founder of Trans Media Watch – a UK charity dedicated to improving media coverage of trans and intersex issues – told Pink News: ‘The BBC did a reasonably good job of challenging Linehan’s stance, but that doesn’t make up for the bias they have displayed in reporting on trans issues over recent months.

‘Trans people are too often talked about rather than talked with, and it is clear from the piece framing the Graham Linehan discussion that the BBC still lacks basic knowledge of trans lives and the law affecting us.’

India cracks down on use of VPNs in Kashmir to get around social media ban,http://reuters.com/article/us-india-kashmir-internet/india-cracks-down-on-use-of-vpns-in-kashmir-to-get-around-social-media-ban-idUSKBN20D0LT?utm_source=reddit.com,"SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Authorities in Indian Kashmir are cracking down on virtual private network (VPN) apps used to circumvent a months-long ban on social media, police said, as part of a broader effort to quell unrest over the withdrawal of the region’s autonomy.

Social networks such as Facebook FB.O, WhatsApp and Instagram are still blocked, even after the government restored limited mobile data service and the internet in Kashmir, so residents use VPNs or proxy servers to bypass the restrictions.

Police said many VPN users were trying to stir trouble in Kashmir and were liable to face action.

“We have identified 100 social media users and are in the process of identifying more users for misuse of social media, for disseminating fake and false secessionist, anti-India propaganda,” said Kashmir cyber police chief Tahir Ashraf.

Police have filed a case against social media users who are using proxy servers to access messaging networks and stir up anti-India propaganda, a spokesman said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government revoked special privileges from Muslim-majority Kashmir in August in a bid to draw the region closer to India and end a 30-year revolt.

It detained hundreds of people and imposed a communications blackout, saying the actions were needed to prevent people from organizing street protests. On Wednesday, security forces killed three militants in the Tral area of Kashmir.

Through VPNs, users can route the data connection of a smartphone or a laptop through a private server instead of the local internet service provider’s network. That allows the user to access sites that are locally blocked.

Adil Altaf, 37, a businessman in Kashmir’s main city, Srinagar, said he had downloaded a dozen VPN apps on his cellphone.

“They go on blocking, I will go on shifting to other VPNs,” he said.

Saleema Jan, who lives in Kashmir, said she had used a proxy server for a video chat with to her son, who is in college in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh.

Modi’s government has frequently curbed access to the internet in Kashmir and other parts of the country, including briefly in the capital, New Delhi, amid growing protests against a new citizenship law.

As of 2018, India led the world in internet shutdowns, according to a report by internet advocacy group Access Now, accounting for 67% of the total recorded worldwide.

A Jammu and Kashmir telecom official said teams of software engineers were working to disrupt VPNs use in Kashmir.

“It is an ongoing process. We block some and they come up with more. It is like a cat-and-mouse game,” he added, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.",JustBadNews,0

Australian Defense Force: Soldiers warned they have 'no place in our Army' if displaying white supremacy hand gestures,http://msn.com/en-au/news/australia/soldiers-warned-they-have-no-place-in-our-army-if-displaying-white-supremacy-hand-gestures/ar-BB108aYs?ocid=ientp,"© Getty Australiam army. Australian soldiers are being warned they will be immediately suspended from active duty, and possibly kicked out of the Army, if caught making white supremacist hand gestures.

The Army has issued an extraordinary directive to all unit commanders instructing them on how to deal with officers or soldiers found to be displaying racist ""hand symbology"" in photos.

It follows the increasing global usage of the so-called ""white power"" hand sign, in which the thumb and index finger touch, while the other fingers of the hand are held outstretched to roughly resemble a ""W"" and a ""P"".

According to the Anti-Defamation League, the overwhelming purpose of the hand gesture is still to signify ""OK"" but is now also widely used by white supremacists.

The ABC has obtained a document sent by Defence Forces Command last year warning any individual who engages in such behaviour has ""no place in our Army"".

© Getty Australian army. That warning came in the same month that the man charged over the Christchurch massacre made the white power symbol while being led into the dock of a New Zealand court.

""To date, two soldiers in the last week have made a white supremacy symbol in photographs,"" the directive sent in March 2019 reveals.

Unit commanders and ""subordinate commanders"" are instructed to initiate ""suspension from duty action"" if they have ""sufficient material"" to suspect an Army member has engaged in the activity.

Commanders are advised that ""if, after considering evidence collected by investigation or fact-finding"" they're satisfied that a gesture ""associated with racial hatred or extremist hate groups"" has been made, ""termination action is to be initiated"".

© Getty Australian army. Despite the crackdown, the Defence Department has told the ABC to date ""no Army member has been terminated as a result of displaying a white supremacy symbol in public"".

""An ADF member found to be associated with extremist ideologies will be investigated and potentially face administrative action,"" Defence said in a statement.

""Administrative action ranges from counselling through to termination of employment.""

The Department has, however, confirmed one Army member has been disciplined ""for contravening Defence values by making inappropriate hand gestures"".

Several Army sources have told the ABC the disciplined member was a Lieutenant Colonel at the time, although Defence has declined to comment due to ""privacy reasons"".

One soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, claimed the Army's directive was considered very problematic because the ""okay"" gesture was too easily mistaken as a ""white power"" symbol.

Neil James from the Australia Defence Association says racist behaviour is extremely rare in the Army, which has a proud record of ethnic advancement.

"US charges Huawei with racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets, escalating crackdown on tech giant",http://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/13/tech/huawei-meng-new-charges-trade-secrets/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The US government has charged Chinese technology giant Huawei with racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets, according to a superseding indictment unsealed Thursday in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York.

A third charge alleges that Huawei engaged in wire fraud to steal intellectual property. The three new allegations supplement more than a dozen other charges already lodged against the company in a case originally unsealed last January. Huawei pleaded not guilty to the initial charges last March.

The Trump administration has been locked in a battle with Huawei for more than a year, as US officials have waged a campaign urging allies not to use Huawei's 5G equipment and enacted other measures aimed at stunting the company's growth.

The earlier charges alleged that Huawei committed bank fraud and violated economic sanctions against Iran, claims that the company has denied. Thursday's indictment also reveals new details about alleged Huawei business dealings in Iran and North Korea.

The Justice Department accuses Huawei of lying about its relationship with an affiliate business called Skycom, which allegedly helped Iran's government perform ""domestic surveillance, including during the demonstrations in Tehran in 2009.""

"The world wastes twice as much food as previously estimated and rich countries are disproportionately responsible. Belgium had the most food waste, and the Philippines had the least.",http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228369,"The negative estimates for the constant in the relationship show that FW is not a problem at low levels of affluence, in fact, using the AIC/cap estimates from Table 2 , one can identify the income threshold (2450 International 2005 USD) beyond which consumer FW in a country turns positive and starts to increase rapidly. The positive slope estimates tell us that for a 1 percent increase in affluence, FW increases by about 5–6 (576.7/100) calories. Note that while changes in body weight over time don’t explicitly feature in the regression equation and in obtaining the sample dataset, the sample variation in bodyweight across countries ( Table 1 ) allows for this possibility.

Regression coefficients of this suggested relationship are provided in Table 2 (columns 3 and 4). Using alternative variables as a measure of affluence–ln(GDP/cap) and ln(AIC/cap) from ICP–gives similar results but AIC shows a slightly better fit ( Table 2 , column 5). This shows that our coefficient estimates are robust to the choice of measure of consumer affluence. A kernel density plot of residuals with AIC/cap as measure of affluence shows them to be fairly normally distributed ( Fig 2 ). Affluence is used as sole explanatory variable, as demand for calories/cap do not seem to be very responsive to food prices [ 24 , 25 ].

Estimates of FW and comparison with existing comparable literature.

As our sample represents only 67% of the world population, and some countries believed to waste a lot of food (including United States, Australia and Canada) are not present in our sample, we cannot use the population weighted average of sample FW data of 351 Kcal/cap/day (Table 1) as an estimate of FW for the world in 2003. We instead use the regression results (Table 2) and world AIC value (6095 international 2005 USD) from ICP 2005 to obtain an estimate of consumer FW for the world in 2005. This yields an estimate of 526 Kcal/day/capita for FW in 2005. At a global level FW rises to 727 Kcal/day/capita by 2011, accounting for 25% of calories available for human consumption. Note that these estimates of FW are derived using the central estimates of the regression coefficients in Table 2, and a range around these could be constructed using the coefficient ranges in the said table.

Using the same estimates (Table 2) and country specific AIC data for 2011 [26] we obtain FW estimates for all countries of world in 2011. The results are presented in Fig 3 below; in which the pattern across countries confirms the general belief that consumers in richer countries waste more food. The dataset underlying the figure is provided in SI (S3 File). This can be used as a consistent global consumer food waste dataset for developing metrics and indicators for inter-country/region comparison.

We also compare the current FW estimates with estimates of FW in the literature, with a particular focus on studies reporting Kcal estimates. While not exhaustive, Table 3 covers the relatively recent comparable work in the field. Kcal estimates [3,10,27,28] yield more readily to such a comparison. We do not directly draw a comparison with FAO physical waste estimates [1], as [27] translate those to provide Kcal estimates and can therefore, in essence, be seen as Kcal equivalents of the physical waste estimates. Due to different time and geographic coverage, we use our regression coefficients (Table 2) to obtain our FW estimates for years beyond 2003.

Comparison with Kummu et al. [27]: If FAO’s food availability estimates (2735 Kcal/day/cap) are correct, then globally consumers alone were wasting about 19% of calories available for human consumption in 2005. The corresponding number obtained by Kummu et al. using FAO food waste data, is in comparison only 8% (derived on the basis of numbers reported in Table 2 and Fig 2 in [27]).

Global FW estimates in terms of Kcal were first reported by Kummu et al. using data from FBS, and waste percentage assumptions [1]. Their analysis covers FW for cereals, fruits & vegetables, oilseeds & pulses, and roots & tubers, but not for all food (e.g. animal products are excluded). As per their study, over the period 2005–2007, of the total 614 Kcal/day/cap wasted in food supply chain, 214 Kcal/day/cap were wasted by consumers. The current study and [10] capture the total extent of FW in a manner which avoids errors in measurement and gathering of consumption data, and in conversion of physical weights to calories. Kummu et al.’s estimates are furthermore based on the waste percentages estimates [1] and are therefore subject to the same critique as the assumptions underlying these percentages. Also, Kummu et al. use food availability data which is already adjusted for country production losses, yet they account for production losses in estimating FW [10]. This, in addition to only partial coverage of food groups, results in a downward biased estimate of consumer FW.

Comparison with Hic et al. [10]: As with the current study, Hic et al. follow [3] to estimate food energy intake required to maintain the observed body weight. The current work however differs from theirs in certain aspects.

Hic et al. 2016 use FBS data on food availability to calculate a measure of FW but their energy requirement is imputed using body weight from different National Health Surveys (NHS) for 71 countries (filling the data gaps with weighted averages). They use three different PAL values to provide three alternative estimates of FW. While they provide estimates of the evolution of FW over 1965–2050, at global and country levels, they assume that BW over this period remain unchanged at the levels reported in NHS. Furthermore, unlike the current study, the BW data used from NHS for different countries comes for different time periods. For example, they use BW from 2011–2012 for Australia and from 1986–1992 for Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, Lithuania, Italy, Iceland, Israel and Serbia. Using a moderate PAL gives an average value of 510 Kcal/day/cap in 2011 for food surplus regions of the world and -120 Kcal/day/cap for parts of the world characterized by food deficit. 510 Kcal/day/cap is not very different from our 526 Kcal/day/cap (albeit for the year 2005), the current work, however, did not have to fill the gaps in data to get a global estimate. While Hic et al.’s global FW estimate of 510 Kcal/day/cap could be more precise than ours on account of including specific nutritional requirements of children, pregnant and lactating women, the claim cannot be made with certainty. This is because while taking pregnant and lactating women into account will increase energy requirements thus lowering FW levels, accounting for children (with lower calorie consumption than adults) will raise FW. The overall effect on relatively young countries is therefore ambiguous. At the same time it can be argued that the Hic et al. estimate is less precise than ours for several reasons: a) their assumption regarding equal PAL values for all countries (given the very different life-styles prevalent across the world); b) inconsistent weight data across countries coming from different points in time; and c) assuming a constant unchanging BW overtime in making future projections. Assuming equal PAL for all countries likely overestimates food energy requirements for the developed world thereby underestimating their FW, the opposite holds for developing/underdeveloped nations. A comparison of our FW estimates with those of Hic et al. (Table 3) lends support to this intuition. For China and India, Hic et al. provide a waste estimate of 620 and 210Kcal/day/cap respectively in 2010, while our estimates for 2011 are 329 and 121 Kcal/day/cap respectively. Our approach also implicitly allows the BW in currently poor nations to follow the same trends as those already observed in affluent nations, as they grow richer. Our global estimate for the year 2011 using AIC data from ICP 2011, is 727 Kcal/day/cap. Note that the 727 Kcal/day/cap estimate should be taken as a rough indication, as it (AIC data) should appropriately be adjusted for 2003–2011 USD inflation.

Hall et al. [3] and Buzby et al. [28]: Two further studies report FW estimates in Kcal terms. Hall et al. study the evolution of food waste in US between 1974–2003 using United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) data on FA, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data on average BW. They show that allocating a fixed fraction of food availability to estimate consumer FW, underestimates FW. As per Hall et al., Americans in 2003 wasted 1400 Kcal/cap/day. In comparison, Buzby et al. estimate the per capita FW in 2010 in US to be 1249 Kcal/day using the same food availability data but assuming a fixed fraction of different commodities being wasted. As suggested by Dou et al. [29], the Buzby et al. estimate of FW is conservative and likely underestimated. Our regression estimates predict 1482 Kcal/day/cap wasted in 2003 in the US, which increased to 1572 Kcal/day/cap by 2011. This indicates, if not establishes, the ability of our approach to get FW estimates similar to ones provided by studies using detailed country specific data. Across all works, Hic et al. estimate the least amount of food wasted in US in 2010, at 1050 Kcal/day/cap (again pointing to possible downward bias in their estimates for developed countries).",JustBadNews,0
"Vietnam food markets selling live frogs 'dying in pain' putting species at risk - Live frogs are being crammed together in tubs and sold in food markets in east Asia, destined for painful deaths, an investigation has found.",http://independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/frogs-market-food-vietnam-asia-animal-cruelty-disease-a9334901.html,"Live frogs are being crammed together in tubs and sold in food markets in east Asia, destined for painful deaths, an investigation has found.

Thousands of the amphibians were filmed being poured into large buckets at street markets in Vietnam, where workers frantically rifle through them, then stuff them into bags for sale.

Animal-welfare experts say the trade is not just “agonising” but also increases the risk of the extinction of the species, as creatures are taken from the wild.

Studies show the practice also damages natural food chains. And scientists say piling up live frogs in such conditions risks spreading disease among the amphibians.

In a joint investigation by the Moving Animals group and The Independent, bins full of living frogs were found in the seafood section of Binh Dien market.

“They are taken from stacked delivery crates and poured into buckets, where workers frantically grab them by hand to sort them,” said one investigator. “The sorted frogs are then stuffed into a bag, ready for sale – all while still alive.

“We also saw the mangled bodies of dead or dying frogs scattered across the market floor – frogs who managed to jump out of these tubs while being sorted ended up squashed under the feet of passers-by or under the wheels of motorbikes speeding down the hectic market corridors. It was shocking.”

Taking the creatures from the wild disrupts natural systems and risks the species' future, say experts (Amy Jones / Moving Animals)

It is estimated more than three billion frogs are eaten worldwide each year, which are mostly caught from in the wild in Indonesia, but they are also farmed. France is the biggest consumer, eating 4,000 tons a year, but America has been catching up, and they are also popular in Asian cuisine.

Fears of falling populations have long been raised, leading France to ban farming and capturing frogs in the country in 1979.

However, the EU still imports the legs of tens of thousands of the amphibians from Asia each year, to the dismay of conservationists.

Activists claim frogs are often “forgotten” in welfare laws. They are “often skinned, and have their snouts and rear legs cut off with scissors or a blade while still alive. Their torsos are then tossed aside in a pile of other bleeding frogs and they endure a slow, agonising death,” according to the Washington-based Animal Welfare Institute.

A 2011 report, Canapés to Extinction, by international animal groups, said scientists had found frogs’ pain perception was similar to mammals’ and when their legs were cut off they struggled “until they reach complete exhaustion”.

Other witnesses have reported that in many cases only the hind legs are used for food, with the body thrown away.

Worldwide, amphibians are already suffering “catastrophic population declines” from interacting pathogens, scientists say. Fungal disease chytridiomycosis is thought to have caused the extinction of 90 species and marked declines of at least 491 others. Globalisation and the wildlife trade have been given most of the blame for the pandemic.

Research shows that the mass movement of frogs for human consumption – often unregulated or mislabelled – also plays a role in ecosystem collapse and spreading disease.

Wiping out frogs leaves snakes starving and allows disease-carrying mosquitoes to multiply, new research has found.

Until 1987, India was the world’s primary exporter of wild-caught frogs, leaving populations heavily depleted and farmers dependent on large quantities of pesticides to control pests and mosquitoes. Ecologists fear that Indonesia, now the source of more than two-thirds of frogs’ legs in supermarkets worldwide, is heading the same way.

And keeping frogs in such cramped conditions, without water, allows them to succumb to viruses.

Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said although the risk to humans was probably very small, there was certainly the risk of spreading disease among frogs.

The 2011 report said: “Due to the mounting evidence that the chytrid fungus and ranaviruses are distributed through frogs traded live, in 2009 the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), specified conditions for handling processed and live frogs (eg health certificates and risk mitigation measures) in its Aquatic Animal Health Code.”",JustBadNews,0

Alexander Mendoza, a notorious MS-13 figure also known as “El Porky,” escaped during the attack in the city of El Progreso, 175 kilometres (108 miles) north of the capital, Tegucigalpa. He was on way to a trial hearing.

The notorious MS-13 crime group was founded by Salvadorans in Los Angeles in the 1980s and spread to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the United States deported waves of migrants.

The most important MS-13 leader on the northern city of San Pedro Sula, Mendoza had been captured in 2015 and sentenced to 20 years in jail on charges of illicit association and money laundering.

“We are going to recapture this man and arrest those who helped him escape,” said Deputy Minister of Security Luis Suazo.

Syria parliament recognizes Armenian genocide,http://timesofisrael.com/syria-parliament-recognizes-armenian-genocide/,"Syria’s parliament Thursday recognized the 1915-1917 murder of up to 1.5 million Armenians as genocide, as tensions run high with Turkey after deadly clashes in northwest Syria.

“The parliament… condemns and recognizes the genocide committed against the Armenians by the Ottoman state at the start of the twentieth century,” the legislature said in a statement.

The Armenians seek international recognition that the mass killings of their people under the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1917 amounted to genocide. They say 1.5 million died.

Turkey strongly denies the accusation of genocide and says that both Armenians and Turks died as a result of World War I. It puts the death toll in the hundreds of thousands.

The move comes after weeks of tensions between Ankara and Damascus over deadly clashes between the two sides in northwest Syria that Ankara says has killed 14 of its soldiers.

Russia-backed government forces have since December upped their deadly bombardment of the last major bastion of opposition in northwest Syria, where Ankara supports the rebels and has deployed troops.

The offensive on the jihadist-dominated Idlib has also forced 700,000 people from their homes toward the closed Turkish border, the United Nations says.

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday threatened to strike Syrian government forces “everywhere” if its soldiers come under renewed attack. Damascus hit back that he was “disconnected from reality.”

Beyond Idlib, Turkey and its proxies have conducted three operations in Syria against both the Islamic State group and Kurdish fighters it views as “terrorists.”

After the last incursion, Turkey set up a so-called “safe zone” in a 120-kilometer (70-mile) strip inside Syrian territory along its southern border.

Parliaments in nearly 30 countries have passed laws, resolutions or motions recognizing the genocide.

The US Congress in December recognized the mass killings as genocide, angering Turkey. US President Donald Trump’s administration said it did not agree.

“The position of the Administration has not changed,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a terse two-sentence statement last December. “Our views are reflected in the president’s definitive statement on this issue from last April.”

After Congress recognized the genocide, Israeli lawmakers called for Jerusalem to do likewise but made little headway on the issue because of opposition from the ruling Likud party.

Syria’s own human rights record has come under harsh condemnation in recent years. Last month, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of sources across the country, said that almost nine years of civil war in Syria had left more than 380,000 people dead including over 115,000 civilians.

The conflict flared after unprecedented anti-government protests in the southern city of Daraa on March 15, 2011.

Demonstrations spread across Syria and were brutally suppressed by the regime, triggering a multi-front armed conflict that has drawn in jihadists and foreign powers.

The conflict has displaced or sent into exile around 13 million Syrians, causing billions of dollars’ worth of destruction.",JustBadNews,0

With growth at its slowest in nearly three decades, China’s leaders seem eager to strike a balance between protecting an already-slowing economy and stamping out an epidemic that has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000.

After reviewing reports on the outbreak from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other economic departments, Xi told local officials during a Feb 3 meeting of the Politburo’s Standing Committee that some of the actions taken to contain the virus are harming the economy, said two people familiar with the meeting, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.

He urged them to refrain from “more restrictive measures”, the two people said.

Local authorities outside Wuhan - where the virus is thought to have first taken hold - have shut down schools and factories, sealed off roads and railways, banned public events and even locked down residential compounds. Xi said some of those steps have not been practical and have sown fear among the public, they said.

China’s state council information office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The official Xinhua News Agency, reporting on the Politburo meeting last Monday, called the coronavirus outbreak “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.” It added, without details, that “party committees and governments of all levels were urged to achieve the targets of economic and social development this year.”

Since the meeting, China’s central bank has vowed to step up support for the economy and prepared policy tools to offset the damage. The NDRC said at a weekend briefing that it was urging companies and factories to resume work, especially in “key industries” such as food and pharmaceuticals.

“In the context of the epidemic and the downward pressure on the economy, it is more important to maintain economic growth,” Pan Gongsheng, vice-governor of China’s central bank, said on Friday.

On Monday, Zhejiang province, an economic powerhouse in eastern China, ordered local authorities not to overreact by restricting everyday movement or shutting down “shops of chain stores and convenience stores that sell daily necessities such as vegetables, cooking oil as well as meat, eggs and dairy products,” according to a government release.

China has unveiled new tax policies as it tries to reduce the burden on industries hit heavily by the epidemic.

Reuters reported this month that policymakers in China are preparing measures, including more fiscal spending and interest rate cuts, amid expectations the outbreak will devastate first-quarter growth.

Many in China returned to work on Monday after the Lunar New Year holiday was effectively extended for about 10 days, but morning commutes were far less crowded than usual and numerous factories remained shut.

The ruling Communist Party’s propaganda department last week ordered state media to focus on “economic recovery”, according to a person with direct knowledge of the order, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.

China’s official media has been trying to project calm. In a Monday editorial, the official People’s Daily urged the public to deal with the epidemic with a “positive mood”.",JustBadNews,0
"More than 100 U.S. troops diagnosed with brain injuries from Iran attack. The U.S. military on Monday disclosed a more than 50% jump in cases of traumatic brain injury stemming from Iran's missile attack on a base in Iraq last month, with the number of service members diagnosed climbing to over 100.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-pentagon-tbi/more-than-100-u-s-troops-diagnosed-with-brain-injuries-from-iran-attack-idUKKBN2041ZM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Monday disclosed a more than 50% jump in cases of traumatic brain injury stemming from Iran’s missile attack on a base in Iraq last month, with the number of service members diagnosed climbing to over 100.

No U.S. troops were killed or faced immediate bodily injury when Iran fired missiles at the Ain al-Asad base in Iraq in retaliation for the U.S. killing of Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at the Baghdad airport on Jan. 3.

The missile attacks capped a spiral of violence that had started in late December. Both sides have refrained from further military escalation, but the mounting number of U.S. casualties could increase scrutiny on the Trump administration’s approach to Iran.

Reuters was first to report earlier on Monday that there were over 100 cases of TBI, up from the 64 previously reported last month.

The Pentagon, in a statement, confirmed that so far 109 U.S. service members had been diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury. It added that 76 of them had returned to duty.

The U.S. military in the past had said to expect an increase in numbers in the weeks after the attack because symptoms can take time to manifest and troops can sometimes take longer to report them.

Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last month that the service members suffering from traumatic brain injuries had been diagnosed with mild cases. He added that the diagnosis could change as time passed.

Symptoms of concussive injuries include headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light and nausea.

Pentagon officials have repeatedly said there has been no effort to minimize or delay information on concussive injuries. But the disclosures following Tehran’s attack have renewed questions over the U.S. military’s policy regarding how it internally reports suspected brain injuries and whether they are treated publicly with the same urgency as loss of limb or life.

U.S. Republican Senator Joni Ernst said more answers were needed.

“I’ve called on the Pentagon to ensure the safety & care of our deployed forces who may be exposed to blast injuries in Iraq,” Ernst said on Twitter.

U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to play down the brain injuries last month, saying he “heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things” following the attack, prompting criticism from lawmakers and a U.S. veterans group.

Various health and medical groups for years have been trying to raise awareness about the seriousness of brain injuries, including concussions.

Since 2000, about 408,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, according to Pentagon data.",JustBadNews,0

Thai soldier kills at least 17 in shooting spree livestreamed on Facebook before posing for selfie in front of burning shopping centre where he is still holed up with terrified hostages,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7981285/Soldier-armed-rifle-kills-12-Thailand.html,"Advertisement

A Thai commando has been killed as security forces desperately try to capture a rogue soldier who has killed at least 21 people in a gun rampage inside a shopping mall - where he is still holed up more than 12 hours after he first struck.

Sergeant Major Jakrapanth Thomma, 32, is hiding out in the Terminal 21 shopping mall in Nakhon Ratchasima, a city 155 miles northeast of Bangkok, after opening fire on terrified civilians this afternoon.

He began his murderous rampage at his barracks, where he executed his commanding officer along with two other soldiers, before commandeering a humvee and tearing away from the scene.

As he drove along the motorway toward the shopping centre, Thomma opened fire on civilians at a house and a Buddhist temple before making his way inside the mall - where he was caught on CCTV stalking the corridors.

He is now locked in a siege with police, who have helped hundreds of people escape after storming the shopping centre and escorting terrified shoppers away from the scene.

One member of Thailand's security forces was killed and two were wounded early on Sunday in a raid on the shopping mall - in which a series of explosions and more gunfire could be heard.

Thai media said the suspect's mother was being taken to the mall to try to persuade him to give up. As she was led to a police car, she was heard saying 'why did he do it?' with tears in her eyes.

The shooter is thought to be holed up in the basement and is exchanging gunfire with officers as they try to bring his rampage - in which he also injured 31 and shot a doctor helping an injured person - to an end.

Several volleys of gunfire were tonight heard ringing out from inside the besieged mall where the gunman is holed up. Two more casualties were seen being taken out of the building after the repeated gunfire.

There were fears the shooter could try to hide in the panicked crowd. Images posted on social media showed people sprinting across the mall car parks and walkways once they were freed.

Police from the Crime Suppression Division urged fleeing shoppers to 'raise their hands' and identify themselves on the ground floor 'and authorities will evacuate you'.

Hospitals across the country braced for a grim night ahead as residents flooded the hospitals to give blood and search for relatives.

A brave lone policeman is among those thought to have entered the shopping mall to search for the shooter. Video shows him holding a semi-automatic handgun as he stalked the empty floors of the building.

Earlier Thomma relayed his shooting spree through Facebook posts which charted the attack from army barracks in the city to the mall.

The gunman posted photos of himself online dressed in full tactical gear and holding a rifle which he smuggled from the army compound's arsenal.

He also posed for a photograph in front of the burning shopping centre with reports suggesting the blaze was caused by a gas canister that exploded when it was hit with a bullet.

Thomma also wrote several posts on his Facebook page including 'should I surrender' and 'no one can escape death'.

In one Facebook video - since deleted - the assailant filmed from an open jeep saying, 'I'm tired... I can't pull my finger anymore' and making a trigger symbol with his hand.

Thomma also posted a picture of a revolver with the captions 'It is time to get excited' and and 'nobody can avoid death'. The gunman seized weapons from the army arsenal before embarking on his shooting spree.

Local media earlier showed footage of the soldier getting out of a car in front of the shopping mall and firing a series of shots, sending people running. People fled while at least one fire roared and what appeared to be the sound of automatic gunfire filled the air.

Police evacuated terrified shoppers from the Terminal 21 mall in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima - also known as Korat - in Thailand early on Sunday where a soldier killed at least 21 people in a shooting rampage that he relayed via Facebook posts

The mall was busy with shoppers on a long weekend for the Buddhist Makha Bucha holiday.

CCTV footage from inside showed the gunman dressed in black and wearing a mask, his gun slung over his shoulder with no sign of other people around.

'We don't know why he did this. It appears he went mad,' said defence ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantrawanit.

A volunteer rescue worker recounted a bloody scene of horror after his team carried four corpses to the hospital.

'I've never seen anything like this,' Peerapong Chatadee said. 'I just feel so sad. He is a solider he should not have fired at unarmed people.'

The Thai Health Minister told reporters around 10 people were already in hospital in a 'critical condition.'

Kongcheep said at least 21 people had been killed and it was not clear whether the gunman had taken hostages in the mall.

'It's not known how many are still inside,' he said.

The bloodshed began on Saturday afternoon when Jakrapanth shot three people - among them at least one soldier - at a senior officer's house and then at nearby army barracks.

'He stole an army vehicle and drove into the town centre,' police Lieutenant-Colonel Mongkol Kuptasiri.

There the gunman used weapons stolen from the military arsenal to bring carnage to a town centre, walking into the Terminal 21 mall - an airport-themed shopping centre filled with colorful Lego sculptures, a merry-go-round and huge replicas of landmarks from around the world.

He 'used a machine gun and shot innocent victims resulting in many injured and dead,' police spokesman Krissana Pattanacharoen said.

Jakrapanth's motive remains unclear.

But throughout the day he posted images of himself and wrote several posts on his Facebook page as the attack unfolded, including 'should I surrender?' and 'no one can escape death'.

One video from a bystander showed a man slumped at the wheel of a car in a pool of blood. It was unclear if he was among the dead.

A woman interviewed by Thailand's Channel One television said she had heard gunshots when she was at the shopping mall and hid in a clothing store with other people before escaping.

The man who was identified by police as the suspect had posted on his Facebook page earlier in the day that 'Death is inevitable for everyone.'

He also posted a picture of what appeared to be him holding a gun.

'The gunman used a machine gun and shot innocent victims resulting in many injured and dead,' a police spokesperson said earlier this afternoon.

In the initial stages, people were unsure what was happening.

Nattaya Nganiem, who shot a video from outside the mall in which gunshots were heard, recounted what she experienced.

'We just left the mall after we had our meal. While we were in our car on the opposite side, we heard a loud sound and then we could see people starting to run out. First I saw a woman run out from the mall hysterically. Then a motorcycle rider in front of her just ran and left his motorcycle there.

'I thought, what's happening? Then we heard several gunshots. The motorcycle guy probably had seen the gunman from where he was. We couldn't see the gunman but we could hear the sound of the gun. It was terrifying.

'We were just inside having dinner and my child was getting unusually restless, that's why we left, otherwise, we would have been stuck inside there. I can't believe this is happening in my hometown. I mean, this shopping mall, we go there almost every other day. '

Once she got home and learned what had happened, she fainted, she said.

Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, is about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northeast of the Thai capital, Bangkok. It is a hub for Thailand's relatively poorer and rural northeastern region.

One officer said the soldier had been involved in an argument about a land deal and shot two people who were involved, another soldier and a woman.

The man then took a gun from the base where he is stationed outside the city and drove to the mall, shooting at people along the way.

The mall was shut down and the street outside was closed while authorities attempted to arrest the gunman.

Facebook, where Thomma's selfies first appeared, sent its condolences to the victims and their families and said there was no place on Facebook for anyone who commits or supports such atrocities.

'We have removed the gunman's accounts from our services and will work around the clock to remove any violating content related to this attack as soon as we become aware of it,' it said.

Hashtags #KoratShootingRampage and #SaveKorat were trending on social media in Thailand.

Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul asked on his Facebook page for blood donations at four hospitals in the vicinity of Korat.

Thai army chief Apirat Kongsompong issued an order for local army commanders to rush to the scene and investigate.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha expressed condolences to the families of those killed, a government spokeswoman said.

Police swoop on a shopping mall in Thailand as a gunman kills at least 12 and holds 16 hostages

Pictured is an explosion at the shopping mall in Thailand today where a gunman went on a shooting spree leaving at least 12 dead

Terminal 21 Korat is part of a small chain of Thai shopping centers run by Bangkok-based property developer LH Mall & Hotel Co. The malls feature floors modeled after major cities around the world.

The size of the mall posed a challenge for security forces as they tried to capture the gunman. It consists of seven main retail floors, including one below ground level, and scores of shops and restaurants. It also houses a movie theater on the top floor.

Many malls in Thailand, including Terminal 21's namesake in Bangkok, have metal detectors and security cameras at entrances manned by uniformed but unarmed security guards. Checks on those entering are often cursory at best.

Gun violence is not unheard of in Thailand - but such major shootings are rare in the Southeast Asian country other than in the far south, where a decades-old insurgency persists.

Firearms can be obtained legally, and many Thais own guns. Mass shootings are rare, though there are occasional gun battles in the far south of the country, where authorities have for years battled a long-running separatist insurgency.

Several shootings at courthouses late last year also renewed concern about gun violence in the Southeast Asia country.

In one high-profile case, two lawyers were shot dead by a clerk at a court in the east of the country during a hearing over a land dispute.

Coronavirus misinformation is running rampant on social media here are some of the hoaxes to watch out for,http://abc.net.au/news/science/2020-01-30/social-media-spreading-coronavirus-misinformation-youtube-tiktok/11912590,"Tech giants are struggling to control the spread of misinformation about the novel coronavirus — and in some cases, even profiting from it.

Key points: Misinformation about the coronavirus is spreading on social media

Misinformation about the coronavirus is spreading on social media On YouTube, ads for brands like KFC were being run next to conspiracy theories

On YouTube, ads for brands like KFC were being run next to conspiracy theories Experts say the situation is unsurprising, but better communication is needed

ABC Science found ads for brands including KFC and Elevit vitamins on YouTube videos that suggest the disease is a bioweapon targeting China, among other conspiracy theories. After being notified, Google removed the ads.

Social media companies and messaging platforms like Weibo and WhatsApp have long struggled with the spread of health misinformation, especially during disease outbreaks.

The coronavirus situation is evolving quickly, which means lies can outpace official sources as we search for answers and solutions — all abetted by technology platforms designed to send content, well, viral.

The spread of misinformation about the coronavirus is unsurprising, suggested Rod Lamberts, deputy director of the Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science.

""If it's frightening, if it's sensational, if it's threatening, then we often follow similar patterns,"" Dr Lamberts said.

""People want to know what to do. People want to know if they should be worried, which is all very reasonable.""

The spread of hoaxes is most troubling for those who need immediate help, including Chinese-Australians trying to leave Wuhan.

On Tuesday, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warned an online evacuation form circulating online was not an official document.

But most common so far is misinformation about the virus's presence in Australia as well as its origins and how to cure it.

Rumour: The coronavirus has infected food in Australia

Earlier this week, a social media post warned that food originating in China such as fortune cookies and wagyu beef could be ""contaminated"" by the coronavirus.

It also claimed the ""Bureau of Diseasology Parramatta"", which does not exist, had found positive cases of the virus at Sydney train stations.

The post was quickly debunked by NSW Health, which said none of the areas mentioned posed a risk, however other iterations of the message were shared on WhatsApp.

Professor James McCaw, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, said he had seen no evidence that consumption of food from China purchased in Australia would be problematic.

In Australia, much of the misinformation seen shared so far relates to the virus's potential impact locally, according to Rachel Blundy, editor of AFP Fact-Check in Hong Kong.

""In [Australia] specifically, it seems to be focusing on 'has the virus arrived in Australia, where should we avoid, how can we stay safe?"" she said.

Information debunked by NSW Health continues to be shared on platforms like WhatsApp. ( ABC News: WhatsApp screenshot )

Rumour: Bill Gates created the coronavirus

One conspiracy theory being shared on Facebook and other sites suggests Bill Gates predicted the coronavirus several months ago, and was involved in ""patenting"" it.

A Facebook spokesperson said the Gates hoax had been rated as false by several third-party fact checkers.

""We are dramatically reducing its distribution and people who see it, try to share it, or already have, are alerted that it's false,"" she added.

In fact, there is not only one coronavirus — and confusion may arise because other strains have been patented as part of research.

The term refers to a large group of viruses that cause illnesses such as the common cold and gastrointestinal infections, and more recent diseases including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).

They're named for the corona, or crown, of surface proteins that the virus uses to penetrate the cells of its host — in other words, the human who's been infected.

New virus strains emerge relatively frequently because the genetic structure of most viruses is so prone to mutating and changing.

Rumour: The coronavirus is a bio-weapon

Another conspiracy theory circulating on social media claims the coronavirus is a bioweapon.

On the video app TikTok, for example, one account suggested the Chinese Government started the coronavirus to decrease the country's population size.

The idea that diseases are deliberately created by governments or other bad actors is longstanding among conspiracy theorists — and challenging for fact checkers to debunk.

Kanishk Karan, a research assistant in the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said both medical misinformation and deliberate disinformation about the coronavirus were being spread online.

""The same was noted around Ebola virus disease,"" he said.

""Some conspiracy theorists weaponised the issue to make a belief that a secret plot is behind the origins of the virus.""

On YouTube, ads for top brands had been shown on videos claiming coronavirus is a bioweapon, earning money for both the content maker and the video platform. But the ads have since been removed from these videos.

""We have strict policies that govern where we allow ads to appear,"" a YouTube spokesperson told the ABC.

""When we find content that is in violation of our policies, we take action.""

TikTok was contacted for comment.

Rumour: You can protect yourself by drinking bleach

On Facebook, a number of private groups focused on the disease have emerged in recent days.

While some users in these spaces are asking for advice about masks and protective measures, others are sharing erroneous theories about both the cause of coronavirus and potential solutions.

Posts on Weibo, Twitter and Facebook have suggested people rinse their mouths with salt water solution to prevent infection, which is not recommended, according to AFP Factcheck.

The Daily Beast also found promoters of the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory dangerously advising fans to drink bleach in an attempt to ward off the illness.

What can be done to stop misinformation

Some social media companies have taken steps to prevent the spread of bad information.

YouTube's policy is to try and surface authoritative sources in its ""next watch"" results. And Twitter now points local users that search ""coronavirus"" to the Australian Department of Health.

However, that information doesn't emerge if you search for ""wuflu"", for example — another way the disease is referred to online, Mr Karan noted on Twitter.

To avoid being misled, look for information from trusted media and government voices, and avoid information that appears be unsourced or inflammatory.

""People just need to keep checking for official sources,"" advised AFP's Ms Blundy, ""and so if you're reading unofficial blogs and and unofficial Facebook pages, then you can't be sure that what you're reading is genuine.""

We must also recognise that there are some questions about coronavirus that we don't yet know the answers to, Dr Lamberts said.

For that reason, social media companies, government and science communicators should share ""simple, clear, straightforward messages"" about the outbreak, he suggested.

""It affects these people ... You're at risk if ... These are the things you should do ... You don't have to worry if you're 'x'.""",JustBadNews,0

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In a nation unaccustomed to widespread working from home, China’s coronavirus epidemic is forcing millions of white-collar workers to get used to business outside the office.

With millions of companies keeping staff away to curb contagion, demand is surging for chat apps that employees are adjusting to use from living rooms, kitchens and home offices.

“When we did our first video call on Monday, some people looked like they just got out of bed,” said Jingshu Chen, who runs virtual reality startup VeeR, which asked its staff to stay away from their Beijing office for the week.

“Then, when we did a video call on the second day, everyone looked ready to work.”

Provinces across China have ordered companies to shut or make staff work from home for at least another week after the Lunar New Year holiday. Many firms may extend that further.

Downloads for WeChat Work surged by almost 70% in the same time.

Both DingTalk and WeChat Work suffered connectivity issues due to heavy usages, the companies confirmed in public statements addressing user complaints.

Companies are also relying more on China’s army of couriers, who are keeping many self-quarantined residents fed and supplied. VeeR’s Chen said large video files her team once accessed on an office network are now delivered to employees’ homes via hard drives with couriers.

Some fear financial disruptions.

John Rood, who runs a digital marketing agency in Shenzhen, said the nationwide work-from-home experiment could cause late payments from clients due to banking system quirks.

“A lot of Chinese banks require you to use a USB drive to log into your account, for security measures,” he said.

“But if the financial departments didn’t bring the USB drive home before the holiday, our payments will probably be delayed another week. “Others said they felt pressure to be online 24/7 as there was no means of clocking off as normal now.

One client manager at HSBC bank said the work-from-home policy has her feeling she cannot leave the house lest she miss a message in her department group chat.

After months of investigations and a two and a half week trial, the impeachment proceedings have come to a close - and so our live coverage follows suit.

President Trump was cleared on both charges in his Senate trial - abuse of power by 52 votes to 48 and obstruction of Congress by 53 votes to 47.

The votes are not as close as they look - a two-thirds majority was required to remove Trump from office.

The only Republican to vote against him - on one charge - was former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Horrifying video of Afghan woman cowering in a hole as she is stoned to death by a furious crowd shouting 'hit her' and 'Allahu Akbar' is investigated by rights group,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7964797/Rights-group-investigates-horrifying-video-Afghan-woman.html,"Horrifying footage shows an Afghan woman being stoned to death by an angry mob in an attack which activists have blamed on the Taliban.

The clip shows a woman cowering and screaming in a hole as she is mercilessly pelted with stones in front of a crowd of onlookers.

A spokesman for Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani has pointed the finger at the Taliban, accusing the militant group of 'cruelty and atrocity'.

The Taliban claim the footage is from 2015 but activists do not believe them and the country's Independent Human Rights Commission is investigating the case.

Horrifying footage shows an Afghan woman cowering on the ground as she is stoned to death, in an attack which activists have blamed on the Taliban

The human rights commission told RFERL that it was trying to establish when the footage was taken and why the woman was killed.

Laila Haidari, a prominent Afghan activist, said on Saturday that the Taliban had stoned the woman 'a few days ago' in Ghor province.

'The intensity of their violence and what they can do against women in the absence of law and order is clearly visible,' she said.

'We have to think about how we can stand up against this approaching horror.'

In the video, the woman can be heard crying and screaming while the crowd shouts 'Allahu Akbar' and 'hit her'.

Another activist, Farangies Shah, also stated that the stoning had been recent as she took aim at possible negotiations with the Taliban.

'Yesterday they stoned a woman in Ghor, tomorrow such acts will reach the shores of the US,' she said.

'Don't forget, you can appease the oppressor but their roots will spread and the problem will persist.'

The woman was forced to sit in a hole where she was mercilessly attacked with stones by suspected Taliban members

A large crowd had gathered for the stoning, many of whom took a turn at pelting the woman

Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for president Ashraf Ghani, directly accused the Taliban of killing the woman.

'I am utterly shocked and saddened after I watched a video on Twitter in which a group of Taliban is stoning an innocent woman,' he said.

'Taliban's cruelty and atrocity under the name of Islam is a crime against humanity.'

Trying to deflect the blame, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed in response that the video was several years old.

He appeared to be referring to a notorious case in 2015 in which a woman known as Rokhshana was stoned to death for adultery, also in Ghor province.

Officials said Rokhshana had been captured by the insurgents after she ran away from home, supposedly with a 19-year-old boyfriend.

The woman appeared to be dumped in a pit before the stoning began. The punishment was frequently used against convicted adulterers when the Taliban ruled the country

The crowd repeatedly hurls stones at the woman in a video clip which Afghanistan's human rights commission is now investigating

A spokesman for Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani has pointed the finger at the Taliban over this footage, accusing the militant group of 'cruelty and atrocity'

Rokhshana was accused of adultery because she was engaged to man she did not want to marry, Afghan authorities said at the time.

Although stoning is illegal under the Afghan constitution, it is seen as a legitimate punishment under the Taliban's extreme laws.

Convicted adulterers were frequently stoned or shot when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until the US-led invasion in 2001.

Zabiullah, the Taliban spokesman, defended the practice and said it 'cannot be rejected by any Muslim'.

He also suggested without evidence that the stoning in question had been carried out by a commander on the side of the Afghan government.",JustBadNews,0

At least 13 children killed in Kenya primary school stampede,http://sbs.com.au/news/at-least-13-children-killed-in-kenya-primary-school-stampede,"At least 13 children died and dozens of others were injured in a stampede as they left their primary school in Kenya on Monday, local police said, with investigators still trying to ascertain the cause of the tragedy.

The police have launched an inquiry into what caused the crowd of students to panic, leading to the crush at the school in the western town of Kakamega.

In the aftermath of the stampede, the police cordoned off the school and took statements from the teaching staff.

Images broadcast by local media showed parents gathered in front of the emergency ward of a hospital in the town, waiting for news of their children.

""We lost 13 children in this stampede and others are in hospital due to injuries,"" Kakamega's police chief David Kabena told reporters at the scene.

""We have launched an investigation to establish what exactly happened,"" he added.

One of the children's mothers blamed the teachers.

""Those who survived said they were running because there were teachers who were beating them, and that is why they were escaping and fell on each other,"" the mother said in an interview with local media.

She said the children were mostly in grade five, aged between 10 and 12.

Corporal punishment is banned in Kenya.

The Kakamega Primary School did not immediately comment on the incident.

""We are devastated by the tragedy that has hit Kakamega Primary School this evening,"" said Kenya's Vice President William Ruto in a post on Twitter.

Kenya Red Cross said on Twitter that it was setting up psychological support services, as well as a ""tracing desk"" to help relatives locate potentially affected students.

The Red Cross said 39 students had been admitted to a local hospital.

13 children have been killed and over 40 others injured in a stampede that occurred as they left school in western Kenya on Monday, local police said.

Coronavirus Cats and dogs 'thrown from tower blocks' in China after fake news rumours animals are causing spread,http://thesun.co.uk/news/10863349/coronavirus-cats-and-dogs-thrown-to-death/amp/,"PANICKING pet owners are reportedly throwing cats and dogs out of towerblocks following bogus claims deadly coronavirus can be passed on by animals.

Chilling pictures coming out of crisis-hit China are said to show the bloodied corpses of animals lying in the road after being hurled to their death.

AsiaWire Chilling pictures coming out of China are said to show the bloodied corpses of animals lying in the road

Five cats were also thrown to death in Shanghai, with locals apparently saying they were pets as they had smooth and clean fur, say unconfirmed reports.

One dog was found dead after allegedly being thrown from one block of flats in Tianjin City in Hebei Province.

Local media stated the pooch was thrown from the upper floors of a tower block at 4am and smashed into the sunroof of a car before ending up on the ground.

Reports state the noise of the dog hitting the car woke sleeping locals as it sounded like a tyre explosion.

Sickened families then found the poor pet lying dead on the ground with its blood staining surrounding bricks.

AsiaWire It’s reported multiple pets were killed following bogus claims they could spread coronavirus

The shocking incidents were sparked after Dr Li Lanjuan said on Chinese state TV said : “If pets come into contact with suspected patients, they should be quarantined.”

However, a local media outlet then reportedly tweaked her words into “cats and dogs can spread the coronavirus”.

The false rumour spread quickly after Zhibo China posted it on social media platform Weibo.

In a bid to put and end to the false claims, China Global Television Network posted a quote from the World Health Organisation.

It read: “There is no evidence showing that pets such as cats and dogs can contract the novel coronavirus, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday.”

PETA Asia press officer for China, Keith Guo, said: “We hope the police can find the cold-blooded guardians of those poor animals as soon as possible.

“In fact, it’s the filthy factory farms, slaughterhouses, and meat markets that threaten the health of every human being on the planet by providing a breeding ground for deadly diseases like coronavirus, SARS, bird flu, and more.”

On Thursday we reported how dog owners in China were rushing to buy face masks for their pooches as experts warn pets could also catch the deadly virus.

One online seller from Beijing told Mail Online he is selling more special masks than ever before.

Zhou Tianxiao, 33, started selling special masks for dogs in 2018 to help protect them from air pollution.

But since the deadly new outrbreak, he has gone from selling 150 masks a month to at least 50 a day.

The killer bug has now spread to every region of China and 22 other countries including the UK.

"'Me Too' Nigeria style: women opt for martial arts over marches. Frustrated by one of the world's highest rates of sexual assault, poor law enforcement and tribal taboos that keep people quiet about gender violence, some Nigerian women are breaking with tradition to take self-defence classes.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-nigeria-women/me-too-nigeria-style-women-opt-for-martial-arts-over-marches-idUKKBN1ZU0T7,"LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) - Frustrated by one of the world’s highest rates of sexual assault, poor law enforcement and tribal taboos that keep people quiet about gender violence, some Nigerian women are breaking with tradition to take self-defence classes.

A local rights group and boxing coach have joined to offer free training that is tearing the lid off the largely unspoken problem of everyday violence against women in a country already well known for atrocities against girls by jihadist fighters.

New student Adeola Olamide says she was filled with fear and shame when first assaulted. When the attacks continued, the petite 35-year-old mother-of-three decided to learn techniques needed to fight off a bigger, stronger opponent.

“For us, the idea of a woman learning to defend herself is revolutionary,” said Olamide, who described having been choked and beaten several times in assaults.

“As a woman in Nigeria, you’re not supposed to have a voice. Every tribe has this in common.”

She spoke minutes before stepping into her first class run by rights group Women Impacting Nigeria and coach Rehia Giwa-Osagie, head of local gym Elitebox.

Their hands wrapped and stuffed into boxing gloves, the students soon filled the gym with hissing sounds as they practiced jabs and uppercuts against heavy bags.

Boxing and karate instructors taught Olamide and about 20 other students basic blocking, striking and escape techniques in the two-hour class, which is offered monthly to any women willing to step out of their cultural comfort zone.

Nigerian media are awash with horrifying stories of women and girls kidnapped and trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation. And the abduction of 276 schoolgirls in 2014 by Boko Haram jihadists sparked global outcry.

But everyday assaults have stayed under the radar.

“RECLAIMING OUR DIGNITY”

Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher for Human Rights Watch, said law enforcement was inadequate. “When this is coupled with the negative perceptions that reinforce injustices against women, it culminates in a pretty hostile environment.”

Coach Rehia said the classes were in a nascent stage but should help combat an “enormous” problem in Nigeria. Official national data on violence against women was not available, but an official at the Women’s Affairs Ministry said the government was making a strong effort to combat the issue.

After her first session, Olamide’s confidence grew.

“There’s something about doing this with other women, reclaiming our dignity outside of a traditional therapeutic process,” said the mother-of-three, still sweating. “It’s different from sitting in a circle and telling our stories.”

Nigeria is the ninth most dangerous country in the world for women, according to a 2018 report from the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The most dangerous was India.

“I had never heard of a women’s self-defence workshop in Nigeria. It’s just not done. But the #Me Too movement we’ve seen around the world has prompted people to ask how we can prevent violence,” said Tope Imasekha, head of the rights group.

#Me Too was ignited by revelations in 2017 of assaults against women in Hollywood and became a global movement.

“Traditionally, we believe that we should be defended by men: our fathers, husbands and brothers. But with more women working and walking around independently, we need to defend ourselves,” said Olamide’s classmate Motunrayo Naiwo, 39.

Naiwo said she had been groped on the streets of Lagos, and seen other women accosted while men stand by watching.

“Now, with this training, even I might be able to help another woman if she’s in trouble,” she said.",JustBadNews,0
22 year old in Malaysia dies from Coronavirus,http://indiatvnews.com/news/india/coronavirus-outbreak-tripura-youth-dies-in-malaysia-584415,"Image Source : Coronavirus outbreak: Tripura youth dies in Malaysia

In the first reported death due to coronavirus infection from northeast India, a 22-year-old youth from Tripura died in a Malaysian hospital after he was reportedly infected by the dreaded virus, family sources said on Thursday. However, Tripura Health and Family Welfare Director Radha Debbarma said the government has no information about the youth's death due to coronavirus infection in Malaysia.

Following advisories of the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry, all state governments and Central agencies, including the Airport Authority of India (AAI), have set up special screening counters and desks.

According to Sahajan Mia in Bishalgarh (under western Tripura's Sepahijala district), his son Manir Hossain, 22, died in a Malaysian hospital after he was reportedly infected by the Novel Coronavirus.

""Manir since 2018 had been working in a restaurant in Malaysia. On Wednesday restaurant staff informed us over the phone that he had died in a hospital due to coronavirus,"" Mia told the media.

He said with the help of the state government, the family was trying to bring the body back home.

According to the family, Hossain, a cricket player, got married in 2016. As he was unable to get a job in Tripura, he went to Malaysia in 2018 and since then had been working in a restaurant there.

Meanwhile, Tripura Health and Family Welfare Director Radha Debbarma told IANS on Thursday the government has set up a special screening desk and counter at the Agartala airport and in the integrated check post along the India-Bangladesh border at Akhaurah, near Agartala.

She said a special unit has also been set up in the Govind Ballabh Pant Medical College and Hospital and the microbiology unit was also alerted.

In Guwahati, Assam's Health and Family Welfare Department has issued instructions to the joint directors in all the districts to make arrangements to screen persons for coronavirus if they have returned from China or Nepal, or have come in contact with people who have visited the countries, where the disease has infected the people.

Assam's Health and Family Welfare Department Director Rathindra Bhuyan said in Guwahati that isolated observation beds have been set up in district hospitals and medical colleges of the state to treat suspected patients in case anybody is found to be affected by a coronavirus.

Guwahati or any other northeastern states' airport does not have direct flight connectivity with any of the cities in China or Nepal. However, people from Nepal and other countries along with the northeastern states occasionally come to northeast India by road.

According to officials in Imphal, Shillong, and Aizawl, similar screening test counters have been set up at airports and border entry points. Eight northeastern states, including Sikkim, share 5,437 km of international boundaries with China, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal.

While the peace plan has garnered support from some Western and Gulf allies - including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the UK - it has been rejected by the Palestinian leadership.

While the peace plan has garnered support from some Western and Gulf allies - including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the UK - it has been rejected by the Palestinian leadership. Among the deal's widely rejected principles is the proposed Israeli annexation of West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley, which is viewed as being completely unacceptable by Palestinians.





Kushner, who began working on the peace plan in 2017 in a largely secretive process, told Sky News Arabia Tuesday he has As part of the plan, future Palestinian statehood would be based on a series of strict conditions - including requiring the future state to be ""demilitarised"".Kushner, who began working on the peace plan in 2017 in a largely secretive process, told Sky News Arabia Tuesday he has read 25 books on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Speaking to Fox News on the same day, Kushner sold the plan, saying: ""Past proposals have been 2 to 3 pages - this is an over 80-page proposal with a map. Never been done before.""



Kushner already unveiled an economic component of the plan in June in Bahrain, with promises of $50 billion of investment in the Palestinian territories and its neighbours. The Palestinians boycotted the presentation, calling it a way to buy off their political aspirations. Supporters of the White House initiative have long counted on the relationships forged by Kushner with several Gulf monarchs, as well as on the informal contacts between some Arab countries and Israel. Their hope is that Saudi Arabia can pressure the Palestinian Authority to accept the peace plan, boosted by its economic component released in June, which anticipates $50 billion in international investments pouring into the area over 10 years. What is the 'Deal of the Century'? Unveiled after a three-year wait on Tuesday, Trump's so-called ""Deal of the Century"" claims to be an ""historic opportunity"" for ""two states"", but would see Israeli occupation of most Palestinian lands in the West Bank.



The US president claims peace plan would more than double territory earmarked for a Palestinian state and grant the future state a capital in East Jerusalem, although others have described the deal as ""farcical"". Israel would be granted an ""undivided"" capital in Jerusalem under the deal and also be given a green light to annex the Jordan Valley - a vital zone which makes up some 30 percent of the West Bank - and Israeli settlements, which are widely considered illegal under international law.



Israel would be allowed its capital in Jerusalem with all territory west of the separation wall, including the historic old city and major Palestinian-majority neighbourhoods, whereas Palestine would be granted only areas of Jerusalem to the east of the wall.

In return for lost territory in the occupied West Bank, the future Palestinian state would be granted territories in the sparsely populated Negev desert close to the Egyptian border. Other concessions include $50 billion worth of investment in the future state and access to two ports.



Both officials from the Palestinian Authority and protesters across the West Bank and besieged Gaza Strip have already rejected the deal, which critics say is overwhelmingly pro-Israel and will prevent the formation of a viable Palestinian state.



Maps unveiled by the White House on Tuesday reveal how the future states of Israel and Palestine would look if the deal is realised.

“If you’re my age and thinking of going to Cyprus this summer, I’d just tell you this — don’t go, just go somewhere else.”

She had dreamed of a career as an anti-terror cop but, after speaking to a pal who had worked abroad, decided to spend a summer in the sun before her uni course.

After looking online, she found a company called Summer Takeover — paying just a £1 deposit to secure her place in Ayia Napa.

The girl, then only 18, paid more than £500 in total before jetting out last July.

After landing with six others, she said she was charged another 300 euros in fees by reps.

She added: “I’d taken 450 euros and already I was nearly out of money.”

She was taken to a dank basement room which she shared with three others.

She said: “Within a few days we all started getting ill with chest infections and raw sewage starting leaking into the room.

“It was awful — worse than the prison cell I was held in later. People’s stuff kept on getting stolen and I had a dress that was taken and my debit card went missing.

SORRENTO, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man who repeatedly harassed parents of shooting victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School has been arrested for possessing the identification of one of the parents, authorities said.

Wolfgang Halbig, 73, was arrested Monday on a charge that he was in unlawful possession of another person’s identification, according to the Lake County Sheriff’s Office.

Halbig was a guest on the radio show of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. He’s been sued by the Sandy Hook families for defamation for falsely claiming that the massacre never happened. The 2012 mass shooting left 20 first graders and six adults dead at the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that Halbig repeatedly emailed several people and law enforcement agencies the Social Security number, birth date and other information of Leonard Pozner, whose 6-year-old son, Noah, died at Sandy Hook.

Pozner reported to sheriff officials that Halbig has continued to harass him over the internet since 2018.

"Boeing Dreamliner production problems threaten the aircraft's safety, former quality manager warns",http://abc.net.au/news/2020-01-28/boeing-whistleblower-dreamliner-production-issues-safety-threat/11904396,"A whistleblower who worked for Boeing for almost 30 years says he would not fly on the plane he helped build due to serious safety concerns.

Key points: Former quality manager claims quality issues at Boeing's North Charleston factory are affecting 787 Dreamliner safety

Former quality manager claims quality issues at Boeing's North Charleston factory are affecting 787 Dreamliner safety Boeing is already suffering due to the suspension of 737 MAX 8 production over technical faults

Boeing is already suffering due to the suspension of 737 MAX 8 production over technical faults An aviation expert says 737 MAX 8s may never fly again

The 100-year-old US company is facing intense scrutiny after two of its 737 MAX 8 planes were involved in fatal crashes in the last 18 months.

Now a second aircraft model — the 787 Dreamliner — is also facing allegations of production problems which compromise its safety.

Former Boeing quality manager John Barnett worked on the company's flagship 787 Dreamliner in the United States but he does not consider any of the planes that left the company's North Charleston factory airworthy.

""I would not fly on a Dreamliner and I've asked my family and begged my family not to fly Dreamliners because I know, I know what's under the skin,"" he told 7.30.

""I know what's flying around out there — and it's scary.""

Boeing's full-year earnings are due to be announced on Thursday and are expected to reflect the toll a year of scandals have taken on the company after what aviation experts say is an ""unprecedented"" situation for the aircraft manufacturer.

The first nine months of 2019 saw profits fall by 95 per cent, and Boeing's CEO was fired in December over his handling of the crisis.

Boeing 'putting profits above quality and safety'

John Barnett took his concerns to Boeing management and the Federal Aviation Administration in the US. ( ABC News )

Mr Barnett had worked for Boeing for more than two decades and ""loved"" the company and all it stood for.

When he was moved to its new factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, he began to see serious problems in the manufacturing of aircraft.

""I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I would consider safe and airworthy,"" he said.

While inspecting the planes, he noticed metal shaving scraps, left over from the installation of floor panels, had fallen near electrical wiring on some of the completed planes.

""When you mix metal slivers with electrical components, it's a recipe for disaster,"" he said.

He believed the debris posed a fire risk, and alerted Boeing management, but says his concerns were brushed off and he was moved to a different area.

""[What they] told me was that it was too expensive for them to take the panels down and clean them,"" he said.

""So, to me, that's an indication that they're putting profits and schedule above quality and safety.""

Mr Barnett also discovered problems with the oxygen supply on the plane that feed into drop-down masks for passengers when there is a mid-air emergency.

When he tested them at the factory, he said he found ""25 per cent of them failed to initiate"".

""So that's another major concern I have is that 25 per cent of the oxygen systems flying around today on the 787s aren't going to work properly.""

The whistleblower also found damaged parts for the aircraft were being used to construct new aircraft, rather than being thrown out as they are supposed to be

""If we have defective parts, and we don't have any more new parts in stock, then the mechanic took a defective part and put it on airplane because they want to get their job done for that day, not thinking about the long-term ramifications of it,"" Mr Barnett said.

""I caught [someone] taking a scrap part out of the bin, and giving it to the mechanic to put on the airplane.

""This part was actually scrapped and thrown in the trash. And he dug it out and said, 'go put it on the airplane.'""

Problems 'being addressed', Boeing says

Mr Barnett said he went through the correct channels to raise the issue within Boeing but got nowhere and so filed a formal complaint with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The FAA visited the North Charleston factory to investigate his claims and found the metal shavings as Mr Barnett described.

It also found Boeing could not account for the disposal of some damaged parts.

Boeing was ordered to fix the problems.

The FAA also found Boeing was aware of the oxygen system problems and was addressing them — but Mr Barnett does not have confidence they are being properly fixed.

In a statement to 7.30, Boeing said the concerns raised by Mr Barnett were not a safety issue and the matter involving the oxygen systems had been addressed.

It insisted that all its planes go through rigorous safety tests before they leave the factory.

""In 2017, Boeing's normal 787 production testing process identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly,"" the statement said.

This article contains content that is not yet available here.

""We removed those bottles from production so that no defective bottles were placed on airplanes, and we addressed the matter with the supplier through our normal FAA-approved process.

""We encourage and expect our employees to raise concerns and when they do, we thoroughly investigate and fully resolve them, in cooperation with the FAA, where appropriate.""

Mr Barnett retired in 2017 and is now taking legal action against Boeing under legislation to protect whistleblowers from discrimination.

He is worried about the planes that have left the factory with the problems he flagged.

""There's a rule of thumb in production, that it takes eight to 10 years for a defect to become an issue on an airplane,"" he said.

""Our first delivery out of Charleston was late 2012. So, we're just now getting into that eight to 10-year window with the 787s delivered out of Charleston and I'm concerned, I'm really concerned.""

7.30 understands no Australian domestic airlines operate 787 Dreamliners that were manufactured in North Charleston (Qantas' 787 planes are understood to be from Boeing's Seattle factory) but many international airlines do have them in their fleets.

A deeper crisis

The Dreamliner allegations come as Boeing faces unprecedented pressure over its 737 MAX 8 series, which has been the airline's biggest headache.

The crisis began in late 2018 when Lion Air flight 610 crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta, killing everyone on board.

Just a few months later, an Ethiopian Airlines plane met the same fate.

Both flights appear to have suffered the same problems before crashing.

""This aircraft clearly should never have been allowed to fly,"" aviation expert Neil Hansford said.

Indonesian authorities point to an automatic software system used to stabilise the plane which pilots were not aware of and could not control when it malfunctioned.

""They put the software in to overcome poor design,"" Mr Hansford said, adding he would not fly on a MAX 8 plane himself.

This article contains content that is not yet available here.

He believes the design of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft was rushed.

""Boeing had worked very hard to make this a cheaper alternative that didn't require training,"" he said.

""So any pilot that had flown the 800 series could automatically fly the MAX 8 after having looked at a video on their computer and that was supposed to equip them.

""But the problem was the MCAS [Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System — the automatic software system] isn't in the flight manuals and isn't in any other training.

""It's grossly negligent, it's engineering arrogance and a total contempt for the people who fly their product. Absolutely inexcusable.

""Boeing should be putting the lives of those people that have been lost clearly on their own shoulders.""

In a statement to 7.30, Boeing said it had made changes to its MCAS software including utilising two sensors instead of one.

""These changes will prevent the flight control conditions that occurred on the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 flights from ever happening again,"" the statement said.

737 MAX 8 may never fly again

All MAX 8 planes have been grounded worldwide for close to a year and it could be another six months before they are declared fit to fly by aviation authorities.

Boeing has temporarily halted production of the model as it scrambles to find a fix.

In Davos last week, US President Donald Trump expressed his disappointment in the American company.

""This was one of the great companies of the world a year ago and then all of these things happened,"" he told CNBC.

""Boeing: big disappointment to me, big disappointment.""

No Australian airline currently holds any MAX 8 aircraft but Virgin has several on order.

It has delayed the delivery of those until 2025.

Qantas told 7.30 it would consider the MAX 8 in the future.

But Mr Hansford doubts the plane will ever be cleared as safe to fly.

""I have a personal belief that this aircraft possibly will never fly again,"" he said.

""They all said there'd be a quick solution and here we are 12 months after 300-odd people lost their lives and there's still not a solution.""",JustBadNews,0
Soccer ball rigged with explosives found attached to balloons near Gaza,http://timesofisrael.com/soccer-ball-rigged-with-explosives-found-attached-to-balloons-near-gaza/,"Palestinians in the Gaza Strip apparently used balloons to float a soccer ball attached to an explosive device into Israel, as part of an uptick in arson balloon attacks in recent days.

Photos showed the bright orange ball, which was discovered in an open area of the Sha’ar Hanegev Regional Council on Thursday, with a device taped to it.

Soldiers from the IDF’s Engineering Corps were called to the scene and defused the device, according to the Ynet news site.

No was injured by the explosives-laden ball, which appeared to be another attempt to target children. Many of the attacks have been launched on brightly colored balloons and local children have been warned not to approach them.

On Friday another suspicious object apparently flown from Gaza with balloons was found in the Sha’ar Hanegev Regional Council

Police officers were dispatched to a field where the device landed.

There were no reports of injuries.

Terror groups in the Strip have continued to launch incendiary devices attached to balloons into Israel in recent days, undeterred by Israel’s threats to respond forcefully to Palestinian attempts to disrupt a major event in Jerusalem, the World Holocaust Forum, which was attended by many world leaders.

On Thursday evening, a rocket warning siren sounded in a community near the Gaza border. The army said it was triggered by an explosion inside Gaza, and not a rocket launch.

There was no immediate word on what caused the explosion in the northern part of Gaza, near the area of the border closest to the city of Sderot.

Israel’s missile defense system around Gaza tracks explosions believed to be caused by rocket launches.

The siren raised tensions in the south amid threats from Gaza’s Hamas rulers to escalate violence in order to pressure Israel during informal truce talks now underway via Egyptian mediation.

A number of suspicious balloons apparently launched from the Gaza Strip were found Thursday in southern Israel.

Police said that four balloons, three in Kiryat Gat and one in a community in the Shafir Regional Council, had suspicious objects attached to them. Sappers were dispatched to the areas.

“In one case the object exploded, with no injuries in the incident,” police said.

Hours earlier, a spokesperson for the Shaar Hanegev Regional Council said a suspicious bunch of balloons was found there. “Military forces immediately came to the scene and handled the situation successfully,” the spokesperson said.

The balloon launches came a day after Israeli television reported that Egypt is involved in “intense efforts” to get Hamas to end the arson balloon attacks on Israel from Gaza amid fears of a return to violence.

There was no official confirmation of the report from Egypt or Hamas.

A senior Hamas official said Tuesday that the recent spate of balloons was a signal to Israel to accelerate unofficial “understandings” meant to ease the blockade on the territory ruled by the terror group.

Speaking to journalists, Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya said the balloons had been launched by disgruntled individuals, not Hamas. But he said his group was “satisfied” with the launches and is ready to send more “if the occupation doesn’t pick up the message.”

The UN’s Mideast envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, called the renewed balloon launches “concerning and regrettable” in a briefing to the Security Council on Tuesday. “These actions are a risk to the civilian population,” he said.",JustBadNews,0
"Mike Pompeo accused a veteran NPR reporter of 'lying,' being 'unhinged,' and misidentifying Bangladesh for Ukraine on a map",http://businessinsider.com/mike-pompeo-accuses-veteran-npr-reporter-lying-and-being-unhinged-2020-1,"In a Saturday statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused an NPR host and veteran reporter of lying, being an example of the ""unhinged"" media, and misidentifying Bangladesh as Ukraine on a map.

But Kelly said that after the interview, Pompeo yelled at her for asking the questions on Ukraine in his office, cursed her out, and asked her if she could identify the country of Ukraine on a map.

In a Saturday statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused an NPR host and veteran reporter of lying, being an example of the ""unhinged"" media, and misidentifying Bangladesh as Ukraine on a map.

On Friday, NPR's ""All Things Considered"" host Mary Louise Kelly interviewed Pompeo, and asked him questions about the United States' support for Ukraine and the ouster of former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, both of which are currently at the center of the ongoing impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

But Kelly said that after the interview, Pompeo yelled at her for asking the questions on Ukraine in his office, cursed her out, and asked her if she could identify the country of Ukraine on a map.

""I was taken to the Secretary's private living room where he was waiting and where he shouted at me for about the same amount of time as the interview itself,"" Kelly recounted after the interview. ""He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine.""

""He asked, 'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?'"" she added. ""He used the F-word in that sentence and many others.""

Kelly added that Pompeo asked his aides to bring a blank map into his office and told her to point to Ukraine, saying, ""people will hear about this.""

In his Saturday statement, Pompeo said that Kelly ""lied to me, twice"" last month and on Friday in ""agreeing to have the post-interview conversation off the record,"" but did not deny that he cursed and yelled at her and said that Americans didn't care about Ukraine, which he is set to visit on January 30.

His statement continued, ""it is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this administration.""

As NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik noted, however, the State Department's own transcript of the interview both shows that Pompeo ""did not contradict"" Kelly when she confirmed that she would ask him about Ukraine.

And while he asked to talk to her without a recorder on after the interview, he did not specify that their conversation would be off the record and thus un-reportable, a key distinction from simply asking her not to record it.

Pompeo ended his statement by saying: ""It is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine,"" seemingly implying that Kelly misidentified Bangladesh as Ukraine on the map he brought into the office.

Kelly, a highly-respected veteran foreign correspondent and national security reporter who has reported from Russia, Iraq, and North Korea, additionally holds a master's degree in European studies from Cambridge University, making it highly unlikely that she would confuse Ukraine and Bangladesh, located in southeast Asia.

Folkenflik added: ""if he wants to accuse distinguished NPR host and correspondent of lying, he should produce additional evidence. This administration often has estranged relationship with fact and truth.""

In a statement to Insider, NPR's senior vice president for news Nancy Barnes defended Kelly, saying, ""Mary Louise Kelly has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report.""

"Protesters Mass in Baghdad, Demanding U.S. Leave Iraq",http://nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/middleeast/protests-iraq-baghdad.html,"He shook his head.

The protest was concentrated in Baghdad, and people were brought in from other cities to participate rather than holding smaller simultaneous demonstrations across the country.

Although the event was carefully organized and scripted by Mr. al-Sadr, a populist anti-American Shiite cleric, and given heft by Iraqi armed groups close to Iran, it also reflected a genuine desire shared by Iraqis to have a government and economy that serves the Iraqi people and not outside interests, many participants said.

Delivering on that may prove to be virtually impossible. But the United States’ recent actions in Iraq drew the wrath of many and distaste even among some Iraqis who support the United States presence.

It is particularly galling to many that the United States still has troops in Iraq and many people point out that while Iran also has influence, it does so without imposing its troops on the country. The armed groups that are part of the Popular Mobilization, even though they are backed by Iran, are not perceived in the same way.

“We don’t need any foreign troops to be in Iraq, we need Iraq for Iraqis,” said Hoda Hashimi, an employee in the Ministry of Trade in Baghdad. “We don’t want Americans to leave, we want the troops to leave — we want America to support our country but with contracts, not troops.”

This demonstration — unlike those in Tahrir Square in central Baghdad, which have gone on for months and involve a ragtag group of antigovernment protesters with homemade signs and a range of backgrounds — is heavily orchestrated rather than a spontaneous outpouring of feeling.

Participants were recruited, transported by buses provided by the organizers and given signs, flags and sometimes food. The vast majority of the participants are Shiite Muslims, who are the main constituency of the cleric Mr. al-Sadr and the armed groups close to Iran.",JustBadNews,0

Britain's worst paedophile found dead in Yorkshire prison with condoms in throat,http://leeds-live.co.uk/news/yorkshire-news/britains-worst-paedophile-died-yorkshire-17590829,"Never miss a thing from all parts of our city - sign up for free email alerts Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Invalid Email

One of Britain's worst paedophiles died after allegedly being strangled with a guitar string in his Yorkshire prison cell before having condoms stuffed down his throat.

Richard Huckle, who was serving life for abusing up to 200 Malaysian children, was found dead at Full Sutton prison in East Yorkshire on October 13 last year.

It is thought the 33-year-old was stabbed with a 'makeshift blade' in his cell but now GrimsbyLive reports that a source has told The Sun Online: ""He wasn’t just stabbed. He was strangled with a guitar string.""

It is also alleged that he had biros and condoms shoved down his throat.

Humberside Police confirmed an investigation shortly after Huckle was found and last week the force confirmed a 29-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the death.

A file has been submitted to prosecutors for consideration.

(Image: Myspace/PA Wire)

The force's statement said: ""A 29-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the death of a man at HMP Full Sutton on October 13, 2019.

""A file has been submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and we are awaiting their decision regarding charges.""

The force's October statement said: ""An investigation has been launched following an incident at HMP Full Sutton on Sunday, October 13.

""We were called shortly after 12.30pm reporting that a man had died at the prison.

""Humberside Police are working closely with the prison service to investigate the death of an inmate and at this time we are treating the death as suspicious.""

Huckle pleaded guilty to 71 counts of sex abuse against 191 children over nine years, some as young as six months old.

He was given 22 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2016 for an unprecedented number of offences against children between six months and 12 years.

The freelance photographer and gap year teacher, from Ashford in Kent, awarded himself 'pedopoints' for different acts of abuse against 191 youngsters, and sold images of his depravity on the dark web.

In online posts, Huckle bragged that it was easier to target impoverished children in Malaysia than those from wealthy Western backgrounds.

Commenting on one of his victims, he boasted:

""I'd hit the jackpot, a three-year-old girl as loyal to me as my dog and nobody seemed to care.""

At the time of his arrest, he was writing a guide to teach fellow paedophiles how to abuse children and avoid detection.

Huckle was stopped at Gatwick Airport en route to spend Christmas with his family in 2014 after Australian authorities tipped off the UK's National Crime Agency.

Officers seized Huckle's encrypted laptop and managed to uncover more than 20,000 indecent pictures and videos although there were other files they were unable to crack.

Huckle was born into a middle-class, church-going family in Ashford in May 1986. He told police he had an 'ordinary upbringing'.

He was a pupil at the Harvey Grammar School and later South Kent College. He was also regular worshipper at Ashford Baptist Church and attended a congregation in London.

He was described by all who met and knew him as a 'quiet man'. Those who went to school with him said he was 'a bit of a loner, but nothing out of the ordinary'.

Reverend Rob Sylvester, minister of Ashford Baptist Church, said: ''Huckle was never a significant figure within the church, irrespective of the crimes he committed, he never possessed the personal skills to warrant any role with either young people or adults.""

Lack of action on climate change leads to warmest decade ever recorded,http://wsws.org/en/articles/2020/01/20/pers-j20.html,"The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the US space agency NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have all independently concluded that the past decade, 2010 to 2019, experienced the hottest ever recorded global surface temperatures. Each decade since the 1960s has been hotter than the previous one.

The five years, 2015–2019, were the warmest. 2019 was the second hottest year—surpassed only by 2016, when the El Niño weather pattern drove temperatures to the highest level yet registered. The average surface temperature has risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era. Among credible scientists, there is no dispute that the cause is the long-term impact of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas commented: “The year 2020 has started out where 2019 left off—with high impact weather and climate-related events. Australia had its hottest, driest year on record in 2019, setting the scene for the massive bushfires, which were so devastating to people and property, wildlife, ecosystems and the environment. Unfortunately, we expect to see much more extreme weather throughout 2020 and the coming decades, fueled by record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”

Hundreds of millions of people around the world are suffering the impact of human-induced climatic change. In 2019 alone, scientists believe that global warming was the main contributing factor to more intense heat waves, droughts and fire, more regular and severe tropical storms and flooding, increased acidification of oceans, accelerated permafrost melt, the thinning of ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica, and the steady rise in sea levels.

What action is required to stem global warming is well known. Emissions must be drastically reduced through the wholesale deployment of non-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels, combined with the deployment of verified means of capturing existing carbon from the atmosphere. If they are not, the WMO’s Taalas commented, “On the current path… we are heading toward a temperature increase of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.”

Yet, for all the proclamations by corporations and governments that they accept the known dangers and the need to reduce the use of fossil fuels, carbon emissions rose to the highest ever level in 2019, according to estimates by the Global Carbon Project. Even though emissions from coal declined—while still accounting for 40 percent of the global total—overall emissions increased through the use of oil and natural gas.

Immense rage is building up internationally, especially in the working class and among the world’s youth, over the sheer recklessness and criminality of those in power, who have refused to implement the policies necessary to avoid catastrophic global warming.

However, the understanding that must inform the political struggles of the coming months and years is that this corporate and government inaction and indifference stem directly from the irrationality of the capitalist system. A social system that is based on the private ownership of the means of production, the subordination of production to the accumulation of profit, and the division of the globe into rival nation-states, i.e., the capitalist system, is incapable of the coordinated international planning and allocation of resources necessary to address the climate crisis.

Protest appeals to the moral conscience of political and corporate leaders have, in the blunt assessment of teenage climate change activist, Greta Thunberg, “achieved nothing.”

Instead, governments internationally, spearheaded by the Trump administration in the United States, are insisting that continued, and even expanded, fossil fuel use is essential for the competitiveness of their industries and their “national interest.”

Just 100 transnational private and state-owned energy corporations—which generate vast returns for the wealthy elite—are responsible for 71 percent of all emissions. The narrow, short-term dictates of shareholder return, or cheap energy for industry, are given priority over the long-term interests of humanity as a whole.

In Australia, where the fires burning across large parts of the continent have starkly brought home the realities of climate change, Scott Morrison, the country’s prime minister, flatly asserted on the weekend: “I won’t put up a carbon tax. I won’t put up people’s electricity prices and I will not wipe out a resources sector which millions of Australians depend on, particularly regional Australians.”

Morrison—a particularly crude defender of the fossil fuel industry—has no concerns for “millions of Australians,” but for the energy corporations that generate billions of dollars in profit from Australia’s status as the largest global exporter of coal and one of the largest producers of natural gas. As for taxation, successive governments in Australia, paralleling global processes, have slashed the rate of tax on both corporations and personal income. Vast wealth that could have been used for socially useful purposes—including low-cost renewable electricity generation—has been channeled to the top 10 percent, and especially the top 1 percent of the population.

As recent weeks have demonstrated in Australia, the emergency and health services needed to prepare for and respond to increasingly severe disasters are under-resourced and under-staffed, while a tiny proportion of the population has accrued obscene amounts of personal wealth.

Moreover, amid escalating corporate struggles for markets and profit share, nation-states are channeling ever greater resources into war preparations—not the reduction of emissions. Military spending in 2018 increased by another 2.7 percent, to at least $1.8 trillion, most of it by the United States, followed by China, the European powers, Saudi Arabia and India, countries that are also responsible for the highest carbon emissions.

The military apparatus itself is a significant factor in emissions. To sustain its vast global operation of predatory wars and intimidation, the fuel use by the US military alone would have ranked it as the world’s 47th largest emitter in 2017 if it were counted as a separate nation.

On January 3, the World Socialist Web Site perspective, “The decade of socialist revolution begins,” presented a concise and objective summation of the political challenges of the coming period. Those who defend the historically outmoded capitalist order are presiding over the descent toward a catastrophic great power war, the destruction of hard-won democratic rights, the degradation of the environment, unprecedented levels of social inequality and unnecessary deprivation and suffering.

The international working class is the only social force that can bring an end to capitalism and usher in a socialist society that prioritises human need, not private profit. Everything depends, however, on the mass struggles of workers, which are already unfolding in country after country, becoming imbued with socialist consciousness and unified into a worldwide movement for revolutionary change. The efforts of all workers and youth who recognise the gravity of the world situation and the crisis posed by climate change must be devoted to this task.",JustBadNews,0
"Malaysia says it's not a 'dumping site,' sends back trash to 13 countries",http://globalnews.ca/news/6436078/malaysia-sends-back-trash-canada/,"PENANG, Malaysia — Malaysia has sent back 150 containers of plastic waste to 13 mainly rich countries since the third quarter last year, with the environment minster warning on Monday that those who want to make the country a rubbish bin of the world can “dream on.”

Shipments of unwanted rubbish have been rerouted to Southeast Asia since China banned the import of plastic waste in 2018, but Malaysia and other developing countries are fighting back.

Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin said another 110 containers are expected to be sent back by the middle of this year.

Yeo said the successful repatriation of a total 3,737 metric tonnes (4,120 U.S. tons) of waste followed strict enforcement at key Malaysian ports to block smuggling of waste and shuttering more than 200 illegal plastic recycling factories.

Of the 150 containers, 43 were returned to France, 42 to the United Kingdom, 17 to the United States, 11 to Canada, 10 to Spain and the rest to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Portugal, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Lithuania, her ministry said.

She said the Malaysian government didn’t pay a single cent, with the costs of sending back the waste fully borne by the shipping liners and companies responsible for importing and exporting the waste.

Yeo said talks were ongoing with U.S. authorities to take back another 60 containers this year. Canada also has 15 more containers, Japan 14, the U.K. 9 and Belgium 8 from 110 more containers that are still being held at Malaysian ports, she said.

“If people want to see us as the rubbish dump of the world, you dream on,” Yeo told reporters during inspection at a port in northern Penang state.

Yeo said the government will launch an action plan on illegal plastic importation next month that will help the different agencies coordinate enforcement and speed up the process of returning the waste.

“Our position is very firm. We just want to send back (the waste) and we just want to give a message that Malaysia is not the dumping site of the world,” she added.",JustBadNews,0

As crowds swelled, black-clad demonstrators began digging up bricks and vandalising traffic lights in the surrounding roads.

Some set fires and built makeshift barricades, according to RTHK.

A plainclothed officer asked Lau to halt the rally, though Lau only agreed when the officer showed his I.D.

Deadly Mystery Virus Spreads Outside China to New Countries,http://gizmodo.com/mystery-virus-spreads-to-new-countries-outside-china-1841057194,"The Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drives a vehicle as they leave the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, Province on January 11, 2020.

Health officials in Thailand and Japan have announced that a strange new virus, which has killed two people and sickened dozens of others in China, has appeared inside their borders this week. The virus, known as 2019-nCoV, was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December and questions remain about how it spreads, according to the World Health Organization.

Officials in Thailand first identified the new virus in the country on January 13 and announced a second case today. Health officials in Japan publicly announced its first case of the mystery illness on Thursday, noting that a man in his 30s had been diagnosed with the virus before improving enough to be discharged from the hospital on January 15.

The illness is a coronavirus, part of a large family of viruses that can cause symptoms ranging from that of a common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, more commonly known as SARS. The new 2019-nCoV presents as having pneumonia-like symptoms and 41 people have tested positive for the virus so far, with five people still in critical condition from “severe infections.”

Health officials believe that the new virus can only be transmitted from animals to human and that the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan, which sells live animals, may be the culprit. And while there has been no confirmation of human-to-human transmission yet, the new patients in Thailand and Japan did not visit that particular market.

“Considering global travel patterns, additional cases in other countries are likely,” the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement posted online Thursday.

The first death from 2019-nCoV was recorded on January 9 after a 61-year-old man in Wuhan contracted the illness. The second death in China was reported yesterday, identified as a 69-year-old man also in Wuhan who was found to have severe damage to multiple organs and pulmonary tuberculosis.

In Japan, the man’s symptoms started on January 3 while he was traveling in Wuhan. The unnamed man traveled back to Japan on January 6 and was hospitalized upon returning from China, according to the New York Times. Health officials are particular concerned about his case, since he reportedly didn’t visit any market with live animals, though he did have close contact with other pneumonia patients, according to the Center For Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota.

The virus popped up in Thailand after a 61-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan visited the country, according to Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health. The woman didn’t visit the seafood market in Wuhan that has been at the center of the known 2019-nCoV illnesses, but she did visit a different market that may have had live animals.

Obviously, there’s much less concern about this new virus if it can’t be transmitted from person to person. As long as it can only travel from animal to human there are relatively straightforward precautions that can be taken to keep people healthy. The Huanan Seafood Market was shut down and cleaned on January 1, just a day after the potential link was discovered on December 31. The market has since reopened.

Some airports like the one in Narita, Japan are doing thermal scans of passengers to screen for anyone presenting with a fever. And a team at the German Center for Infection Research in Berlin has reportedly developed a new lab test for 2019-nCoV that was published by WHO yesterday.



“Now that this diagnostic test is widely available, I expect that it won’t be long before we are able to reliably diagnose suspected cases. This will also help scientists understand whether the virus is capable of spreading from human to human,” Professor Christian Drosten said in a statement published online. “This is an important step in our fight against this new virus.”

Professor Drosten was on the team behind the Zika virus test that became the standard worldwide.

“The fact that some cases do not seem to be linked with the Huanan seafood market means we cannot exclude the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission,” WHO said in a tweet earlier this week.

"Israel arrests hundreds of Palestinian minors in Jerusalem, violating children's rights",http://haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-arrests-hundreds-of-palestinian-minors-in-jerusalem-violating-child-rig-1.8377280,"The use of force, nighttime arrests, questioning not in the presence of their parents, rides in patrol cars for intimidation and unnecessary handcuffing – these are just some of the violations of the rights of minors arrested by police in the Isawiyah neighborhood of Jerusalem over the past few months.

More than 600 residents have been arrested since the launch of regular police raids in Isawiyeh, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) said. Residents and lawyers say about a third of those who have been held are minors.

In a case reported by B’Tselem, a 13-year-old boy said police officers broke into his house even though they were told that his parents were not at home.

“The policeman pushed my head against the sofa and then hit me in the head with something hard. I think it was a tear gas grenade. I was really scared. They pushed my hands forward, and handcuffed them with plastic cuffs and took me outside while my little brothers were screaming and crying,” the boy said. He was questioned and released a few hours later after his father was summoned to the police station.

By law, minor suspects have a long list of rights. For example, minors may not be arrested or questioned at night, they may not be arrested in educational institutions, or by plainclothes police officers, and may only be arrested “if it is impossible to achieve the purpose of the arrest in a way that is less harmful.”

The police systematically violate the rights of minor suspects in Isawiyah, ACRI says. The law may allow the police to not follow these rules in extreme cases, but the association says it is unfeasible that such exceptional circumstances existed in all these cases, and in any case the police have never presented evidence of such a need.

Three weeks ago, another boy, aged 11 and 10 months, beneath the age of criminal responsibility of 12, was arrested. The police officers put him in a police car, took him for a ride around the neighborhood and then took him to the police station. A video clip of the arrest spread on social media, the child’s great fear and anxiety on display.

Samar, the boy's father, was summoned to the police station. “I arrived there and told the officer that if you think he threw rocks – prove it to me. The policeman showed me a video and said that’s my son, and I told him it’s not him. Only then did they look and it turns out there was nothing. They released him,” Samar said.

Another minor was arrested along with his brother. In this case too, the police drove both boys around the neighborhood in a patrol car and then released them. When he was summoned for investigation, the boy was asked to sign a document in Hebrew, a language he does not know how to read.

About a month and a half ago, two brothers, aged 12 and 16, were arrested after their home was searched, without their parents being present. The boys were taken out to the street surrounded by policemen, in violation of the law that states the detention of minors needs to be conducted as discreetly as possible.

“Regretfully, the law is abandoned on the road to Isawiyah,” wrote ACRI lawyer Tal Hassin, in a letter to the police’s legal adviser, Ayelet Elisher. “We are aware, of course, of the exceptions the law allows for the broad protections it provides for minors, but they are supposed to be implemented only in rare and exceptional cases. In Isawiyah, as the examples above and reality shows – day after day, night after night – the exception has become the rule,” Hassin wrote.

In a letter of reply to Hassin, Superintendent Lines Hemed, the deputy legal advisor to Jerusalem District Police, said the police are careful to protect the rights of minors.

“When a suspect who looks like a minor is caught, without any identifying documents, an attempt is made in the field to locate his parents … if it is ascertained that the minor is beneath the age of criminal culpability, he is released and his parents receive a summons for questioning. At the same time, there are cases in which conditions in the field do not allow the identification of the minor in real time … In these cases, immediately upon clarification of the identity and age of the minor, contact is made with the parents,” Hemed wrote. In addition, the police actions in Isawiyah are necessary to reduce the amount of violence in the neighborhood, he said.

The Israel Police said it has acted over the past few months in Isawiyah “to provide a response to the hundreds of violent incidents and riots against civilians and security forces. In 2019, a dramatic increase occurred in the number of violent disturbances in the neighborhood, while the Israel Police identified clearly nationalist activities of violent and inflammatory nature. Alongside the operations, the Israel Police established an integrated policing center for making police services accessible to the residents of Isawiyah, and has done intensive work to create partnerships for the benefit of the residents.”

The police said further that all the incidents included in the report that included a video clip, the footage showed only the arrest and not the incident that led to the person taken into custody.

In the latest development in the neighborhood, five Isawiyah residents have been arrested after violating an administrative arrest warrant from the homefront commander. As reported by Haaretz two weeks ago, Gen. Tamir Yadai issued an administrative order barring nine residents from leaving their homes after dark.

The order was issued without presentation of any evidence. Five of the youths demonstrably violated the order and were arrested. A court ordered them released on bail on Tuesday but they have refused to pay the bail saying the detention order is illegal as no evidence of any violations on their part have been made presented.",JustBadNews,0

It looks like Iran is ready to start bombing its fake aircraft carrier again,http://businessinsider.com/iran-fixes-fake-aircraft-carrier-so-it-can-bombs-it-2020-1,"Iran has a fake aircraft carrier that it uses for target practice as it trains to take on the US Navy, which routinely puts flattops and other surface vessels in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waterways.

Iran severely damaged its replica of a US Navy Nimitz-class carrier during drills in 2015, and the ship, a painted barge designed to look like a carrier, sat like that for years.

Recent satellite photos taken by Planet Labs and first reported by Defense One show that Iran has completed or is close to completing repair work, meaning it may be preparing to start bombing the fake ship again.

Iran has a fake aircraft carrier. The vessel sat damaged for years, but it appears to be back in action, meaning it’s time for the country’s armed forces to start trying to sink it again.

Satellite images provided to Insider by Planet Labs and first reported by Defense One show that Iran appears to have completed or be close to completing repairs on its mock flattop, a painted barge resembling a US Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, after damaging it during target practice in 2015.

Iran first started constructing a mock-up of a US aircraft carrier in 2014, CNN reported at the time, citing satellite photos of the work being done at the port of Bandar Abbas. The purpose of the carrier construction project was not immediately clear.

Following the CNN report, Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi, who was then commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps naval forces, revealed the point of the replica carrier.

„We have been making and sinking replicas of US destroyers, frigates, and warships for long years,“ he told Iranian media. „We practice the same drills on replica aircraft carriers because sinking and destroying US warships has, is, and will be on our agenda.“

In February the following year, Iran announced that it had destroyed a mock aircraft carrier during the Payambar-e Azam 9 (The Great Prophet 9) war games in the Persian Gulf, where US carriers have routinely sailed for years in shows of force.

Iranian media said that the ship was destroyed by rockets fired from „tens of IRGC speedboats.“ The fake flattop was also struck by IRGC cruise and ballistic missiles, the report said.

The mock carrier was not actually destroyed, but it was damaged. It remained in such a state for years until Iran began actively working to repair it last fall amid heightened tensions with the US, which had deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln and thousands of additional troops to the US Central Command area of responsibility to confront Iran.

In October, one month before construction began, Defense One reported Brig. Gen. Amirali Hajizadeh, the head of Iran’s IRGC Aerospace Force, threatened US bases and carriers.

„Everybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,“ he said.

Hajizadeh’s forces were recently involved in a missile strike on US and coalition forces in Iraq in the wake of a US drone strike the killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

Bryan Clark, a defense expert and former US Navy officer, told Defense One that the mock-up could be used for major exercises in the spring, adding that Iran could use the fake flattop for cruise-missile strikes, small-boat attacks, and drone strikes.",JustBadNews,0

"No survivors after Ukrainian Boeing plane with 176 aboard crashes in Iran. A Ukrainian airliner crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, bursting into flames and killing all 176 people on board.",https://reuters.com/article/us-iran-crash/no-survivors-after-ukrainian-boeing-plane-with-176-aboard-crashes-in-iran-idUSKBN1Z70EL,"DUBAI/KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine outlined four potential scenarios on Thursday to explain the deadly crash of one of its airliners in Iran, including a missile strike and terrorism, as Iranian investigators said the plane was on fire before it fell to the ground.

Kiev said its investigators wanted to search the site of Wednesday’s crash southwest of Tehran for possible debris of a Russian-made missile used by Iran’s military. An initial report by Iran’s civil aviation organization said the plane had experienced an unspecified technical problem.

The Ukrainian International Airlines Boeing 737-800, flying to Kiev and carrying mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians, crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport, killing all 176 people on board.

The Iranian report cited witnesses on the ground and in a passing aircraft flying at a high altitude as saying the plane was on fire while in the air.

It said the three-year-old airliner, which had its last scheduled maintenance on Monday, encountered a technical problem shortly after take-off and started to head toward a nearby airport before it crashed. The report said there was no radio communication from the pilot and that the aircraft disappeared from radar at 8,000 feet (2,440 m).

It is so far unclear if any technical issue could be related to a maintenance fault or defective part.

The disaster puts a renewed spotlight on Boeing, which faces a safety crisis over a different type of 737, though the plane that crashed in Iran does not have the feature thought to have caused crashes of the grounded 737 MAX.

The Iranian report referred to the crash as an accident.

Investigations into airliner crashes are complex, requiring regulators, experts and companies across several international jurisdictions to work together. It can take months to fully determine the cause and issuing an initial report within 24 hours is rare.

A Canadian security source told Reuters there was evidence one of the engines had overheated.

The crash happened hours after Iran launched missile attacks on U.S.-led forces in Iraq, leading some to speculate that the plane may have been hit.

The initial assessment of Western intelligence agencies was that the plane had suffered a technical malfunction and had not been brought down by a missile, five security sources - three Americans, one European and the Canadian - who asked not to be named, told Reuters.

UKRAINIAN THEORIES

Ukraine Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danylov said the country’s investigators wanted to search for possible Russian missile debris after seeing information on the internet.

He referred to an unverified image circulated on Iranian social media purportedly showing the debris of a Russian-made Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile of the kind used by the Iranian military.

Ukrainian investigators into the crash include experts who participated in the investigation into the 2014 shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, Danylov said.

The Malaysian airliner was shot down on July 17, 2014, over territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine as it was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board.

In a televised statement, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier asked people to refrain from speculation, conspiracy theories and hasty evaluations regarding the crash. He declared Thursday a day of national mourning.

Zelenskiy said he would speak by telephone with the Iranian president to step up cooperation in investigating the crash.

Ukraine is looking at various possible causes, including a missile attack, a collision, an engine explosion or terrorism.

Countries recognized under a UN-administered convention as participants should nominate who they wish to be involved in the Iran-led investigation, the Iranian report said.

Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne called his Iranian counterpart to stress the need for Canadian officials “to be quickly granted access to Iran to provide consular services, help with identification of the deceased and take part in the investigation of the crash”, a Canadian statement said.

“Canada and Canadians have many questions which will need to be answered.”

Britain wants a transparent investigation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Thursday following a call between the British leader and Zelenskiy.

“The prime minister said that there needed to be a full credible and transparent investigation into what happened,” the spokesman said.

Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen with the United States’ killing of a top Iranian general on Friday. Tehran retaliated with a missile strike on U.S. targets in Iraq.

The Ukrainian airliner took off at 6:12 a.m. local time and was given permission to climb to 26,000 feet, the report said. It crashed six minutes later near the town of Sabashahr.

Bodies and body parts recovered from the site of the crash have been taken to the coroner’s office for identification, the report said.

Smouldering debris, including shoes and clothes, was strewn across a field where the plane crashed on Wednesday. Rescue workers in face masks laid out scores of body bags.

Onboard were 146 Iranians, 10 Afghans, 11 Ukrainians, five Canadians and four Swedes, the report said, but said some may have held citizenship of other countries.

Ukrainian authorities have said those on board included 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, and 11 Ukrainians.

Online bots are actively spreading false information to steer the blame for the Australian fires away from climate change,http://theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/08/twitter-bots-trolls-australian-bushfires-social-media-disinformation-campaign-false-claims?CMP=soc_567&fbclid=IwAR3JsJ-AYuMkZVaojdAqPaTIqaB6qZoz5k8W9FuD6Q5Sw4rvvuuia8WHnHE,"Bot and troll accounts are involved in a “disinformation campaign” exaggerating the role of arson in Australia’s bushfire disaster, social media analysis suggests.

The bushfires burning across the nation have been accompanied by repeated suggestions of an arson epidemic or “arson emergency”.

The false claims are, in some cases, used to undermine the link between the current bushfires and the longer, more intense fire seasons brought about by climate change.

The Queensland University of Technology senior lecturer on social network analysis Dr Timothy Graham examined content published on the #arsonemergency hashtag on Twitter, assessing 1,340 tweets, 1,203 of which were unique, published by 315 accounts.

Using a Twitter bot detection tool, he assessed a random sample for bot-like characteristics.

His preliminary analysis found there is likely a “current disinformation campaign” on Twitter’s #arsonemergency hashtag due to the “suspiciously high number of bot-like and troll-like accounts”.

He similarly found a large number of suspicious accounts posting on the #australiafire and #bushfireaustralia hashtags.

“Australia suddenly appears to be getting swamped by mis/disinformation as a result of this environmental catastrophe, and we are suffering the consequences in terms of hyped up polarisation and an increased difficulty and inability for citizens to discern truth,” Graham told the Guardian.

Quick Guide Climate change and bushfires Show Does climate change cause bushfires? The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. What is the evidence on rising temperatures? The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. What other effects do carbon emissions have? Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. So is climate change making everything dryer? Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. What do recent weather patterns show? The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires? Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer.

“Looking at the kinds of accounts that post using the #ArsonEmergency hashtag, you see that these are individuals who are hyper-partisan ideologues, behaving in a way that is not reflective of the average Twitter user.

“The conspiracy theories going around (including arson as the main cause of the fires) reflect an increased distrust in scientific expertise, scepticism of the media, and rejection of liberal democratic authority. These are all major factors in the global fight against disinformation, and based on my preliminary analysis it appears that Australia has for better or worse entered that battlefield, at least for now.”

There is no dispute that arson is a serious problem in Australia, or that arsonists have not been active in the current bushfire season. NSW police say they have charged 24 people with deliberately lighting bushfires this season.

But that does not detract from the clear scientific evidence showing climate change is making Australia’s bushfire seasons longer and more severe. The Bureau of Meteorology’s clear advice is that climate change is “influencing the frequency and severity of dangerous bushfire conditions in Australia and other regions of the world, including through influencing temperature, environmental moisture, weather patterns and fuel conditions”.

The BoM states that there is some evidence that “climate change could influence the risk of ignitions from dry-lightning.

“Bushfire weather conditions in future years are projected to increase in severity for many regions of Australasia, including due to more extreme heat events, with the rate and magnitude of change increasing with greenhouse gas concentrations (and emissions),” the bureau says.

Claims about arson are not the only falsehoods being spread on social media. Other patently false claims include that the government has created the bushfire crisis to clear land for high-speed rail. Another absurd claim is that Islamic State is somehow responsible.

Several maps purporting to show the scale of the fires also vastly exaggerate their spread, including an artistic rendition of heat map that the artist never intended to be used as a true representation of the bushfires.",JustBadNews,0
"Iran threatens to attack White House in 'powerful retaliation'. I am sorry, but as an African I have to laugh. Iran doesn't even have a remotely comparable military budget, they are apparently begging for money at funerals now.",http://mol.im/a/7853703,"Advertisement

Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. will 'strike back' harder at Iran if it retaliates against over the killing of military leader Qasem Soleimani.

'These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner,' Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon.

'Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!' he continued.

The president remained largely silent on Twitter for most of the day as he golfed during his last winter vacation day in West Palm Beach.

He broke his silence after returning to Mar-a-Lago from his golf resort and took a hit at lawmakers and politicians who have criticized him for not notifying or consulting Congress before directing the attack.

Trump ordered an air strike on an Iraqi airport in Baghdad, which took out Soleimani – who was classified by the Obama administration as a terrorist.

The attack came just days after protesters who support Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militia raided on New Year's Eve the U.S. embassy in Iraq, which has never been breached before.

Several U.S. politicians and pundits have questioned whether the attack was warranted and have said they haven't seen enough intelligence to warrant the action. Trump said he ordered the killing because Soleimani had ordered attacks on Americans in the Middle East.

Iran has since placed an $80million bounty on Trump's head and threatened to attack the White House in response to the president's warning that any strike on American interests in the region will bring massive retaliation.

President Donald Trump gave two thumbs up and flashed a smile after leaving his golf resort to return to Mar-a-Lago where he threatened to strike back in a 'disproportionate manner' if Iran took retaliatory action against the U.S. for the killing of General Qassem Soleimani

Donald Trump warned Sunday that if Iran retaliates against the U.S. he will take 'disproportionate' action against them. He also said he did not need to notify Congress if he decides to issue another attack

An organizer for a funeral procession for General Qassem Soleimani called on all Iranians to donate $1 each 'in order to gather an $80million bounty on President Trump's head'.

The organizer made the remarks during the procession in Mashad.

Iran has also announced it they will no longer abide by any of the limits of its 2015 nuclear deal.

A statement issued by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's administration said the country will not observe limitations on its enrichment, the amount of stockpiled enriched uranium as well as research and development in its nuclear activities.

It did not elaborate on what levels it would immediately reach in its program.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations watchdog observing Iran's program, could not be immediately reach for comment.

Earlier on Sunday, the Iraqi parliament voted for US troops to be expelled from the country. The vote will 'obligate the government to work towards ending the presence of all foreign troops on Iraqi soil,' the country's media office stated.

'We can attack the White House itself, we can respond to them on the American soil. We have the power, and God willing we will respond in an appropriate time,' Iranian MP Abolfazl Abutorabi (pictured)

As tensions escalate after Soleimani's death, Iranian MP Abolfazl Abutorabi threatened to launch an attack on American soil in retaliation.

'We can attack the White House itself, we can respond to them on the American soil. We have the power, and God willing we will respond in an appropriate time,' Abutorabi said, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency.

Abutorabi went on to say that 'this is a declaration of war, which means if you hesitate you lose'.

'When someone declares war do you want to respond to the bullets with flowers? They will shoot you in the head,' he added.

Abutorabi's threat was made during an open session of parliament in Tehran just days after Iranian military Soleimani was killed in a drone strike on Friday at Baghdad airport. Soleimani was the architect of Tehran's overseas clandestine and military operations as head of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force.

After Sunday's funeral marches in Iraq, where thousands of people gathered, Soleimani's body was flown to the city of Ahvaz in southwest Iran. Video from the scene showed a casket wrapped in an Iranian flag being unloaded from a plane as a military band played and the crowd angrily chanted 'Death to America'.

On Saturday, Revolutionary Guards commander Major General Hossein Salami promised 'a strategic revenge which will definitely put an end to the US presence in the region'.

However, Trump, who Iranian leaders branded as a 'terrorist in a suit', threatened to hit 52 critical targets in Iran in retaliation if Tehran strikes any American interests in the region. He upped the stakes after Iran said it had identified 35 targets for potential strikes and raised its red 'flags of revenge' over a key mosque.

An organizer for a funeral procession for Soleimani reportedly called on all Iranians to donate $1 each 'in order to gather an $80million bounty on President Trump's head'

'Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!' Trump tweeted on Saturday from Mar-a-Lago, after spending the day at his nearby golf course.

'Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently hundreds of Iranian protesters,' Trump said.

'He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years,' he continued.

Trump's threat referenced the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1981, in which 52 US diplomats and citizens were held hostage by student revolutionaries in Iran.

His threat to target sites important to 'Iranian culture' drew many accusations from critics that he was threatening to commit 'war crimes'. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the list of US targets from DailyMail.com.

'They attacked us, & we hit back,' Trump said of the drone strike on Soleimani, which followed assaults on the US embassy in Baghdad by pro-Iranian militiamen.

'If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!' he said.

In a CNN interview, Hossein Dehghan, the military adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, said: 'The response for sure will be military and against military sites.'

'Let me tell you one thing: Our leadership has officially announced that we have never been seeking war and we will not be seeking war,' Dehghan said.

'It was America that has started the war. Therefore, they should accept appropriate reactions to their actions. The only thing that can end this period of war is for the Americans to receive a blow that is equal to the blow they have inflicted. Afterward they should not seek a new cycle,' he added.

Dehghan was referring to Khamenei's statement in May when the supreme leader said Tehran does not seek war with the US.

At the time, Khamenei said: 'There won't be any war. The Iranian nation has chosen the path of resistance. We don't seek a war, and they don't either. They know it´s not in their interests.'

Earlier on Saturday, an Iranian official said at least 35 US targets, including warships and Tel Aviv, have been identified for retaliatory strikes.

Iranian General Gholamali Abuhamzeh, a Revolutionary Guards commander in the southern province of Kerman, said vital American targets in the region were identified a 'long time ago', including ships in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and Tel Aviv.

'The Strait of Hormuz is a vital point for the West and a large number of American destroyers and warships cross there … some 35 US targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv are within our reach,' he said, according to Reuters.

Hezbollah, an Islamic political and militant group, has also warned Iraqi soldiers to stay at least 1,000 meters away from US military bases from Sunday onwards.

A retaliation attack from Iran could be seen 'within weeks' either at home or abroad, a senior congressional staffer told Time.

The staffer said: 'There is no indication that there is going to be a de-escalation in the near future. The only question is how bad is the retaliation going to be and where and what is it going to hit.'

Abuhamzeh's concerning remarks that Iran has previously identified targets seems to confirm the State Department's reasoning behind the airstrike on Friday.

The State Department said: 'General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.'

'The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.'

Meanwhile, one of the Iranian-backed militia Kataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades, warned Iraqi soldiers to vacate any premises near US bases housing American soldiers in a thinly-veiled threat.

'The leaders of the security forces should protect their fighters and not allow them to become human shields to the occupying Crusaders,' the statement said, regarding coalition bases.

Iran is considering its options against America in retaliation for the killing of Quds commander Qassem Soleimeni in Baghdad. The conflict could quickly spiral out of control, dragging in other world powers including Russia, Turkey and China

An Iranian official revealed that at least 35 US targets have been identified for retaliatory strikes, including ships in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Pictured: The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (L), the air-defense destroyer HMS Defender and the guided-missile destroyer USS Farragut transit the Strait of Hormuz in November

Tel Aviv, a prominent city in Israel, has also be singled out as a possible target for attack by General Gholamali Abuhamzeh

In a press conference after Friday's airstrike, Trump said Soleimani was plotting attacks against Americans in a press conference after the airstrike.

'Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him,' the president revealed in a press conference.

Although the specific locations of the 35 targets have not been disclosed, the US Embassy in Baghdad and the military base could be potential targets.

This comes off the heels of the slaying of an American contractor who was killed in a rocket attack a week ago while working at an Iraqi military base in the country's northern region.

The US retaliated by launching an attack on five Popular Mobilization militia bases in Iraq and Syria, killing more than 24 people and inciting a nearly two-day siege of the United States Embassy in Baghdad.

Following Soleimani's death, several Iranian officials and the 62-year-old's supporters vowed revenge on the US.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the US made a 'grave mistake' in killing Soleimani and will supposedly suffer consequences for years to come.

Iran's President Rouhani issues chilling warning that the US made a 'grave mistake' and will face the consequences 'for years to come' after Soleimani's family asks for revenge The President of Iran has issued a chilling warning that the U.S. made a 'grave mistake' by killing the leader of Iran's Quds force, Qassem Soleimani, in an airstrike and that it will face consequences for years to come. In a visit to the notorious general's house on Saturday, one of Soleimani's daughter's asked President Hassan Rhouani for revenge. 'Who is going to avenge my father's blood?' she asked. In response, he promised her that 'everyone will take revenge' and 'we will, we will avenge his blood , you don't worry.' 'The Americans did not realize what a grave mistake they have made. They will suffer the consequences of such criminal measure not only today, but also throughout the years to come,' Rouhani said. 'This crime committed by the US will go down in history as one of their unforgettable crimes against the Iranian nation.' Soleimani, 62, was killed in the early hours of Friday, local time, outside Baghdad's International Airport in an airstrike ordered by President Donald Trump. President Rouhani (right) speaking with General Soleimani's daughters (left) on Saturday Hours after the attack, Trump said that he ordered the killing of Soleimani to prevent war, adding that the commander was plotting 'imminent and sinister' attacks against Americans. The general was the architect of Iran's shadow warfare and military expansion in the Middle East and was targeted specifically because he was actively developing plans to kill members of the U.S. military and diplomats in the region. 'We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war,' the president said in brief remarks at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. Rouhani has said that Iran has the right to seek revenge, saying that that retaliation will come when the 'dirty hands of the US' are removed from the region indefinitely. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatolla Ali Khamenei (pictured) with a member of Soleimani's family during a visit to the family's home on Friday evening Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatolla Ali Khamenei also visited the home on Friday evening where he said the airstrike that killed the architect of the country's infamous militia was 'villainous'. 'Everyone is bereaved & grateful to your father. This gratitude is due to his great sincerity, since hearts are in God's hands. Without sincerity, [people's] hearts wouldn't have been with him like this. May God bestow His blessings on all of us,' he said, recounting the conversation in a tweet. 'You saw people in many cities come out in numbers, with devotion. Wait to see his funeral. These blessings are before us to see the value of martyrdom. What a blessing for Hajj Qasem. He achieved his dream.' In a series of other tweets following the meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the Trump administration as 'villainous' and condemned the airstrike. 'Hajj Qasem Soleimani had been exposed to martyrdom repeatedly, but in performing his duty & fighting for the cause of God, he didn't fear anyone or anything. He was martyred by the most villainous people, the US govt, & their pride in this crime is a distinguishing feature of him,' he wrote on Saturday. He also warned Iran's 'enemies' that the Jihad of Resistance' supposed victory will be 'bitter.' Advertisement

While visiting Soleimani's family on Saturday, Rouhani called the airstrike an 'unforgettable crime'.

'The Americans did not realize what a grave mistake they have made. They will suffer the consequences of such criminal measure not only today, but also throughout the years to come,' Rouhani said.

'This crime committed by the US will go down in history as one of their unforgettable crimes against the Iranian nation.'

Ayatolla Ali Khamenei visited the family on Friday and echoed similar sentiments against the Trump administration.

'Hajj Qasem Soleimani had been exposed to martyrdom repeatedly, but in performing his duty & fighting for the cause of God, he didn't fear anyone or anything. He was martyred by the most villainous people, the US govt, & their pride in this crime is a distinguishing feature of him,' he wrote on Saturday.

He also warned Iran's 'enemies' that the Jihad of Resistance' supposed victory will be 'bitter'.

He wrote: 'All friends—& enemies—know that Jihad of Resistance will continue with more motivation & definite victory awaits the fighters on this blessed path. The loss of our dear General is bitter. The continuing fight & ultimate victory will be more bitter for the murderers & criminals.'

During funeral processions for Soleimani, his supporters chanted 'No, No, America,' 'Death to America, death to Israel' and 'America is the Great Satan.'

Mohammed Fadl, a mourner dressed in black, said the funeral is an expression of loyalty to the slain leaders.

'It is a painful strike, but it will not shake us,' he said.

Thousands chant 'Death to America!' and hold signs vowing revenge at funeral of Soleimani Thousands of furious mourners thronged in the streets of Baghdad today during funeral processions for the slain Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia commander who died with him during yesterday's US strike. They chanted 'Death to America' and 'America is the Great Satan' as they walked beside the coffins of Soleimani, architect of Iran's global military strategy, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Kataeb Hezbollah chief, in Baghdad. The pair had been riding in a two-vehicle convoy which was decimated by three missiles from an American MQ-9 Reaper Drone in the early hours of Friday outside Baghdad International Airport. The strike - which also killed four more Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards and five members of Iraq's pro-Iran paramilitary network - infuriated Tehran, who vowed jihad on America. Thousands of mourners pack the streets of Baghdad on Saturday to mourn Soleimani and Muhandis killed in a US strike outside the Iraqi capital's airport in the early hours of Friday Funeral processions were held for the 62-year-old Soleimani (left), chief of the elite Quds Forces arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, as well Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, 66, (right) commander of a pro-Iran Iraqi militia in Baghdad on Saturday Meanwhile Iraq, whose prime minister attended the funerals today, threatened to order the expulsion of all US troops from the country after what it called 'a brazen violation of Iraq's sovereignty.' President Donald Trump has said that he ordered the killing of Soleimani to prevent war, adding that the commander was plotting 'imminent and sinister' attacks against Americans. Mourners in the Iraqi capital today carried posters of Soleimani and flags of Muhandis's Iran-backed Kataeb Hezbollah militia, which has committed brazen attacks against US bases in recent months, climaxing with a siege of the US embassy on Tuesday. The procession began at the Imam Kadhim shrine in Baghdad, one of the most revered in Shia Islam before crowds headed south to a point near the Green Zone, the high-security district home to government offices and foreign embassies, including America's. Mourners surround a car carrying the coffin of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani through the streets of Baghdad on Saturday Meanwhile thousands of angry demonstrators stood outside the UN offices in Iran's capital, demanding retribution for the killing of Soleimani. The head of Iran's elite Quds Force will be laid to rest Tuesday in his hometown of Kerman as part of three days of ceremonies across the country, the Revolutionary Guards said. Yesterday Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the 62-year-old father-of-five's family home and offered condolences after vowing 'jihad' on America for the drone strike. It comes as Tehran's UN ambassador, who represents Iran's only diplomatic mission within the US, told CNN Friday that the airstrike was 'tantamount to opening a war against Iran.' 'The US has already started a war against Iran, not just an economic war but something beyond that by assassinating one of our top generals,' Ravanchi said. 'There will be harsh revenge... The response for a military action is a military action.' Today mourners in the Iraqi capital, many of them in tears, chanted: 'No, No, America,' and 'Death to America, death to Israel.' Mohammed Fadl, a mourner dressed in black, said the funeral is an expression of loyalty to the slain leaders. 'It is a painful strike, but it will not shake us,' he said. Two helicopters hovered over the procession, which was attended by Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and leaders of Iran-backed militias. The remains will later be taken to the Shiite holy city of Najaf to the south, and the remains of the Guards will then be flown to Iran, which has declared three days of mourning. Following the violent attacks on the embassy during marches for other militant 'martyrs' earlier this week, the U.S. is bracing for the possibility of another assault. Some of the funeral processions were being held in areas close to the heavily-fortified 'Green Zone' and officials are extremely wary of masses of militia close to consular buildings. Any attempt by Iran-backed militias to breach the embassy would 'run into a buzzsaw' of fire from U.S. defenders, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said earlier this week. 'We are very confident that the integrity of that embassy is strong and it is highly unlikely to be physically overrun by anyone,' Milley said at a Pentagon briefing. A US defense official told AFP Saturday that America would scale back military operations in Iraq and devote manpower to defending its bases and troops. 'We will conduct limited anti-Islamic State group operations with our security partners where it mutually supports our force protection efforts,' the official said. 'We have increased security and defensive measures at Iraqi bases that host coalition troops.' NATO announced Saturday it was suspending training missions in Iraq. The NATO mission in Iraq, which numbers in the hundreds, trains the country's security forces at the request of the Baghdad government to prevent the return of the Islamic State group. As tensions soared across the region, there were reports overnight of an airstrike on a convoy of Iran-backed militiamen north of Baghdad. Hours later, the Iraqi army denied any airstrike had taken place. The U.S.-led coalition also denied carrying out any airstrike. The Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of mostly Iran-backed militias, and security officials had reported the airstrike in Taji, north of the capital. An Iraqi security official had said five people were killed and two vehicles were destroyed. It was not immediately clear if another type of explosion had occurred. Advertisement

At least two rockets were reported to have fired near the US Embassy in Baghdad and three were fired at Balad Airbase housing US troops, about 50 miles north of the city.

After the rockets landed, security around the embassy's perimeter, located in the the green zone were rammed up in response.

Of the three missiles that fired from the airbase, two Katyusha rockets fell inside the base and it was not immediately clear how many US troops are being housed inside.

A number of rockets also landed in the Al-Jadiriya neighborhood, according to the Iraq Army, although it is not clear if that was the intended target.

There have been no reports of injuries and it is not clear who fired the rockets.

Rockets launched at US Embassy in Baghdad and military airbase housing American soldiers Rockets were fired near the US Embassy in Baghdad and a military airbase housing American troops a day after General Qassem Soleimani was killed in an air strike. On January 1, pro-Iran protesters stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad, and lit fires outside At least two rockets landed near the embassy, which is located in the security-tight Green Zone. It also reported that security at the embassy's perimeter was stepped up after the rockets fell. Earlier this week, pro-Iran protesters stormed the US embassy in a siege that lasted just over a day. Another three rockets were fired at Balad Airbase housing American troops, about 50 miles north of the city, according to Reuters. Of those, two Katyusha rockets fell inside the base. It's not clear how many US troops are being house at the base.

Iranians raise blood red 'flags of revenge' for General Qassem Soleimani's killing Iranians raised the blood-red 'flags of revenge', vowing to retaliate after the US killed general Qassem Soleimani in an airstrike in Baghdad. Iranian state TV broadcast the flag being hoisted over the minarets at the revered Jamkaran Mosque in the holy city of Qom on Saturday. In Shia Islam the red flags, which have also been flown at demonstrations in Tehran, symbolize blood spilled unjustly and serve as a call to avenge the person who is slain. It comes as Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei and President Hassan Rouhani consoled Soleimani's distraught children at his family home last night, reassuring them the commander would be avenged. As the flag was raised in Qom, the mosque speakers called, 'O Allah, hasten your custodian reappearance,' a reference to the end-times reappearance of the Mahdi. Protesters demonstrate over the U.S. airstrike in Iraq that killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Tehran, Iran, Saturday. Red flags in Shia tradition symbolize both blood spilled unjustly and serve as a call to avenge a person who is slain In Shia Islam, the faith of Iran, the Mahdi is a divine figure who will appear to bring a Day of Judgement and rid the world of evil. According to local reports it is the first time in the Qom mosque's history - a holy site since the Middle Ages - that the red flag has been raised over the building. Last night Khamanei and Rouhani consoled Soleimani's family. 'Who is going to avenge my father's blood?' One of the commander's daughters asked. In response, Rouhani promised her that 'everyone will take revenge' and assured her as she wept, 'we will, we will avenge his blood, you don't worry.' 'The Americans did not realize what a grave mistake they have made. They will suffer the consequences of such criminal measure not only today, but also throughout the years to come,' Rouhani said. 'This crime committed by the US will go down in history as one of their unforgettable crimes against the Iranian nation.' Soleimani, 62, was killed in the early hours of Friday, local time, outside Baghdad's International Airport in an airstrike ordered by President Donald Trump. Hours after the attack, Trump said that he ordered the killing of Soleimani to prevent war, adding that the commander was plotting 'imminent and sinister' attacks against Americans. The general was the architect of Iran's shadow warfare and military expansion in the Middle East and was targeted specifically because he was actively developing plans to kill members of the U.S. military and diplomats in the region. Thousands of mourners took to the streets of Tehran on Saturday where the red flag was also seen fluttering before a downtown mosque in the Iranian capital. Meanwhile in Baghdad, shouts of 'Death to America' filled the air as tens of thousands of people marched to mourn Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was also killed in the US strike. A PMF-organised procession carrying the bodies of Soleimani, Muhandis and other Iraqis killed in the US strike took place in the city's heavily fortified Green Zone. Mourners included many militiamen in uniform for whom Muhandis and Soleimani were heroes. They carried portraits of both men and plastered them on walls and armoured personnel carriers in the procession. Advertisement

In another unsettling event, Iran has unfurled a red flag, signifying revenge, on top of the Jamkaran Mosque, in Qom.

The US has since ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and closed their Baghdad based embassy, where Iranian militiamen and supporters staged violent protests outside the building for two days. Additionally, NATO has suspended training Iraqi security and armed forces in the region.

Spokesman Dylan White said: 'The safety of our personnel in Iraq is paramount.'

Several US cities have also begun taking precautions against any potential attacks by bolstering security.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the NYPD will take steps to protect 'certain locations' from 'from any attempt by Iran or its terrorist allies to retaliate against America'.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would bolster security in the wake of the Iranian airstrike

Bill de Blasio: 'We are in an unprecedented situation today, but the NYPD is ready for any scenario. New Yorkers will see heightened security at locations around the city, but there is NO credible and specific threat at this time. If you see something, say something'

'No one has to be reminded that New York City is the number one terror target in the United States. We're taking escalation in the Middle East seriously — and I have absolute faith in the NYPD to protect this city and keep every New Yorker safe,' he said in a tweet.

Gov Andrew Cuomo added that the Department of Public Service has been in contact with all electric, telephone, water and natural gas utilities in New York in an effort to increase vigilance for cybersecurity and physical security.

The Los Angeles Police Department and Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, DC, have also announced mounting security.

The LAPD is in talks with law enforcement at all levels and say there is not credible threat as of now.

Bowser released a statement saying Metropolitan Police and Homeland Security were working to monitor evolving events.

'While there are no immediate threats to the District of Columbia, we remain vigilant and [Metropolitan Police Department] & [DC Emergency Management and Homeland Security] will remain in close contact with regional and federal partners to monitor evolving events — both at home and abroad,' she said.",JustBadNews,0
"Australia's 'insurance' koala population halved by bushfires: At least half of Australia's only disease-free koala population, a key insurance for the species' future, is feared dead.",http://thehindu.com/news/international/australias-insurance-koala-population-halved-by-bushfires/article30484076.ece,"‘It’s one of the biggest tragedies for the koala population since the late 1800s when they used to hunt them for their fur’

At least half of Australia’s only disease-free koala population, a key “insurance” for the species’ future, is feared dead with more badly hurt after bushfires swept through an island sanctuary, rescuers said on Sunday.

Kangaroo Island, a popular nature-based tourist attraction off the coast of South Australia state, is home to many wild populations of native animals including the much-loved koala, where the populated was estimated at 50,000.

Massive bushfires have flared up in the vast country’s southeast in a months-long crisis, killing nearly half a billion native animals in New South Wales state alone, scientists estimate.

Conditions have been particularly severe in recent days, with an ongoing blaze on Kangaroo Island spreading rapidly and razing 170,000 hectares — one-third of the island — on Friday.

“Over 50% (of the population) has been lost,” Sam Mitchell of Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, which is raising funds to care for the injured koalas, told AFP.

“Injuries are extreme. Others have been left with no habitat to go back to, so starvation will be an issue in coming weeks.” A University of Adelaide study published in July found that the Kangaroo Island koala species is particularly important to the survival of the wider population as it is the only large group free from chlamydia.

The bacterial infection — which causes blindness, infertility and death in the species — is widespread in koalas in the eastern Queensland and New South Wales states and also occurs in Victoria state.

“They are an insurance population for the whole population,” the University of Adelaide’s Jessica Fabijan, who carried out the study, told AFP. “These fires have ravaged the population.” Ms. Fabijan said massive bushfires in New South Wales and Victoria’s Gippsland region, home to major koala populations, is also expected to have killed many animals.

“It’s one of the biggest tragedies for the population since the late 1800s when they used to hunt them for their fur,” she added.

Habitat loss, dog attacks, car strikes and climate change have already led to a sharp decline in the furry marsupial’s population, which is believed to have numbered more than 10 million prior to European settlement of the continent in 1788.

The koalas cannot be removed from the island due to their chlamydia-free status, the state government said, adding that veterinarians were rescuing and treating the injured animals on-site.",JustBadNews,0
"Shock, fear and sadness grip Australia's 'bushfire refugees' | Thousands of Australians forced from their homes by rampaging bushfires now find themselves stuck in makeshift camps, fearful for the future and turned refugees in their own country",http://phys.org/news/2020-01-sadness-australia-bushfire-refugees.html,"Towering bushfires in Australia have turned the sky red and forced thousands from their homes

Thousands of Australians forced from their homes by rampaging bushfires now find themselves stuck in makeshift camps, fearful for the future and turned refugees in their own country.

On golf courses, cricket ovals and showgrounds—anywhere with a minimal amount of combustible tree cover—Australians are sheltering from a climate-fuelled disaster.

At the Catalina Country Club in Batemans Bay, New South Wales, rows of caravans, 4x4s, pick-up trucks and tents are pitched cheek by jowl.

The golf club's dining room has been converted into an evacuation centre.

Instead of players supping a beer after a summer's day of play, elderly displaced ladies huddle around cups of tea and play cards to pass the time.

Stacks of donations—food, clothing, water—are piled high and there is a steady stream of people walking in and out.

Some new arrivals quip that they are refugees.

But even in a country accustomed to bushfires and which prides itself on resilience in extreme conditions, the last few days, weeks and months have been shocking.

Towering blazes have turned the sky black and choking smoke has covered whole cities—as well as parts of neighbouring New Zealand and New Caledonia—amid searing images of families forced to wade into the ocean for safety.

Many people have taken refuge in spots where there is minimal amount of combustible tree cover

For many, the future is riddled with uncertainty: about whether their homes still stand, when they can return and—with months of summer still to go—about when all this will end.

Many are facing this uncertainty while dealing with the trauma of what they have lived through.

Narelle Coady, 54, took refuge at a Batemans Bay beach on Saturday when her home came under threat for the second time in five days.

""We defended on Tuesday and it was just too scary,"" she told AFP. ""Really bad, couldn't breathe. Oxygen gone. It was horrible.""

""That was my first and last time.""

Batemans Bay motel owner Justine Donald, 40, evacuated her home on New Year's Eve in a scene she described as looking like ""the end of the world"".

""The town went black,"" she said. ""It was black, orange and so thick that to breathe it in, you thought you were going to suffocate.""

For many who have fled the fires, there is uncertainty about whether their homes will be standing when they return

""That frightened me so much for my life that now I don't even think about the properties.""

""It's devastating,"" she said, at times becoming tearful. ""My main thing is I just want to be alive and for all of us to be safe.""

""If that's going to happen again today, I'm going to need a good big bottle of wine and hopefully be stuck inside with towels under my doors because I'm not going to go outside into that again.""

Mick Cummins, 57, also recalled New Year's Eve when he left his home as fires tore up the east coast.

""Hellfire came over the hill,"" he said. ""We just sat there and watched explosion after explosion, the bowling club went up, the houses down the street went up.""

He remembered the fires from 1994 as particularly bad. But compared with this year, they were ""just a barbeque"", he said.

""We're here until we can go home,"" said his wife Ulla. ""They're saying we're probably not going to have power until next week. And if we've got no power, we've got no phone service either. We're stuck.""

One resident of Batemans Bay described the scene as she fled as looking like the 'end of the world'

Wes Moreton, a 30-year-old father of five left his home, but then was forced to leave his place of refuge as the fire front moved north.

He took no chances and headed with his family to Sydney. Like so many, he is unsure whether they will have a home when they return.

""Fingers crossed it's still standing,"" he said.

Tracey Milanovich, 37, is charged with six counts of obtaining property over $250 by trick, attempt to commit a crime, criminal harassment, larceny over $1,200 and intimidating a witness, a spokesman for the Fall River District Court in Somerset, Massachusetts, told CNN.

She pleaded not guilty at her arraignment on Monday and was released on personal recognizance. Her next court appearance is scheduled for February 21, the court said.

CNN called Milanovich's attorney for comment but has not yet received a response.

Through a business called Tracy's Psychic Palm Reader, police said Milanovich convinced a client that she needed to provide cash and purchase household items, including towels and bedding, to banish a spirit from her daughter. Milanovich was found to have stolen approximately $71,000 from the woman, the department said.

"French police shoot dead man near Paris after fatal stabbing. French police shot dead a man near Paris on Friday after he went on the rampage with a knife in a park, killing one person and wounding two more, a prosecutor said.",https://reuters.com/article/us-france-security/french-police-shoot-dead-man-near-paris-after-fatal-stabbing-idUSKBN1Z21DX,"VILLEJUIF, France (Reuters) - French police shot dead a man near Paris on Friday after he went on a rampage with a knife in a park, killing one person and wounding two more, prosecutors said.

Religious documents including a copy of the Koran were found among the man’s belongings, but there was no evidence the man had been influenced by radical Islamists, a spokesman for prosecutors said.

The attacker had a history of mental illness, had been admitted to hospital a few months ago, and was undergoing a course of psychiatric treatment, the spokesman said.

The attack happened in the town of Villejuif, about 8 km (5 miles) south of central Paris. Police cordoned off the area, and ambulances and police vehicles lined a road approaching the park.

The attack comes as the French capital has been rocked by major attacks resulting in mass casualties in the past four years.

The two injured victims were being treated in nearby hospitals, Laure Beccuau, the prosecutor whose office is handling the case, told reporters.

“The suspect tried to attack other victims during his murderous spree, who were able to escape,” she said.

Laurent Nunez, the deputy interior minister, visited the scene and said the attacker likely would have hurt more people if police had not shot him when they did. “It was an extremely courageous act,” Nunez said of the police response.

The prosecutor’s spokesman said the attacker, identified only as Nathan C., was born in 1997 in Lilas, a northeastern suburb of Paris.

One witness described hearing the attacker shout “Allahu Akbar,” or “God is great,” during the knife attack in the park, according to the spokesman.

But he said: “We don’t have evidence that would allow us to suppose there has been a radicalization.” The man was not known to domestic intelligence services and had no criminal record, the spokesman said.

During the attack, the man first targeted a woman. The woman’s spouse intervened to protect her, and in the process he was fatally stabbed. The woman was not gravely wounded, the spokesman said.

In October last year, four people were stabbed to death at the Paris police headquarters by Mickael Harpon, an IT specialist working for the police. Prosecutors said that Harpon, who was shot dead by police, had come under the sway of radical Islamists.

Updated: Jan 03, 2020, 13:51 IST

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison faced enraged hecklers and an angry firefighter in a town ravaged by bushfires, piling pressure on the leader amid an unprecedented crisis that has killed at least 18 people.

A firefighter refused to shake Morrison’s hand when he visited the town of Cobargo in New South Wales state on Thursday.

Video footage showed Morrison tried to grab the man’s hand, who then got up and walked away, sparking an apology from the Prime Minister. A local fire official explained that the man had lost his house while defending others’ homes.

Another man blasted Morrison for watching fireworks over Sydney Harbour from his official waterfront mansion, Kirribilli House, while fires raged further south on New Year’s Eve.

“You won’t be getting any votes down here, buddy. You’re an idiot,” the man shouted.

“I don’t see Kirribilli burning after the fireworks,” he screamed.

Morrison said on Friday he didn’t take the attacks personally.

“I just see it as a sense of frustration and hurt and loss and anger that is out there about what is the ferocity of these natural disasters,” he told reporters in Bairnsdale in eastern Victoria state.

“And I understand that, and we will seek to provide that comfort and support in whatever way we can,” he said.

Morrison had walked away from a Cobargo woman who urged him to provide more funding to the town and state firefighters.

“This is not fair. We’re totally forgotten about down here. Every single time this area has a flood or a fire, we get nothing,” another woman shouted as Morrison drove away.

Even a state politician from his own Liberal party whose seat is in the region took a swipe at the Prime Minister.

“To be honest, the locals probably gave him the welcome he probably deserved,” said New South Wales transport minister Andrew Constance.

The Prime Minister, who won a surprise election victory last May, ended 2019 on a sour note with fires raging across five states while he took off on a family holiday to Hawaii. Facing criticism, he cut the holiday short and apologised for making a mistake.

He is now considering cancelling an official trip to India scheduled for Jan. 13 to 16, due to the fire emergency.

“I’m inclined not to proceed on that visit,” Morrison said on Friday.",JustBadNews,0

Germans think Trump is more dangerous than Kim Jong Un and Putin,http://m.dw.com/en/germans-think-trump-is-more-dangerous-than-kim-jong-un-and-putin/a-51802332,"Although Washington is one of Germany's closest allies, public trust in the US has significantly eroded under President Donald Trump, a new YouGov survey showed.

Germans were asked who was more dangerous: North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Russian President Vladimir Putin or US President Donald Trump.

Some 41% of Germans said they thought Trump was the most dangerous out of the five world leaders.

In second place was Kim with 17%, followed by Putin and Khamenei with 8%. Coming in last was China's Xi with 7%.

Over 2,000 people in Germany took part in the survey, which was commissioned by news agency dpa.

A similar YouGov poll was carried out in July last year, in which 48% of Germans surveyed said Trump was more dangerous than Kim and Putin. That poll, however, did not include the leaders of Iran or China.

Donald Trump on Germany: Top quotes The good, the bad and the ugly US President Donald Trump has offered both candid praise and unabashed criticism of Germany and its policies. From calling German Chancellor Angela Merkel ""possibly the greatest world leader"" to describing her open-door refugee policy as a ""catastrophic mistake,"" here are his most memorable quotes regarding Germany.

Donald Trump on Germany: Top quotes 'Greatest' ""Germany's like sitting back silent, collecting money and making a fortune with probably the greatest leader in the world today, Merkel,"" Trump said in a 2015 interview with US news magazine Time.

Donald Trump on Germany: Top quotes 'Very bad' ""The Germans are bad, very bad ... Look at the millions of cars they sell in the US. Terrible. We'll stop that,"" Trump said during a NATO leaders summit, according to German news magazine Der Spiegel, which cited sources at the alliance's meeting.

Donald Trump on Germany: Top quotes 'Something in common' ""As far as wiretapping, I guess, by - you know - [the Obama] administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,"" Trump said in March during a press conference with Merkel. He was referring to his unproven allegations that ex-President Barack Obama tapped his phone. There was widespread anger in Germany in 2013 when it was revealed the US National Security Agency tapped Merkel's phone.

Donald Trump on Germany: Top quotes 'Illegals' ""I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals (sic), you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from,"" Trump said in a joint interview published by German daily Bild and British newspaper The Times, referring to Merkel's open-door policy for refugees fleeing war and persecution.

Donald Trump on Germany: Top quotes 'Germany owes vast sums of money' ""Despite what you have heard from the fake news, I had a great meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO and the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany,"" Trump said in a two-tweet statement after meeting with Merkel for the first time in March 2017.

Donald Trump on Germany: Top quotes 'Turning their backs' ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition,"" Trump tweeted in the midst of a row within the German goverment. He went on to claim that: ""Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!""

Macron trusted more than Merkel

A separate year-end poll showed that public trust in German Chancellor Angela Merkel had also diminished at home, particularly when compared to other European leaders.

According to a poll carried out by the Kantar institute for the Funke media group, 57% of Germans surveyed said they had a ""rather high"" level of trust in French President Emmanuel Macron.

Merkel, on the other hand, came in several points behind the French leader at 53%.

The differences were even more pronounced on the other end of the scale, with 44% of Germans surveyed saying they had ""very little"" trust in Merkel, compared to 32% for Macron.

In that poll, Trump came in last as the least trustworthy leader (89% very little trust), behind Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (86%) and Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson (71%). Developments in all three NATO allies since around 2016 have gained considerable media attention in Germany.

'This is mass rape': Uighur activist condemns program said to pay Chinese men to sleep with Uighur women to promote 'ethnic unity',http://insider.com/uighur-activists-mass-rape-chinese-men-xinjiang-2019-12,"A Uighur activist has spoken out against China's ""Pair Up and Become Family"" program, in which Han Chinese men are sent to China's western region of Xinjiang to live with Uighur women, many of whose husbands have been sent to prison camps.

The program, first introduced in 2017, was discussed in an October report by Radio Free Asia that cited two unnamed Chinese officials. The report outlined a horrific program in which many of the Chinese men would often sleep in the same beds as the women.

""Normally one or two people sleep in one bed, and if the weather is cold, three people sleep together,"" one official told RFA.

""It is now considered normal for females to sleep on the same platform with their paired male 'relatives,'"" he said in reference to the men, who are referred to as ""relatives"" even though they are not family.

According to the report, these Chinese officials typically stay in Uighur households for up to six days at a time and work and eat with Uighur families while also discussing Communist Party political ideology.

""They help [the families] with their ideology, bringing new ideas,"" one official told RFA. ""They talk to them about life, during which time they develop feelings for one another.""

Chinese officials say the program is used to ""promote ethnic unity,"" a second official told RFA, but it also lets the government keep close tabs on ethnic minorities living in China's western Xinjiang autonomous region.

Rushan Abbas, a US-based Uighur activist whose family members have been detained in one of what is believed to be hundreds of detention centers in the region, told the Australian news outlet News.com.au that the program was promoting systemic rape against Uighur women.

""This is mass rape,"" she told News.com.au. ""The government is offering money, housing, and jobs to Han people to come and marry Uighur people.""

She added that it was often difficult for Uighur women to refuse advances of these men because of the crackdown in the region against the minority group on the pretense of counterterrorism.

""Neither the girls nor their families can reject such a marriage because they will be viewed [by Chinese authorities] as Islamic extremists for not wanting to marry atheist Han Chinese,"" she told the outlet. ""They have no choice but to marry them.""

""[The Han Chinese] have been raping Uighur women in the name of marriage for years,"" she added.

China has been accused of running mass detention centers in Xinjiang. Interviews with people who were held in the camps reveal allegations of beatings and food deprivation as well as medical experimentation on prisoners.

China has acknowledged the existence of some ""reeducation camps"" but has repeatedly denied reports of abuse at its facilities.

The region has a population of about 10 million people, many of whom are Uighur or other ethnic minorities, and in May, US Assistant Secretary of Defense Randall Schriver said ""at least a million but likely closer to 3 million citizens"" were detained in these facilities.

The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination last year called on China to ""halt the practice of detaining individuals who have not been lawfully charged, tried, and convicted for a criminal offense in any extra-legal detention center."" The committee also called out China's practice of racial and ethnic profiling and heavy-handed restrictions that disproportionately targeted the Uighur community.

Satellite images reviewed by the Washington-based East Turkistan National Awakening Movement earlier this month identified at least 465 detention centers, labor camps, and suspected prisons in Xinjiang.

A recent leak of classified Chinese government documents known as the ""China Cables"" laid out a manual for exactly how the detention centers were to operate, from preventing escape by double locking all the doors to using a ""points system"" based on behavior that is linked ""directly to rewards, punishments, and family visits.""",JustBadNews,0

'This is mass rape': China slammed over programme that 'appoints' men to sleep with Uighur women.,http://nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12295956,"Western coverage of one of China's worst human rights abuses – the mass detainment of over a million Muslim Uighurs – has increased over the past year.

Satellite images revealed the Government destroying scores of traditional burial grounds belonging to Uighurs in northwest Xinjiang; drone footage revealed hundreds of blindfolded and shackled men being transferred to detention camps; and just last month, secret Chinese Government documents revealed how the regime was instructed to deal with the ethnic minority.

But lesser reported on is a disturbing policy implemented in the northwest region – a forced-living arrangement between Han Chinese men and Uighur women that's been likened to ""mass rape"".

The Government claims it's designed to promote harmony between the different cultural groups. But activists tell a different story.

'MASS RAPE': CHINA'S SHOCKING 'PAIR UP' PROGRAMME

In November, various Western media outlets reported that Han Chinese men had been assigned to monitor the homes of Uighur women whose husbands had been detained in prison camps.

The reports came out after an anonymous Chinese official gave an interview with Radio Free Asia, confirming the program but denying there was anything sinister about it.

As part of the ""Pair Up and Become Family"" programme, Han Chinese men stay with and sleep in the same beds as Uighur women.

According to the Chinese Government, the programme is designed to ""promote ethnic unity"".

But to Rushan Abbas, a Uighur activist whose family members have been detained in the Xinjiang camps for more than a year, it's nothing more than systemised rape – part of the Government's brutal ongoing crackdown against the country's ethnic minority.

""This is mass rape,"" she told news.com.au. ""The Government is offering money, housing and jobs to Han people to come and marry Uighur people.

""Neither the girls nor their families can reject such a marriage because they will be viewed (by Chinese authorities) as Islamic extremists for not wanting to marry atheist Han Chinese. They have no choice but to marry them.

""(The Han Chinese) have been raping Uighur women in the name of marriage for years. It took more than a year for the media to pick that up.""

While the Chinese Government claims the program is about promoting unity, it also allows officials to keep a close eye on the Uighurs who have spent decades living under increased surveillance.

Human rights organisations have slammed the program, saying there is ""no evidence that families can refuse such visits"" and describing it as ""deeply invasive forced assimilation practices"".

Last month, a Chinese official told Radio Free Asia the purpose of the program was to ""help the families with their ideology, bringing new ideas … they talk to them about life, during which time they develop feelings for one another"".

""Normally one or two people sleep in one bed, and if the weather is cold, three people sleep together,"" he said, adding ""it is now considered normal for females to sleep on the same platform with their paired male 'relatives'"".

They claimed the ""relatives"" and their female hosts sleep at least a metre apart at all times and that male Communist Party officials have never tried to take advantage of women.

Ms Abbas says this is all lies. ""Tons of pregnancies are coming up,"" she said. ""Tons of forced abortions. This is mass rape disguised as 'marriage'. Uighur girls are forced to marry Han Chinese men with government gratifications.""

WHY IS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TARGETING XINJIANG?

Hostility towards the Uighur people stems back decades but has increased sharply under China's current leader Xi Jinping.

The crackdown on Xinjiang is partly fuelled by Islamophobia. Mr Xi's government is increasingly cracking down on religious worship across the country, but Muslims have been especially targeted.

The crackdown is also economic. Mr Xi has a grand plan in motion to put his country at the economic and political centre of the world.

These ambitions are best summed up by the Belt and Road Initiative, a trillion-dollar project that seeks to connect countries across continents on trade, with China at its centre.

Geographically, Urumqi – the capital of Xinjiang – is a crucial intersection point in the ""Belt"" part of the project.

It also shares several international borders: Mongolia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

The last thing the Chinese Government wants for such a crucial region in this plan is unrest or the loss of control. And that's where the intense security crackdown comes in.

This explains why the crackdown escalated around five years ago, in line with the Belt and Road Initiative taking off.

'MY FAMILY DISAPPEARED'

Ms Abbas has long spoken out against the human rights abuses in Xinjiang – a move that has had disastrous consequences for her family in China.

In September last year, she spoke about the conditions in the camps while seated on a panel hosted by a Washington think tank.

Six days later, her aunt and sister both disappeared at the same time – despite living 1400 kilometres away from each other.

""My sister is a medical doctor. Their 'vocational training' shouldn't apply to her. My aunt is a retired schoolteacher. Both of them went to Chinese school and speak fluent Chinese. They shouldn't have been targets,"" Ms Abbas said.

Even from her home in Virginia, US, Ms Abbas says she feels unsafe. ""There's always that concern. But we all live once and we all die someday. If I only think about my own safety and my own life, who will do the right thing and speak up about this atrocity? If my sister is sitting in some cell block facing torture and abuse, I'm sure she is hoping that I will be doing something to save her and other millions of Uighurs, so I have to keep doing what I'm doing.""

'MASS EXTERMINATION IS NEXT'

The camps in Xinijang are given various names in the media. Some refer to them as ""mass internment camps"". Others call them ""surveillance facilities"", ""re-education camps"" or simply ""detention centres"".

But Ms Abbas repeatedly refers to them as ""concentration camps"" and warns if the Western world doesn't intervene, the mass detention will turn into mass murder.

""Our children are unable to speak our language and understand our culture,"" she said. ""They are taken to state-run orphanages and are completely indoctrinated.

""I'm afraid this will turn into mass extermination. There's nothing better to describe what's happening in Xinjiang than concentration camps. What are we waiting for? Mass executions and gas chambers before we take action? What is it going to take to have the leaders of world communities – particularly Western democratic countries like Australia and New Zealand – to act? Executions? Is that what it's going to come down to?""",JustBadNews,0
A 6-year-old girl found a disturbing hand-written note in a Christmas card that claimed foreign prisoners were being forced to work in China,http://businessinsider.com/tesco-stopped-production-chinese-factory-over-prison-labor-claim-2019-12,"The UK-based grocery-store chain Tesco has halted production at a factory in China after a report that the factory used forced labor to produce Christmas cards.

A Sunday Times report said a 6-year-old London girl found a disturbing handwritten note in a Christmas card purchased at the chain in which the author described being a foreign prisoner forced to work.

Similar pleas detailing forced labor in China have popped up in clothing and other products in the UK and the US.

Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories.

Tesco, the massive UK-based grocery-store chain, has announced that it halted production at a factory in China over a claim that the factory used forced labor to produce Christmas cards.

Peter Humphrey broke the story at The Sunday Times that a 6-year-old girl in South London found a handwritten plea for help inside a Christmas card she bought from Tesco.

The front of the card was decorated with a kitten in a Santa hat, but the inside contained a disturbing message from someone claiming to be a prisoner who was forced to work.

„We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China,“ the message said in capital letters. „Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization.“

The girl’s father, Ben Widdicombe, told the Associated Press that the family initially thought the note was a „prank.“ They soon realized it was legitimate, however, and contacted Humphrey, who was requested by name in the note. Humphrey as a corporate investigator was detained for several years in China in the same prison.

Tesco said in a statement after the report that all the cards had been pulled from sale, that it had suspended its use of the factory, and that because the grocery giant „would never allow“ the use of prison labor in its supply chain, it was launching an investigation.

„We have a comprehensive auditing system in place and this supplier was independently audited as recently as last month and no evidence was found to suggest they had broken our rule banning the use of prison labor,“ the statement said. „If a supplier breaches these rules, we will immediately and permanently delist them.“

Similar pleas from forced labor in Chinese facilities have surfaced in the West before.

Primark launched an investigation in 2014 after finding a note written in Chinese that was hidden in a pair of pants claiming inmates were forced to make clothes for 15 hours a day, the BBC reported.

In 2017, a Walmart customer found a note in a purse detailing harsh conditions that included 14-hour workdays, beatings, and malnourishment at a prison in the Chinese region of Guangxi.

China’s massive rise as an economic giant has capitalized on „the production of labor-intensive, cheap goods for export“ that has created instances of forcibly employing children, disabled people, and federally detained people in dangerous work conditions, according to the Global Slavery Index.",JustBadNews,0
Hong Kong police say they froze $9 million meant for protesters,http://cnn.com/2019/12/20/asia/hong-kong-protests-money-frozen-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Hong Kong police say they have frozen about $9 million in funds raised by anti-government protesters, and arrested four members of a prominent fundraising group on allegations of money laundering.

Chan Wai-kei, the acting superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau's financial investigation division, said Thursday that police also seized about $16,700 in cash, 3,300 supermarket coupons, two lasers pointers, six arrows and ""a lot"" of protective gear. The four were taken in on money laundering offenses, Chan said.

Chan said the four suspects were connected to the Spark Alliance, a nonprofit formed in 2016 that helps arrested protesters to pay their legal fees. The group has raised $2.3 million in donations in the past six months, police said.

Over 6,000 people have been arrested during more than six months of political unrest in the semiautonomous Chinese city. Many face charges of rioting, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

Police allege that some of the donations to Spark Alliance were diverted to a shell company, and some were used to purchase personal insurance products. One of the four people arrested is the beneficiary of the insurance policies and the owner of the shell company, Chan said.

A samo sformułowanie „tęczowa zaraza”? Zrodziło się ono podczas homilii na zasadzie skojarzenia z wierszem Józefa Szczepańskiego „Ziutka”, którego fragmenty wówczas cytowałem – mówił.

– Dla mnie nie ulega wątpliwości, że ideologia LGBT jest taką „zarazą”, która atakuje serca i umysły ludzi, podobnie jak przed laty serca i umysły ludzi atakowała ideologia bolszewicka, marksistowska. I to zwycięsko, przynajmniej na jakiś czas, atakowała także umysły ludzi naprawdę wybitnych – wyjaśniał, podając przykład filozofa Leszka Kołakowskiego.

Jędraszewski porównał szerzenie się „ideologii LGBT do epidemii cholery z Poznania w XIX wieku. – Dla nikogo wtedy nie ulegało wątpliwości, że w sytuacji powszechnego zagrożenia trzeba ludzi za wszelką cenę ratować. – Jeśli mówimy, że LGBT jest ideologią będącą rodzajem umysłowej zarazy, to tym samym stwierdzamy, że jest czymś, co nas atakuje oraz nam zagraża i przed czym trzeba ratować siebie, a także innych ludzi – podkreślał.

Two more killed as India detains hundreds and blocks internet while citizenship protests rage,http://telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/12/19/two-killed-india-detains-hundreds-blocks-internet-citizenship/,"Two more people have died in protests over India's controversial new citizenship law bringing the death toll to eight, as police detained hundreds of people and cut internet services while crowds defied bans on public gatherings.

At least one of those killed in the southern city of Mangaluru, had been shot, hospital officials told Reuters amid clashes between stone-throwing crowds.

Authorities erected roadblocks and for the first time blocked internet access in the capital, Delhi, as they tried to quell nationwide anger.

Protests have now raged for a fortnight over Narendra Modi's new legislation, which opponents say undermines India's secular foundation and represents a drive to bring India closer to a Hindu state. Thursday's deaths are thought to bring the total to eight.

Mobile phone companies said they had been ordered to cut internet services in parts of the capital.

"Deputy who slammed N.C. middle school student to floor is fired, charged with assault",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-who-slammed-n-c-middle-school-student-floor-fired-n1103211?cid=public-rss_20191217,"A North Carolina school resource officer seen on video slamming a middle school student twice on the ground has been fired from the sheriff's department and charged with assault, officials said.

Vance County sheriff's deputy Warren Durham faces charges of misdemeanor assault on a child under 12, misdemeanor child abuse and willful failure to discharge duties related to his employment with the sheriff's office, the county's prosecutor said Tuesday.

Durham also lost his job after footage surfaced of him picking the 11-year-old up into the air and throwing the student face-first onto the floor at Vance County Middle School, about 45 miles north of downtown Raleigh.

The deputy then picked the child up again and slammed him on the ground a second time before he roughly yanked the boy to his feet, video obtained by NBC affiliate WRAL showed.

The incident happened Thursday, and the school reported it to the school district that day.

In a statement Thursday, the sheriff's department said the deputy was placed on administrative leave and it referred the incident to the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. On Monday, the department said the deputy was ""no longer an employee.""

Mike Waters, district attorney for Vance County, said Tuesday that a warrant has been issued for Durham's arrest.

He said Durham was charged with misdemeanors rather than felonies because the boy did not suffer serious bodily injuries.

""As a part of this investigation, we will be seeking to make sure that Mr. Durham does not ever serve as a law enforcement officer here,"" Waters said.

The boy's grandfather, a pastor, on Monday said, ""What happened to my grandson was very bad.""

Pastor John Miles said at a news conference Tuesday that the family was disappointed in the misdemeanor charges, but he thanked officials.

""We wanted them to be felony charges,"" he said. ""But as the D.A. said, they went by the law book and they went by the guidelines.""

Miles said previously that his grandson called his mother after the incident, and that an assistant principal at the school took him home. The boy's mother has said he has a bump on his head from the incident but was not hospitalized.

The Vance County school district said the incident was ""unacceptable and egregious.""

""We are disappointed, embarrassed and most of all, want to express our apologies to our community that this occurred,"" the district said in a statement Monday. ""No student should ever experience this anywhere, especially not in our schools. We are better than this.""",JustBadNews,0
Indigenous boy stabbed to death in Amazon amid wave of racism,http://independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/amazon-brazil-indigenous-eriscan-soares-guajajara-amarante-do-maranh-o-a9247121.html,"An indigenous 15-year-old boy has been stabbed to death in an Amazonian reserve in Brazil, the latest in a string of murders which have heightened tensions in the region.

Erisvan Soares Guajajara’s body was found on Friday in the Amarante do Maranhão city, on the edge of an increasingly deforested indigenous reserve on the fringes of the Amazon rainforest.

The killing is the fourth in the Guajajara tribe in recent weeks and has further fuelled recrimination and racism in the febrile atmosphere surrounding indigenous people and deforestation.

The Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI), a charity which advocates on behalf of Brazil’s indigenous population, reported Erisvan had travelled to the city with his father to buy groceries and clothes.

A second man, Roberto Silva, who is not indigenous, was also killed at the same party Erisvan was at.

The local police have handed the bodies over for autopsies and believe they may have died during a fight, the Brazilian version of the Spanish newspaper El Pais reported.

Detectives have told the local press the killings were unconnected to previous murders of indigenous people and therefore could be investigated locally, without calling in the federal police.

But this has been strongly refuted by indigenous advocates. Sonia Guajajara, the executive co-ordinator of the indigenous association ABIP and a leader in Erisvan’s tribe, said it was time the authorities took attacks on her people more seriously.

“Another brutal crime against the Guajajara people,” she tweeted. “Everyone who doesn’t like us feels allowed to kill because they know impunity rules. It’s time to say ENOUGH.”

According to figures from CIMI, murders of indigenous people rose 23 per cent in 2018. Since the far-right Jair Bolsonaro won the presidency there have been increasing reports of conflict between Brazilian loggers and the indigenous people who live in the forests they want to exploit.

Just last week, two other Guajajara leaders were killed in a drive-by shooting on a motorway in another indigenous reserve in Maranhão state. A third leader, Paulino Guajajara, was murdered in an ambush on indigenous land 100km from Amarante do Maranhão in November,

The federal agency in charge of indigenous affairs, Funai, has said it is following the latest case, according to The Guardian. However, other reports suggest Funai have confirmed the police’s account, which has ruled out any connection between Erisvan’s death and “hate crime, dispute over timber, or land”.

Brazilian Air Force spray water over Amazon fires

“There is a sequence of violence afflicting the Guajajara people and Funai should look into that,” said Gilderlan Rodrigues, CIMI’s co-ordinator in Maranhão.

Earlier this week, the federal justice minister, Sergio Moro, sent agents from Brazil’s National Public Security Force to “ensure the physical and moral integrity of indigenous peoples, Funai's officials and non-Indians” in the reserve where the drive-by shooting took place.

The measure will only last for 90 days, however, and does not include the Arariboia reserve, where Erisvan lived.

Arariboia has been hit particularly hard by deforestation and seen regular violent clashes between loggers and the Guardians of the Forest, an indigenous volunteer force which patrols protected areas of the rainforest.

Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events

According to Brazil’s Pastoral Land Commission, killings of indigenous leaders are at their highest for 11 years.

Illegal logging gangs, empowered by the rhetoric of Mr Bolsonaro, have swept into vast swathes of the Amazon, triggering increased violence with the indigenous communities who live there.

There is also evidence of growing antipathy towards the indigenous from the Brazilian public in the Amazonian regions, with racist messages calling for further violence rippling across social media and WhatsApp groups in recent weeks.",JustBadNews,0

Then-Attorney General Barbara Underwood's investigation revealed a ""shocking pattern of illegality"" that included ""unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.""

A settlement included the dissolution of the foundation, as well as 19 factual admissions of their illegal activity.

Those admissions include obscuring a campaign event as a veterans fundraiser in 2016, and giving the campaign ""complete control"" over the $2.8m raised at the event.

Mr Trump also admitted ""that he and his campaign took credit for the grants that the foundation made"" with funds he raised from the public.

The president also admitted using foundation funds to ""settle legal obligations of companies he controlled"" and to pay for a portrait that cost him $10,000.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — A powerful suicide bombing targeted an under-construction medical facility Wednesday near Bagram Air Base, the main American base north of Afghanistan’s capital, the U.S. military and Afghan officials said. Two civilians were killed and more than 70 people wounded.

The Taliban later claimed responsibility for the attack and Afghan officials said all the insurgents were killed. The Bagram airfield was not in danger, said Col. Sonny Leggett.

The facility is being rebuilt to help the Afghan people who live in the area, the U.S. military said.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that at least four dozen civilians were killed in this attack, but Afghan officials disputed that number. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.

Bagram District Gov. Abdul Shokor Qodusi said the facility was attacked by six Taliban insurgents following the suicide bombing. He said the facility was not under construction as Pompeo said but had been built years ago by Koreans and has been closed since 2015.

“The attacks seriously damaged a hospital that was being rebuilt for the Afghan people,” Pompeo said in his statement. “This is precisely the kind of activity that we’re working to reduce through the efforts that we’re undertaking. The people of Afghanistan deserve an end to these senseless acts of violence.”

The Taliban control or hold sway over nearly half of Afghanis tan, staging regular attacks that target foreign and Afghan forces, as well as Kabul government officials, but also kill scores of civilians.

Outside the sprawling base, several homes, mostly belonging to the poor, were destroyed. A large mosque in the area was also badly damaged.

Shortly after the bombing, Afghan troops, special forces and intelligence officers cordoned off the perimeter of the base with armored personnel carriers. Heavily armed soldiers kept residents far from the base gates.

Within minutes of the suicide bombing, U.S. fighter aircraft bombed the area, according to witnesses.

Earlier reports suggested a U.S. military convoy might have been the target of Wednesday’s attack.

Dr. Abdul Qasim Sangin, a physician who heads the main hospital in the province, said the hospital near the perimeter of the base was on fire. It wasn’t immediately clear if any foreigners were inside the hospital.

Gen. Mahfooz Walizada, police chief of Parwan province, where the base is located, confirmed the attack but offered no details on casualties.

Sangin said his hospital received six wounded, all Afghans. Five were in stable condition and one was critical, he said. Scores more were treated and released by medics at the scene. Most were suffering cuts and bruises from flying glass and debris.",JustBadNews,0

Youth urge adults to stop 'acting like children' on climate change,http://reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-accord-children/youth-urge-adults-to-stop-acting-like-children-on-climate-change-idUSKBN1YD24W,"MADRID (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With children and young people increasingly at risk from extreme weather and out in the streets demanding faster action on global warming, efforts to respect and promote their rights in climate policy need to step up, U.N officials said on Monday.

On the sidelines of U.N. climate negotiations in Madrid, the U.N. children’s agency (UNICEF) and former Irish President Mary Robinson urged countries in the Paris Agreement on climate change to keep the rights of children and young people in mind as they put the accord into practice.

Theo Cullen-Mouze, a 17-year-old climate activist from Ireland, said his small island community off the west coast was suffering from wilder winter storms, longer summer droughts and more frequent extreme floods.

As a result, he felt like he had no option but to start a climate protest every Friday outside his local government office, with his younger sister.

“I came to Madrid because the adults are acting like children,” he said, lamenting their failure so far to curb planet-heating emissions and rising temperatures.

“Please listen to us, please listen to the science,” he pleaded.

At the Madrid conference, UNICEF launched a “Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action”, which it said reflected priorities identified by children and youth throughout the world.

Those included expanding investment in protecting children from disasters and helping them adapt to climate threats, beefing up education on environmental issues and enabling the participation of young people in climate change policy-making.

The declaration was signed on Monday by nine countries: Chile, Costa Rica, Fiji, Luxembourg, Monaco, Nigeria, Peru, Spain and Sweden.

Paloma Escudero, UNICEF’s global director of communications, noted that half a billion children live in areas at very high risk of floods due to extreme weather, as well as rising sea levels.

Last week, the agency released data showing storms forced about 760,000 children from their homes in the Caribbean from 2014-2018, compared with 175,000 in the preceding five years.

David R. Boyd, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, said that when the initial U.N. convention on climate change was signed in 1992, about four-fifths of the world’s energy supply came from fossil fuels, and that share had not dropped since.

“Children, I apologize to you from the bottom of my heart - we are failing you,” he said. “We need urgent, rapid and far-reaching changes in all aspects of society in order to address the climate crisis.”

Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said she was pleased that more young people were able to speak out at the United Nations, in parliaments and elsewhere to demand climate action - even though the response so far had been inadequate.

“I understand the despair and rage so many younger people - and older ones too - are feeling,” she told an event to launch the declaration. “Your advocacy is helping to change that and is a real force of hope for all of us.”

‘DON’T FORGET US’

Penelope Lea, 15, an ambassador on climate and environment for UNICEF Norway, called climate change “a ticking clock”.

She has chaired a national children’s climate panel for several years, and said it had received “thousands of thoughts” from young people.

“We write a report every year and give it to the politicians - so they don’t forget us,” she said.

“We need new ways to think and act”, she added.

Ministers from countries that signed the declaration spoke of their efforts to consult with children and include some of their views in plans and legislation to tackle climate change. But they acknowledged more could be done.

Camila Gonzalez, a 16-year-old Mexican climate activist, said young people should be given a seat at the table when governments make decisions on responding to climate change.

“Yes, we are children... but do not think that we are stupid and do not know enough,” she said.

She and other young panelists said they wanted more tools and spaces to contribute to policy-making, as well as a greater push at national level to educate children on climate change and create more green jobs.

UNICEF’s Escudero noted that only 42% of countries’ Paris Agreement climate action plans - which they are due to update next year - mentioned children or youth.

Robinson, also a former U.N. human rights chief and grandmother of six, said countries should think harder about how to include children in those plans and find ways for young people to be listened to.

“Children have called out the adult world (on climate change)... because this is a gross injustice to young people,” she said. “It’s not fair that we have condemned children so far to have that worry and that fear.”",JustBadNews,0
New Yorker offers a horrifying look into the RSS: Blood and Soil in Narendra Modi's India,http://newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/09/blood-and-soil-in-narendra-modis-india,"In a village in Haryana, I spoke with a young Hindu woman named Ayesha. A year before, she had met a Muslim man named Omar, a purveyor of spiritual medicine who had been visiting her home to treat her mother. They fell in love, and decided that Ayesha would convert to Islam and they would get married. Her family was horrified, she said. One night, Ayesha ran off with Omar to his village, a few miles away, where they got married in a mosque, and moved in with his relatives. For several months, Ayesha said, her family tried to persuade her to get a divorce; at one point, her father brought her a pistol and a suicide note to sign. “I was so sad, I almost agreed,” she said.

One night, as Omar rode his bicycle, two men followed on scooters. One of them pulled out a gun and shot Omar dead. Ayesha remained with Omar’s family, saying she will never go back to her own. “I am one hundred per cent certain that my family is responsible for my husband’s death,” she said.

When Ayyub was a child, a group of men gathered every morning for prayer and martial arts in a field down the street from her home. The men formed a local chapter of the R.S.S., and sometimes chanted slogans celebrating Hindu supremacy: “Hail, Mother India.” The men were friendly, she recalled—eager to recruit Muslims. But she had learned in school that an R.S.S. acolyte had killed Gandhi, so she and her brother, Aref, kept their distance. “We would watch with fascination,’’ she said. “But I didn’t like being there.”

Early one morning in Ahmedabad, on a playground at Ellisbridge Municipal School No. 12, I looked on as a dozen men raised the saffron flag of the R.S.S. They ranged in age from eighteen to sixty-three, and were all trim and fit, many of them wearing the group’s signature khaki shorts. They began with yoga poses and calisthenics. Then they took out long wooden rods and began to perform martial exercises. (An R.S.S. chief once said that the group’s cadres could be assembled to fight more quickly than the Indian Army.) The men moved together, stepping and striking in formation. “One-two-three-four, one-two-three-four,” their leader cried. “Don’t think you’re an expert—I’m seeing a lot of mistakes.”

The men finished in a semicircle on the ground, offering prayers to the Hindu sun god: “O Surya, the shining one, the radiant one, dispeller of darkness, source of life.” They ended by shouting, “Victory to India!”

Afterward, the men—who included an engineer, a lawyer, a garment merchant, and a police officer—laughed and clapped one another on the back. Together they made up the Paldi chapter of the R.S.S., one of more than thirty thousand across India. Paldi is an overwhelmingly Hindu neighborhood, but the nearest Muslim enclave, which came under attack in 2002, is less than a mile away. On this morning, there wasn’t much talk of politics. “I’m just here to stay fit,” Nehal Burasin, a student, told me.

For a fuller explanation of the R.S.S.’s world view, I spoke to Sudhanshu Trivedi, a lifelong member who is now the B.J.P.’s national spokesman. Over dinner at the Ambassador Hotel in Delhi, Trivedi told me that the R.S.S. is dedicated to the propagation of “Hindutva”: the idea that India is first and foremost a nation for Hindus. It is, he said, by far the largest organization of its kind in the world. In its ninety-four-year existence, the R.S.S. has embedded itself in every aspect of Indian society.

Between bites of salad, Trivedi rattled off R.S.S. talking points. The organization says that it runs some thirty thousand primary and secondary schools; that it administers hospitals across India, especially in remote areas; and that it maintains the second-largest network of trade unions in the country, the largest network of farmers, the largest social-welfare organization working in the slums. The B.J.P., India’s dominant political party, came last in his litany. “So, you can see, in the entire scheme of things, compared to what the R.S.S. is doing, what the B.J.P. is doing is small,” he said. In fact, the R.S.S. was rapidly becoming a state within a state—capturing India from within. Over the summer, the organization announced that it was establishing a school to train young people to become officers in the armed forces. This year, more than a hundred and fifty former officers and enlisted men signed a letter decrying the “completely unacceptable” use of the military for political purposes. They referred to Modi’s taking credit for the cross-border strikes in Pakistan, and to the boast by some B.J.P. politicians that it was “Modi’s army.”

The key to understanding modern India, Trivedi told me, was accepting that “Hinduism is not basically a religion—it is a way of life.” Anyone born in India is part of Hinduism. Therefore, all the other religions found in India thrive because of Hinduism, and are subordinate to it. “The culture of Islam is preserved here because of Hindu civilization,” he said.

As part of the Hindutva project, B.J.P. leaders have been rewriting school textbooks across the country, erasing much of its Islamic history, including that of the Mughals, Muslim emperors who ruled India for three centuries. The B.J.P. has changed Mughal place names to ones that are Hindu-influenced. Last year, the Mughalsarai railway station, built in central India a century and a half ago, was renamed for Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, a right-wing Hindu-nationalist leader. Allahabad, a city of more than a million people, is now called Prayagraj, a Sanskrit word that denotes a place of sacrifice. In November, the old story of Ayodhya was in the news again, when India’s Supreme Court cleared the way for a Hindu temple to be constructed on the former site of Babri Masjid. In a thousand-page decision, the Court provided no evidence that a temple had been destroyed to build the mosque, and acknowledged that the mosque had been torn down by an angry mob. Nevertheless, it handed control of the land to a government trust, effectively allowing the B.J.P. to proceed.

Trivedi told me that no one in the R.S.S. bore any animus toward Islam. But, he said, it was important to understand just how far the faith had fallen. “In India, the most educated community is the Parsis, which is a minority. The second most educated is the Christians, which is a minority. The most prosperous is the Jains, which is a minority. The most entrepreneurial is Sikh, which is a minority. The first nuclear scientist in India was a Parsi—a minority,” he said. “Then what is the problem with Muslims? I will tell you. They have become captives of the jihadi ideology.”

When Ayyub and the photographer were detained at the hospital in Srinagar, I found a hiding place across the street, screened by a wall and a fruit vender; Ayyub would have faced serious repercussions if she was found to have snuck in a foreigner. After about an hour, they emerged. Ayyub said that an intelligence officer had questioned them intently, then released them with an admonition: “Don’t come back.”

The next morning, we drove to the village of Parigam, near the site of the suicide attack that prompted Modi’s air strikes against Pakistan. We’d heard that Indian security forces had swept through the town and detained several men. The insurgency has broad support in the villages outside the capital, and the road to Parigam was marked by the sandbags and razor wire of Indian Army checkpoints. For most of the way, the roads were otherwise deserted.

In the village, Ayyub stopped the car to chat with locals. Within a few minutes, she’d figured out whom we should talk to first: Shabbir Ahmed, the proprietor of a local bakery. We found him sitting cross-legged on his porch, shelling almonds into a huge pile. In interviews, Ayyub slows down from her usual debate-team pace; she took a spot on the porch as if she had dropped by for a visit. Ahmed, who is fifty-five, told her that, during the sweeps, an armored vehicle rumbled up to his home just past midnight one night. A dozen soldiers from the Rashtriya Rifles, an élite counter-insurgency unit of the Indian Army, rushed out and began smashing his windows. When Ahmed and his two sons came outside, he said, the soldiers hauled the young men into the street and began beating them. “I was screaming for help, but nobody came out,” Ahmed said. “Everyone was too afraid.”

Ahmed’s sons joined us on the porch. One of them, Muzaffar, said that the soldiers had been enraged by young people who throw rocks at their patrols. They dragged Muzaffar down the street toward a mosque. “Throw stones at the mosque like you throw stones at us,” one of the soldiers commanded him.

Muzaffar said that he and his brother, Ali, were taken to a local base, where the soldiers shackled them to chairs and beat them with bamboo rods. “They kept asking me, ‘Do you know any stone throwers?’—and I kept saying I don’t know any, but they kept beating me,” he said. When Muzaffar fainted, he said, a soldier attached electrodes to his legs and stomach and jolted him with an electrical current. Muzaffar rolled up his pants to reveal patches of burned skin on the back of his leg. It went on like that for some time, he said: he would pass out, and when he regained consciousness the beating started again. “My body was going into spasms,” he said, and began to cry.

After Muzaffar and Ali were released, their father took them to the local hospital. “They have broken my bones,” Muzaffar said. “I can no longer prostrate myself before God.”

It was impossible to verify the brothers’ tale, but, as with many accounts that Ayyub and I heard in the valley, the anguish was persuasive. “I am a slightly more civilized version of these people,” Ayyub told me. “I see what’s happening—with the propaganda, with the lies, what the government is doing to people. Their issues are way more extensive—their lives. But I have everything in common with these people. I feel their pain.”",JustBadNews,0

(Courtesy of Tri-State Alliance)

EVANSVILLE — A school board member was caught on video saying “cry me a river” to local activists who’d confronted the board about the needs of transgender students.

The Tri-State Alliance (TSA), an LGBTQ rights group for southeastern Illinois, southwestern Indiana and western Kentucky, have been regular attendees at board meetings for the Evansville-Vandeburgh County School Corporation. Ten activists from the group had come to the Nov. 25 meeting to talk to the school board. The TSA said that six people had signed up to speak. Only one was able to speak to the board before being denied by board president Karen Ragland. The other five were able to speak only after TSA activists twice protested.

Afterwards, board member Ann Ennis confronted TSA members. The group said on their Facebook page that they had addressed transgender suicide with the board member, who then said there was no support on the board to protect the students. When TSA President Wally Paynter said she was transphobic, Ennis said “cry me a river” while making a violin-playing motion as she left the room.

The comment was caught on video by TSA members.

Jeremy Clarkson blames Greta Thunberg for killing motor shows by making youngsters hate cars,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7730943/Jeremy-Clarkson-blames-Greta-Thunberg-killing-motor-shows-making-youngsters-hate-cars.html,"Jeremy Clarkson today accused Greta Thunberg of 'killing the car show' as he identified her as one of the main reasons young people today 'hate cars'.

The Grand Tour host, 59, suggested the climate campaigner’s war against climate change had put youngsters off gas-guzzling vehicles.

And he called the 16-year-old 'an idiot' for claiming 'we're all going to die', suggesting the tactic wouldn’t help advance her cause.

Jeremy Clarkson, 59, (left) suggested Greta Thunberg's (right) war against climate change had put youngsters off gas-guzzling vehicles

Mr Clarkson told The Sun: 'Everyone I know under 25 isn't the slightest bit interested in cars - Greta Thunberg has killed the car show.

'They're taught at school, before they say “Mummy and Daddy”, that cars are evil, and it's in their heads.'

Even so, he admitted that Ms Thunberg's concerns about global warming had finally filtered through to his show and he now accepted it was 'very definitely a thing'.

The issue will feature in next month's episode, The Grand Tour Presents: Seamen, which will see Mr Clarkson make a 500-mile trip from Cambodia to Vietnam, alongside Richard Hammond and James May.

The trio have been working together for more than 20 years and it was the first time they had been filmed taking climate change seriously rather than mocking it.

Writing in The Sunday Times about the programme, which will feature fishermen suffering due to water shortages, Mr Clarkson admitted: ‘It’s the first time that we’ve ever admitted to there being global warming.’

The issue will feature in next month's episode, The Grand Tour Presents: Seamen, which will see Mr Clarkson make a 500-mile trip from Cambodia to Vietnam, alongside Richard Hammond and James May

The presenter has long been a critic of the green movement, and recently called Ms Thunberg as a ‘spoilt brat’ after she broke down in tears while furiously scolding UN delegates for not taking responsibility for fixing the planet's warming climate.

'I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope. How dare you.

'You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,' the Swedish activist thundered in her speech at the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York.

Clarkson called Ms Thunberg 'an idiot' for claiming 'we're all going to die', suggesting the tactic wouldn’t help advance her cause

Mr Clarkson wrote in The Sun: ‘How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn’t build which cost £15million, that you didn’t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn’t mention.'

'We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all. So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.'

In 2009, environmental campaigners dumped manure on Mr Clarkson's front lawn in protest against his attitude on global warming.

Eco-campaigners said he has a 'blase attitude to climate change' because of his love of high-powered cars and 4x4 cars.

Activists from environmental group Climate Rush unloaded two bag-loads of horse manure at his home with a banner which read: 'This is what you're landing us in'.

The seven female protesters, dressed as suffragettes, made the stop outside Clarkson's home as part of their month-long horse-and-cart road show around the south west of England to raise awareness of climate issues.

"Melania Trump booed at Baltimore youth event. Melania Trump was widely booed when she took the stage at a youth event in Baltimore on Tuesday, an unusually hostile reception for a U.S. first lady.",https://reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-melania/melania-trump-booed-at-baltimore-youth-event-idUSKBN1Y02B8,"(Reuters) - Melania Trump was widely booed when she took the stage at a youth event in Baltimore on Tuesday, an unusually hostile reception for a U.S. first lady.

The sustained boos, which bookended her remarks and were interrupted by some cheers, marked the latest negative reception for President Donald Trump and the first lady at recent public events. The Republican president is seeking re-election in November 2020 as an impeachment inquiry against him heats up in Congress.

Baseball fans booed the Republican president at a World Series game in Washington in October. Days later, he was greeted with a mix of cheers and boos at a Mixed Martial Arts event in New York City. All three cities are heavily Democratic.

The first lady spoke about opioid addiction at the B’More Youth Summit hosted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, a nonprofit group founded by the actor.

“Hello, everyone,” Mrs. Trump said as she tried to talk through sustained boos at the start of her brief remarks.

The jeering subsided, then restarted as she concluded by telling the audience: “Wishing you all a Happy Thanksgiving. May God bless you, your families and the United States of America.”

Donald Trump has few friends in Baltimore, a city he derided as “disgusting” and “rodent-infested” over the summer during a war of words with late hometown congressman Elijah Cummings, a harsh critic of Trump’s policies. Protests greeted the president during a September visit to the city 40 miles (60 km) north of Washington.

The sentences cannot be appealed. The accusations against the three had been made by more than 20 alumni of Mendoza’s Antonio Provolo Institute for the deaf.

Guards charged over Epstein's suicide get trial date. Two correctional officers accused of covering up their failure to check on financier Jeffrey Epstein before he hanged himself will face an April 20 trial date.,https://reuters.com/article/us-people-jeffrey-epstein-guards/guards-charged-over-epsteins-suicide-get-trial-date-idUSKBN1XZ28I,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two correctional officers accused of covering up their failure to check on financier Jeffrey Epstein before he hanged himself will face an April 20 trial date.

Slideshow ( 14 images )

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres scheduled the trial for Tova Noel and Michael Thomas at a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Monday. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty.

Epstein’s suicide on Aug. 10, at age 66, came a little over a month after the well-connected money manager was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutors say that Noel and Thomas, the only correctional officers on duty in Epstein’s unit the night before he was found dead, failed to carry out checks on Epstein and falsely recorded that they had.

Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.

Thomas’s lawyer, Montel Figgins, said at Monday’s hearing that he would seek more information about the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death, saying that problems throughout the prison system could be important to the case.

After the hearing, he told reporters his client was a scapegoat.

“There’s only two people charged, but for this to happen, the whole system had to fail,” he said.

Jason Foy, a lawyer for Noel, declined to speak to reporters outside the courtroom.

Noel, 31, was charged with five counts of falsifying records, while Thomas, 41, was charged with three counts. Both were charged with conspiracy.

Epstein’s friends once included U.S. President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew. He previously avoided federal prosecution for sex crimes in a 2007 plea deal that has been widely criticized as too lenient.

His $577 million estate is now the target of civil lawsuits by more than a dozen women who say he sexually abused them in his homes in New York, Florida and elsewhere.",JustBadNews,0
13-year-old arrested for allegedly threatening school shooting in Los Angeles,http://cnn.com/2019/11/22/us/school-shooting-plot-thwarted-in-los-angeles/index.html,"(CNN) Authorities arrested a 13-year-old boy and seized an assault-style rifle in connection with a reported threat at a middle school, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Friday.

Students at Ánimo Mae Jemison Charter Middle School told teachers and administrators on Thursday they heard the boy, a student at the school, threatening to shoot students and staff members, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said at a news conference.

LASD Century station deputies responded to a call of a student who threatened to shoot other students and staff. The investigation resulted in a search warrant-the seizure of an AR15 rifle, ammunition, list of intended victims and a drawing of the school layout.

Protesters stay holed up on Hong Kong campus surrounded by riot police,http://cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-1.5367564,"At least eight protesters who had been holding out at a trashed Hong Kong university surrendered to police in the early hours of Friday, while others desperately searched for escape routes as riot officers surrounded the campus.

The siege at the campus on the Kowloon peninsula appeared to be nearing an end with the number of protesters dwindling to less than 100, days after some of the worst violence since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June.

Much of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University, which teemed with 33,000 students, faculty and staff in the most recent school year, has become a deserted wasteland.

Hundreds of anti-government protesters had fortified the campus and engaged in street battles with riot police earlier this week.

But now the number of protesters has dwindled to fewer than 100, turning the grounds into an eerily empty compound scattered with debris and defaced with political slogans.

Trash and debris from homemade petrol bombs were strewn across the grounds. Many protesters have abandoned their equipment, including gas masks and umbrellas.

Much of the campus is damaged, with rooms vandalized and windows shattered. Electricity and water are still functioning.

In a library, most books were untouched but makeshift petrol bombs were left on desks.

The protesters appeared to be outnumbered by media and people hoping to help, including some university staff, a group of Catholic clergy, and principals of secondary schools looking for any children still holding out.

A Catholic priest said his group had found the remaining protesters largely unwilling to engage.

Some protesters told Reuters they were holding out not for a showdown with police, but because they were innocent and looking for an escape route.

""We are feeling a little tired. All of us feel tired but we will not give up trying to get out,"" said a 23-year-old demonstrator who gave his name only as Shiba as he ate noodles with egg and sausage in the protesters' canteen.

""We spent yesterday trying to find ways to get outside but failed, so we came for some breakfast,"" he said.

""I won't consider surrendering. Surrendering is for people who are guilty. None of us inside are guilty,"" Michelle, a 20-year-old student, said on the campus of Polytechnic University on the Kowloon peninsula.

More than 1,000 protesters who tried to leave earlier this week were arrested, and most of those who remain say they hope to avoid being arrested for rioting or on other charges.

Last campus still occupied

The Chinese-ruled city has enjoyed two days and nights of relative calm ahead of district council elections that are due to take place on Sunday.

The government has said it is committed to proceeding with the elections and is monitoring the situation to ensure the election can be held safely.

All polling stations will be guarded by armed officers in riot gear for the first time in the history of local elections, the South China Morning Post reported.

Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Beijing has said it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula granting Hong Kong autonomy.

'I have nothing to lose'

The unrest marks the most serious popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.

Some protesters have surrendered while others were held during escape attempts that included clambering down from a bridge to waiting motorbikes and fleeing through the sewers.

Graffiti sprayed on campus buildings read: ""I have nothing to lose. I have no stake in the society,"" summing up the mood felt by many of the protesters on Thursday morning.

Some looked for breakfast in one of the university canteens, which remained stocked with food, including noodles and tomatoes.

Cross Harbour Tunnel still shut due to damage

One protester, dressed in black clothes with gloves, elbow and knee pads, had about a dozen colourful lighters strapped to his chest. He told Reuters the remaining protesters were discussing what to do next.

In the past two weeks, protesters have torched buildings and public infrastructure, including a footbridge and toll booths at the city's Cross Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong island to the Kowloon peninsula.

The protesters say that they are angry at the way the MTR, Hong Kong's public rail network, has helped riot police, and that shutting down key infrastructure forces the government to listen to their demands for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police violence, among other things.

The Cross Harbour Tunnel remained shut on Thursday because of extensive damage, authorities said.

Some train services remained shut, the city's metro operator MTR Corp said, while the rural Yuen Long station in New Territories would shut by 2 p.m. local time, to pre-empt demonstrations marking four months since suspected triad gang members attacked protesters and commuters there.

'Erroneous signal'

China has accused the United States and the U.K. of stirring up trouble in Hong Kong and it has criticized the U.S. House of Representatives over its passing of two bills aimed at supporting the protesters and sending a warning to China about human rights.

China resolutely opposed the bills and would never allow anyone to undermine the ""one country two systems"" principle, or to destroy Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said.

China's state Xinhua news agency said a top Chinese official in Hong Kong, Xie Feng, had summoned the U.S. consul-general to denounce the legislation as gross interference and a violation of international law.

The Hong Kong government also expressed its strong opposition to the bills, saying they would harm Hong Kong's relations with the United States.

""The two acts will ... also send an erroneous signal to the violent protesters, which would not be conducive to de-escalating the situation,"" the city government said in a statement.

The anger over the U.S. legislation, which has been sent to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign the bills, comes as the two countries are locked in delicate trade talks.",JustBadNews,0
"Johnson & Johnson loses pelvic mesh class action in Australia. More than 1,350 Australian women won a seven-year-old class action lawsuit on Thursday against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) for misleading patients and surgeons about the risks of the pharmaceutical giant's pelvic mesh implants.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-australia-classaction/johnson-johnson-loses-pelvic-mesh-class-action-in-australia-idUKKBN1XV0CH,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - More than 1,350 Australian women won a seven-year-old class action lawsuit on Thursday against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) JNJ.N for misleading patients and surgeons about the risks of the pharmaceutical giant's pelvic mesh implants.

FILE PHOTO: Johnson & Johnson's company logo is pictured in New York, U.S., September 17, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

The suit is one of many J&J has faced in the United States, Canada and Europe over the implants, used to treat urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, in which organs shift from normal positions. J&J in October agreed to pay nearly $117 million to resolve claims in 41 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

Australia’s Federal Court found that J&J subsidiary Ethicon had sold the devices without warning women about the “gravity of the risks”, and was negligent in rushing the products to market before proper testing. The judge in the case, Anna Katzmann, has set February for the next hearing in the case, where damages will be discussed.

Ethicon said it was reviewing the court’s decision and would consider its options to appeal.

“Ethicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products,” the company said in a statement.

Judge Katzmann ruled that much of the information the company provided about the devices was “inaccurate” and at times made “false representations”.

“The question is whether this conduct considered as a whole was misleading or likely to mislead. I believe it was,” Katzmann said in her judgment.

“The post-market evaluation of all the Ethicon devices was deficient,” she said. “It fell well below the level of care required of a reasonably prudent manufacturer.”

“The risks were known, not insignificant and on Ethicon’s own admission, serious harm could ensue if they eventuated,” the judge said in her ruling.

Patients said they had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse after having the mesh surgically implanted.

Dozens of women involved in the class action welcomed the court’s decision.

Julie Davis, the original claimant in the case, said she was “incredibly pleased” with the judgment but said it would not take away the pain and damage done to women.

“They have treated women essentially like guinea pigs, lied about it and done nothing to help,” she told reporters at a televised media conference outside the court in Sydney.",JustBadNews,0

"'This Has Got to Stop. It's Evil': Turkish Military Using Drones to Attack Civilians, Ambulances in Northern Syria",http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/november/this-has-got-to-stop-its-evil-turkish-military-using-drones-to-attack-civilians-ambulances-in-northern-syria,"TAL TAMR, Syria - While the Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of most US troops in Syria, some will remain to secure the country's eastern oil fields from ISIS.

The Turkish military is taking advantage of the situation with devastating consequences for the civilians in that area.

Turkey and Russia now patrol northern Syria side by side as Turkish President Erdogan moves ahead to annex a much more land bordering his country. Local Syrians showing displeasure with some pelting a Turkish patrol with rocks near the town of Derrik. Turks fired what they claim to be tear gas to disperse the protests. The questionable chemical, however, sent ten unconscious people to the hospital, a result rarely caused by tear gas. One protester was run over by a Turkish vehicle and later died.

Doctors at the hospital in Tal Tamr have treated more than 700 patients so far.

""The Kurds in this area have faced so much injustice from this invasion, and we sometimes feel powerless to stop the bloodshed,"" Dr. Chevin Hasan told CBN News.

CBN News Contributing Correspondent Chuck Holton could hear the Turkish drones as he recorded a segment for his report.

""So this reconnaissance we're doing of the front line area just south of Seri Kani, shows that this YPG position is surrounded on three sides at the moment by the Free Syrian Army, off to the west, the north and to the east,"" Holton said. ""But they aren't quite as worried about being attacked from those positions as they are from indirect fire, that's mortars and artillery, because they just had a round land back behind them. They don't know if that's like a reconnaissance by fire or if the enemy's actually bracketing them trying to bomb this target. The other thing they have to worry about, we can hear overhead right now is drones.""

Many of the wounded at this hospital are clearly victims of Turkish drone attacks. Dave Eubank, leader of the Free Burma Rangers aid group, has been working in the area for more than three weeks.

""We are at a mobile casualty collection point,"" Eubank said. ""We had to hide our vehicles because of Turkish drone strikes, and in the last three days, 26 people have been killed by drone strikes in this area alone.""

It is clear these drones are going after more than just military targets. Eubanks' own marked ambulance took a hit Nov. 2, wounding two and killing one of their ethnic Kachin medics, 37-year-old Zhau Seng. He died on his baby daughter's first birthday.

But Turkey's president is undeterred, vowing to continue the fight against what he calls terrorists, while local aid groups estimate more than 300,000 have fled the area. Meanwhile, medical people on the ground have labeled these civilian drone strikes as war crimes.

""And so we ask for a stop to the Turkish drones,"" Eubank told CBN News. ""Five ambulances have been taken out earlier. And so this has got to stop. It's evil.""

""All we want is to be able to live in peace like any other nation,"" Dr. Hasan said. ""We just hope President Trump will remember us and maybe he can do something to help our situation.""",JustBadNews,0

The flare-ups occurred a day after police shot an unarmed protester at close range and a man was doused with petrol and set on fire in some of the worst violence since the protests began nearly five months ago in the China-ruled city.

At the rural Chinese University near Tai Po, some of the fiercest fighting broke out at night as riot police stormed the campus where hundreds of protesters congregated, firing a barrage of tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.

Hundreds of masked protesters, many of them students, hurled back petrol bombs, rocks and bricks, some launched with catapults. After the clashes, dozens of the injured lay sprawled on the ground at a nearby sports pitch.

The chaotic night scenes of explosions, smoke plumes, yelling and sustained gunfire, which left scores of injured students sprawled on the ground, stoked a sense of dread among some who recalled the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown by Chinese troops on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.

“The fear among the students is so strong,” said Wing Long, a 25-year-old theology student. “That’s why we’ve gathered today to stop it from happening.”

The police, however, said protesters in the campus had thrown debris and petrol bombs onto a nearby highway linking the Northern New Territories with Kowloon, bringing traffic to a standstill in a haze of tear gas smoke.

The city’s 24 pro-democracy lawmakers condemned the police in a joint statement, saying the nonstop firing of tear gas had turned the campus into a “battlefield,” while urging the international community to speak out for Hong Kong’s youngsters to “prevent the recurrence of the tragedy of 1989.”

Medics on the scene told Reuters that at least 60 people were injured.

At City University, students in hard hats and gas masks had spent much of the day barricading the campus, making home-made shields, and stockpiled bricks and petrol bombs on bridges and other approaches.

They overran the campus and smashed up glass panels in the adjacent Festival Walk shopping mall and set fire to a giant Christmas tree.

CENTRAL PROTEST

Earlier in the day, more than 1,000 protesters, many wearing office clothes and face masks, rallied in Central for a second day during lunch hour, blocking roads below some of the city’s tallest skyscrapers and most expensive real estate.

After they had dispersed, police fired tear gas at the remaining protesters on old, narrow Pedder Street. Police made more than a dozen arrests, many pinned up on the pavement against the wall of luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co.

Police said masked “rioters” had committed “insane” acts, throwing trash, bicycles and other debris on to metro tracks and overhead power lines, paralyzing transport in the former British colony. TV footage showed activists dropping heavy objects from overpasses on to traffic below, just missing a motorcyclist.

“Our society has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown,” Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung told reporters.

The demonstrators have been protesting since June against what they believe to be meddling by Beijing in the freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place when the territory returned to China from British rule in 1997. Tough police tactics in response to the unrest have also fueled anger.

China denies interfering and has blamed Western countries including Britain and the United States for stirring up trouble.

Protests and road blockages ran late into the night in multiple districts including Mong Kok, Tin Shui Wai and Tai Po, where a truck was set on fire.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said protesters were being selfish and she hoped that universities and schools would urge students not to take part in the demonstrations.

Most universities, and some schools, said they would close again on Wednesday. The Hong Kong Jockey Club said all off-course betting centers would also be closed ahead of Wednesday’s racing at Happy Valley as a safety precaution.

DEADLY FORCE

The United States on Monday condemned “unjustified use of deadly force” in Hong Kong and urged police and civilians alike to de-escalate the situation.

Emergency services have remained reticent to use the word ""evacuate"", but by Tuesday they might. ""I'm not leaving, not yet,"" Mrs Clarke said. ""My life is important, I know that and if [there is] a danger to my life I probably would have to go but I will try and stay. We just need to prepare.""

Loading Residents all over the surrounding towns of Kempsey were doing the same on Monday, clearing roof gutters, chainsawing low hanging branches, moving anything that could possibly fuel a flame. Bales of hay, never more precious than in a drought, were entrusted to a local truck driver to be transported to safer ground. ""If even a cinder gets into that shed ... the shed can go, but not the hay in it, because that feeds the cows. We've got no feed anywhere,"" Mrs Clarke said. In the surrounding towns of Kempsey landowners gathered at meetings with police, council and emergency services, where they were ""strongly advised"" to relocate to evacuation centres.

Over in Macksville caravans and tents dotted the local showground from the early hours of Monday. Among them was Tracey Coulter, who nursed a cup of tea on a camp chair as she took another nervous phone call from her husband who was home preparing to defend their property near Bowraville. Leaving with her three daughters and her grandchildren on Friday, she had hoped to return on Sunday, but quickly decided the risk was too high. “It was that eerie at home, the burnt trees, you don’t know where they are going to fall,” Mrs Coulter said.

If we can put as many tracks in as we can, we’ve got a better chance of taking out as many blocks as we need to [before the fire returns],” said Ben Donnelly, as he bulldozed fire trails behind a 200-acre property.

""Between the fires at Kempsey and the fires near Macksville, I’ve been bulldozing everywhere and anywhere.” Mr Donnelly spent Monday ""dozing"" side-by-side with local landowner Brad Edge to protect the perimeter of his property before conditions worsen. “I’m just here clearing up as much as we can,” Mr Edge said. “I’ve got eight-year-old twins.

"Hong Kong police open fire, wounding protester, as chaos erupts. Hong Kong police opened fire and hit at least one protester on Monday, media reported, as chaos erupted across the city a day after officers fired tear gas to break up demonstrations that are entering their sixth month.",https://reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests/hong-kong-police-open-fire-wounding-protester-as-chaos-erupts-idUSKBN1XL00W,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police shot and critically wounded a protester and a man was set on fire on Monday in violence that prompted leader Carrie Lam to denounce “enemies of the people” and drew a chilling warning from a senior Chinese newspaper editor.

Protesters threw petrol bombs at police after a weekend of clashes across the Chinese-ruled territory, marking a dramatic escalation in more than five months of often violent pro-democracy unrest.

“The violence has far exceeded the call for democracy and the demonstrators are now the people’s enemy,” Hong Kong chief executive Lam said in a defiant televised address.

“If there’s still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong ... government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I’m making this statement clear and loud here: that will not happen.”

Police fired tear gas in the narrow streets of the Central business district where some protesters, crouching behind umbrellas, blocked streets as office workers crowded the pavements and hurled anti-government abuse.

Some passersby took cover inside the Landmark mall, one of the oldest and most expensive, as volleys of tear gas rained down.

There have been almost daily protests in Hong Kong, but it was rare for tear gas to be fired during working hours in Central, lined with bank headquarters and top-brand shops. Some offices closed early.

China has a garrison of up to 12,000 troops in Hong Kong who have kept to barracks throughout the unrest, but it has vowed to crush any attempts at independence, a demand for a very small minority of protesters.

The editor in chief of China’s Global Times tabloid, published by the state-owned People’s Daily, said Hong Kong police had nothing to be scared of.

“You have the backing of not only Hong Kong and Chinese people, but also Chinese soldiers and People’s Liberation Army in Hong Kong,” Hu Xijin wrote on his blog. “They can go into Hong Kong to provide support at any time.”

SHOOTING CAUGHT ON VIDEO

Police fired live rounds at close range at protesters in Sai Wan Ho on the eastern side of Hong Kong island and one 21-year-old protester was wounded. Police said the victim was in critical condition.

Resident Anson Yip, 36, said protesters were building a road block when police ran to the scene.

“They didn’t fight and the police ran and directly shot. There were three sounds, like ‘pam, pam, pam’,” Yip said.

Video footage showed polystyrene boxes and other debris littering a crossing and blocking traffic. A protester wearing a white hoodie and mask walks towards a policeman, as if to challenge him. The officer draws his gun and points it at him at close range and grabs him round the neck.

As the officer holds the man with his left hand, he shoots another approaching masked protester at close range with his right hand. Three shots ring out and the man falls to the ground.

The fallen man is pinned to the ground by an officer holding a gun to his head. The man in white escapes.

A friend visited the wounded man in hospital.

“My friend didn’t actually attack the police or do anything,” Rigan, 19, said. “They just shot him. My friend is optimistic, friendly and willing to help others.”

The man fell just a couple of metres from a large makeshift memorial to a student who died from a fall in a car park last week, the blood staining the street next to candles, flowers, and anti-government posters.

“The live rounds fired by police are clear evidence of reckless use of force,” Amnesty International Hong Kong said in a statement. “Another policeman was seen driving at high speed into a group of protesters on a motorbike. These are not policing measures – these are officers out of control with a mindset of retaliation.”

Police said the motorcycling officer had been suspended.

Video images online also showed a man dousing petrol on another and setting him on fire outside Ma On Shan Plaza in the New Territories. Engulfed in flames, the man was able to rip off his shirt and douse the blaze. Police said he was in critical condition.

More than 60 people were wounded on Monday, Lam said in her address.

CAMPUS CHAOS

The unrest also spread to densely populated Mong Kok on the Kowloon peninsula, often the site of street clashes. Police used water cannon and tear gas to try to break up protesters who regrouped, digging up bricks to throw at police and blocking Nathan Road, a major artery. A taxi driver who drove close to the crowds was beaten.

The clashes looked set to last into the night as they have done many times before.

Police said more than 120 places has been either vandalised or blocked on Monday. Some 266 people had been arrested since last Monday.

Protesters are angry about what they see as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in the freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony by the “one country, two systems” formula put in place when the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

China denies interfering and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble.

The violence comes after student Chow Tsz-lok, 22, died in hospital last week following a fall as protesters were being dispersed by police.

Police fired tear gas at Chinese University, where students hurled petrol bombs and barricaded the campus like a fortress. There were at least four arrests.

“I feel a strong sense of helplessness,” said one Chinese University student who gave his name as Chan. “Who wouldn’t want to attend class if they could? The government still isn’t listening to us.”

The university said it would again suspend classes on Tuesday.

Protesters threw petrol bombs at police at the Polytechnic University on the Kowloon side of Victoria Harbour. Petrol bombs were also thrown at Hong Kong University on the main island.

Protesters say they’re fed up with growing inequality. Most come out in peace but they’re met with force, and the situation quickly escalates. Chile is supposed to be one of Latin America’s more stable democracies, a model for success since the country’s dictatorship ended in 1990. But this brutal crackdown suggests the security tactics haven’t changed all that much. Police have fired pellets and rubber bullets. These rounds are often shot at close range, hitting people where they can do maximum damage: the eyes. More than 180 protesters have been partly blinded. And the numbers continue to rise. I follow Carlos Puebla into the eye trauma unit of a public hospital. The waiting room is full of people who tell me a similar story. I’m back with Carlos Puebla. Dr. Carmen Torres, who removed his eye several days ago, tries to insert an implant. But the pain is too intense. Dr. Enrique Morales is tracking what doctors see here as an epidemic of eye trauma. The government denies any wrongdoing. Later, my official request to the minister and to the police were also declined. International human rights groups are investigating allegations of abuse. But that process rarely succeeds in bringing the powerful to account. After all, it was Chile’s president, Sebastian Piñera, who set the stage for the violent clampdown. Since then, at least five deaths, more than 180 severe eye injuries, 1,800 hospitalizations, 5,000 arrests, plus allegations of torture and sexual violence. Many of the victims say they were not acting aggressively when they were shot. All they can do now is file a lawsuit and wait. The police violence hasn’t deterred people from coming out — to the contrary.

Thousands gathered at Santiago's Plaza Italia square, where they chanted and held banners. Smoke billowed from the campus of a nearby university, where protesters started a fire.

Police had previously set up barricades in front of the university to attempt to limit damage.

Chileans have been protesting against inequality and corruption

Why are Chileans protesting?

Protests began in the Latin American country in a dispute over a hike in subway fares in October, but have since evolved into an outcry over a wide range of social issues from pensions to government corruption.

Police used water cannon and rubber bullets to disperse protesters on Friday. Recent attempts by President Sebastian Pinera to appease protesters and to threaten them with a clampdown on vandals and looters have apparently not been heeded.

Protesters have renamed the central square ""Dignity Plaza.""

At least 20 people have died and 2,500 have been injured since the protests began.

"Chile's Pinera to crack down on vandals, looters. Chile's President Sebastian Pinera announced a battery of measures on Thursday to tighten security and increase penalties for vandals as ongoing riots, looting and violence have left at least 20 dead over two weeks of protests.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-chile-protests/chiles-pinera-to-crack-down-on-vandals-looters-idUKKBN1XH2DO,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera announced a battery of measures on Thursday to tighten security and increase penalties for vandals as ongoing riots, looting and violence have left at least 20 dead over two weeks of protests.

Pinera said he would send bills to Chile’s congress to toughen penalties against looting, violence and destruction committed during protests. The penalties would increase if the acts are carried out by hooded vandals trying to hide their identities.

Chile’s worst unrest since the end of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in 1990 has wrought more than $1.5 billion in damage to businesses and hobbled Santiago’s metro system, once the envy of Latin America. Vandals have looted hundreds of grocery stores, left much of the downtown painted over in graffiti and set fire to buildings.

Pinera said he would combat the work of “criminals” by beefing up intelligence-gathering activities, including more than doubling to 17 the drones used in Santiago for aerial surveillance.

“One of the principal responsibilities of the state is to ensure public order and security,” Pinera said in a televised speech. He added that police and security forces in Chile had “total support” from his administration.

The political opposition in Chile immediately pounced on Pinera’s announcements. Jorge Sharp, the left-leaning mayor of the port city of Valparaiso, said on Twitter that Pinera had missed the point.

“More repression won’t resolve the social injustices,” Sharp said. “It will only provoke more violence.”

Chile’s worst unrest since the end of Augusto Pinochet’s 1973-1990 dictatorship has already led to more than 7,000 arrests, and injuries to 1,659 protesters and 800 police officers, according to authorities and rights groups.

Prosecutors are also investigating more than 800 allegations of abuse, including torture, rape and beatings by security forces during demonstrations that have often degenerated into riots.

The unrest has grown less violent in recent days but has shown little signs of subsiding.

On Wednesday evening, hooded vandals attacked several shops, cafes and the headquarters of a right wing political parties in one of Santiago’s more upscale neighborhoods.",JustBadNews,0
Hong Kong protests: Knife attacker bites man's ear after stabbing four,http://bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-china-50281914,"Video caption Knife attack amidst protests in Hong Kong shopping mall

Five people have been injured in a knife attack at the site of a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong.

The attack happened at the Cityplaza mall in the Tai Koo district on Hong Kong Island.

The local hospital authority said four men and one woman were injured, with two in critical condition.

One of the injured, a local councillor, had his ear partially bitten off by the as-yet unidentified male attacker, who was subdued by passersby in the mall.

Witnesses said the Mandarin-speaking attacker drew a knife after a political argument with people in the mall, which was the site of pro-democracy protests earlier in the day.

The local councillor, Andrew Chiu Ka-yin, reportedly was attempting to prevent the attacker leaving the scene when the man bit off a section of his ear. Witnesses said the attacker was badly beaten by passersby who intervened, before police arrested the man.

One of the victims, a woman, told the South China Morning Post that the suspect drew a knife after arguing with her sister and her husband, who were also injured. The Hong Kong Free Press reported that that attacker was a Mandarin-speaking pro-Beijing supporter.

Hong Kong has experienced five months of sometimes violent demonstrations by pro-democracy activists, who first took to the streets to protest against a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, but evolved into a broader revolt against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

The wave of pro-democracy protests continued this weekend, days after a high-profile activist, Joshua Wong, was banned from standing in local elections. Police fired tear gas on Sunday into crowds of demonstrators in the eastern suburb of Taikoo Shing, home to the Cityplaza where the stabbing occurred.

With no end in sight, China's leaders signalled last week that they were preparing to change how the mainland administered Hong Kong.

Shen Chunyao, the director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters that officials were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive was appointed and removed. He did not elaborate on what exactly might change.

Last month, the leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups was taken to hospital after being attacked, apparently with hammers. Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front lying in the street, covered in blood.

From hospital, the activist said he ""remained committed to the ideal of peaceful non-violence"".

Violence of crisis continues to intensify

Images and footage of the incident spread quickly around social media platforms. The man who did the biting was subdued by a crowd, which then beat him, some using metal objects.

That is was all happening in a shopping centre being stormed by riot police in pursuit of protestors who were earlier singing and chanting made it even more intense. A small group of hardcore activists had also smashed up shops whose owners they judged to be too ""pro-Beijing"".

I watched the footage on a television in a small restaurant in Hong Kong. Halfway through the report, the woman running the place turned and walked away from the screen. ""This is all too depressing,"" she said in Chinese.",JustBadNews,0

Germany Moves to Tighten Gun and Hate Speech Laws After Far-Right Attacks,http://nytimes.com/2019/10/30/world/europe/germany-gun-hate-speech-laws.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"BERLIN — Prospective gun buyers in Germany would have to undergo background checks to ensure they have no ties to extremism and social media companies operating in the country would be required to report suspicious posts under a series of proposals advanced Wednesday by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.

The legislation comes amid a recent spike in far-right crime. In June, a conservative politician, whose name had appeared on a neo-Nazi hit list circulated online, was fatally shot in the head in what officials believe was the country’s first far-right political assassination since the Nazi era. And just three weeks ago, a right-wing gunman killed two people after attacking a synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur.

“The threat from far-right extremism and far-right terrorism, and with them anti-Semitism, is high in Germany and we can’t stress it often enough,” Horst Seehofer, Germany’s interior minister, said at a news conference.

The bulk of far-right attacks in recent years have consisted of anti-Semitic crimes and hate crimes targeting foreigners and those who support them. The far right has scapegoated immigrants as dangerous and broken longstanding taboos about using language that echoes that of the Nazis. This has come despite more than a decade of German economic prosperity and the country’s persistent ranking as one of the safest in the world.",JustBadNews,0

'LGB Alliance' faces criticism from transvestites for being transphobic,http://independent.co.uk/life-style/lgb-alliance-group-transphobic-alison-bailey-lesbian-gay-bisexual-a9169091.html,"A new lesbian, gay and bisexual alliance group has been heavily criticised for excluding the transgender community, prompting people to label it transphobic.

The “LGB Alliance” group met in London on Tuesday evening, with lawyer Allison Bailey of Garden Court Chambers calling it a “historic moment for the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual movement”.

“Spread the word, gender extremism is about to meet its match,” Bailey tweeted.

The new alliance is formed of previous members of LGBT+ charity Stonewall who have decided to protest against the organisation’s transgender stance.

At the meeting, the group formed of “influential lesbians, gay men and bisexuals” revealed its mission to “counteract the confusion between sex and gender which is now widespread in the public sector and elsewhere”.

The LGB Alliance will be formally launched in January 2020, but hundreds of people have already criticised the group on social media for its perceived anti-trans stance.

On Twitter, the group describes its aim as: ""Asserting the right of lesbians, bisexuals and gay men to define themselves as same-sex attracted. Gender is a social construct.""

In response to Bailey, one person tweeted: “As a bisexual woman, I am utterly disgusted at your attacks on our trans siblings and your alliance with the religious right. You do not speak for me (or for any of the other queers I know – we’re all equally repulsed by your ideas).”

Another person tweeted that members of the group “should be ashamed” of themselves.

Others sought to deny the existence of an “LGB” movement altogether, with one person tweeting: “There is no LGB movement. Not one that doesn’t stand side by side with trans people. Speaking as a bisexual guy, no less is acceptable, and you definitely don’t speak for me.”

Another person wrote: “You can’t be pro-LGB if you’re anti-T. We are one, together. No ‘LGB Alliance’ will speak for me or any of my friends or colleagues.”

Bev Jackson, a co-founder of the Gay Liberation Front and spokesperson for LGB Alliance, told The Independent: “​We did not, do not, exclude trans people. Several trans people attended the meeting, one as a guest speaker. We are not attacking trans people.

""Our group focuses on sexual orientation. This has become necessary, because lesbians in particular, and recently gay men too, are suffering from the confusion between sex and gender. Lesbians and gay men are people who are attracted to others of the same sex. I fought for their rights to be respected fifty years ago and am sad that I need to defend those rights again today.""

Stonewall has been keen to distance itself from the group after reports claimed the charity was “splitting”.

Paul Twocock, Stonewall’s interim CEO said: “There is no truth to reports of Stonewall ‘splitting’, so please ignore the alarmist headlines.",JustBadNews,0

Bolivia erupts in Chaos as elections vote count changes outcome after misterious stop,http://aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/fiery-protest-erupts-bolivia-morales-outright-win-191022040251327.html,"Crowds burned offices of the electoral body in two cities as move to halt release of vote count results sparks anger.

Bolivia‘s electoral authority President Evo Morales was close to avoiding a runoff in his re-election bid, touching off protests by the leader’s opponents already upset by a sudden halt in the release of the vote count.

Crowds burned the offices of the electoral body in the southern cities of Sucre and Potosi, and protesters set fire to ballots from Sunday’s election in Tarija.

Groups of Morales’ supporters and opponents also clashed in a number of places, including the administrative capital of La Paz.

The president’s opponents suggested that officials were trying to help Morales avoid a runoff fight, in which he could lose to a unified opposition, while an observer mission from the Organization of American States (OAS) expressed concerns about the development.

A US State Department accused Bolivian authorities of trying to subvert the vote.

Morales topped the eight other candidates in Sunday’s presidential election, but the last released results before Monday night showed him falling a few points short of the percentage needed to avoid the first runoff in his nearly 14 years in power.

Still, he claimed an outright victory late on Sunday, saying the uncounted votes would be enough to give him a fourth term. He told supporters at the presidential palace that “the people again imposed their will.”

On Sunday night, Bolivia’s top electoral authority stopped announcing new results – a point at which Morales had a lead of 45.3 percent to 38.2 percent over his closest rival, former President Carlos Mesa.

On Monday night, the agency renewed its “quick” count and said that with 95 percent of votes counted, Morales had 46.41 percent to Mesa’s 37.07 percent.

In La Paz, Al Jazeera’s John Holman said such a long gap was “unusual” and that results usually trickled in steadily.

“A lot of questions are being asked about why the count was frozen and why, when it opened up again, Morales had enough of a lead to make him a winner in this round,” Holman said.

Mesa warned earlier that there could be “manipulation of the vote to impede a second round” of voting that could imperil Morales’ 14-year hold on power.

Under Bolivian law, Morales needs a 10-percentage point advantage over Mesa to avoid a second-round election in December. The official count is not due for seven days.

Risk of unrest

After the release of results was stopped, a special electoral mission from the OAS said it was closely monitoring the election and urged the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to renew the release of results.

Mesa called on citizens and civic groups “to conduct a battle in defence of the vote”.

“They can’t take away democracy from us,” he told his supporters in Santa Cruz, a stronghold of opposition to Morales.

The interior minister, Carlos Romero, accused the opposition of trying to create trouble, warning that “they have to take care of the violence they’re generating.”

Morales, 59, an Aymara from Bolivia’s highlands, came to prominence leading social protests and became the country’s first indigenous president in 2006. Since then, he has coasted to two re-election victories and presided over more than a decade of growth in South America’s poorest country.

Following a boom in commodities prices, Morales paved roads, sent Bolivia’s first satellite to space and curbed inflation. Stadiums, markets, schools, state enterprises and even a village bear his name.

Being forced into a runoff would be a blow to Morales, “whose political success has been impressive and who seemed confident of a first-round win”, said Michael Shifter, head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think-tank, noting concerns about the slowing economy, corruption scandals and Morales push for a fourth term in defiance of both a national referendum and the Bolivian constitution.

“Many Bolivians are simply weary,” Shifter said. “If re-elected, Evo will be in office nearly two decades.”",JustBadNews,0

This article is more than 1 year old

Latin America’s most prosperous country is braced for fresh upheaval after Chile’s president expanded a state of emergency beyond the capital and the death toll from three days of violence rose to 11.

“We are at war with a powerful and uncompromising enemy that respects nothing and no one,” Sebastián Piñera declared in an unyielding late-night address on Sunday.

Official statistics hinted at the scale of the turmoil unleashed by clashes and riots over the weekend: 1,554 arrests, more than 10,000 troops sent on to the streets and reports of at least 40 outbreaks of looting.

“It was a weekend of rage,” said Patricio Navia, a political scientist at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies in New York.

Protests in Chile against cost of living – in pictures Read more

The convulsion comes days after Chile’s centre-right leader hailed his country as a haven of Latin American tranquility that was managing to avoid the economic and political strife blighting Argentina, Paraguay, Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador.

“Chile looks like an oasis,” the billionaire conservative boasted in an interview with the Financial Times (paywall).

The crisis began early last week as a youth revolt against a 3% increase in metro fares that the government was subsequently forced to scrap.

As outrage over those measures grew, student protesters stormed metro stations as part of a fare-dodging movement designed to pressure the government. On Friday, demonstrators torched at least a dozen stations, causing an estimated $300m (£230m) of damage.

Play Video 0:58 Chile: students ambush metro stations in mass fare-dodging protest over price hikes – video

But Paula Rivas, the president of the Metro Workers’ Union in the capital, Santiago, said the fare hike was not the driving force behind the mutiny.

“It’s the low pensions, the privatisation of water, the rise in electricity prices, the healthcare system, the need for equal education rights,” she said. “The metro fare was just the trigger, it is symbolic. It made people say, ‘enough’. We will not be silenced.”

Observers and protesters say the rebellion – the worst unrest Chile has faced since the dying days of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship three decades ago – is fuelled by deep-rooted disillusionment at how millions of citizens have been frozen out of the country’s economic rise.

“This isn’t because of the metro price – it is because the system is squeezing us like lemons,” said Bessy Gallardo Prado, a 34-year-old law student who has joined the protests.

“This is happening because of decades of injustice, abuse, and inequality. There is no social security in this country. People earn little and work a lot and wages are not enough to make ends meet.”

Navia, who is based in the Chilean capital, said unlike in other Latin American countries, public anger was not the product of worsening living conditions.

“Living conditions are in fact improving. Poverty levels are going down … Chile has been growing for most of the past decade,” he said. “The problem is that people perceive that wealth and opportunity are not evenly distributed. There isn’t a level playing-field.

“They feel like they are at the gates of the promised land. And they see all the elites inside having fun and enjoying the benefits of economic development – and they are not being let in.”

The Santiago mayor, Karla Rubilar, struck a conciliatory tone on Monday, calling for dialogue between authorities and demonstrators.

“We want the word of the day to be ‘rebuilding’ – rebuilding trust. Because we know it has been lost. Not during this government, but over many years,” she told reporters.

But many blame Piñera, who was elected in 2017 and is one of Chile’s richest men, for inflaming the situation with his uncompromising and inept response.

As Santiago descended into chaos last Friday and the state of emergency was declared, the president was photographed dining with his family at an upmarket restaurant. “Piñera eats pizza as Santiago burns,” one critic tweeted.

On Sunday night he caused further fury with a hardline address in which he claimed the country was “at war” with “evil” delinquents who were bent on causing chaos and destruction.

Navia said: “It was reminiscent of George W Bush … It is a provocation. When you tell protesters you are at war with them, they will go out and provoke you.”

He said Piñera’s administration appeared to believe the declaration of a state of emergency would extinguish the uprising – but many protesters were defying the government’s curfew.

“Things are tense and quiet [in Santiago] – almost like a public holiday,” Navia said. “But this could reignite in the coming days.”",JustBadNews,0

Chile shuts down capital city metro as violent protests spread,http://reuters.com/article/us-chile-protests-metro-idUSKBN1WX2DV,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera declared a state of emergency in the capital Santiago early on Saturday, as the city of 6 million descended into chaos amid riots that left a downtown building engulfed in flames and its metro system shuttered.

Slideshow ( 16 images )

Black-hooded protesters enraged by recent fare hikes on public transportation lit fires at several metro stations, looted shops, burned a public bus and swung metal pipes at train station turnstiles during Friday’s afternoon commute, according to witnesses, social media and television footage.

Pinera spoke to the nation in the early hours of Saturday, declaring an emergency lockdown as sirens filled the night air downtown, and police and firefighters rushed to contain the damage.

The center-right Pinera said he would invoke a special state security law to prosecute the “criminals” responsible for the city-wide damage, while at the same time saying he sympathized with those impacted by the rate hikes.

“In the coming days, our government will call for a dialogue ... to alleviate the suffering of those affected by the increase in fares,” Pinera said in the broadcast address.

Chile is one of Latin America’s wealthiest nations, but also, among its most unequal. Frustrations over the high cost of living in Santiago have become a political flashpoint, prompting calls for reforms on everything from the country’s tax and labor codes to its pension system.

Enel Chile, a subsidiary of Italian utility Enel, said vandals had set fire to the company’s high-rise corporate headquarters downtown. Local television footage showed flames climbing up the side of the building as fire crews struggled to break through growing crowds of protesters.

The company said in a statement posted on Twitter that workers had been evacuated safely from the site.

High school and university students began the protests after the government hiked fares on Oct. 6 to as much as $1.17 for a peak metro ride, blaming higher energy costs and a weaker peso.

The protests turned increasingly violent on Friday afternoon, however, and by early evening, officials had closed down all of the city’s 136 metro stations, which connect more than 87 miles of track.

The metro system will remain closed through the weekend, with officials saying “serious destruction” made it impossible to operate trains safely.

Demonstrators clanging pots and honking horns clashed with police armed with batons and tear gas all across the normally subdued city late into Friday evening.

Metro management said there had been more than 200 incidents on Santiago’s subway system in the previous 11 days, mostly involving school children and older students jumping barriers and forcing gates.

Earlier on Friday, after a meeting with the metro chief and interior minister, Transport Minister Gloria Hutt told reporters the fare hike would not be reversed. She said the government subsidizes almost half the operating costs of the metro, one of Latin America’s most modern.

“This is not a discussion that should have risen to the level of violence that we’ve seen,” she said.",JustBadNews,0

“In the coming days, our government will call for a dialogue ... to alleviate the suffering of those affected by the increase in fares,” Pinera said in the broadcast address.

Chile is one of Latin America’s wealthiest nations, but also, among its most unequal. Frustrations over the high cost of living in Santiago have become a political flashpoint, prompting calls for reforms on everything from the country’s tax and labor codes to its pension system.

Enel Chile, a subsidiary of Italian utility Enel, said vandals had set fire to the company’s high-rise corporate headquarters downtown. Local television footage showed flames climbing up the side of the building as fire crews struggled to break through growing crowds of protesters.

The company said in a statement posted on Twitter that workers had been evacuated safely from the site.

High school and university students began the protests after the government hiked fares on Oct. 6 to as much as $1.17 for a peak metro ride, blaming higher energy costs and a weaker peso.

The protests turned increasingly violent on Friday afternoon, however, and by early evening, officials had closed down all of the city’s 136 metro stations, which connect more than 87 miles of track.

The metro system will remain closed through the weekend, with officials saying “serious destruction” made it impossible to operate trains safely.

Demonstrators clanging pots and honking horns clashed with police armed with batons and tear gas all across the normally subdued city late into Friday evening.

Metro management said there had been more than 200 incidents on Santiago’s subway system in the previous 11 days, mostly involving school children and older students jumping barriers and forcing gates.

Earlier on Friday, after a meeting with the metro chief and interior minister, Transport Minister Gloria Hutt told reporters the fare hike would not be reversed. She said the government subsidizes almost half the operating costs of the metro, one of Latin America’s most modern.

“This is not a discussion that should have risen to the level of violence that we’ve seen,” she said.",JustBadNews,0
"As Trump Downplays Attack on Kurds, Amnesty Details Turkish War Crimes and 'Utterly Callous Disregard for Civilian Life', ""Killing defenseless people in cold blood is utterly reprehensible and a blatant war crime,"" said Amnesty International secretary general Kumi Naidoo",http://commondreams.org/news/2019/10/18/trump-downplays-attack-kurds-amnesty-details-turkish-war-crimes-and-utterly-callous,"Just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump downplayed Turkey's assault on Kurds in Syria by likening it to a parking lot squabble, Amnesty International on Friday presented damning evidence that Turkish forces and their allies have committed war crimes and displayed a ""shameful disregard for civilian life"" in northeastern Syria.

Based on video footage, medical records, and witness testimony from journalists and aid workers, Amnesty's new report details numerous appalling instances of Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies indiscriminately bombarding residential areas, abducting civilians, and committing murder in cold blood.

""The Turkish military offensive into northeast Syria has wreaked havoc on the lives of Syrian civilians who once again have been forced to flee their homes and are living in constant fear of indiscriminate bombardment, abductions, and summary killings.""

—Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International

""In one of the most horrific attacks documented,"" Amnesty said, ""a Kurdish Red Crescent worker described how he pulled bodies from the wreckage of a Turkish airstrike on 12 October at around 7 am, in which two munitions landed near to a school in Salhiye, where civilians displaced by the fighting had sought shelter.""

The aid worker told Amnesty that four people, including two children, were killed in the Turkish strike.

""I couldn't tell if they were boys or girls because their corpses were black. They looked like charcoal,"" he said. ""The other two people killed were older men, they looked older than 50. Honestly, I am still in shock.""

The report also highlights the case of Hevrin Khalaf, a Kurdish female politician and Secretary General of the Future Syria political party who was ""dragged out of her car, beaten, and shot dead"" on October 12 by fighters with Ahrar al-Sharqiya, a Syrian rebel group allied with Turkey.

""A medical report seen by Amnesty International lists a series of injuries inflicted on Hevrin Khalaf,"" the group said, ""including multiple gunshot wounds to the head, face, and back as well as fractures to her legs, face and skull, detachment of skin from her skull, and loss of hair as a result of being dragged by the hair.""

Kumi Naidoo, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement that ""killing defenseless people in cold blood is utterly reprehensible and a blatant war crime.""

""Turkish military forces and their allies have displayed an utterly callous disregard for civilian lives.""

In addition to demanding that Turkey halt its attacks on northeastern Syria, Amnesty urged nations that export arms to the country to immediately suspend any weapons transfers.

""The USA is the largest exporter of weapons to Turkey,"" Amnesty noted. ""Other suppliers include Italy, Germany, Brazil, and India.""

Amnesty's report comes after Trump—who paved the way for the Turkish military operation by abruptly withdrawing U.S. forces from northeastern Syria—made light of the humanitarian catastrophe in the region by comparing it to a parking lot scrap between ""two kids.""

""Sometimes you have to let 'em fight,"" Trump said during a campaign rally in Dallas, Texas. ""Like two kids in a lot, you gotta let 'em fight, then you pull 'em apart.""

"China third-quarter GDP grows 6.0% year-on-year, misses expectations. China's economic growth slowed more than expected to 6.0% year-on-year in the third quarter, the weakest pace in at least 27-1/2 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered amid a bruising Sino-U.S. trade war.",https://reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-gdp/china-third-quarter-gdp-grows-6-0-year-on-year-misses-expectations-idUSKBN1WX05A,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s third-quarter economic growth slowed more than expected and to its weakest pace in almost three decades as the bruising U.S. trade war hit factory production, boosting the case for Beijing to roll out fresh support.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose just 6.0% year-on-year, marking a further loss of momentum for the economy from the second quarter’s 6.2% growth.

China’s trading partners and investors are closely watching the health of the world’s second-largest economy as the trade war with the United States fuels fears about a global recession.

Asian stocks stumbled after the data, reversing gains made on the UK and European Union striking a long-awaited Brexit deal.

Downbeat Chinese data in recent months has highlighted weaker demand at home and abroad. Still, most analysts say the scope for aggressive stimulus is limited in an economy already saddled with piles of debt following previous easing cycles, which have sent housing prices sharply higher.

Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based economist at Hwabao Trust, pinned the worse-than-expected GDP growth mainly to weakness in export-related industries, especially the manufacturing sector.

“Given exports are unlikely to stage a comeback and a possible slowdown in the property sector, the downward pressure on China’s economy is likely to continue, with fourth-quarter economic growth expected to slip to 5.9%,” Nie said.

“Authorities will loosen policies, but in a more restrained way.”

The third-quarter GDP growth was the slowest since the first quarter of 1992, the earliest quarterly data on record, and missed forecasts for 6.1% growth in a Reuters poll of analysts. It was also at the bottom end of the government’s full-year target range of 6.0%-6.5%.

In a briefing after the GDP data release, Mao Shengyong, a spokesman for China’s statistics bureau, announced Beijing’s plans to bring forward some 2020 special local government bond issuance to this year, in a move to spur regional infrastructure investment.

Even recent signs of breakthrough in the protracted trade war between Beijing and Washington are unlikely to change the economic outlook any time soon.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week the two sides had reached agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff hike, but officials warn much work still needed to be done.

A slide in China’s exports accelerated in September while imports contracted for a fifth straight month.

The drags on demand, both domestic and global, have hit several key parts of the economy with weakness seen in freight shipments, factory power generation, employment and entertainment spending. In September, factory gate prices fell at their fastest pace in three years.

Mao from the statistics bureau said there was ample room to change monetary policy, as rising consumer inflation has been mainly driven by volatile food prices.

The International Monetary Fund has warned the U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, but said output would rebound if their dueling tariffs were removed.

Beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the current slowdown, including trillions of yuan in tax cuts and local government bonds to fund infrastructure projects and efforts to spur bank lending.

But the economy has been slow to respond with business confidence shaky and local governments facing increasing strains as tax cuts hit revenues, weighing on investment.

PATCHES OF HOPE

In contrast to the disappointing headline GDP number, China’s industrial output grew a better-than-expected 5.8% in September, faster than the 17-year-low posted in August.

The uptick was in line with signs of increased domestic orders, though overall demand remains at historically weak levels. Analysts had expected industrial output to grow 5.0% in September.

Slideshow ( 4 images )

September’s industrial production was also in line with recent business surveys that noted new domestic orders in food processing, textiles and electrical machinery, although growth in other products such as cement, crude steel and cars slowed further.

Hwabao Trust’s Nie does not expect stronger manufacturing to last given slowing global demand, which would suggest a pick up in broader economic growth remains unlikely.

Fixed asset investment grew 5.4% from January-September, matching expectations, but slowing from the 5.5% in the first eight months.

Private sector fixed-asset investment, accounting for 60% of the country’s total investment, grew 4.7% in January-September, down from 4.9% in January-August.

Retail sales rose 7.8% year-on-year last month, in line with expectations, and faster than 7.5% in August.

In another positive sign, China’s property investment stayed buoyant in September, boosted by a rise in new construction activity.

But property transactions slowed during what is traditionally China’s “Golden September” peak season for new home sales, hurt by authorities persistent crackdown on speculation, which showed few signs of easing.

“As infrastructure investment is unlikely to rebound strongly, preventing a big slide in property investment will be key for authorities when they try to stabilize next year’s economic growth,” said Zhang Yi, chief economist at Beijing-based Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management.",JustBadNews,0

Shots allegedly fired at protesters.",http://aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/protests-erupt-lebanon-plans-impose-taxes-191017194856354.html,"Lebanese government plans to impose new taxes on tobacco, gasoline and some social media platforms, including WhatsApp.

Hundreds of people have taken to the streets across Lebanon over the government’s plans to impose new taxes amid an economic crisis in the country.

The protests late on Thursday came as the government held discussions about the 2020 budget and proposed new taxes, including on tobacco, gasoline and some social media platforms such as Whatsapp.

Chanting “Revolution!” dozens of protesters marched near the government headquarters and parliament building in central Beirut, the Lebanese capital, where large numbers of riot police were deployed.

State-run National News Agency (NNA) said the bodyguard of an official opened fire at protesters as they tried to block the road where a convoy was passing in central Beirut.

There was no immediate word on casualties.

Others in the capital blocked the road to the airport with burning tyres, NNA said.

Demonstrations also erupted in Beirut’s southern suburbs, the southern city of Sidon, the northern city of Tripoli and in the Bekaa Valley, NNA said.

Across the country, demonstrators chanted the popular refrain of the 2011 Arab Spring protests: “The people demand the fall of the regime.”

“We elected them and we will remove them from power,” one protester told a local TV station.

Public anger has simmered since parliament passed an austerity budget in July, with the aim of trimming the country’s ballooning deficit. The situation worsened last month after banks and money exchange houses rationed dollar sales, sparking fears of a currency devaluation.

The government is assessing a series of further belt-tightening measures it hopes will rescue the country’s ailing economy and secure $11bn in aid pledged by international donors last year.

It is expected to announce a series of additional tax hikes in the coming months as part of next year’s budget.",JustBadNews,0

'Really unfair': Toronto teen disappointed at Vans for pulling her Hong Kong shoe design from contest,http://nationalpost.com/news/it-was-really-unfair-toronto-teen-blasts-vans-for-removing-her-hong-kong-shoe-design-from-contest,"Article content continued

“I just think it was really unfair of them to take away my design. It had followed all the rules,” she said in an interview. It “was a huge disrespect to the freedom of my expression, which stands as one of the chief features of the brand.”

Hong Kong demonstrators and their backers are among those condemning the decision. They’ve called it the latest example of Western enterprises putting profits from China ahead of the pro-democracy cause, and applauded the artist — identified on the contest site simply as naomiso.

But So’s story is not quite as straightforward as those activists might imagine.

Her design features a yellow umbrella, the bauhinia flower that forms Hong Kong’s logo and a group of people in gas masks and helmets, all emblematic of the mass protest movement.

So said her parents are immigrants from Hong Kong and have been following recent events there closely, which meant the idea came to her almost immediately. She says the protesters are “voicing out their opinions, and I think that’s really important in this day and age.”

Yet she insists she was not trying to take a stand herself.

“I see my role as a designer, but also as a reporter. Reporters use a camera, pen and paper and I use my artwork as my medium to express,” So says. “It’s really sad to see the many places in Hong Kong that I have visited to be in such disarray.”

In fact, she and her family have so far balked at giving a Hong Kong company permission to produce shoes based on her design. The manufacturer wants to donate the proceeds to groups supporting the demonstrations, but So said consenting to that “would be me taking sides.”",JustBadNews,0
Pedophile who abused up to 200 children found dead in prison,http://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/14/uk/richard-huckle-pedophile-killed-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) A man described as one of Britain's worst pedophiles has been found dead in jail.

Richard Huckle, 33, who claimed to have abused almost 200 Malaysian children, died at Full Sutton prison in Yorkshire, England on Sunday, the UK's Ministry of Justice confirmed in a statement. UK media reported that Huckle had been stabbed to death.

Huckle received 22 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2016 for offenses against children aged between six months and 12 years.

The Ministry of Justice confirmed Huckle had died on October 13 but added that it would be ""inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing.""

During his trial, the London court heard Huckle, who worked as a freelance photographer, was arrested in 2014 at Gatwick Airport as he returned home from Malaysia, where he committed most of his crimes. He had confessed to abusing children on a blog he published on the dark web, an area of the Internet not easily accessible to the general user.

"With No End to Unrest in Sight, Hong Kong's Economic Pain Deepens",http://nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-economy.html,"For many, the looming question is whether a prolonged or precipitous economic decline will chip away at popular support for the movement. A few business owners shook their heads in dismay over the vandalism and disruptions to public transport, though they asked to remain anonymous given the growing vigilante-style attacks on those the protesters deem hostile to their cause.

Surrounded by display cases stacked full with $70,000 Rolexes and $20,000 Tudor watches, Cherry Chang, 30, the owner of a small store in Tsim Sha Tsui, the shopping district, said sales have halved over the last few months. Still, she said she was willing to endure short-term financial pain for the loftier goals of genuine democracy and the preservation of the city’s generous civil liberties.

“I don’t mind losing money to support certain ideals,” she said.

Cheuk-Yan Lee, general secretary of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which supports the protest movement, said he thought most Hong Kongers would blame the government for any hardship, not the protesters. The bigger threat, he said, is losing the freedoms and reliably independent courts that coaxed so many international companies to set up shop here in the first place.

“What will really hurt Hong Kong is not a brief drop in consumption but a loss of faith from global investors,” he said. “Instead of suppressing the protests, the government needs to revive confidence in the rule of law. Otherwise, we will just end up being another Chinese city.”",JustBadNews,0
Hate crime psychologist is brutally killed in her South African home,http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7554683/Hate-crime-psychologist-brutally-killed-South-African-home.html?ito=amp_twitter_share-top,"Leading scholar, Dr Mirah Wilks (pictured), was murdered in her home after a gang broke in, stabbed her 12 times and slit her throat

A brilliant psychologist and specialist in hate crime and violence in South Africa was brutally butchered and had her throat slit in her own home by a gang of armed robbers.

Leading scholar Dr Mirah Wilks was ambushed and attacked by the men who had waited until her husband Frank left to worship at the local synagogue, leaving her home alone.

The group had climbed up onto the roof and removed tiles and dropped down inside the house and stabbed Mirah at least twelve times in the chest and back then cut her throat.

Retired husband Frank, 72, returned home from evening worship on Sunday night and found the blood soaked body of his wife of 45 years lying dead on the floor of the family home.

Dr Wilks, 69, was renowned for her research into hate crimes, trauma and violence and was a highly respected former Chair of the Psychological Society of South Africa.

South African Police have launched a major man-hunt for the gang who struck at the home in Johannesburg and killed her just to steal two laptops and a mobile phone.

Former art teacher turned counsellor, Dr Wilks qualified last year with a PhD in Hate Crimes from the University of South Africa after spending many years in South Africa as a top psychologist.

Wilks, pictured here with her husband Frank (left), was renowned for her academic research into hate crimes, trauma and violence and was highly respected in her field

Dr Wilks had moved to Australia from Israel as a young girl and had a daughter Tarryn and son Brett in Melbourne, Victoria, with husband Frank (left) and the family later emigrated to South Africa

She had also gained degrees at the University of Queensland in Australia and the University of Pennsylvania in the USA and was working at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg when she was murdered.

Dr Wilks had moved to Australia from Israel as a young girl and had a daughter Tarryn and son Brett in Melbourne, Victoria, with husband Frank and the family later emigrated to South Africa.

Dr Wilks had recently started important research into 'resilience as a means of adaption and survival' with a special focus on South Africa's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

South African Police said they believed the men had waited for Mr Wilks to leave the home before breaking in through the ceiling to perhaps get round the security doors and windows.

A source said the helpless grandmother was stabbed at least twelve time and during the struggle the ruthless gang slit her throat before making off with two laptops and cell phone.

Police spokespeman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said: 'A case of murder is being investigated and the post mortem will determine the exact cause of death but a sharp object was used.

Dr Wilks, pictured behind her husband Frank (left) and another relative, was referred to as a 'good soul' and someone with 'great integrity and honour'

'It was used in the fatal assault on the victim who was found by her husband when her returned home from church and we are appealing for witnesses to come forward.'

Professor Juan Nel who was a close friend of Dr Wilks, and her supervisor, said that the Pyschological Society of South Africa was distraught after learning of her murder.

He said: 'Dr Wilks was the victim of a violent crime that took place in her home and Mirah's untimely death has left us with a deep sense of loss that will affect all of us here.

'Mirah was known to a great many of her colleagues in the psychology fraternity and was a good soul and a person in the profession who had great integrity and honour' he said.

Counselling psychologist Dr Ingrid Artus said: 'We have a scarcity of psychologists in South Africa and the service they provide to society are vital and her loss will impact on patients.

'The work that she was doing in SA was vital to helping a country such as ours. This will perpetuate the fear that many associate with crime. She will be greatly missed,' she said.

The Psychological Society of South Africa shared a poignant letter Dr Wilks had shared with her students, describing herself as a childhood polio survivor and Jewish refugee who had battled cancer.

'Everyone has a story,' Dr Wilks wrote. 'I have often wondered how I survived, rebounded and found new pathways to health. What was the source of my ability to regenerate? Where was my source of hope and positivity? Did my attitude on life and my personality have anything to do with my experiences of resilience in adversity?'

The society added: 'And hopeful and positive, she was. Always.'

She had also gained degrees at the University of Queensland in Australia and the University of Pennsylvania in the USA and was working at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg (pictured) when she was murdered

Trump admits US killed millions in war based on lies,http://wsws.org/en/articles/2019/10/10/iraq-o10.html,"Amid the storm of denunciations—extending from right-wing Republicans to the Democratic Party, the New York Times and the pseudo-left Jacobin magazine—of his decision to pull US troops out of Syria, President Donald Trump issued an extraordinary tweet on Wednesday in defense of his policy:

“The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE ... IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! We went to war under a false & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.”

Trump’s Twitter account has dominated the US news cycle ever since he took office. Tweets have introduced fascistic new policies on immigration, announced the frequent firings of White House personnel and cabinet members and signaled shifts in US foreign policy.

Last month, amid the mounting of an impeachment inquiry, which the Democratic leadership in Congress has focused exclusively on “national security” concerns stemming from Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the US president set a new personal record, tweeting 800 times.

Yet the corporate media has chosen to ignore Trump’s tweet on the protracted US military intervention in the Middle East.

From the standpoint of the bitter internecine struggle unfolding within the US capitalist state, the tweet expresses the sharp divisions over US global strategy. While those around Trump want to focus entirely on preparation for confrontation with China, layers within the political establishment and the military and intelligence apparatus see the continuation of the US intervention to assert its hegemony over the Middle East and countering Russia as critical for American imperialism’s drive to impose its dominance over the Eurasian landmass.

But aside from these disputes over geo-strategic policy, the admission by a sitting US president that Washington launched a war under a “false” and “disproven” premise that ended up killing “millions” has direct political implications, whatever Trump’s intentions.

It amounts to an official admission from the US government that successive US administrations are responsible for war crimes resulting in mass murder.

Trump acknowledges that Washington launched the 2003 invasion of Iraq on the “false premise” of “weapons of mass destruction.” In other words, the administration of George W. Bush lied to the people of the United States and the entire planet in order to facilitate a war of aggression.

Under international law, this war was a criminal action and a patently unjustified violation of Iraq’s sovereignty. The Nuremberg Tribunal, convened in the aftermath of the Second World War, declared the planning and launching of a war of aggression the supreme crime of the Nazis, from which all of their horrific atrocities flowed, including the Holocaust. On the basis of this legal principle, Bush, Vice President Cheney and other top US officials, as well as their successors in the Obama and Trump administrations who continued the US intervention in the Middle East—expanding it into Syria and Libya, while threatening a new war against Iran—should all face prosecution as war criminals.

The real basis for the war was the long-held predatory conception that by militarily conquering Iraq Washington could seize control of the vast energy resources of the Middle East—giving it a stranglehold over the oil lifeline to its principal rivals in Asia and Europe—and thereby offset the decline of US imperialism’s global hegemony.

The World Socialist Web Site described the consequences of the US assault on Iraq and its people as “sociocide,” the deliberate destruction of what had been among the most advanced societies, in terms of education, health care and infrastructure, in the Middle East (see: “The US war and occupation of Iraq—the murder of a society”).

The casualties inflicted by this war were staggering. According to a comprehensive 2006 study done by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and published in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet, the death toll resulting from the US invasion rose to over 655,000 in the first 40 months of the US war alone.

The continued slaughter resulting from the US occupation and the bloody sectarian civil war provoked by Washington’s divide-and-rule tactics claimed many more direct victims, while the destruction of basic water, power, health care and sanitation infrastructure killed even more. The mass slaughter continued under the Obama administration with the launching in 2014 of what was billed as a US war against ISIS. This war, which saw the most intense bombing campaign since Vietnam and reduced Mosul, Ramadi, Fallujah and other Iraqi cities to rubble, claimed tens if not hundreds of thousands more lives.

Recent estimates of the death toll resulting from 16 years of US military intervention in Iraq range as high as 2.4 million people.

The Iraq war has had its own disastrous consequences for US society as well. In addition to claiming the lives of more than 4,500 US troops and nearly 4,000 US contractors, the war left tens of thousands of US troops wounded and hundreds of thousands suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries.

What of all the families in the United States who lost children, siblings or parents in a war that Trump now admits was based upon lies? Together with the veterans suffering from the wounds of this war, they should have the right to sue the US government for the results of its criminal conduct.

The cost of the US wars launched since 2001 has risen to nearly $6 trillion, the bulk of it stemming from Iraq, while interest cost on the money borrowed to pay for these wars will eventually amount to $8 trillion.

These grievous costs to US society are compounded by the social and political impact of waging an illegal war, resulting in the shredding of democratic rights and the wholesale corruption of a political system that is ever more dominated by the military and intelligence apparatus.

The media’s silence on Trump’s admission of war crimes carried out by US imperialism in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East is self-incriminating. It reflects the complicity of the corporate media in these crimes, with its selling of the lies used to promote the aggression against Iraq and its attempt to suppress antiwar sentiment.

Nowhere was this war propaganda developed more deliberately than at the New York Times which inundated the American public with lying reports about “weapons of mass destruction” by Judith Miller and the noxious opinion pieces by chief foreign affairs commentator Thomas “I have no problem with a war for oil” Friedman.

By all rights, the media editors and pundits responsible for promoting a criminal war of aggression deserve to sit in the dock alongside the war criminals who launched it.

The corporate media has also ignored Trump’s indictment of the US wars in the Middle East because it speaks for those sections of the US ruling establishment that want them to continue.

Trump’s cynical nationalist and populist rhetoric about ending US wars in the Middle East is aimed at currying support with a US population that is overwhelmingly hostile to these wars, even as his administration—backed by the Democrats—has secured a record $738 billion military budget in preparation for far more catastrophic wars, including against nuclear-armed China and Russia.

If the fascistic occupant of the White House is able to adopt the farcical posture of an opponent of imperialist war, it is entirely thanks to the Democrats, whose opposition to Trump is bound up with the concerns of the US intelligence agencies and the Pentagon over his conduct of foreign policy.

While there was mass opposition to the invasion of Iraq, the pseudo-left in the United States, together with the media, worked might and main to channel it behind the Democratic Party, which provided uninterrupted support and funding for the war. Today, it is the most pro-war party, aligned with the opposition to Trump by the likes of John Bolton, Lindsey Graham and Bush.

Trump’s admission about the criminality of the Iraq war only confirms what the World Socialist Web Site stated from its very outset. The struggle that it has waged for the building of a mass antiwar movement based upon the working class and armed with a socialist and internationalist program to unite the workers of the United States, the Middle East and the entire planet against the capitalist system provides the only way forward in the struggle against war.",JustBadNews,0

California-based game company Blizzard bans pro esports player and confiscates his prize money after he voices support for Hong Kong protesters,http://businessinsider.com/blizzard-bans-esports-player-blitzchung-supporting-hong-kong-protests-interview-2019-10,"Invent Global

Blizzard Entertainment has sent a professional esports player home from a tournament and handed him a 12-month ban after he voiced support for Hong Kong protesters during a postgame interview.

The esports player, whose real name is Chung Ng Wai but who is known as Blitzchung, will also be fined the full amount of the prize money he won from the Hearthstone Grandmasters regular-season tournament.

During the interview on the official Taiwanese Hearthstone stream, Blitzchung appeared wearing a gas mask, which he lifted up before shouting „Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!“ in Chinese.

Blizzard appears to be arguing that Blitzchung’s statements about the Hong Kong protests offended „a portion or group of the public“ or damaged the company’s image.

The situation highlights the thorny trade-off US-based companies face when operating in China, which offers a lucrative and massive market but a different set of rules companies must play by.

A professional esports player has been fined his prize money and given a yearlong ban after he voiced support for Hong Kong’s protesters during a postgame interview.

The Hong Kong-based player, known as Blitzchung, will be forced to forfeit his monetary prize and won’t be able to compete for a year for making the remarks, the US-based video game giant Blizzard announced Tuesday. The two casters — esports commentators — who appeared alongside Blitzchung in the interview will also „not work with Blizzard anymore,“ according to the company.

The player, whose real name is Chung Ng Wai, was participating in the Hearthstone Grandmasters regular season, an esports tournament in which players play Hearthstone, the turn-based online card game developed by Blizzard.

On Sunday, the esports publication Inven Global tweeted out footage of Blitzchung’s post-match interview on the official Taiwanese Hearthstone stream. Blizzard has since deleted footage of the interview from its official channels.

During the interview, Blitzchung appears wearing a gas mask, which he lifts up before shouting „Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!“ in Chinese, as verified by Polygon.

@Matthieist #Hearthstone pic.twitter.com/DnaMSEaM4g

After Blitzchung’s exclamation, his two casters look down, seemingly in an attempt to distance themselves from his remarks. Blitzchung later told Inven Global it was his „duty“ to speak out about the Hong Kong protests.

„As you know, there are serious protests in my country now,“ he said. „My call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention. I put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months that I sometimes couldn’t focus on preparing my Grandmaster match.

„I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life,“ he told the publication.

Blizzard is a US-based company, where speech is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, but it also operates in authoritarian China thanks to a partnership with one of its China-based investors, Tencent. China issues only a certain number of game licenses a year, and US-based companies often partner with game companies based in the country as a way to access the vast market and grow their sales — but partnerships like that often lead to a clash of values.

The situation highlights the thorny tradeoff US-based companies face when operating in China: It’s a hugely profitable opportunity, but placating the Chinese government can require compromising on fundamental democratic values in ways that provoke backlash elsewhere in the world.

Tellingly, Tencent is also a partner of the NBA, which is in crisis after the Houston Rockets‘ general manager, Daryl Morey, faced a major backlash in China for tweeting in support of the Hong Kong protesters on Friday.

Several of the Rockets‘ Chinese sponsors and partners, including the state broadcaster China Central Television and Tencent’s livestreaming platform, Tencent Sports, have since said they will no longer broadcast Rockets games.

Morey deleted the tweet and said he did not mean to „cause any offense,“ but the damage seems to have been done in a country where basketball is the most watched sports league.

The TV show „South Park“ is another recent example of a US-based product angering the nation state. After a recent episode saw the character Randy visit a Chinese reeducation camp and endure forced labor, the show has reportedly been banned in China. The show promptly issued a mock apology through its Twitter account.

Elsewhere in the tech industry, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was recently criticized by its own employees and US lawmakers for quietly working on a version of the Google search engine designed for the Chinese market that would censor its results. The company has since said it’s stopped work on the project.

Blizzard, announcing the bans, did not address whether Tencent or the Chinese government influenced its decision. Instead, it said Blitzchung violated the rules of its competition, specifically this rule:

„Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.“

Blizzard appears to be arguing that Blitzchung’s statements about the Hong Kong protests offended „a portion or group of the public“ or damaged the company’s image. Blizzard did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment. The company has disabled comments on its blog post announcing the ban.",JustBadNews,0
Elon Musk privately admitted he was a 'f--king idiot' for calling a cave diver a 'child rapist' without evidence,http://businessinsider.com/elon-musk-admits-ryan-mac-email-vernon-unsworth-mistake-2019-10,"Lawyers for Vernon Unsworth, the British cave diver hitting Elon Musk with a defamation lawsuit after Musk called him a ""pedo guy,"" unveiled new documents in the lawsuit on Monday.

The documents contain an email from Musk to a public-relations agent in which he called himself a ""f---ing idiot"" for telling a BuzzFeed journalist in an email that Unsworth was a ""child rapist.""

Unsworth's lawyers allege Musk paid a private investigator not only to dig up dirt on Unsworth but also to feed information to the British press.

The documents reveal how Musk came to deeply regret his extraordinary allegations against the cave diver.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Elon Musk privately called himself a ""f---ing idiot"" for calling a cave diver a ""child rapist"" in an email to a journalist.

Court documents made public Monday night in a legal battle between the cave diver Vernon Unsworth and the Tesla CEO have shed more light on the fallout from Musk's evidence-free allegation on Twitter that Unsworth was a ""pedo guy.""

Musk first called Unsworth the name in a tweet sent in July last year. The professional diver had criticized Musk's proposal to rescue a Thai soccer team trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand using a submarine — a move Unsworth described as a publicity stunt.

The following month, after receiving an email from the BuzzFeed News reporter Ryan Mac, the 48-year-old tech executive emailed the journalist with a barrage of fresh allegations, claiming without offering evidence that Unsworth was a ""child rapist"" who married a 12-year-old and urging Mac to investigate. Mac subsequently published the email, which Musk had prefaced with ""off the record."" (Mac had not agreed to an off-the-record exchange in advance.)

Read more: Elon Musk hired a PI to dig up dirt on cave diver Vernon Unsworth. That guy is reportedly a felon.

The new court documents from Unsworth's lawyers include emails Musk sent to a public-relations agent after the debacle, indicating how he came to regret his extraordinary allegations against the cave diver. ""I didn't expect Buzzfeed to publish an off the record email,"" Musk wrote. ""My intent was to have them investigate and come to their own conclusions, not publish my email directly. Still, I'm a f---ing idiot.""

""In the past, Buzzfeed has respected emails prefaced with 'off the record,' but this time they did not,"" he added. ""It was still one of the dumbest things I've ever done.""

Unsworth's lawyers allege that Musk and Mac's interaction was not the only example of the CEO trying to feed stories to the press about Unsworth.

James Howard-Higgins, a private eye hired by Musk to dig into Unsworth, was also tasked with feeding information surreptitiously back to the press, the new documents indicate. An email to Howard-Higgins from Jared Birchall, the head of Musk's family office, said: ""We would like you to immediately move forward with 'leaking' this information to the UK press. Obviously must be done very carefully.""

A previous set of documents in the case first revealed that Musk had hired Howard-Higgins to defend himself, and BuzzFeed subsequently reported last week that Howard-Higgins had a history of fraud. In a deposition, Musk said he came to believe that the reports being sent back to Musk's family office were ""just taking us for a ride.""

Unsworth's UK lawyer Mark Stephens alleged to Business Insider that Musk's email to BuzzFeed News and Howard-Higgins' instructions to leak to the press showed a common attempt to manipulate the media without explicitly naming Musk as the source of the information. ""It's exactly the same strategy,"" he said.

Unsworth's lawyers also claim that Howard-Higgins never gave Musk any information about Unsworth marrying a 12-year-old. ""Nothing in [Howard-Higgins'] report would reflect or give grounds to say that,"" Stephens said.

Musk's lawyer Alex Spiro told Business Insider in a statement: ""This case is nothing but a money-grab in which Unsworth has pursued profit and self-promotion at every turn.""

"Chinese muslims reveal rapes, abortions and forced sterilisations 'using chilli paste' at 'concentration camps' as shocking footage emerges of hundreds of shackled and blindfolded prisoners",http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7546833/Chinese-muslims-reveal-rapes-abortions-forced-sterilisations-concentration-camps.html,"Muslim women who have fled China's 'concentration camps' have revealed a world of rapes, abortions and sterilisations as they find refuge abroad.

It comes as shocking footage emerged allegedly showing hundreds of shackled and blindfolded Muslim prisoners being transferred in Xinjiang, western China.

UN experts and activists say at least one million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are held in the detention centres in Xinjiang.

China describes them as 'training centres' helping to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.

But the escaped women and local rights groups say attempts to curb the Muslim population - using methods such as rubbing chilli paste on women's privates - are common.

Muslim women who have fled China's 'reeducation camps' have revealed a world of rapes, abortions and forced sterilisations as they find refuge abroad. Gulzira Mogdyn (pictured), 38, said officials cut her open and ripped out her fetus without anaesthetic

Student Ruqiye Perhat, who was arrested in Xinjiang in 2009 and spent four years in prison before fleeing to Turkey, told the Washington Post: 'Any woman or man under age 35 was raped and sexually abused.'

And others who have fled the camp more recently claimed the rapes had become more systematic than in normal prisons.

The camps' guards would 'put bags on the heads of the ones they wanted' before dragging the women outside and raping them through the night.

In one case, a human rights activists claimed there had been seven instances of women forced into having intrauterine devices implanted.

And it was claimed women who were pregnant when they were arrested were made to have brutal abortions.

The camps' guards would 'put bags on the heads of the ones they wanted' before dragging the women outside and raping them through the night. Pictured: Gulzira Mogdyn on the phone at a bus stop on the outskirts of Almaty, Kazakhstan

Gulzira Mogdyn, 38, who fled to Almaty, Kazakhstan, told of the gruesome way officials cut her open and ripped out her fetus without anaesthetic.

Others have previously said the Chinese guards would also medically experiment on them ahead of planned organ harvesting.

China has been forced to defend its authorities' actions as 'normal tasks' following the emergence of shocking footage purported to show hundreds of shackled and blindfolded Muslim prisoners being transferred.

The drone video shows the detainees being led from trains with their heads shaven, eyes covered and hands bound.

The video, uploaded to social media and unverified, appeared as the United States is increasing its pressure on Beijing over what it says is the systematic oppression of Muslims.

Social media footage purports to show Uighur Muslim prisoners being transferred in China

With their heads shaven, eyes covered and hands bound, the detainees are seen wearing purple vests with the words 'Kashgar Detention Center' written on their backs in the clip

The alleged prisoners are also seen in the clip sitting in rows outside what appears to be a train station watched by dozens of SWAT officers.

Many of them, thought to be ethnic minority Uighurs, are seen wearing purple vests with the words 'Kashgar Detention Center' written on their backs.

US officials believed the footage to be authentic.

Former detainees have revealed that Muslims were forced to eat pork and speak Mandarin in those internment camps.

China has also kept thousands of Uighur children away from their Muslim parents before indoctrinating them in camps posing as schools and orphanages, recent evidence shows.

The detainees are seen sitting in rows in a train station watched by dozens of SWAT officers

The clip then shows them being taken away by the SWAT officers to an unknown location

A Western intelligence official was able to verify the movement of some 500 prisoners earlier this year from Kashgar to Korla in Xinjiang, a Muslim-dominant region in western China

Muslims make up about two per cent of the 1.4 billion population in China. However, as the country is so populous, its Muslim population is expected to be the 19th largest in the world in 2030.

The Muslim population in China is projected to increase from 23.3 million in 2010 to nearly 30 million in 2030.

The clip, filmed by a Chinese-made DJI drone, was posted to YouTube last month by a user known as 'Fear on War'.

Words in the video suggest the scene was captured in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, an autonomous prefecture for Mongols in southern Xinjiang.

A pervasive security apparatus has subdued the ethnic unrest that has long plagued China's north-western Xinjiang region. Chinese officials have largely avoided comment on the re-education camps, but some said that ideological changes are needed to fight separatism

Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang have been told to vow loyalty to the Communist Party of China and the country's leader Xi Jinping. Pictured, a woman walks past a screen showing images of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kashgar on June 4, 2019

Authorities in China's Xinjiang region have rounded up an estimated one million mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking minorities into internment camps in what they call an 'anti-terror' campaign

Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the footage was likely to have been taken at the Korla West Train Station in Korla after analysing the footage, according to Mr Ruser's tweets.

Korla is a city of 550,000 people in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.

Authorities of Xinjiang said: 'Transporting inmates by judicial authorities (is related) to normal judicial activities.'

In a statement to CNN, the authorities said: 'Cracking down on crimes in accordance with law is the common practice of all countries.'

They added: 'Xinjiang's crackdown on crimes has never been linked to ethnicities or religions.'

A Western intelligence official believed the footage to be authentic. The official was able to verify the movement of some 500 prisoners earlier this year from Kashgar to Korla, according to CNN.

A European security source also claimed that the footage was genuine and showed up to 600 Uighur Muslim prisoners being moved earlier this year.

The source told Sky News last month: 'This is typical of the way the Chinese move this type of prisoner.'

New York-based Human Rights Watch said the footage demonstrates the 'gross human rights violations' against Uighurs from Beijing.

It called for an independent investigation into China's treatment of its Muslim residents.

A spokesperson from the group told MailOnline: 'While HRW hasn't yet corroborated this footage, it raises the specter of many of the same kinds of gross human rights violations against Uyghurs we have documented - especially mass arbitrary detention and lack of access to family or counsel.

'It underscores the urgent need for an independent investigation; Chinese authorities lost all credibility on this issue months ago by denying these abuses even exist.'

Radical Muslim Uighurs have killed hundreds in recent years, and China considers the region a threat to peace in a country where the majority is Han Chinese. Armed police and soldiers are common sight in Xinjiang after ethnic unrest in capital Urumqi left nearly 200 people killed

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week blasted China over its treatment of Uighur Muslims.

Pompeo reserved his toughest criticism for China in a keynote speech at a Vatican conference on religious freedom.

'When the state rules absolutely, it demands its citizens worship government, not God. That's why China has put more than one million Uighur Muslims ... in internment camps and is why it throws Christian pastors in jail,' he said.

'When the state rules absolutely, God becomes an absolute threat to authority,' he said.

Pompeo had previously called Beijing's treatment of the country's ethnic Uighur minority among 'the worst stains on the world'.

Beijing slammed Pompeo's remarks as 'lies'.

'The lies of American politicians can't trick people around the world and will only further expose the purpose of their hidden political motives,' said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.

'We express our strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to these US officials who disregard the facts... and seriously interfere in China's internal affairs,' she told reporters at a press briefing in Beijing.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week said China 'demands its citizens worship government, not God' in a keynote speech at a Vatican conference on religious freedom

China has come under international scrutiny over its policies in the north-western region of Xinjiang, where as many as one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities are being held in re-education camps, according to the 2018 findings of an independent UN panel.

After initially denying their existence, Beijing now defends the camps, which it calls 'vocational education centres', as a necessary measure to counter religious extremism and terrorism.

A 13-year-old dies after his classmates punched him at school,http://cnn.com/2019/09/26/us/13-year-old-dies-school-fight-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Mourners for a 13-year-old California boy who died from injuries sustained in an attack by students at his school angrily confronted the school system's superintendent at a Wednesday night vigil.

Moreno Valley Unified School District Superintendent Martinrex Kedziora, escorted by deputies, sought shelter behind the school's locked doors after his address at the vigil led to a vocal crowd questioning the district's response to ongoing schoolwide bullying concerns, CNN affiliate KCAL reported. In KCAL's report, one woman can be heard shouting, ""There's no excuse, you need to resign from office.""

Moments before that, Kedziora had tried to address the crowd before being shouted down. ""We're here tonight to work with the community to support them,"" he said.

Then, a woman responded, ""We are the community and you're not working with us.""

The victim, who police identified only as Diego, was a student at Landmark Middle School in Moreno Valley, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Police were called to the school on September 16 after a fight broke out on campus, according to a press release from Riverside County Sheriff's Department.

Brazilians Blast Bolsonaro's UN Speech Denying Amazon Devastation as a Total 'Scam',http://commondreams.org/news/2019/09/24/brazilians-blast-bolsonaros-un-speech-denying-amazon-devastation-total-scam,"Brazilians and environmental advocates around the world responded with outrage to a speech that Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro gave Tuesday to the United Nations General Assembly that included what one reporter described as ""a cantankerous and conspiratorial defense of his environmental record.""

""Bolsonaro is trying to convince the world that he is protecting the Amazon, when in reality he is promoting the dismantlement of the environment.""

—Márcio Astrini, Greenpeace Brazil

Márcio Astrini, public policy coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, declared Tuesday that ""the president's speech about the environment was a scam.""

""Bolsonaro is trying to convince the world that he is protecting the Amazon, when in reality he is promoting the dismantlement of the environment,"" Astrini said. ""Under his management, burning, deforestation, and violence have increased outrageously. For the forest and its people, Bolsonaro is a problem, not the solution.""

Bolsonaro's first speech (pdf) to the U.N. since he took office in January came amid mounting global criticism over this past summer's surge in deforestation and corresponding fires in the Amazon rainforest, the majority of which is located in Brazil. The ongoing destruction has provoked worldwide protests and calls for international intervention from some environmentalists and other world leaders—notably, French President Emmanuel Macron.

In Bolsonaro's address delivered in Portuguese Tuesday, the Brazilian leader took aim at foreign governments, NGOs, and the international media that have sounded the alarm about the burning of the Amazon.

""First of all, my government is solemnly committed to environmental preservation and sustainable development, to the benefit of Brazil and the world,"" Bolsonaro claimed, noting that ""Brazil is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of biodiversity and mineral resources.""

Bolsonaro continued:

All countries have their issues. However, the sensationalist attacks we have suffered from much of the international media due to the Amazon fires have aroused our patriotic sentiment. It is a misconception to state that the Amazon is a world heritage; and it is a misconception, as scientists attest, to say that our forest is the lung of world. Resorting to these fallacies, some countries, instead of helping, have followed the lies of the media and behaved disrespectfully, with a colonialist spirit. They have questioned what is most sacred to us: our sovereignty!

The Brazilian president added that he is ""especially grateful"" to U.S. President Donald Trump for respecting Brazil's sovereignty and claimed that ""unfortunately, some people, both inside and outside Brazil, with the support of NGOs, insist on treating and keeping our natives as cavemen."" Bolsonaro promised that his government ""will not increase its already demarcated Indigenous lands to 20 percent, as some heads of state would like to see happen.""

As The Guardian reported Tuesday, ""In an attempt to portray himself as a friend of Brazil's Indigenous communities Bolsonaro invited a rare indigenous supporter, Ysani Kalapalo, to attend his address and donned an Indigenous necklace after arriving in New York.""

Sônia Guajajara, head of the Brazilian Indigenous People's Association and one of the country's best-known Indigenous leaders, criticized Bolsonaro for the stunt.

""This is an attempt to trick the world and show he has support. But... it is another of his big lies,"" Guajajara told The Guardian. ""It doesn't matter what image he wants to project. What matters are his actions—which the world whole is seeing.""

Guajajara addressed Indigenous Brazilians' broader opposition to Bolsonaro's environmental agenda in an interview published Tuesday by The Washington Post.

""He wants to deliver our land for exploration, and we will never abide by this position,"" she said. ""The Indigenous movement across the five regions of this country do not agree with Bolsonaro's politics. We will continue fighting, opposing and making ourselves foes of this government.""

Brazil's former Environmental Minister Marina Silva, who oversaw a significant reduction in deforestation in the 2000s, told the Post that ""it is unfortunate, worrying, and very sad to see Brazil, which was once a protagonist in the environmental agenda, deny the reality of the grave problem of deforestation.""

""Only someone completely deranged and delirious can negate that which the eyes can see,"" Silva added.

The Brazilian Climate Observatory concurred in a statement Tuesday.

""As expected, Bolsonaro's speech at the United Nations has doubled down on division, on nationalism, and on ecocide,"" the observatory said. ""The president has once again embarrassed Brazil abroad by giving up the country's long-standing leadership on the environment for the sake of ideology.""

""Bolsonaro's policies bring an immediate risk to all humankind,"" the observatory warned. ""Science warns us that we have until 2030 to cut carbon emissions by 45 percent if we want to have a standing chance of stabilizing global heating at 1.5°C, thus avoiding its worst impacts. Runaway deforestation both in the cerrado and in Amazonia can, alone, blow the global target.""

Reporters highlighted factual issues with Bolsonaro's 30-minute address and noted that it could have repercussions for diplomacy. The Guardian's Tom Phillips tweeted, ""Even in their worst nightmares, I'm not sure Brazilian diplomats will have imagined a Bolsonaro [U.N. General Assembly] speech so arrogant, so bile-filled, and so truly calamitous for Brazil's place in the world.""

As Scottish foreign correspondent Andrew Downie put it, ""Well, speeches to the U.N. don't get crazier than that.""",JustBadNews,0
Trump: U.S. is 'locked and loaded' for potential response to attack in Saudi Arabia,http://jpost.com/Breaking-News/Trump-US-is-locked-and-loaded-for-potential-response-to-Saudi-attack-601810,"WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the United States was ""locked and loaded"" for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia 's oil facilities, after a senior official in his administration said Iran was to blame.Trump also authorized the use of the U.S. emergency oil stockpile to ensure stable supplies after the attack, which shut 5% of world production.""There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!"" Trump said on Twitter.Earlier in the day, a senior U.S. official told reporters that evidence from the attack, which hit the world's biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it, instead of the Yemeni Houthi group that had claimed responsibility.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim rival Iran.""Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply,"" he said.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the U.S. allegation it was responsible as ""pointless."" A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned that the Islamic Republic was ready for ""full-fledged"" war.""All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying.Tensions between Washington and Tehran were already running high because of a long-running dispute between the two nations over Iran's nuclear program that led the United States to impose sweeping sanctions.Oil prices surged more than 15% at the open on Sunday on worries over global supply and soaring tensions in the Middle East. State oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack on Saturday had cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day.The U.S. official, who asked not to be named, said on Sunday there were 19 points of impact in the attack on Saudi facilities and that evidence showed the launch area was west-northwest of the targets - not south from Yemen.The official added that Saudi officials indicated they had seen signs that cruise missiles were used in the attack, which is inconsistent with the Iran-aligned Houthi group’s claim that it conducted the attack with 10 drones.""There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate,"" the official told reporters.Riyadh has accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil-pumping stations and the Shaybah oil field, charges that Tehran denies, but has not blamed anyone for Saturday's strike. Riyadh also says Tehran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny.Richard Nephew, a program director at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, said that if Iran was responsible for the attack, it may be as retribution for U.S. sanctions.""They are making decisions about whether and how to respond to what they see as a massive attack on their interests from the U.S. via sanctions by attacking U.S. interests in turn, and those of U.S. partners they believe are responsible for U.S. policy,"" he said.Aramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take ""weeks, not days.""Riyadh said it would compensate for the damage at its facilities by drawing on its stocks, which stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data.Trump said that ""based on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.""The Saudi bourse closed down 1.1% on Sunday, with banking and petrochemical shares taking the biggest hit. Saudi petrochemical firms announced a significant reduction in feedstock supplies.""Abqaiq is the nerve center of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24 to 48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,"" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters.CALLS FOR RESTRAINTAccording to the U.S. official, 17 structures at Abqaiq sustained damage on their west-northwest facing sides, along with two points of impact at Saudi's Khurais oil field.Consultancy Rapidan Energy Group said images of the Abqaiq facility after the attack showed that about five of its stabilization towers appeared to have been destroyed, and would take months to rebuild - something that could curtail output for a prolonged period.""However Saudi Aramco keeps some redundancy in the system to maintain production during maintenance,"" Rapidan added, meaning operations could return to pre-attack levels sooner.Some Iraqi media outlets said the attack came from there.

"Oregon man was falsely accused by Target employee of having child porn. Soon after, he died.",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-man-was-falsely-accused-target-employee-having-child-porn-n1051066,"The estate of an Oregon man who was wrongly accused by a Target employee of possessing child pornography is suing the retail giant for $1 million, claiming negligence, false arrest and intentional infliction of emotional distress, according to a complaint.

Jeffrey Buckmeyer was accused by an employee at a Target store in Tigard, Oregon, in July 2018 of having child-abuse or child-pornography materials on his mobile phone, the complaint filed in Oregon Circuit Court on Aug. 29 says.

The accusation sparked an FBI investigation. Several months later, Buckmeyer died of a heart attack, the complaint says.

Buckmeyer had asked an electronics department employee for help freeing up storage space on his iPhone, which is when the unidentified employee then claimed he saw the explicit images, according to the The Oregonian. The employee alerted security personnel, who took down Buckmeyer's license plate number, the Oregonian reported.

A Target employee then made a detailed report to law enforcement claiming that they had seen the images on Buckmeyer's phone. The two employees involved are listed in the complaint as ""John Doe #1"" and ""John Doe #2.""

“We’re aware of the claims and are looking into them with our legal team,” Target said in a statement emailed to NBC News.

A month later, in August 2018, Buckmeyer was detained and questioned by law enforcement officers and the FBI seized several electronic devices from his home.

While he was investigated, Buckmeyer's neighbors were made aware of the allegations against him and his ability to spend time with his daughter was reduced, according to the complaint.

But a review by the FBI and an independent forensics expert determined that Buckmeyer never had any child pornography on any of his electronic devices, which were later returned to him.

""Target’s false report wasted FBI time and resources that could have been used to pursue real criminals. We hope this lawsuit will create a change in Target's corporate policies so this doesn't happen again to another innocent victim,"" Michael Fuller, lead trial attorney for the Buckmeyer estate, told NBC News via email.

Buckmeyer died in April, but his estate is asking for a jury trial in the case.",JustBadNews,0
"'I'd rather F1 be boring and bring Hubert back' - Vettel calls for safety improvements. After Formula 1 was labelled as 'boring' in June, Sebastian Vettel says he would rather that and bring back Anthoine Hubert.",https://bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/49599387,"Follow the Italian Grand Prix at Monza on the BBC Sport website & app from 09:30 BST on Friday

Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel says he would rather Formula 1 be boring if it could bring back Anthoine Hubert, the French driver killed in a Formula 2 crash in Belgium last weekend.

Hubert, 22, died after suffering a 170mph impact from the car of American Juan Manuel Correa at Spa on Saturday.

Four-time world champion Vettel, part of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, says safety must be improved.

""I still think there's things we can do better and improve,"" he said.

Last weekend's fatal crash is being investigated by the FIA, while the car belonging to Giuliano Alesi, the driver who Hubert avoided before crashing into the barriers, has since been impounded by Belgian police.

Correa has been moved to intensive care in Britain after suffering a spinal injury and broken legs during the F1 support race.

The discussion over safety in motorsport comes just five races after F1 was labelled as ""boring"" after an uneventful French Grand Prix in June.

""Some people think Formula 1 is too safe and too boring,"" Vettel added at a news conference before this weekend's Italian Grand Prix.

""But I would rather have boring Formula 1 championships forever and bring Anthoine back.

""To some extent it [danger] is part of motor racing - it's part of the thrill - but obviously the last few years have been a wake-up with the passing of Jules [Bianchi] and now Anthoine.

""What happened couldn't be any worse. I think it will be examined in a very detailed way which is correct and what everyone would expect but to draw any conclusions now is probably not right, we need to have a full picture of a lot of elements.

""I'm a fan of holding races in Spa because it's a great track which has a great history and a lot of the corners are unique, but for sure after what happened we need to have a very close look and take some time to understand exactly what happened.""

Hubert was a Renault junior driver, and raced with F1 drivers Charles Leclerc and Pierre Gasly in their youth

Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were the last drivers to die during an F1 race weekend at Imola in 1994. There was not another driver fatality in F1 until 2015 when Jules Bianchi died nine months after suffering severe head injuries in a crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc dedicated his win in Spa to his former friend and rival Hubert, and said that while he was aware of the risks involved in racing, ""it's always a shock when something like this happens"".

Leclerc added: ""Anytime you go at that speed it will always be dangerous. On the other hand, every time I'm going into the car I am going in with the same mindset, and I think we are all trying to do that even with what happened on Saturday.

""When you are getting in your car you are trying to be in the zone, trying to think about what you need to do and you need to race as hard as you can to finish as high as you can.""

The use of asphalt run-off areas has also been questioned in the days following Hubert's crash, with some arguing that gravel traps would limit the risks drivers are prepared to take and also possibly prevent a car from bouncing back on track after a crash.

""Some of it is true, the Tarmac run-off areas do invite us to keep pushing because it doesn't have an immediate consequence,"" said Renault's Nico Hulkenberg.

""There always needs to be the right balance somewhere, and maybe we should have some customised solutions for corners like Eau Rouge in the way that we don't really see that corner until you come up the hill.""",JustBadNews,0
"President Trump keeps falsely saying the US has the 'world's cleanest and safest air.' Actually, he's making pollution worse.",http://businessinsider.de/does-the-us-have-the-cleanest-air-in-the-world-2018-10?utm_source=reddit.com&r=US&IR=T,"President Trump is, once again, falsely claiming that America has the cleanest air in the world: On Wednesday he tweeted that the US has the ""purest air on the planet.""

US air is not the cleanest in the world. In fact, it's gotten dirtier on Trump's watch.

Plus, air doesn't belong to any one country, making it tough to determine whose is cleanest. If there were a prize for cleanest air, it would probably go to Australia or New Zealand.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Trump has once again falsely claimed that the US has the cleanest air in the world.

""Who's got the world's cleanest and safest air and water? AMERICA!"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday, as CNN kicked off a 7-hour-long session of ""climate crisis"" town halls with 10 Democratic presidential candidates.

""I want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet – we've now got that!"" Trump added.

This isn't the first time that Trump has falsely touted America's air as number one — he tweeted a similar statement in October 2018, along with a map from a World Health Organization report. The statement was not true then, and it definitely isn't now.

Air in Australia and New Zealand is far cleaner than in the US

The Environmental Performance Index, a metric from environmental scientists at Yale and Columbia that ranks 180 countries around the world, puts the US in 10th place when it comes to overall air quality (Australia is first).

In terms of PM 2.5 pollution — a measure of ultra-fine particulate matter in the air — the country with the world's cleanest air is New Zealand, while the US ranks seventh on that list. Meanwhile, the cleanest cities in the world (in terms of particulate concentrations) are in Sweden.

Air-pollution expert Gabriele Pfister, deputy director at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Lab, told Business Insider that a single country could never have the ""cleanest"" air on Earth, because we all live under the same sky.

Using the WHO map to brag about the US' air quality, as Trump did in October, is misleading, Pfister added.

That's because the map only reflected estimates of how much ultra-fine PM 2.5 pollution people are breathing around the world, and that's just one component of dirty air.

""America doesn't have the cleanest air in the world just because it's white on this map,"" Pfister said.

As a category, PM 2.5 includes dust and other tiny particles floating around that are smaller than 2.5 microns wide (sometimes referred to as ""PM 2.5"" pollution). Common sources of these pollutants include emissions from cars and other vehicles, as well as heating oil, coal, secondhand smoke, chemicals from power plants, smoke from cooking, and even natural sources like forest fires.

Pfister said it's no surprise that the US have fewer of these small pollutants than some developing countries, where more people cook over open flames.

PM 2.5 particles are 30 times skinnier than a strand of human hair. Because they're so small, they can easily travel into the lungs — a serious problem for people who already have breathing and heart issues.

When the air is hazy, breathing it in can have dangerous, long-term effects on the brain. Heavy exposure over time can also lead to reduced lung function and even death.

US air is cleaner than it used to be, but there is still work to do

According to the EPA, aggregate emissions of six of the most common air pollutants in the US have dropped 73% since 1970, when the agency got serious about cleaning up the air.

But the work isn't done. In 2014, the EPA estimated that between 50,000 and 120,000 people in the US die prematurely every year because of bad air. The agency also notes on its website that ""despite great progress in air quality improvement, approximately 111 million people nationwide lived in counties with pollution levels above the primary U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards in 2017.""

This 2018 EPA map shows the counties that still don't meet the Clean Air Act standards:

US EPA

""PM 2.5 is one component of air pollution,"" Pfister said. ""If you look at ozone pollution, you will actually see that the US has quite a bit more ozone pollution than many regions in the developing world ... that has to do with the ozone chemistry.""

She worries about the air she breathes in Colorado, she said, as more oil and gas operations open up near schools, hospitals, and people's homes.

""Specifically in the western US, we have leveled off. We are not clean,"" she said.

Trump is making it more difficult for Americans to breathe

Despite Trump's claims about the US' air quality, air in the country is actually getting dirtier and more dangerous to breathe under his administration. An Associated Press report in June analyzed federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data and found that ""there were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before"" than there were during the period from 2013 to 2016.

""There were noticeably more polluted air days each year in the president's first two years in office than any of the four years before,"" the AP said.

The American Lung Association's ""State of the Air"" report for 2019 found, similarly, that more than four in 10 Americans live in counties that got at least one ""F"" for unhealthy air.

""That's 7 million more than last year's report,"" the report said.

Air pollution is deadly — it kills tens of thousands of people in the US every year. Yet Trump has rolled back at least 10 air-pollution and emissions rules while he's been president, according to the New York Times.

Popeyes customer pulls a gun after being told there were no more chicken sandwiches,http://cnn.com/2019/09/03/us/popeyes-chicken-houston-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) People are going crazy for Popeyes' sold-out chicken sandwiches, but this is taking it three steps too far.

Houston police say a group of customers walked into a Popeyes Chicken restaurant Monday night and asked for some sandwiches. But the restaurant chain is all sold out -- news the foursome didn't want to hear.

The group -- two men and two women -- grew angry, and that's when one man pulled out a gun, police said.

The employees ran to the back of the restaurant and the group, who police estimated range in age from 17 to 20 years old, ran out of the restaurant. They jumped into an older model SUV with a woman in the driver seat.

But they weren't finished -- the group pulled through the drive-through lane and threw an empty can through its window.

The Post and Courier reports Hope for Wholeness founder McKrae Game came out of the closet this summer, nearly two years after he was fired from the faith-based conversion therapy program. He's now trying to come to terms with the harm he inflicted when he was advocating for religious efforts to change a person's sexuality.

“Conversion therapy is not just a lie, but it’s very harmful,” Game told The Post and Courier. “Because it’s false advertising.”

The 51-year-old also is trying to find his place in a community he's assailed for at least 20 years. Game is one of several former movement leaders who have left the pulpits of heterosexuality, come out as LGBTQ and condemned conversion therapy as a dangerous and misleading practice.

Currently, 18 states and Washington, D.C., ban the practice of conversion therapy for minors, according to Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. South Carolina, however, is not one of these states.

"Disapproval of Bolsonaro presidency jumps amid Amazon crisis - poll.

The Datafolha polling institute found that 29% say that Bolsonaro is doing a “great or good” job, down from 33% in July, according to the poll published on Monday.

Brazilians who said the Bolsonaro was doing a normal job fell to 30% from 31% previously, within the margin of error.

The poll diverges from the usually equal three-way split between those approving, disapproving and rating normally the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, with his negative numbers gaining an upper hand, said Leonardo Barreto, a partner in Brasilia-based consultancy Capital Politico.

“Very likely, it’s the people who were giving the president the benefit of the doubt but are losing patience for some reason,” Barreto said.

The three factors likely changing Brazilians’ minds are the lack of a major economic recovery, Bolsonaro letting up on his aggressive rhetoric on combating corruption and concerns that his government has lost control over the Amazon, he said.

Datafolha found that 51% of Brazilians thought Bolsonaro had done a bad or terrible job responding to the Amazon fires.

Last month, Brazil’s space research agency, INPE, revealed that the highest number of forest fires were tearing through the Amazon rainforest since 2010, sparking international outcry demanding that the country do more to protect the world’s largest tropical rainforest.

Bolsonaro authorized the military to fight the fires after several days of public protests and criticism from world leaders.

For the first time, farmers who voted en masse for Bolsonaro in the election might be reconsidering their support because of the failure to stop criminals setting fires in the Amazon and fears that it could hurt global demand for Brazilian agricultural products, Barreto said.

“This affects the heart of the Bolsonaro electoral base,” he said.

The far-right firebrand engaged in a public war of words with French President Emmanuel Macron, who called for more to be done to combat them as Group of Seven wealthy nations met in France.

Bolsonaro ultimately said that he would only accept an offer of $20 million in aid if Macron withdrew “insults” against him.

Datafolha found that 66% of Brazilians said that Brazil should accept international aide to combat Amazon deforestation.

"Owner of Timberland, Vans, shoes says will no longer buy Brazilian leather. The parent company of Timberland, Vans and Kipling shoes said on Thursday that it will no longer buy Brazilian leather, saying it had failed to meet its ""responsible sourcing requirements.""",https://reuters.com/article/us-brazil-environment/owner-of-timberland-vans-shoes-says-will-no-longer-buy-brazilian-leather-idUSKCN1VJ1I2,"BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest have receded slightly since President Jair Bolsonaro sent in the military to help battle the blazes, but international fallout accelerated as a major shoemaker said it would not buy supplies from Brazil.

Brazil has registered 2,696 fires in the Amazon in the five days since Saturday, when the military began on-the-ground firefighting efforts, according to data from Brazil’s space research agency INPE. That is down 31% from the previous five days when 3,917 fires were registered before the military response.

The thousands of fires tearing through the Amazon have spawned an international crisis for Brazil, with public protests and world leaders voicing concern that Bolsonaro’s government is doing too little to protect the world’s largest tropical rainforest. After several days of criticism, Bolsonaro decided to send in the military to support firefighting efforts.

This year’s surge in fires, which INPE says is the worst since 2010, also raises fears of companies stepping back from Brazil amid adverse publicity surrounding the burning forest and the prospect of international sanctions.

On Thursday, the owner of shoe and apparel brands including Timberland, Vans and the North Face took the most concrete corporate move yet in response to the fires. VF Corp VFC.N will no longer buy Brazilian leather, it said in a statement.

VF said it would resume buying Brazilian leather when “we have the confidence and assurance that the materials used in our products do not contribute to environmental harm in the country.”

The Greensboro, North Carolina-based company, whose other brands include Dickies, Smartwool and JanSport, said it is no longer able to assure that leather from Brazilian suppliers meets this commitment.

The company did not respond to questions regarding the value of its Brazilian leather imports or possible markets it might use for alternative supply.

According to the Center for the Brazilian Tanning Industry, the main leather trade group in Brazil, the country exported $1.44 billion of bovine leather in 2018. Its largest export markets were the United States, China and Italy, which together consumed about 60% of Brazilian leather exports in 2018.

Elsewhere, Norway has urged several of its companies to ensure they do not contribute to Amazon deforestation, including oil firm Equinor ASA EQNR.OL, fertilizer-maker Yara International ASA YAR.OL and aluminum producer Norsk Hydro ASA NHY.OL.

The fires have also led to heightened scrutiny of Brazilian agriculture, one of the country’s main economic engines.

Responding to concerns, soy crusher industry group Abiove released data it said shows that production of the oilseeds is not contributing to the fires.

The 10 towns in the Amazon reporting the most fires have only 30,000 hectares of soy planted, a negligible amount in Brazil’s overall soy trade, Abiove said. Brazil’s total planted soy area is 36 million hectares.

Still, more than half of the plantings were in the municipality of Novo Progresso in the Amazonian state of Pará. That town was the epicenter of the so-called Fire Day earlier this month which allegedly called on people to set fires to clear land for agriculture and cattle grazing - a claim prosecutors are still investigating.

Environmentalists claim that fires were set by real estate speculators and ranchers, as it is common practice to clear land for agricultural use.

Bolsonaro has insisted fires are under control and issued a decree on Thursday banning fires from being set across the country for 60 days.

On Thursday, he thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for his support in the Group of Seven’s discussion of the Amazon region at last weekend’s summit in France of the world’s wealthiest nations.",JustBadNews,0
'This Is a Coup': Warnings of Ploy to Ram Through No-Deal Brexit as Boris Johnson Moves to Suspend UK Parliament,http://commondreams.org/news/2019/08/28/coup-warnings-ploy-ram-through-no-deal-brexit-boris-johnson-moves-suspend-uk,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday announced plans to suspend the U.K. Parliament, a move lawmakers and commentators condemned as a flagrant abuse of power aimed at forcing an exit from the European Union—with or without a deal.

""This is a coup d'etat, and it must be fought,"" tweeted Guardian columnist Owen Jones.

The New York Times described Johnson's decision, which was approved by the queen, as ""a surprise maneuver that would make it harder for lawmakers to prevent Britain from exiting the European Union without an agreement with the bloc,"" also known as No-Deal Brexit.

""In a letter sent Wednesday to all members of Parliament, Mr. Johnson said he intended to resume on Oct. 14, with a speech by Queen Elizabeth II, laying out the agenda of the Conservative government,"" the Times reported.

Johnson has repeatedly stated the U.K. will leave the European Union at the end of October, even if an agreement is not reached.

Right-Wing Star Andy Ngo Exits Quillette After Damning Video Surfaces,http://thedailybeast.com/andy-ngo-who-became-a-right-wing-star-leaves-quillette-after-incriminating-video-appears?source=articles&via=rss,"The conservative op-ed website Quillette announced Monday night that controversial right-wing writer Andy Ngo is leaving his job as an editor at the site, an announcement that comes on the same day that a Portland newspaper published a story revealing that Ngo witnessed a far-right group planning violence but never reported it.

Ngo, a photographer who was until recently a sub-editor at Quillette, became a celebrity on Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets after he was attacked by left-wing demonstrators at a Portland political rally in June. Ngo then became prominent as an opponent of political violence, with most of his criticism aimed at the left.

But footage taken by an undercover liberal activist in May and described on Monday by the Portland Mercury showed Ngo witnessing activists from the far-right group Patriot Prayer planning a violent confrontation at a bar associated with left-wing activists. Ngo never reported on what he had seen the Patriot Prayer members planning, and some of the people involved in the attack at the bar now face felony riot charges.

Hours after the Portland Mercury story ran on Monday, Ngo removed his Quillette job from his Twitter profile. Shortly after that, Ngo’s name disappeared from the masthead at Quillette, a self-described “platform for free thought” that has become a hub for the right-wing Intellectual Dark Web movement.

Ngo didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Quillette editor-in-chief Claire Lehmann insisted in emails to The Daily Beast that Ngo’s exit had nothing to do with the Portland Mercury story or the undercover footage that began to circulate on Twitter last week, saying instead that Ngo left the site weeks earlier but that the move was only made public on Monday.

“Andy actually moved on from Quillette a few weeks ago because he is undertaking bigger & better projects, we just hadn't updated the website and he hadn't updated his Twitter bio until today,” Lehmann wrote.

Asked about the videos of Ngo standing next to the far-right activists as they planned an attack on their political opponents, Lehmann said she hadn’t watched the footage.

“I haven't seen the video,” Lehmann told The Daily Beast.

Pressed on the timing of the announcement, Lehmann said Ngo had taken “a break” weeks earlier from her website because of a “brain injury” he received while being attacked at the June rally. A fundraiser for Ngo after the attack raised nearly $195,000.

“We are good friends still, he was a great worker, and I fully support him in his future endeavors,” Lehmann told The Daily Beast.

The undercover video of Ngo marks another round of controversy for Quillette this month, which was hoaxed by a left-wing prankster just a few weeks ago. An op-ed writer posed as a Marxist construction worker who was critical of the Democratic Socialists of America—but the hoax was soon revealed as a scheme meant to embarrass Quillette by tricking them into publishing an article by a writer who doesn’t actually exist.",JustBadNews,0
Hong Kong protests: A point of no return,http://livemint.com/news/world/hong-kong-protests-a-point-of-no-return-1566404751134.html,"Hong Kong: Hong Kong, a city synonymous with bankers and brokers, has become a city of inventive protesters. This past weekend, they appeared to be everywhere. Prompted by a desire to re-establish the democracy movement’s reputation for non-violence after recent protests saw petrol bombs thrown at police stations and the airport shut down, people turned out in huge numbers to call for democracy.

On Saturday morning, 22,000 teachers walked down narrow pavements in the business district in such measured fashion that they appeared to be stationary. Poignantly, they were supporting the right of students to continue their campaign of civil disobedience. The march was so peaceful that a posse of policemen took cover under the awning of billionaire Li Ka-shing’s office headquarters to protect themselves from the rain bucketing down, leaving the teachers to mind themselves.

A sea of protesters

The urban legend that the Great Wall of China is so large that it can be seen from the moon now needs to be recast for future generations: the demonstrations for democracy in Hong Kong have been so enormous and so admirable that they are worthy of such a boast. On 16 June, two million people in the city of seven million joined the protests against the government’s decision to try to pass a law that would allow the extradition of Hong Kong people to face trial in China. The proposed bill appeared to equate China’s courts, infamous for kangaroo trials where the outcome is predetermined by the communist dictatorship, with Hong Kong’s.

The city’s courts are the most independent in Asia; in the past decade a former chief executive of Hong Kong, a top civil servant and two property tycoons have been jailed for corruption. The extradition bill was seen as yet another encroachment by China on Hong Kong’s freedoms, notably its separate judiciary, police force and administration that were promised till 2047 as part of the terms of its handover to China in 1997 after 156 years of British rule.

On Sunday, 1.7 million people turned out for a demonstration that began in Victoria Park, the site of the annual vigil for the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in June 1989 when students were killed by People’s Liberation Army troops. As images of Chinese military vehicles gathering just across the border from Hong Kong went viral earlier last week, Hong Kong’s protests appeared at risk of provoking an intervention by Chinese military garrisons in and near Hong Kong. Even without bloodshed, their very presence on the streets would imperil the city’s future as a financial centre.

Even an hour before the protest on Sunday, the 19 hectares of the park looked a sea of black-shirted demonstrators. Cries of “Free Hong Kong! Democracy Now!"" interspersed with updates about the organizers’ complex negotiations with the police showed how different from China the city remains. As always in the past decade, the demonstration was part political rally, part civics lesson.

No Arab Spring moment

The massive protests of the past 12 weeks originated from hunger strikes by students and protests by 100,000 often pram-pushing parents who in 2012 forced the Hong Kong government to abandon plans for communist-styled “patriotic education"" textbooks that airbrushed Tiananmen out of history and denounced democracy as bad for nations. The 2012 protests and the much larger shutdown of the city in 2014, the so-called “umbrella revolution"", have been viewed as a Chinese equivalent of the Arab Spring.

This is a mostly mistaken parallel. The protests have no chance of spreading to communist China. And, Hong Kong’s citizens may be ethnically Chinese but they are refugees (or the children and grandchildren of refugees) who fled from a dictatorship to remake their lives in Hong Kong and have grown up in a liberal city with a free press. For them, communist China is a profoundly foreign, repressive country, especially for the youth who have been at the forefront of these protests.

The territory has its own mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and is lauded for being the easiest place to do business in the world with an incorruptible civil service known for its decency. (In June, while flying to Bengaluru, I discovered I had neglected to renew my resident’s visa two months earlier. The matter was resolved in five minutes, my apologies cut short by the immigration official’s concern that I get to the departure gate.)

Hong Kong had as high a per capita income as Britain at the time of its handover in 1997. But, its economy was and is bedevilled by absurdly high property prices created by oligopolistic property moguls, poor government policies and huge inequalities of income. China practices a form of crony capitalism and state-led capitalism that is not dissimilar, so the status quo remained. The absence of free elections promised by China to take place a decade after the handover in 1997 has festered like a sore. But, it has allowed Hong Kong to continue with its capitalist way of life and separate government.

Even this could now be at risk.

Watch video: Why Hong kong is at a point of no return

With the protesters

On Sunday afternoon as Victoria Park filled up with protesters, I spoke with Albert Ho, the former head of the largest pro-democracy political party in Hong Kong. Ho’s own reputation as a politician had been hurt by a compromise agreement he reached with Beijing almost a decade ago to widen political participation in the city that still fell far short of a free election. Ho dismissed last week’s widely published photographs of China’s armoured vehicles gearing up in Shenzhen across the border as mere “psychological warfare"". “Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city and a financial centre,"" Ho, a lawyer, said, underlining China’s need to preserve confidence in a city with a free movement of capital.

Indeed, more than two-thirds of the capital raised on Hong Kong’s stock market has been for Chinese enterprises and its state banks have large outstanding US dollar liabilities that look worrying, even without a political crisis in Hong Kong. In the past 30 years, the city’s stock market has raised as much as $1 trillion for state-owned enterprises as well as tech firms such as Tencent and Xiaomi that have valuations rivalling Silicon Valley’s. “Once they use force, that would be the end of Hong Kong. It would be (rendered) of no use to China at a time when its economy is weakened by the trade war,"" Ho said.

Struggling to make himself heard while the youngsters on stage variously shouted cries for independence from China, Ho spoke of his admiration for the “innovativeness"" of the protesters who used encrypted messaging systems such as Telegram and a flash mob style of converging on protest sites such as the airport and then dispersing before the police arrived.

The success of more radical leaders such as Joshua Wong, whose political career started as a 15-year-old schoolboy after he led the protests against “patriotic education"" in 2012 has pushed politicians such as Ho to the sidelines. But the diverse pro-democracy groups are in contact once again. Ho, who is a youthful-looking 68, said: “We are divided by strategy, but we are not divided.""

Most of the younger protesters, for instance, support independence for Hong Kong. Ho’s generation knows Beijing would never even agree to discuss this. In the run-up to the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, there was a giant stopwatch-style clock in Tiananmen Square that counted down the days and hours to Hong Kong’s “reunification"" with China. Its return signified the end of a period of humiliation by foreign powers.

The Chinese hand

The gigantic demonstrations over the weekend and the restraint of the police and the protesters defused the risks of violence, but also underlined that the political impasse in Hong Kong is no closer to being resolved. The city’s deeply unpopular chief executive, Carrie Lam, has shown an inability to engage with protesters and was almost robotic in her two press conferences since the protests began. She has made virtually no concessions, angering the city further.

Even before her selection in March 2017 by a pro-Beijing, business-heavy electoral college of 1,200, Lam, a career bureaucrat, seemed out of touch. She invited derision after she confessed that she did not know where to buy toilet paper. In an interview with the Financial Times last year, she discounted the underlying problem of unaffordable high property prices in the city that prevent even doctors and accountants from buying apartments and dismissed the young protesters of 2014 as being misled by “envy"" of the rich.

“The government’s policies mostly help the property companies gain as much money as they can,"" said Stanley So, a 34-year-old advertising executive who has attended 20 marches in the past 12 weeks. So said he lives with his mother in a 300-square-foot public housing unit. His sister and brother-in-law live in a similar sized rented flat that they can never hope to buy.

Beijing’s response to the protests has been so divorced from the political and economic concerns of the young protesters in its textbook, dictatorial doublespeak that the communiques appeared to have been garbled in translation. Still, in private briefings in Beijing to Western journalists last week, foreign ministry officials sought to defuse the tension. They denied the view that Beijing will crack down if the protests continue into September in order to ensure that President Xi Jinping’s celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the communist republic in October go off smoothly.

The unprecedented decision to allow coverage of the protests in Chinese official media raises the stakes, however. Over the past few weeks, the attacks by the young protesters in Hong Kong on Chinese government offices in the city and a beating of a reporter from a Chinese communist mouthpiece at the airport last week has already had a chilling effect on tourism from China, which accounted for 80% of the staggering 65 million tourists who visited the city last year.

An uncertain future

The battle between Hong Kong’s young protesters and Beijing is already one in which everyone loses. On Friday, the city’s richest businessman, Li Ka-shing, issued full-page newspaper advertisements calling for peace. While professing his love for China, Li has for some years now reduced his holdings in Hong Kong and instead invested billions in water and power utilities in the UK and Australia. Now, many others in Hong Kong are also pragmatically planning to migrate to Singapore and Taiwan. Bank managers report a spike in requests for offshore bank accounts.

On 17 August, Beijing triumphed in a petty show of power over Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s highly regarded airline, when its chief executive Rupert Hogg resigned, which was first announced in Chinese state media even before the company had issued a regulatory filing. Beijing’s aviation regulator had threatened the airline, owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate Swire Pacific, with the loss of its landing rights in China on the dubious grounds that employees who supported the protests were a safety and security threat. Hogg is understood to have quit rather than provide a list of employees who supported the protesters.

In the mid-1990s, Li Ruihuan, an opponent of former president Jiang Zemin, aptly said of Beijing’s relationship with Hong Kong: “If you don’t understand something, you are unaware of what makes it valuable, and it will be difficult to keep it intact."" State media has been happy to brand the protesters as manipulated like puppets by the “black hands"" of the US, despite no evidence of this. US President Donald Trump, initially tweeted that the Hong Kong protesters were “rioters"", in effect toeing the Communist Party line.

On 18 August, calls by young protesters for Hong Kong’s independence were followed by repeated demands for the resignations of the leaders of what remains a highly professional local police force, despite the occasional excessive use of force by the police in the past few weeks. The demands for independence may be part of a negotiation ploy but angers China and suggests an immaturity guaranteed to put the protesters’ goals of ensuring Hong Kong’s autonomy out of reach.

On both sides of what Lam described on 13 August as an “abyss"" that the city risks being pushed into are implacable opponents unwilling to compromise.

"Burning Amazon Rainforest Likely Wasn't an Accident, Threatens All Future Climate Change Action",http://firstpost.com/tech/science/burning-amazon-rainforest-likely-wasnt-an-accident-threatens-all-future-climate-change-action-7205181.html,"Kavya Narayanan

""Just a little alert to the world: the sky randomly turned dark today in São Paulo, and meteorologists believe it’s smoke from the fires burning *thousands* of kilometers away, in Rondônia or Paraguay. Imagine how much has to be burning to create that much smoke(!). SOS""

That was a message São Paulo-based journalist Shannon Sims tweeted on 20 August. That was roughly a week after the first news about a surge in forest fires in the Amazon was broken, followed by six continuous days of unrelenting fires in the region. Scientists have declared it a ""record rate"" of the fire's spread. A warning has since been issued: the burning forest could strike a devastating blow to the global fight against climate change. Potentially, the fires could be something the world doesn't recover from.

Destroyed: 1.5 soccer fields of rainforest per minute

The Amazon region stretches over a 7,000,000 km2 area of river basin. Of this, a 5.5 million square kilometre area spanning nine countries makes up the densest rainforest on Earth. There were an estimated 390 billion trees in the area as of 2013. That number has seen a steep decline over the past few years, particularly under the directives of Brazil's current President. Data from the Brazilian Space Agency shows how Brazil has dramatically reduced deforestation in the Amazon starting at ~2007, reducing it by over 2/3 in half a dozen years and keeping it low for the following decade. That all changed and ecological destruction ensued the Brazilian President's term.

Fires are quite common in the Amazon, with a few ten thousand recorded each year. These fires have increased in frequency of late. A record 72,000 fires have blasted the rainforest since January this year, of which 9,500 are from the past week alone (15 August-21 August), the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) of Brazil has said. This is the highest rate of fires in the region since the country's space research center began tracking them in 2013, the INPE said Tuesday. More than 1½ soccer fields of Amazon rainforest are being destroyed every minute of every day, they added.

Ironically, the Amazon rainforest has been “fire-resistant” for much of its history. This, simply because of the kind of forest it is, receiving rain and staying moist through most of the year. That said, it does also go through hot spells, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said, and drought is an established fuel for wildfires. There is nothing abnormal about the climate or rainfall amounts in the Amazon this year, INPE researchers have said.

Environmental groups in Brazil have been campaigning for years to save the rainforest. More recently, they have blamed President Bolsonaro for having endangered the vital rainforest by relaxing restrictions and ""openly encouraging deforestation"". The Institute of Environmental Research in Amazonia (IPAM) said that it found no evidence to suggest that a lack of rain could have caused the fires, and that deforestation was the primary driver for the fire's reach.

""The dry season creates favourable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,” INPE researcher Alberto Setzer told Reuters. ""The fire that we’re seeing today is a fire that’s directly related to deforestation,"" said Ane Alencar, scientific director of IPAM.

Research has shown that indigenous management of forests, which has shrunk dramatically in Amazonia since Bolsonaro took office, is the best approach to maintain the health of rainforests, anywhere in the world. In Brazil, which is home to two-thirds of the rainforest, the President, Jair Bolsonaro, has likened indigenous Amazonian reserves to ""chickenpox"" on the land.

To top it off, an invasion of human activity — farming, mining, and drilling — are exacerbating what was a bad situation to begin with in Brazil. Fears surrounding deforestation continue have grown under Bolsonaro, who appears to be blatantly ignoring international concerns over deforestation and climate change.

The 'Planet's Lungs' are burning

The Amazon rainforest is often referred to as the planet's lungs for producing 20 percent of atmospheric oxygen on the Earth. At roughly two and a half times the size of India, is the largest rainforest on the planet, and home to uncountable species of fauna and flora. It's no surprise that Amazonia is among the most important and vital ecosystems int the world to slow global warming.

The majority – over two-thirds – of the rainforest falls in Brazil, where there have been a total of 72,843 fires this year. Over half of these have been in the Amazon region, according to the INPE – an 80+ percent increase compared to the same period last year. While that sounds like an inordinate number of fires for any single region, here's some perspective: Last year, this same region saw 40,136 fires burn. The second-worst year on record after 2019 was 2016, over which 68,484 fires.

Tropical rainforests everywhere in the world are critical in the fight against climate change. They are large-scale sites that store carbon dioxide, keeping the greenhouse gas in its solid carbon state as soil, branches, and leaves. The Amazon is the world’s largest such tropical rainforest, making its protection critical to the world in its attempts to preventing any further global heating.

Even out here in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean I hear about the record amount of devastating fires in the Amazon. My thoughts are with those affected. Our war against nature must end. — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 22, 2019

The Amazon is also the single-richest biodiversity hotspot – home to the most biodiverse place on Earth. It's safe to say that preserving the rainforest is a matter of slowing down plant and animal extinctions overall.

Widespread devastation & impact

As the fires mark what the world hopes is a climax to the relentless ecological destruction in Brazil over recent years, a Twitter user offers a glimpse of how bad things are at the edges of the fireline in the Amazon as of 20 August this week.

Around 2000 km Southeast of the forest is São Paulo, Brazil, where smoke from the burning forest has created chaos.

São Paulo was blanketed by a layer of thick smoke and ash, as seen in images shared by residents on Twitter. On Monday, 19 August, parts of the city were shrouded in complete darkness between 3 and 4 pm in the afternoon local time.

Does the President's have a role in it all?

Unlike most other ecosystems, wildfires raging in the Amazon are unnatural, scientists think. The recent surge in deforestation rates in the region is considered a major contributing factor behind the alarming numbers. Environmentalists have pinned the blame on the country's President Jair Bolsonaro, calling out policy after policy directed by the President that have threatened the forest more than it already is.

Bolsonaro has taken a controversial pro-business stance ever since he rolled into office on 1 January, making several promises. Among them were actions to restore Brazil's economy by finding other uses for the Amazon forest. He vowed that if elected, he would not set aside a ""single centimetre"" more land for indigenous reserves.

He has expressed disdain for conserving the rainforest, favoring industrial growth relentlessly. Emboldened loggers, farmers, miners, ranchers and other developers have flocked the Amazon brazenly in response, logging at undeveloped forest land, the bulk of which is indigenous territory. The nation's environmental enforcement agency has had its budgets slashed by $23 million, according to a CNN report.

Adding insult to injury, Bolsonaro went ahead and called the recent wave of fires in the Amazon the handiwork of local environmental NGOs.

""Crime exists, and we need to make sure that this type of crime does not increase. We took money away from the NGOs. They are now feeling the pinch from the lack of funding,"" he said. So, maybe the NGO-types are conducting these criminal acts in order to generate negative attention against me and against the Brazilian government. This is the war we are facing.""

Organizations like Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund have warned that if the Amazon reaches a point of no return, the rainforest could become a dry savannah, no longer habitable, let alone remain vital and biodiverse. The forest could become a large-scale carbon-emitter, where it was once a carbon sink, becoming a powerful driver of climate change.",JustBadNews,0
The fires in the Amazon were likely set intentionally.,http://qz.com/1692804/fires-in-the-amazon-rainforests-were-likely-intentional/,"The Amazon rainforest is burning at an unprecedented rate, and the fires are unlikely starting themselves. Rather they may be set by people in an attempt to clear land for cattle ranching.

Cattle ranching is responsible for as much as 80% of the ongoing deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. A significant portion of the global beef supply, including much of the UK’s corned beef supply, originates on land that was once Amazon rainforest and is now denuded.

“The fire that we’re seeing today is a fire that’s directly related to deforestation,” Ane Alencar, the scientific director of Brazilian NGO IPAM (Institute of Environmental Research in Amazonia), told forest news website Mongabay. These are not wildfires, she said, but rather fires set by people seeking to create cattle ranches, intentionally ignited during the dry season each year. “They cut the trees, leave the wood to dry and later put fire to it, so that the ashes can fertilize the soil.”

When the rainy season returns, grass for cattle briefly flourishes, thanks to the nutrients left by the ashes, Mongabay reports.

In satellite images of Mato Grosso, Brazil provided by satellite company Planet, taken on Aug. 20, smoke wafts above fragments of the rainforest interspersed with tan-colored squares of farmland, where the Amazon has already been deforested for agriculture.

As Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has expressed disdain for conserving the rainforest, his support for industrial growth has reportedly encouraged ranchers and other developers to move more brazenly into undeveloped forest land—much of which is indigenous territory.

Research has shown that indigenous management practices are the best approach to maintaining the health of tropical rainforests globally. Satellite imagery from the Amazon confirms that research; between the 1980s and 2018, deforestation crept all the way up to and against the exact contours of the Xingu Indigenous Park in Brazil, for example.

Over the last half century, a total area larger than the state of Texas has been lost to deforestation. As loggers, ranchers, and miners continue to encroach on the ecosystem, the loss is accelerating: Last month, it peaked at a rate of more than three football fields a minute.

Tropical rainforests are critical storage sites for carbon dioxide, keeping the greenhouse gas in its solid carbon state, locked away in soils and trees. The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rainforest, making its protection critical to preventing runaway climate change.

The Amazon is also a biodiversity hotspot, and includes the most biodiverse place on Earth, making its preservation a matter of slowing down plant and animal extinctions, too. Hundreds of thousands of indigenous people in more than 400 tribes also live in the Amazon, and rely on the rainforest to support their lives and preserve their cultures.",JustBadNews,0

Planned Parenthood said on Monday it would no longer accept grants from a federal program subsidizing reproductive healthcare for low-income women after the Trump administration banned participants in the program from referring women to abortion providers.,https://reuters.com/article/us-usa-abortion/planned-parenthood-turns-down-u-s-subsidies-in-fight-over-abortion-referrals-idUSKCN1V91QJ,"(Reuters) - Planned Parenthood said on Monday it was withdrawing from a federal program subsidizing reproductive healthcare for low-income women after the Trump administration banned participants in the program from referring women to abortion providers.

Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the United States, said its move was spurred by a federal appeals court decision last month clearing the administration’s way to restrict Title X grants under a new policy critics have branded a “gag rule.”

In addition to barring recipients from making abortion referrals, the policy requires financial and physical separation between facilities funded by Title X and those where actual abortions are performed.

The rule, imposed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is part of a broad effort by the Republican president, his allies in Congress and numerous Republican-dominated state legislatures to curtail abortion access in recent years.

Planned Parenthood, accounting for about one-fifth of all Title X funds granted, had vowed to cease accepting money from the program months ago, when HHS said it would start enforcing the new restrictions. The group said it would rely instead on private donations and emergency funds to make up the difference as best it could.

Monday’s move marked a formal Title X withdrawal, to remain permanent unless Congress acts to overturn the restriction or legal challenges prevail in court.

“Due to an unethical and dangerous gag rule, the Trump administration has forced Planned Parenthood grantees out of Title 10,” Alexis McGill, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, told journalists on a conference call.

STATES FOLLOWING SUIT

Planned Parenthood is not alone. Legislatures in Maryland and Massachusetts preemptively adopted measures to opt out of Title X and provide state funding in its place if the new rule took effect. And governors of five other states - Hawaii, Illinois, New York, Oregon and Washington - have said they would do the same. So has Maine Family Planning, a nonprofit, sole recipient of Title X funds in that state.

Congress appropriated $286 million in Title X grants in 2017 to Planned Parenthood and other health centers to provide birth control, disease screening and other reproductive health and counseling services to poor women.

That funding already was prohibited from being used to pay for abortions, but abortion opponents have long complained that the money in effect subsidized Planned Parenthood as a whole, including its abortion services.

The organization had been providing healthcare to about 40% of the 4 million people who rely on Title X funding annually, with 600 of its clinics receiving money from the program.

Critics said Planned Parenthood’s action showed it was primarily focused on abortion.

“In withdrawing from Title X, Planned Parenthood has made it crystal clear that abortion is its number one priority,” said Ashley McGuire, a senior fellow with the Catholic Association.

Abortion has remained one of the most contentious issues in U.S. politics since the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision affirming a woman’s constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy.

Opponents cite religious beliefs in decrying abortion as immoral, while the other side casts abortion restrictions as infringing on women’s private medical choices and control over their own bodies.

Federal judges in Washington state, California and Oregon, among nearly two dozen states challenging the administration’s rule in court, issued preliminary injunctions against its enforcement earlier this year.

But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on June 20 lifted those injunctions, and the same court rejected emergency bids to overturn that decision in July. That allowed the restrictions to take effect while court cases proceed.

The rule largely restored a restriction created in 1988 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991, only to be suspended by the Clinton administration in 1993.",JustBadNews,0

A man who allegedly stabbed a woman to death in Sydney’s central business district before attacking others on a busy city street with a butcher’s knife was arrested carrying information about terrorist attacks and extremist ideologies on a USB drive.

But police say the man did not have any known links to terror groups, and that he acted alone. The attacks are not being treated as a terrorist attack, the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said on Tuesday night.

The 20-year-old man from Marayong, near Blacktown in western Sydney, jumped on cars and yelled at bystanders to “shoot me in the fucking head” before being restrained by members of the public – later lauded as “heroes” by police – who used cafe chairs and a milk crate to pin him down.

Britons hailed as 'heroes' after helping restrain man accused of Sydney knife attack Read more

About an hour after the man’s arrest, the body of a 24-year-old woman was found inside an apartment in Clarence Street, in central Sydney. It is understood she had suffered multiple stab wounds.

Police say the man was arrested carrying a USB drive containing documents espousing “terrorist ideologies” and detailing mass casualty crimes, including recent attacks in North America and New Zealand, but he did not have any known links to terror groups, and acted alone.

The man has a history of mental health problems. It has been reported that he had escaped from a mental health facility in recent days, but this has not been confirmed.

“His history is unremarkable compared the gravity of his crimes,” Fuller said. He said the man was known to police in relation to his history of mental health conditions, not because of any links to terror groups.

The man’s offending first came to public light when he was seen running amok through Clarence Street. Fuller described it as six minutes of “terrifying carnage”.

A 41-year-old woman was stabbed in the back in the Hotel CBD, on the corner of Clarence and York streets.

She was taken to St Vincent’s hospital suffering a non-life threatening injury from a single stab wound to her back. There were no other injuries after the man appeared to attack passersby at random with a butcher’s knife.

The alleged offender, also suffering injuries, was taken to hospital, but was expected to be transferred to a police station overnight and charged, likely with murder and serious assault charges.

“If it becomes a terrorist incident… obviously there will be other charges in relation to that… it’s an evolving investigation,” Fuller said.

Footage of the man’s rampage showed him running across a city intersection, his clothes apparently stained with blood. At one point he climbs on the roof of a car, yelling, as a man carrying a cafe chair seeks to corral him.

Further footage shows members of the public restraining the man near Wynyard station, holding him down by using chairs across his body and a milk crate over his head. Some members of the public abuse the man and attempt to assault him, while others urge people to “wait for the cops”.

Superintendent Gavin Wood of NSW police said the bystanders who apprehended the men were “significantly brave people”.

“To approach a person with a mindset of obviously what this person [had], with clear evidence of a stabbing previously, these people are heroes.”

He said their actions had prevented others from being hurt.

“These members of the public, going about their day-to-day business, have jumped into a situation which was extremely dangerous and hostile and they have brought a person, who we will be alleging has stabbed an innocent person for no specific reason, into custody and allowed us to do our job.”

Wood said it had been reported to him that the man had yelled “Allahu Akbar”; he said this had not been captured as part of the “evidentiary base” but would form part of the investigation.

Footage posted online of the man yelling reveals an indistinct pronunciation, suggesting he was not an Arabic speaker, nor familiar with the phrase.

The driver of the car on which the man climbed said he had appeared suddenly on the street, covered in blood and brandishing a butcher’s knife.

“He was fearless, he was completely fearless. He was on something, I don’t know what he was on. It was a scary moment, I’m sure, for a lot of people in Sydney,” the driver told Channel Nine.

Paul Walker, a Channel Seven cameraman was on the scene and followed the chase through the city filming the arrest near the corner of Carrington and Wynyard streets in Wynyard.

As the man lay restrained on the ground, Walker filmed a bottle of pills next to him, labelled Antenex.

The drug is a diazepam which is used to treat anxiety and depression. Seven was reporting that the man had absconded from a mental health facility some days before.

Walker said the man with the chair, whom he identified as a bank worker, had used the chair “like a lion tamer”, trying to turn the man around as he ran through the city streets.

“They moved through the city streets, the fireys were calling out to people to run away,” Walker said.

“One guy wanted to kill him, but the fireys tried to settle him down. Once he was in a position that was compliant everyone was just trying to work out why.”",JustBadNews,0

Commissioner Mick Fuller said the men who tackled the man suspected of stabbing two women were ""the highest order of heroes"".

Armed with nothing more than chairs, a milk crate and crowbar, several men chased the man as he ran up Clarence Street and jumped on the bonnet and roof of a car.

Four of those men — Paul O'Shaughnessy, Luke O'Shaughnessy, Lee Cuthbert and Alex Roberts — said they instinctively sprung into action when they saw the commotion below the York Street recruitment office where they work.

""[He] jumped on a car wielding a knife with blood on it and we were like, 'Wow, what's going on here',"" Paul O'Shaughnessy said.

""So immediately, we just got the troops and said, 'Right, let's go and see if we can help'.""

He said they ran down through throngs of terrified bystanders fleeing the scene and ""just continued to chase the guy while other people were just going away"".

""Because obviously, he's wielding a knife. I don't know whether it's an instinct thing or what, but we was like, 'Right, we've just got to try and restrain this guy from doing any more'.""

The man was allegedly waving a large knife and then jumped back down from the car roof and into the middle of the road, shouting as his pursuers continued to close in.

They eventually knocked him down with a cafe chair, and then used a milk crate to hold his head to the footpath as first firefighters then police arrived to restrain him.

Mr Cuthbert — from Manchester, UK, along with Paul and Luke O'Shaughnessy — said they were shaken after the incident but did not hesitate to defend their ""new home"".

A 21-year-old woman's body was found at an apartment complex near the scene and another woman, aged 41, was taken to hospital after allegedly being stabbed by the armed man.

'He had blood all over him'

Paul O'Shaughnessy said Luke, whose professional profile states he is a champion Thai boxer, was the ""real hero"".

""He pursued him the hardest and managed to get a grip of him with another man,"" he said.

""We just waited for the cops to come. He had blood all over him.""

'Chair Chap' (right) was also praised on social media for intervening, but has not been formally identified. ( Twitter: @ayusha77 )

The group of friends, three of whom have come from countries terrorised by men wielding knives, said they had joked about how to handle an attack.

""We talked about it as a team, we said somebody might attack one day and imagine he was in the vicinity what would [we] do?"" Paul O'Shaughnessy said.

""For us it was just go and help straight away, don't even think.""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison commended ""the brave actions of those who were present"" and said his ""thoughts are with all those who have been impacted by this violent attack"".

"Japan-South Korea gloom spurs worries of 'never seen before' chip price spike. Memory chip spot prices have risen for the first time this year, indicating grim warnings of ""never seen before"" spikes and a supply disruption could come to pass as a dispute between South Korea and Japan drags on.",https://reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-japan-laborers-chips-analy/japan-south-korea-gloom-spurs-worries-of-never-seen-before-chip-price-spike-idUSKCN1UD0ZL,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Memory chip spot prices have risen for the first time this year, indicating grim warnings of “never seen before” spikes and a supply disruption could come to pass as a dispute between South Korea and Japan drags on.

FILE PHOTO: Memory chip parts of U.S. memory chip maker MicronTechnology are pictured at their fair booth at an industrial fair in Frankfurt, Germany, July 14, 2015. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo

The 15% spike in DRAM chip prices over a week - in a sector dogged by oversupply and weak demand for more than a year - comes after Japan tightened curbs on exports of some chipmaking materials to South Korea - home to the world's top two memory chipmakers, Samsung 005930.KS and SK Hynix Inc 000660.KS.

To be fair, the price surge indicated by industry tracker DRAMeXchange refers to the spot market that accounts for less than a tenth of the memory chip landscape as most major tech firms source through mid- and long-term contracts.

Given this background, major customers such as iPhone maker Apple AAPL.O are yet to start stockpiling, but the price spike has started fuelling fears that Japan's curbs will soon impact supply, several industry sources said.

“If the ban continues, memory prices will skyrocket like never seen before as 75% of DRAM and 45% of NAND global output is at risk,” Mark Newman from Bernstein said, referring to South Korea’s dominance in the supply of those memory chips.

A person at a South Korean chipmaker said customers were “following the situations closely” but “taking a wait-and-see approach as demand still remains weak”.

Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment.

""We will need contingency plans if the impact materializes,"" said a spokeswoman at Vaio, a Sony Corp 6758.T spinoff.

“Options include seeking alternative chip suppliers outside South Korea,” she said, adding business at the Japanese computer maker had, however, not yet been hit.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW, the world's top contract chipmaker, warned that Japan's export curb is the ""biggest uncertainty"" for the fourth quarter.

CONTINGENCY PLANS

Japan has tightened curbs on exports of three chipmaking materials - fluorinated polyimides, used in smartphone displays; photoresists, used to transfer circuit patterns on to semiconductor wafers; and hydrogen fluoride, used as an etching gas when making chips.

South Korea sourced 94% of fluorinated polyimides, 92% of photoresists and about 44% of hydrogen fluoride from Japan in the first five months of this year, Korean industry data showed.

Seoul has said it is seeking to make its supply chain more independent and has been getting fresh offers from Russia and China to provide hydrogen fluoride.

A local media reported that South Korea was considering lowering import tariffs on these products from other countries to fill in any potential supply gaps.

“We ... do see some (chip) module manufacturers raising their quotes or announcing halts to production in light of the material restrictions ...,” research firm TrendForce said.

In NAND flash market, supply has also been hurt by an output halt at Japan’s Toshiba Memory last month due to a power outage.

A person at Toshiba Memory said the plant resumed operations in mid-July but it will take time for shipments to recover fully and that the company still has to catch up with existing orders.

Brokerage UBS said this week it expects NAND contract chip prices to fall 5% in the third quarter, less than a previous forecast for a 10% quarter-on-quarter drop, citing Toshiba’s output cut and Japan’s export curbs. But it kept its projection for a 17% drop in DRAM contract prices unchanged.

NAND chips are found in mobile devices as well as memory cards, USB flash drives and solid-state drives, while DRAM is used to support electronic devices performing multi-tasks.

Clear winners from better chip prices would be Micron, Toshiba, Nanya and Western Digital, Bernstein’s Newman said.

“Samsung and SK Hynix, although potentially hurt from production issues, would also benefit from significantly higher prices and ironically likely still be net winners,” he added.

Shares of Micron have risen 12% since Japan announced the export curbs on July 1, while Western Digital Corp WDC.O and SK Hynix have gained 8% and 7% respectively. Taiwan's Nanya Technologies 2408.TW has increased 5%.

Samsung shares, however, have dipped 2% over the period, hurt by its forecast for a 56% plunge in second-quarter profit due to tumbling memory chip prices.",JustBadNews,0
China's Deadly Air Pollution Is Also Costing Billions in Solar Efficiency,http://ecowatch.com/china-solar-air-pollution-2639163912.html,"China is leading the way on renewable energy, having installed half the world's solar panels in 2017. But its transformative economic growth fueled by coal and other fossil fuels and its outsized manufacturing sector have coughed up so much air pollution that it has blocked adequate sunlight from reaching its solar panels, according to a new study published this week in Nature Energy.

The researchers behind the study analyzed incoming sunlight at 119 different points around China from 1960 to 2015. They found that sunlight dimmed over the 55-year span and that average solar generation declined 11 to 15 percent during that time. If China could clean up its air enough to revert back to the air quality it had in 1960, it could yield a 12 to 13 percent increase in electricity production and save billions each year. The study projects that cleaner air would save $5 to $7 billion in 2030, according to CNET.

In economic terms, that 11 to 15 percent decline in solar output cost China the equivalent of $1.9 billion in 2016, which is enough to have powered 1.3 million homes in the U.S. for one year, as Interesting Engineering reported.

""There is a direct energy-related benefit of cleaner air,"" Bart Sweerts, the energy researcher at ETH Zürich who led the study, told Earther. ""As such, this study provides a supporting argument for the primary driver behind air pollution control measures: reducing the detrimental effects on health.""

As if the gnarly images of dimmed skies, smog so thick it's impossible to see the skyline, and people walking around in face masks were not enough, the statistics behind the health effects of air pollution are enough to justify strict emissions regulations and a push towards renewable energy. Nearly 38 percent of Chinese citizens, or 532 million people, are breathing appallingly polluted air daily, which accounts for nearly 750,000 premature deaths each year, as Interesting Engineering reported.",JustBadNews,0

"A Lowell police officer repeatedly raped a 16-year-old homeless girl while on duty, prosecutors allege",http://boston.com/news/crime/2019/06/27/lowell-police-officer-allegedly-raped-homeless-teen,"A Lowell police officer was charged Thursday on allegations he repeatedly raped a 16-year-old homeless girl while he was working in a community outreach program three years ago, prosecutors said.

Kevin Garneau, 49, of Pelham, New Hampshire, was arraigned on two counts of rape in Middlesex Superior Court following a department investigation that began earlier this year, Middlesex County District Attorney Marian Ryan’s office said in a statement.

He was released on personal recognizance and ordered to wear a GPS monitoring device and to stay away from the victim, according to officials.

“I’m astonished and deeply disappointed. I acted as soon as we were made aware of these allegations,” police Superintendent Raymond Kelly Richardson said in a statement. “This is not what the men and women of the Lowell PD represent. They police legally, respectfully, and compassionately.”

Prosecutors said in 2016, Garneau allegedly assaulted the girl while she was living in a tent in a part of the city that was set aside to provide shelter to the local homeless population. Garneau, at the time, was a member of a community group that provided help to the homeless, including people struggling with substance abuse, according to the DA’s statement.

“The defendant is alleged to have entered the victim’s tent and told her there were warrants out for her arrest, but in exchange for her providing sexual services he would not arrest her,” the statement says. “The defendant is alleged to have sexually assaulted the victim several more times in the months after the initial assault.”

Lowell police first became aware of the allegations against Garneau in January and “immediately launched an investigation,” officials said.

A 19-year department veteran, Garneau was assigned administrative duties while investigators carried out their review, according to a statement from Lowell police.

Authorities contacted the district attorney’s office last month at the end of the internal probe. Garneau is currently on unpaid administrative leave as the case continues, police officials said.

The department did not comment any further Thursday, citing the pending case.

"Trump has lied more than 10,000 times since he became the president",http://theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/29/trump-false-misleading-claims-fact-check,"President’s 10,000th false claim came on Friday when he discussed the Charlottesville protests, the Washington Post reports

Donald Trump has made more than 10,000 false or misleading claims since he became president in January 2017, according to a count by factcheckers at the Washington Post.

Trump’s strike rate of “alternative facts” – a phrase made infamous by senior adviser Kellyanne Conway – has increased rapidly in recent months, the paper said on Monday.

Lies, damned lies and Donald Trump: the pick of the president's untruths Read more

Whereas it took Trump 601 days to make 5,000 false and misleading claims, equivalent to eight a day, it was only another 226 days before he smashed the 10,000 barrier, an average of nearly 23 claims a day, the Post reported.

The distinct worsening of the problem coincided with the publication of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian election interference, a partial government shutdown over border wall funding and a series of freewheeling campaign rallies during the midterm elections.

Trump’s frequent tweets and interviews with Fox News are also rich wells of misinformation. About one-fifth of his false or misleading claims are about immigration, the Post said.

His most repeated assertion is that the border wall is already being built. It is not.

Starting with his inaugural address, Trump averaged less than five false claims a day in his first 100 days in office, Post factchecker Glenn Kessler and colleagues wrote, “but the tsunami of untruths just keeps looming larger and larger. As of 27 April, including the president’s rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin [on Saturday night], the tally in our database stands at 10,111 claims in 828 days.”

According to the Post’s own count, Trump’s 10,000th false or misleading claim came on Friday when, speaking to reporters outside the White House, Trump returned to the controversial subject of far-right protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.

At the rally in Green Bay, held in apparent opposition to the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in Washington, Trump offered a particularly shocking example of his art. Trying to score political points against Democratic Wisconsin governor Tony Evers, he made the false claim that mothers and doctors have the option to “execute” babies.

Earlier this year Trump disparaged factcheckers, telling supporters at a rally in El Paso, Texas: “Some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called ‘factcheckers’.”",JustBadNews,0
"We're not a dumpster! Indonesia sends plastic, shoes & DIAPERS disguised as paper waste back to US",http://rt.com/news/461978-indonesia-sends-back-trash/,"Indonesia says it won’t become yet another world “dumping ground” after it returned five containers of waste back to the US, joining the growing number of Asian nations to recently turn away Western ‘recyclables.’

The waste arrived in Indonesia from Seattle back in March. The cargo, shipped by a Canadian company, was supposed to contain paper recycling material, but the Environment and Forestry Ministry discovered multiple “impurities” inside five containers and ordered them to be “re-exported.”

The containers were filled with “significant amounts” of various plastic waste and shoes, in addition to other rubbish such as wood scraps, fabrics and even diapers. “Although the containers were originally from Canada, the country of departure was the US,” said Waste and Hazardous Waste Management Directorate General Secretary Sayid Muhadhar.

This is not appropriate and we don't want to be a dumping ground.

Indonesia, which has a very limited capacity to recycle even its own plastic, has a decree banning the importation of consumer plastic waste. Production waste in the form of clean paper and plastic scraps can still enter the country, if the Trade Ministry grants an import license.

Any trash that enters the country illegally will immediately be sent back, Indonesian Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar warned earlier this month, stressing that the government will investigate any reported malpractices and violations. Just on Friday, the Batam customs received 65 containers from North America and Europe that authorities believe might contain toxic waste, the Jakarta Post reported, noting that containers have been sealed while a lab examines the samples. The country previously returned dozens of containers filled with illegal plastic in 2015 and 2016.

Indonesia broke its decade-old record and imported a total of 283,000 tons of plastic last year, the National Statistics Agency showed. The huge 141 percent increase followed China’s January 2018 decision to stop accepting plastic waste from the rest of the world due to environmental concerns. In the past, China processed over half of the world’s trash.

Beijing’s ban forced Western corporations, which lack their own waste recycling capacities, to seek new ‘markets’ in Asia. The situation worsened even further when India followed China’s example and banned the importation of solid plastic waste.

As a result, tons of trash from the US, Europe and Australia ended up going to Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, forcing these countries to seek countermeasures to protect their environment. Vietnam placed a moratorium on granting new import licenses, while Thailand issued a ban on imports. In the meantime, Malaysia and the Philippines have both recently sent back mountains of trash to their original destinations.

Fake science led a mom to feed bleach to her autistic sons and police did nothing to stop her,http://nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fake-science-led-mom-fee-bleach-her-autistic-sons-police-n1017256,"Laurel Austin documented her son Jeremy’s first dosing of chlorine dioxide on YouTube. In the 30-second video, broadcast to 4,465 subscribers, Jeremy, 27, sits at a kitchen table as his mother narrates his mood. Then his arms seem to involuntarily twist around one another and he screams into his forearm before taking a bite of a banana.

“Here’s to hoping and praying,” she says.

Austin, 51, is a photographer in Lenexa, Kansas, and a mother of six, four of whom are adults with autism. According to her Facebook posts, she has tried almost every fad online “cure” for autism — a developmental disorder that has no known cure — including treatments for heavy metal poisoning, hormone therapies used in chemical castration and “natural” remedies such as cilantro and algae.

For the last year, according to her social media posts and documents from a police investigation, Laurel Austin has been giving two of her adult sons, Jeremy and Joshua, chlorine dioxide. The Food and Drug Administration warns the solution amounts to industrial bleach, and doctors say it can cause irreparable harm when ingested, including damage to the digestive system and kidneys.

Joshua, 28, is talkative and likes “The Simpsons” and playing retro Nintendo games, while Jeremy, 27, doesn’t speak and can go into rages during which he bites his arms, according to their father, Bradley Austin, who provided police investigation files to NBC News. Joshua and Jeremy live with Laurel Austin, who is their court-appointed guardian, charged with making medical and other decisions for them. Jeremy was living in a group home until his mother took him out to try chlorine dioxide, according to his father.

Since January, when Bradley Austin learned that his ex-wife was using chlorine dioxide on their sons, he’s been trying to stop her. (He’s also exploring fighting for guardianship of his sons.) But the local police, the state’s division of adult protective services and a medical doctor treating Jeremy have all declined to intervene. A police spokesman said there wasn’t enough evidence that chlorine dioxide was dangerous; a caseworker with the Kansas Adult Protective Services told police that she didn’t see the situation as serious enough for the state to take action.

The Austins’ case illustrates the ways in which online health misinformation can become so pervasive that it begins to sway not only those on the fringe who are seeking alternate treatments and explanations but also authorities, including doctors and the police, who are charged with protecting the most vulnerable.

“Health misinformation has started to infiltrate more mainstream,” said Dr. Brittany Seymour, an assistant professor at Harvard University’s School of Dental Medicine, who studies health misinformation online. “Historically we relied on the authority of paywalled scientific papers and there were naturally limiting factors that kept the spread of misinformation at bay, like geography and communication barriers. With the internet and social media, those barriers have been removed.”

Those roadblocks used to keep misinformation from scaling to a dangerous level, Seymour said.

“The voices sharing and spreading misinformation are still small, but we know it really just takes a few now and it can spread far. So the number may be small, but the impact is not.”

The Kansas authorities’ lack of responsiveness has baffled Bradley Austin, who feels he’s run out of options for protecting his sons from their mother’s “treatments.”

“I just want her to stop,” he told NBC News.

It is unclear whether there has been any harm caused to the sons by the bleach. Bradley Austin told police that Joshua’s blood tests in January came back with no abnormalities. In a video posted to YouTube, Laurel Austin said Jeremy refused to be tested.

Laurel Austin declined to be interviewed but said in response to emailed questions that NBC News was “being used as a shameful tool with incorrect information by an absentee father as means to lower or even eliminate his child support obligation to his autistic special needs sons.”

Bradley Austin denied this characterization. The Austins had a court date last year to renegotiate child support, but Bradley Austin said it was unrelated to his concerns about his ex-wife’s use of chlorine dioxide.

When asked additional questions, Laurel Austin replied, “I have nothing further to add.”

Misinformation goes mainstream

The chlorine dioxide Laurel Austin gives to her sons is made by mixing a sodium chlorite solution with an acid activator — both of which are available online for about $20. The solution was first promoted almost two decades ago by a former Scientologist, Jim Humble, as the “Miracle Mineral Solution,” or MMS for short, and sold as a cure for AIDS, cancer and almost every other disease known to humanity.

Doctors say chlorine dioxide’s only effects are harmful, warning that it can damage tissues in the digestive system, disrupt the functioning of red blood cells and lead to kidney failure.

Kerri Rivera, a former Chicago real estate agent who is not a doctor, latched onto the so-called cure and began suggesting it to parents of autistic children around 2012, writing a book and appearing at seminars and on popular conspiracy theorists’ YouTube channels at a time when autism diagnoses were skyrocketing. Rivera declined to comment.

Even as the FDA issued warnings about chlorine dioxide — saying it can cause “severe nausea, vomiting and life-threatening low blood pressure from dehydration” — and the Justice Department prosecuted several sellers who marketed the chemical as a miracle cure, proponents including Rivera built a following online.

Rivera claims to have sold tens of thousands of copies of her book outlining the chlorine dioxide protocol before Amazon banned the title in April. Facebook and YouTube followed suit, deleting accounts and videos promoting chlorine dioxide with thousands of subscribers and millions of views after facing pressure from lawmakers and public health advocates to take responsibility for the spread of health misinformation on their platforms.

Such containment, experts say, is effective when dealing with anti-vaccine and false-cure misinformation, and it’s especially important during health crises, such as the current national resurgence of measles. But true believers — including some parents desperate for a cure for their autistic children — will still find a way to access false information.

""Content moderation can really help curb what informs the decisions that people make,"" said Nat Gyenes, a program lead at the social technology firm Meedan, who also studies technology and health at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. “But at the same time, people who want or are determined to look for other misinformation will find it on the internet.”

Laurel Austin is so determined. In her spare time, she dabbles in conspiracy theories, co-hosting or appearing in anti-vaccination radio programs and videos — several with Rivera herself. According to her social media posts, Austin is also a “flat-earther” and attends annual conferences with other enthusiasts of the unscientific idea that the world is not a globe.

The anatomy of an investigation

Joshua was visiting his dad overnight in January when his stepmother, retired registered nurse Kerrie Austin, opened the bottle his mother had sent along with directions for him to take a shot glass full of the solution every two hours, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.

The smell of chlorine “almost knocked me off my feet,” Kerrie Austin said.

Bradley Austin called poison control, then took the solution to the Lenexa police department and Joshua to the hospital for blood tests, which came back normal. In the police investigation notes that Bradley Austin shared with NBC News and that were confirmed by a police spokesman, the Lenexa police officer wrote that he “could smell the overwhelming odor of bleach.” Another officer wrote that the bottle was “off-gassing.” “The gassing smelled like chlorine and was very potent.”

As part of their investigation, a police officer called Kansas’ poison control center and spoke to a pharmacist, who said that he was familiar with the chlorine dioxide solution and advised the officer that it was unsafe to consume, according to investigation notes.

That awareness likely came from experience. Over the last five years, poison control centers have managed 16,521 cases nationwide dealing with chlorine dioxide, according to data provided by the American Association of Poison Control Centers. At least 50 of the cases were considered life-threatening, and eight people died. It’s not clear how many of the cases involved people with autism.

According to the investigation notes, after speaking to Bradley Austin, the officers went to Laurel Austin’s home. She told the officers that she was following Rivera’s chlorine dioxide protocol and said she’d seen improvement in her sons’ behavior since she began giving them the solution. The police observed both Joshua and Jeremy and determined they seemed to be happy and in good health and neither appeared to be in pain.

Laurel Austin showed the police online articles about chlorine dioxide, including one from the Autism Research Institute, one of the first and most vocal organizations to push the discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. That 2015 article claimed the solution had the potential to heal, but ultimately advised against its use, according to investigation notes. “This legitimizes the claim by Laurel of her use of MMS CLO2 as a holistic treatment approach,” the officer wrote. Laurel Austin followed up with the officer by sending a link to a YouTube video of Rivera explaining the chlorine dioxide protocol.

According to the notes, the officers were also convinced by a document labeled “Jeremy Austin’s Daily List of Supplements.” One line of the document read: “MMS Chlorine Dioxide (CD/MMS) drops 16 doses a day every hour.” The list was stamped and signed by Dr. Sarita Singh, a primary care physician at Kansas University’s MedWest Family Medicine Clinic.

Officers spoke to Singh, who confirmed she had approved the list of supplements, including the chlorine dioxide. After a follow-up visit with Laurel Austin and Joshua, Singh sent a letter to police stating the chlorine dioxide was “benign and not toxic,” according to the investigation notes.

Singh is currently on maternity leave and did not respond to requests for comment. Jill Chadwick, director of media relations for the University of Kansas Health System, which oversees Singh’s practice, cited privacy laws in an email declining comment.

“But even if you called the mom and got her to sign a waiver enabling us to talk,” Chadwick wrote, “We have nothing to add to this story at this time.”

In a YouTube video posted in March, Laurel explained how she found medical doctors willing to sign off on the chlorine dioxide protocol. “Actually, I have found several doctors. Just by going to the Institute for Functional Medicine website and you put in your area, and they can bring up doctors that you didn't even know were there.”

The Institute for Functional Medicine is a professional association focused on alternative medicine, which it describes as “an individualized, patient-centered, science-based approach that empowers patients and practitioners to work together to address the underlying causes of disease and promote optimal wellness.” It operates as a nonprofit and brought in $16 million in revenue in 2017.

Doctors have criticized the organization’s promotion of vitamins, probiotics and parasite cleanses in treatments for various illnesses without scientific evidence that they work. The founder of the institute has bucked medical consensus with the claim that autism is caused by toxins in the environment and can be cured with changes to diet and supplemental nutrition.

“IFM does not support the use of chlorine dioxide nor do we include that biochemistry in our programs,” Institute for Functional Medicine CEO Amy Mack wrote in an email to NBC News. “We have concerns regarding potential side effects.”

There are 12 practitioners listed in the IFM database in Laurel Austin’s area, according to a search on the association’s website. Singh is not among them.

“I have so far found three doctors that will sign off on this,” Laurel Austin said in the video. “And to say that they use it, too.”

Bradley Austin’s call wasn’t the first time someone had reported Laurel Austin’s treatment of her sons to the police. Last November, a staff member at Options Services, a day program for people with developmental disabilities in Merriam, Kansas, called police to report that Laurel Austin had given Jeremy chlorine dioxide in the parking lot after staff members refused to do so. Laurel Austin described that incident to police as part of the January investigation.

Laurel Austin responded by leaving a negative review in April on the organization’s Google page. In the review, she wrote that she was “blindsided” by the center calling the police when she had a doctor’s note supporting the use of chlorine dioxide. But, she continued, “All the stress and anxiety finally ended today when 5 months later I have 2 more doctors signing off on this protocol AS SAFE.”

The owner of Options Services did not return a phone call requesting comment, but did respond to the Google review.

“I'm sorry you are unhappy that we contacted the police as directed to by Poison Control for forcing your son to drink bleach,” the owner replied in April, adding that Jeremy had been vomiting and the smell of the solution was making employees sick. “What you force your son to do on your time is most certainly your business but we will not be put in a position of contributing harm to anyone.”

Options Services’ report triggered an investigation by Kansas Adult Protective Services, according to the police records. A caseworker visited Laurel Austin’s home, looked at the chlorine dioxide bottle and the doctor’s note and made contact with Jeremy, noting that he didn’t appear to be presenting any negative side effects. “Although the MMS protocol is controversial, it did not meet the threshold to remove” Laurel Austin’s sons, the caseworker found, according to the police report.

A representative for Kansas Adult Protective Services declined to comment, citing privacy laws.

After talking with Poison Control, Adult Protective Services and the doctor, the Lenexa police closed their investigation. “There was no legal standing to feel they were in any immediate danger,” the report found.

“We concluded our case with no evidence of a crime,” Danny Chavez, Lenexa Police Department’s public information officer, said.

Chavez said police hypothetically could have brought charges if Laurel Austin had been feeding her sons something like gasoline, but when it comes to chlorine dioxide, “we don't have evidence that it is a super dangerous poison.”

“Ultimately what we have to look at is, is there the intention to commit a crime? Whether something is a good practice and whether something rises to the level of a crime are two separate things.”

Bradley and Kerrie Austin do not speak to Laurel Austin and have not seen or heard from Jeremy or Joshua since the police closed the case in January. Although they pay child support, they have no legal rights to the young men because they are not listed as guardians.",JustBadNews,0

BIGGEST protest in Hong KongEVER!!! Hong Kong protest attracts 'more than one million' people against China extradition bill,http://independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-extradition-bill-china-carrie-lam-million-a8951136.html,"More than one million people on Sunday joined a mass protest in Hong Kong against a government-sponsored extradition bill with mainland China, according to organisers.

Protesters are opposing legislation that would allow people to be extradited for trial, which critics fear would let the Chinese government snatch political opponents in the territory with impunity.

Hong Kong, which has a population of 7.4 million people, is a semi-autonomous region in China with its own devolved political and judicial powers.

The protest took place three days before Hong Kong’s government plans to bring the bill to the full legislature, bypassing the committee process, in a bid to win approval by the end of the month.

Late on Sunday night, a group of demonstrators broke through barriers at the Legislative Council building in Central, where the march had ended. The crowd briefly pushed its way into the lobby, but police in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to push the protesters outside.

The organiser’s turnout figure would make it one of the largest protests in Hong Kong’s history, surpassed only by a rally of an estimated 1.5 million people for the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.

A police spokesperson estimated 240,000 people were on the march “at its peak”.

The scale of the protest has increased pressure on Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam and her supporters in Beijing.

“She has to withdraw the bill and resign,” James To, a veteran lawmaker for the Democratic Party, told crowds gathering outside the city’s parliament and government headquarters on Sunday night.

“The whole of Hong Kong is against her.”

Businesses and human rights groups have criticised the legislation, arguing Hong Kong’s legal autonomy is being eroded and that China’s legal system would not guarantee the same rights to defendants as in Hong Kong.

US and European officials have issued formal warnings that the changes would damage Hong Kong’s rule of law.

Nevertheless, Ms Lam has pushed forward with the proposal, insisting that Hong Kong courts will have the final say over whether to grant extradition requests and suspects accused of political and religious crimes will not be extradited.

“What can we do to get Carrie Lam to listen to us, how many people have to come out to make her reconsider listening to the public?” said Miu Wong, a 24-year-old office worker who joined the protest.

“This is the end game for Hong Kong, it is a matter of life or death. That’s why I come,” said Rocky Chang, a 59-year-old professor. “This is an evil law.”

Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under the “one country, two systems” framework which allows some independence to the region.

It has extradition treaties with 20 countries, such as the UK and US, but no agreement has been reached with mainland China despite decades of negotiations.

The lack of an extradition deal is attributed to concerns over China’s poor record on legal independence and human rights.

Ms Lam’s government has argued that the revisions are necessary to close a legal loophole which is thought to have allowed Hong Kong to become a haven for criminals from mainland China.",JustBadNews,0

Pennsylvania suspect shoved man onto train tracks for being white: police,http://foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-suspect-shoved-man-onto-train-tracks-for-being-white-police,"A Pennsylvania man is behind bars after shoving another man onto train tracks last week for being white, police said.

Willie Hayes – who is black – was taken into custody Thursday on charges of ethnic intimidation, attempted homicide and aggravated assault, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.

Police said the incident happened around 9 p.m. last Saturday at the Wood Street Light Rail Transit in Pittsburgh. A criminal complaint cited two witnesses who told police that the victim “was assaulted and then thrown onto the trolley tracks by an unknown black male.”

The victim – later identified as Charles Basarab – was punched three times, then shoved, and thrown onto the tracks, police said. Basarab was hospitalized with broken bones, bruises, cuts, and facial injuries and required surgery for internal bleed, the Post-Gazette reported.

"IQ rates are dropping, and there's really no explanation for it.",http://nbcnews.com/think/opinion/iq-rates-are-dropping-many-developed-countries-doesn-t-bode-ncna1008576,"People are getting dumber. That's not a judgment; it's a global fact. In a host of leading nations, IQ scores have started to decline.

Though there are legitimate questions about the relationship between IQ and intelligence, and broad recognition that success depends as much on other virtues like grit, IQ tests in use throughout the world today really do seem to capture something meaningful and durable. Decades of research have shown that individual IQ scores predict things such as educational achievement and longevity. More broadly, the average IQ score of a country is linked to economic growth and scientific innovation.

Even children born to high-IQ parents are slipping down the IQ ladder.

So if IQ scores are really dropping, that could not only mean 15 more seasons of the Kardashians, but also the potential end of progress on all these other fronts, ultimately leading to fewer scientific breakthroughs, stagnant economies and a general dimming of our collective future.

As yet, the United States hasn’t hit this IQ wall — despite what you may be tempted to surmise from the current state of the political debate. But don’t rush to celebrate American exceptionalism: If IQs are dropping in other advanced countries but not here, maybe that means we’re not really an advanced country (too much poverty, too little social support).

Or — just as troubling — if we are keeping up with the Joneses (or Johanssons and Jacques) in terms of national development, that means we are likely to experience similarly plummeting IQs in the near future. At which point, the U.S. will face the same dangers of intellectual and economic stagnation.

SIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE

If we want to prevent America from suffering this fate, we’d better figure out why IQs are dropping elsewhere. But it’s uncharted territory. Until recently, IQ scores only moved in one direction: up. And if you're thinking, ""Isn't the test set up so that 100 is always the average IQ?,"" that's only true because researchers rescale the tests to correct for improving raw scores. (Also, congrats, that’s the kind of critical thinking we don’t want to lose!)

These raw scores have been rising on a variety of standard IQ tests for over half a century. That may sound odd if you think of IQ as largely hereditary. But current IQ tests are designed to measure core cognitive skills such as short-term memory, problem-solving speed and visual processing, and rising scores show that these cognitive capabilities can actually be sharpened by environmental factors such as higher-quality schools and more demanding workplaces.

For a while, rising IQ scores seemed like clear evidence of social progress, palpable proof that humanity was getting steadily smarter — and might even be able to boost brainpower indefinitely. Scholars called it the ""Flynn effect,"" in homage to J.R. Flynn, the researcher who recognized its full sweep and import.

These days, however, Flynn himself concedes that ""the IQ gains of the 20th century have faltered."" A range of studies using a variety of well-established IQ tests and metrics have found declining scores across Scandinavia, Britain, Germany, France and Australia.

Details vary from study to study and from place to place given the available data. IQ shortfalls in Norway and Denmark appear in longstanding tests of military conscripts, whereas information about France is based on a smaller sample and a different test. But the broad pattern has become clearer: Beginning around the turn of the 21st century, many of the most economically advanced nations began experiencing some kind of decline in IQ.

One potential explanation was quasi-eugenic. As in the movie “Idiocracy,” it was suggested that average intelligence is being pulled down because lower-IQ families are having more children (""dysgenic fertility"" is the technical term). Alternatively, widening immigration might be bringing less-intelligent newcomers to societies with otherwise higher IQs.

However, a 2018 study of Norway has punctured these theories by showing that IQs are dropping not just across societies but within families. In other words, the issue is not that educated Norwegians are increasingly outnumbered by lower-IQ immigrants or the children of less-educated citizens. Even children born to high-IQ parents are slipping down the IQ ladder.

Some environmental factor — or collection of factors — is causing a drop in the IQ scores of parents and their own children, and older kids and their younger siblings. One leading explanation is that the rise of lower-skill service jobs has made work less intellectually demanding, leaving IQs to atrophy as people flex their brains less.

One leading explanation is that the rise of lower-skill service jobs has made work less intellectually demanding, leaving IQs to atrophy as people flex their brains less.

There are also other possibilities, largely untested, such as global warming making food less nutritious or information-age devices sapping our ability to focus.

Ultimately, it’d be nice to pin down the precise reason IQ scores are dropping before we’re too stupid to figure it out, especially as these scores really do seem connected to long-term productivity and economic success.

And while we might be able to compensate with skills besides intelligence, like determination or passion, in a world where IQ scores continue to fall — and where the drop expands to places like the United States — there’s also a bleaker scenario: a global intelligence crisis that undermines humanity's problem-solving capacity and leaves us ill-equipped to tackle the complex challenges posed by AI, global warming and developments we have yet to imagine.",JustBadNews,0

AIDS Agency Resigns Suddenly",http://nytimes.com/2019/05/08/world/africa/un-aids-workplace-harassment.html,"The head of the United Nations agency created to eradicate the AIDS crisis resigned “with immediate effect” on Wednesday, five months after his leadership was impugned in a damning report about workplace sexual harassment and bullying.

Michel Sidibé, the executive director of the agency, U.N.AIDS, has accepted a position as the minister of health and social affairs in his native Mali, the agency said in a statement that extolled what it described as Mr. Sidibé’s “remarkable contribution to the AIDS response” since his appointment a decade ago.

A panel of independent experts who reviewed the Geneva-based agency last year found Mr. Sidibé responsible for fostering a cult of personality and patriarchal management, saying he had “enabled a culture of harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying and abuse of power.” Their review said the atmosphere at the agency was “toxic.”

Even while acknowledging his achievements in combating AIDS, the experts said they had no confidence in his leadership. Critics of Mr. Sidibé said the review was so damaging that he had little choice but to resign. Instead, he promised changes at the agency and said he would leave at the end of June, six months ahead of his term’s expiration.",JustBadNews,0
'Makes me angry': Big telcos' $10 service fees concern wireless customers and the CRTC | CBC News,http://cbc.ca/news/business/10-fee-customer-service-calls-crtc-fido-koodo-bell-1.5130950?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar,"Canada's telecom regulator has joined angry customers in questioning the growing number of fees that wireless providers charge when people call customer service to make changes to their account.

The telcos' goal is to encourage customers to instead make their own changes online — using the free, self-serve option.

But the plan may backfire as customers who prefer the human touch, and the CRTC, raise concerns over the fees.

""It's a scam,"" said Fido customer Paul Doroshenko of Vancouver.

Starting on May 14, Fido, which is owned by Rogers, will charge $10 when customers call to request certain account transactions that can be done online. They include making a payment, updating contact information or one's payment method, and resetting a voicemail password.

""They're making so much money on me every month … and then they want to charge $10 for a simple service call?"" said Doroshenko, whose preference is to call customer service rather than make changes online.

Hey Zdravko, we'll still be here to help our customers! The fee only applies to a few transactions that can be easily completed through self-serve, find out more here: <a href=""https://t.co/CFnlfJ4JRa"">https://t.co/CFnlfJ4JRa</a>.. -Claudia —@FidoSolutions

Rogers told CBC News that the ""vast majority"" of Fido customers already use its free online services, which allow them to easily manage their accounts at their convenience.

""As more Canadians choose self-serve options to manage their day-to-day needs, we're continually investing in digital services to give customers more control,"" spokesperson Bill Killorn said in an email.

Last August, the Rogers discount brand chatr began charging a similar $5 fee, and on May 2, Bell and its discount brand Virgin Mobile began charging $10 when customers call to change their rate plan or data package before their billing cycle is up.

Similar to Fido, Telus's discount brand, Koodo, charges $10 for various account changes when done over the phone. Telus didn't say when Koodo started charging the fee.

Telus and Bell's main brands also charge fees for a few different account changes when customers call in.

Customers can also do all these transactions online themselves, for free.

CRTC steps in

The growing list of service fees has raised eyebrows at the CRTC. Last month, the telecom regulator sent a letter to providers stating that it is ""concerned that the practice may be inconsistent"" with the Wireless Code — the mandatory code of conduct for wireless companies.

The CRTC wouldn't tell CBC News precisely how the practice may violate the code, but its letter asks companies charging the fees to provide details, including how customers are informed about them.

Rogers, Bell and Telus each told CBC News that their fees comply with the Wireless Code.

John Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, suggests the CRTC is taking action on service fees because it has likely received many complaints from customers. (CBC)

Consumer advocate John Lawford suggests the CRTC is stepping in because it has likely received many customer complaints about the fees.

""I think people were complaining in big numbers and fairly loudly because it seemed to them to be contrary to fairness and what they expected from a company,"" said Lawford, executive director of the Ottawa-based Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC).

""It should be a cost of doing business.""

What about my contract?

Mary Marks of Montreal believes the new Fido fees are unfair. She signed up her husband with Fido years ago and manages her family's phone plans.

""I can do anything online; it's not a problem,"" she said. ""But I like to call in.""

The $10 charge isn't mentioned in the contract, she said.

""It's a change of contract. Do I have a choice about it? Do I not? None of this has been explained.""

The Wireless Code states that providers can't change key terms in a contract without a customer's consent, and that all one-time fees must be spelled out.

In its CRTC submission, Rogers said account transaction charges don't need to be disclosed in a contract because they're simply ""administrative fees"" that apply only at certain times to certain customers.

Rogers, Bell and Telus each say customers are made aware of fees charged for certain account transactions done over the phone. (iStock)

Rogers, Bell and Telus each said in their submissions that they inform customers about the fees in various ways, including on their website and over the phone when customers make a request that will cost them.

""Our full disclosure of all fees is always in compliance with the Wireless Code,"" Bell spokesperson Nathan Gibson said in an email.

The three big telcos also said the fee can be waived for certain individuals, such as someone with special needs, and that customers are never charged when they call to simply request information.

End of paper billing?

The CRTC is also scrutinizing another service that wireless providers increasingly want customers to solely access online: their bills.

In June, PIAC and a seniors group filed a complaint with the CRTC after Koodo stopped mailing customers paper bills.

The CRTC has yet to rule on the matter.

Meanwhile, Telus went paperless in November and Fido followed suit last month.

Telus told CBC News its customers can still request a paper bill. Rogers said Fido is investing in online services to better serve its customers, and that it is happy to work with those concerned about moving to online billing.

Customer Paul Doroshenko says he got nowhere when he complained to Fido about the end of his paper bills. The criminal lawyer runs his own law practice and said the bill's arrival by mail every month helped him keep track of one of his many business expenses.

""It makes me angry,"" Doroshenko said of the end of paper bills and the coming $10 fee.

""There's so little service being provided.""",JustBadNews,0
The support Prince Charles gave to shamed clergyman Peter Ball after his caution for gross indecency was misguided a scathing report into child sex abuse allegations at the Church of England has concluded.,http://belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/abuse-inquiry-brands-princes-support-for-shamed-bishop-peter-ball-misguided-38095336.html,"The support the Prince of Wales gave to shamed clergyman Peter Ball after his caution for gross indecency was “misguided”, a scathing report into abuse allegations at the Church of England has concluded.

The church was accused of “putting its own reputation above the needs of victims” by offering secrecy and protection for child abusers which allowed them to “hide in plain sight” for decades, despite damning allegations against them.

The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) report said Ball, a self-styled confidant to Charles, was an example of how a senior member of the Anglican church “was able to sexually abuse vulnerable teenagers and young men for decades”, backed by support from senior colleagues which was “rarely extended to his victims”.

It said Charles’s actions – in speaking about Ball with the then-Archbishop of Canterbury and a member of Lambeth Palace, and the Duchy of Cornwall buying a property to rent to Ball and his brother – were “misguided”.

“His actions, and those of his staff, could have been interpreted as expressions of support for Peter Ball and, given the Prince of Wales’ future role within the Church of England, had the potential to influence the actions of the Church,” the report added.

Charles – who maintained a correspondence with Ball for more than two decades after the caution – told the inquiry he regretted being “deceived” by Ball, the former Bishop of both Lewes and Gloucester.

The report focused on evidence against the Diocese of Chichester and against Ball, and found “a number of serious failings” following allegations of child sexual abuse dating back more than 40 years.

IICSA found claims of abuse were not handled adequately by the Church, lacked urgency or appreciation of their seriousness and allowed the Church to prioritise its own image above its responsibilities to victims.

One of Ball’s victims, Neil Todd, killed himself aged 38 after being “seriously failed” by the Church, which “discounted Ball’s conduct as trivial and insignificant” while displaying “callous indifference” to Mr Todd’s complaints.

The report also criticised former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, who showed “compassion” to Ball and displayed his “overt support” for him despite there being no justification.

Victims were “disbelieved and dismissed” by those in authority at the Diocese of Chichester, which received the most reports of child sexual abuse in any of the 42 dioceses in England and Wales during half a century.

Professor Alexis Jay, inquiry chairman, said: “For years, the Diocese of Chichester failed victims and survivors of child sexual abuse by prioritising its own reputation above their welfare.

“Not only were disclosures of abuse handled inadequately by the Church when they came to light, its response was marked by secrecy and a disregard for the seriousness of abuse allegations.

“Peter Ball is one example of how a senior member of the clergy was able to sexually abuse vulnerable teenagers and young men for decades.

“The public support he received is reflective of the Church’s culture at the time – a support that was rarely extended to his victims.”

Ball, now in his late 80s, accepted a caution for one count of gross indecency in 1992 and resigned due to ill-health.

It was not until 22 years later that he finally admitted his crimes, and was jailed in 2015 for sexually abusing 18 young men over three decades.

The report also found that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) missed an opportunity to charge Ball with a slew of offences in 1992, which he subsequently admitted in 2015.

He was released in February 2017 after serving half of his 32-month sentence behind bars.

He was deemed too ill to give evidence to the inquiry in person, but submitted a lengthy statement in which he said he had got to know Charles better after his divorce from Diana, Princess of Wales, and that their relationship “was one of support and respect”.

Charles, who will be Supreme Governor of the Church of England when he becomes king, told the inquiry he “at no stage (sought) to influence the outcome” of any police investigation into Ball.

It followed a series of letters between the prince and Ball, in which Charles said he wished he could “do more” during correspondence in 1995 following the clergyman’s upset at his own plight.

He added: “I feel so desperately strongly about the monstrous wrongs that have been done to you and the way you have been treated.”

Charles also wrote in support of finding a Duchy property for Ball and his brother to rent, adding: “I long to see you both settled somewhere that suits you and gives you peace and tranquillity.”

Ball and his brother, Michael, the then-Bishop of Truro, rented a Duchy home between 1997 and 2011.

In addressing Charles’s involvement with Ball, the report said: “The actions of the Prince of Wales – in speaking about Ball with the Archbishop of Canterbury and a member of Lambeth Palace, and the Duchy of Cornwall buying a property to rent to Ball and his brother – were misguided.”

The report found that Ball’s “charisma, charm and reputation” enabled him to avoid an initial criminal conviction, while he was said to “relish” contact with “prominent and influential people”, such as the prince.

The IICSA said the Church’s response to Ball’s arrest in 1992 was to minimise his offending and later to return him to ministry with “indecent haste”, without any kind of basic assessment of risk to children.

It criticised Lord Carey, who it was claimed “equivocated” following the allegations against Ball, “seeming frequently to do the wrong thing when there was a choice to be made”.

The report said Lord Carey showed compassion only for Ball, adding: “Almost every aspect of his decision-making regarding Peter Ball indicates poor judgment and a failure to recognise the appalling experiences of Ball’s victims.”

In its conclusions, the report said the Church failed with its response to the accusations – which were marked by “clericalism” through a lack of accountability and a belief in their own superiority, and of “tribalism”, through protecting itself and its members regardless of culpability.

It added: “The Church of England should have been a place which cared for and supported victims of child sexual abuse.

“The investigations into the Diocese of Chichester and the events surrounding Peter Ball revealed a number of serious failings in its response to allegations … (Perpetrators) were able to hide in plain sight for many years.

“There were occasions when the Church put its own reputation above the needs of victims and survivors – it did not always treat victims and survivors with the compassion or dignity they deserved.”

The report acknowledged that the Church had issued an “unconditional apology to victims and survivors”, but said many considered it to be “unconvincing”.

But it said that the most recent Clergy Discipline Measure, which is designed to deal with abuse allegations, remains “flawed” and is “inappropriate” due to it not providing an adequate route to resolving safeguarding.

The report, based on four weeks of public hearings between March and July last year, recommended the introduction of safeguarding guidance for religious communities, and suggested the Government amend the law to include members of the clergy when defining “positions of trust” for sexual abuse cases.

The next phase of the inquiry is due to take begin next month, and seek evidence of “cultural attitudes” towards safeguarding in the Anglican church.

Riot Games employees walk out to protest forced arbitration in sexual harassment claims,http://cbsnews.com/news/riot-games-walkout-league-of-legends-employees-protest-forced-arbitration-sexual-harassment-claims/,"More than 150 workers at Riot Games walked out of the video game company's Los Angeles headquarters Monday protesting the company's use of arbitration to handle sexual discrimination claims.

Riot Games allegedly forced two plaintiffs in sexual discrimination cases into arbitration last month. Five former and current employees have filed lawsuits against the company since August.

The video game developer said that it would not change policies while it's currently in active litigation, but plans to give new employees the option to opt-out of mandatory arbitration. It said it will consider extending the option to all employees.

More than 150 workers at video game developer Riot Games, known for fan favorites like League of Legends, walked out of the company's Los Angeles headquarters Monday to protest the use of arbitration to handle sexual discrimination claims.

Employees are protesting the decision last month by the company to force two plaintiffs in sexual discrimination cases into arbitration, the Los Angeles Times reported. The company had been saddled with a sexual harassment scandal since August when video game blog Kotaku published a report alleging inappropriate treatment towards employees.

Since then, five current and former employees filed lawsuits, accusing the company of gender-based discrimination and harassment, according to the Los Angeles Times.

""To every former, current, & future female Rioter, I am sorry I didn't speak up when I experienced sexism at Riot... I want you to know that my silence ended today,"" Ronnie Blackburn, Riot Games researcher and walkout organizer, tweeted in August.

To every former, current, & future female Rioter, I am sorry I didn't speak up when I experienced sexism at Riot. I had the power & the will, which some understandably lack, & I chose silence out of fear for my career. I am sorry & I want you to know that my silence ended today. — Ronnie Blackburn (@RiotKidRonnie) August 7, 2018

The protest, which workers say is the first of its kind in the video game industry, is only the latest walkout to shine a light on what critics call a culture of sexism in tech companies and in particular a male-dominated ""bro culture"" popularized by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.

In November, 20,000 employees at Google staged a walkout protesting the tech giant's sexual misconduct allegations. As a result, Google promised it would change its mandatory arbitration policy for employees. Other companies, like Facebook, Lyft, Microsoft and Uber, also committed to enact new policies.

Riot Games said in a public post Friday that it would not change its employee arbitration policies while the company is currently in active litigation, but said it would give all new Riot employees the option to opt-out of mandatory arbitration as soon as its lawsuits are resolved.

The video game developer also said that it would deliver an answer on whether it will extend that opt-out option to all past and present employees. ""We know that this resolution will not satisfy all Rioters. We understand and respect Rioters who choose to protest this decision on Monday,"" the company said in the post.

Riot Games also promised to commit to interviewing a diverse slate of candidates for new job listings.",JustBadNews,0
Arctic permafrost is melting so fast it's damaging the equipment scientists use to measure it,http://www-m.cnn.com/2019/05/06/world/permafrost-melt-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) In the Arctic, a changing climate isn't something that might happen in the near future. In the uppermost stretches of the Northern Hemisphere, it's already happening now.

Temperatures are warming; sea ice is retreating.

And a new study says permafrost is melting so fast in the Arctic that it's not only ripping up the landscape, but it's also wrecking scientific equipment and making climate change even worse for all of us.

It releases gases and changes the landscape

As permafrost -- ground that is frozen year-round -- melts, it releases carbon and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Current modeling for this is based on an expectation that permafost thaws slowly, thus carbon would be released into the atmosphere at a certain rate. But this new study published last week in the journal Nature says since some Arctic permafrost is melting much more quickly, higher amounts of greenhouse gases and carbon could be released as well. That would warm the planet up more quickly.

Scientists at this point just don't know what all the consequences of such permafrost-induced carbon release could be, though in the study researchers estimate it could produce twice as much gas than what current models are predicting.

Rapid permafrost melt isn't just releasing more greenhouse gases into air: It's changing the landscape, too, since permafrost affects about a quarter of the land in the Northern Hemisphere.

The group of scientists who conducted the study talked of research sites in Alaska, now covered with lakes, that a year ago were a forest. And they also saw rivers filled with sediment that once flowed clear. All of these abrupt changes to the land made it more difficult for them to conduct research, since the scientific equipment they depend on was sometimes literally swallowed up by the land.

It put scientific equipment under water

""We now know that ice-rich permafrost covers about 20% of the permafrost region, and in these ecosystems, the permafrost is literally the glue that holds the land together. When it thaws, the land liquefies,"" Merritt Turetsky, an ecologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario and the study's lead researcher, told CNN. ""In flat areas, before the permafrost thaws, ecosystems are dry enough to be forested. When the permafrost thaws, all the trees die, topple over, and the whole system flips to a lake. I have been monitoring permafrost temperature in interior Alaska for the past 10 years (outside Fairbanks), and we returned to our field sites only to find all our gauges and equipment totally under water. You can imagine that the electronics did not survive!""

Rick Thoman, a climatologist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, said he's seen similar changes in his state.

""Anything built on permafrost (like roads) will be affected,"" Thoman told CNN. ""You can see it on the natural landscape as well.""

Because of the possible changed working conditions brought on by the permafrost melt, scientists working in the Arctic will need to develop new strategies and get more creative as they conduct research there, Turetsky said.

A thawing Arctic will contribute a lot more carbon to the atmosphere, she added, estimating it could be like the world absorbing the emissions of two more large countries.

It's not too late to do something about it

Since scientists still don't fully know how all of this rapid melting will affect the environment, the study's researchers made a number of recommendations to help find out, including:

Improve the tracking of permafrost regions across the Arctic by using drones and lasers in surveying the land;

Increase funding for monitoring sites, especially in waterways;

Increase the number of observatories and experiments in the area so that more data can be gathered;

Improve reports, so that policymakers can get the best current estimates of the effects of permafrost melt on climate change.

Thoman, the Alaska climatologist, also noted that the most visible examples of climate change in his state could be seen in parts of western and northern Alaska. Those are vast, remote stretches of land which contain what he called ""vulnerable communities"" of people, many of them indigenous to the area and poor.

""The impacts are disproportionally borne by the people least equipped to deal with it,"" he said.

Despite the dramatic landscape changes seen already, Thoman said it's not too late to reverse the tide.

""Environmental change is entirely obvious and is well on the way. Some of that is baked into the system from the added heat of the oceans,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it's too late. It's never too late to do something. People are increasingly understanding that things aren't going back to the way they were. We have to adapt.""",JustBadNews,0
FDA To End Program That Hid Millions Of Reports On Faulty Medical Devices,http://khn.org/news/fda-to-end-program-that-hid-millions-of-reports-on-faulty-medical-devices/,"This story can be republished for free ( details ). This story also ran on Tampa Bay Times

The Food and Drug Administration announced it is shutting down its controversial “alternative summary reporting” program and ending its decades-long practice of allowing medical device makers to conceal millions of reports of harm and malfunctions from the general public.

The agency said it will open past records to the public within weeks.

A Kaiser Health News investigation in March revealed that the obscure program was vast, collecting 1.1 million reports since 2016. The program, which began about 20 years ago, was so little-known that forensic medical device experts and even a recent FDA commissioner were unaware of its existence.

Former FDA official Dr. S. Lori Brown said ending the program now is a “victory for patients and consumers.”

“The No. 1 job of the FDA — it shouldn’t be ‘buyer beware’ — is to have the information available to people so they can have information about the devices they are going to put in their body,” Brown said.

FDA principal deputy commissioner Dr. Amy Abernethy and its device center director, Dr. Jeff Shuren, announced the decision to terminate the program in a statement on increasing transparency about the safety of breast implants.

The agency has for years allowed makers of breast implants to report hundreds of thousands of injuries and malfunctions out of the public eye, federal records show.

“We believe these steps for more transparent medical device reports will contribute to greater public awareness of breast implant adverse events,” Abernethy and Shuren said in a Thursday statement. “This is part of a larger effort to end the alternative summary reporting program for all medical devices.”

Related Investigation Hidden FDA Reports Detail Harm Caused By Scores Of Medical Devices

FDA spokeswoman Angela Stark said the agency will also end “alternative summary reporting” exemptions still in place for makers of implantable cardiac defibrillators, pacemakers and tooth implants. The FDA has said the program was originally designed to allow for more efficient internal review of well-known risks.

The agency said it began winding down the program in mid-2017, revoking many reporting exemptions, including those for saline breast implants and for balloon pumps used inside patients’ blood vessels.

At that point, the agency required device makers with ongoing exemptions to file quarterly reports in its public device-harm database known as MAUDE, short for the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience.

Still, FDA data provided to KHN shows that during the first nine months of 2018 the FDA continued to accept more than 190,000 injury reports and 45,000 malfunction reports under the hidden “alternative summary reporting” program.

Ronni Solomon, vice president and chief policy officer of the ECRI Institute, which studies device safety, said the staff uses the FDA’s open data on a daily basis to look for signals that might show heightened risks with a particular device.

“We think it’s really vital for the sake of transparency, for the sake of policy, for sake of science,” she said. “We’re really glad to see this, the sooner the better.”

The agency said its forthcoming data release will be for the alternative summary reports filed before mid-2017. The FDA for years reached agreements with makers of about 100 devices, allowing them to cease public reports of certain types of problems. The agency previously said the agreements and resulting records were available only by filing a Freedom of Information Act request, a process that can take months or even years.

Going forward, device makers will be required to file individual reports describing each case of patient harm related to a medical device.

The FDA has not said it will stop allowing device makers to file other types of device-harm exemption reports that are withheld from the public, such as when there is mass litigation over a device or when a company is submitting reports from an independent device-tracking registry. Nor has a plan been announced to open those records, which contain reports of harm related to pelvic mesh and surgical robots and reports of deaths related to several cardiac devices.

The FDA had granted Covidien, now a division of Medtronic, a long-standing “alternative summary reporting” exemption for its surgical staplers, a device used to cut tissues and vessels and quickly seal them during a variety of surgeries.

In 2016, when just 84 reports of stapler-related harm were disclosed in the FDA’s MAUDE database, almost 10,000 more malfunction reports were sent directly to the FDA’s in-house database, the agency acknowledged.

The device has been subject to numerous lawsuits over patient deaths and grave harm.

Doris Levering alleged in court that a stapler malfunction during liver surgery caused profuse bleeding that left her husband, Mark, 62, with serious brain damage and unable to walk. She applauded the agency’s decision to open the database. “It’s just wonderful to know that this information is going to be out in the open and not covered up,” she said. “Now doctors who need to find the information will be able to find it.”

The surgeon, hospital and device maker have all denied wrongdoing in an ongoing legal case.

The FDA has announced a May 30 advisory board meeting to review the agency’s oversight of surgical staplers.

The FDA will leave in place a newer summary-reporting program that allows makers of more than 5,500 types of devices to send the agency spreadsheets logging device malfunctions. Unlike the “alternative summary reporting” program, device makers will not be allowed to report serious injuries using that approach.

Over the years, the FDA has had an uneven record of disclosing its “exemption” reports to advisers who review the safety of individual devices.

In February, FDA officials presented an advisory panel on gynecological devices with data showing 476 adverse events in 2017 related to a certain type of pelvic mesh. That panel was not briefed on nearly 12,000 reports filed by eight mesh makers in 2017, under a special exemption for lawsuit-related reports, according to an agency spokeswoman and a review of public records.

FDA spokeswoman Deborah Kotz said in an email that those “litigation” summary reports did not contain enough detail for the FDA to determine whether they shed any light on the safety question at hand.

The FDA ultimately took decisive action, though, ordering makers of the type of mesh under review to stop marketing those products, which were used to support sagging pelvic organs.

In late March, after KHN’s investigation landed, the FDA convened another panel to review breast implant-related injuries and a rare form of lymphoma. For that meeting, the agency did provide a full tally of previously unreported injury and malfunction reports related to breast implants.

As of Thursday, though, the agency said it would leave the textured breast implants linked to a rare lymphoma on the market.

Matt Baretich, a Denver-area biomedical engineer who advises health systems on device safety, is eager to examine the hidden reports as they’re released by the FDA.

“I’m really interested to see what information has been hidden so I can go back,” Baretich said. “I may have been looking for that information and not found anything and thought there was not a problem.”",JustBadNews,0
Turkey to buy Russian missiles despite US 'threats',http://france24.com/en/20190505-turkey-buy-russian-missiles-despite-us-threats,"Advertising Read more

Istanbul (AFP)

Turkey on Sunday dismissed US threats of sanctions if it went ahead with a Russian missile purchase, saying it would not renege on a pledge to Moscow.

Washington has warned its NATO ally for months that Ankara's adoption of Russian S-400 missile technology alongside US F-35 fighters would pose a threat to the jets and endanger Western defence.

The US has said it will halt a joint F-35 programme with Turkey if it acquires the Russian missile defence system. A US law furthermore provides for sanctions on any country concluding arms deals with Russian companies.

""The US threats of sanctions shows that they don't know Turkey,"" Vice President Fuat Oktay told Kanal 7 television.

""The decision on the S-400 has been taken. Once a pact has been signed, one's word given, Turkey respects it,"" he said.

The S-400 purchase is one dispute fuelling tensions between two nations also at odds over US support for Syrian Kurdish militias which Ankara brands as terrorists and Turkish backing for US foe Venezuela.

Ankara said the first deliveries of the S-400 are scheduled for June or July.

Last month, after repeated warnings, the United States said Turkey's decision to buy the S-400 system was incompatible with it remaining part of the emblematic F-35 jet programme.

Turkey had planned to buy 100 F-35A fighter jets, with pilots already training in the United States.

Washington has placed a freeze on the joint manufacturing operations with Turkey, and suggested Ankara might be able to obtain a US missile defence system if it forgoes the one on offer from Moscow.

"Four members of Sikh family shot dead in US' Ohio, police to investigate 'hate crime' angle after evidence of forced entry - Firstpost",http://firstpost.com/world/four-members-of-sikh-family-shot-dead-in-us-ohio-police-to-investigate-hate-crime-angle-after-evidence-of-forced-entry-6541651.html,"A homicide investigation into the deaths of four members of a Sikh family in the United States will explore the 'hate crime' angle, reports said on Tuesday.

Four members of a Sikh family in United States' Ohio were shot dead in their home in the West Chester apartment complex on Sunday. The local police has said that they will also explore the 'hate crime' angle, reports said on Tuesday.

The victims, three women, and one man were found dead inside the apartment with multiple gunshot wounds. Children also live in the apartment, but they were not present at the time of the shooting, reports said.

Chief of police, Joel Herzog was quoted as saying that “multiple gunshots” were fired inside the apartment, but he didn't specify how many, or whether the victims had been shot more than once. Police wasn't of the opinion that one of the victims was the shooter, reports said.

While the police did not specify whether they were looking for one or more suspects, Herzog said that they had evidence of forced entry.

Herzog also said that it was too early to suggest a motive and it doesn’t appear that there was any return fire. He said Butler County’s coroner will determine the cause of death and release the victims’ identities.

Herzog said the shooting appeared ""isolated"" and he doesn't believe there's any danger to the community.

""Authorities established a perimeter around the apartment complex early Monday morning and are now searching on a larger scale. Investigators towed two vehicles from the scene at about 7 am Monday. Investigative teams continued to canvas the apartment complex and surrounding areas for evidence Monday. A dive team searched a pond on the property, and investigators have searched the grounds extensively,"" WCPO Cincinnati reported.

Reports quoted the local temple's executive committee president, Jasminder Singh, as saying that he was shocked when he learned of the deaths. ""This is a horrible, horrible happening, in our community especially,"" he says. ""Everybody is really shocked and at the same time scared.""",JustBadNews,0
UK: Liverpool man dies after being declared fit for work and denied benefits,http://wsws.org/en/articles/2019/04/30/step-a30.html,"Stephen Smith, 64, died in an emaciated state on April 15. The last years of his life were marred by serious ill health, made worse by the punitive actions of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) who denied him Employment Support Allowance (ESA) and declared him “fit for work.”

Smith’s ailments included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis and an enlarged prostate. He also had a colostomy bag. He had recently been in hospital with a bout of pneumonia, which may have led to his death. His chronic ill-health meant that his weight had dropped to six stones (84 lbs./38 kgs.) and he feared for his life.

Smith had worked all his life, until his health deteriorated in 2006/2007. He was employed as a plumber and then ran a shop repairing fridges and washing machines. Well-known and respected locally, he never married but had family in the area. He was admitted to hospital last Christmas because of deteriorating health.

Despite his long-term chronic health problems, Smith failed a DWP Work Capability Assessment (WCA) in March 2017. Failure meant he lost his right to ESA and instead had to sign on each week as available for work to receive Job Seeker’s Allowance of just £67 a week. JSA requires claimants to prove they are actively seeking work.

Photos of Smith published in the Liverpool Echo at the time he was refused ESA are heart-breaking and caused widespread outrage. The DWP dismissed letters from two doctors who had written in Smith’s support. They stated that because of his chronic illness, he was unable to walk 20 metres without getting exhausted and being in pain.

Speaking to the media in February, Smith explained that he struggled to survive at home: “I could only make it to the kitchen to make food once a day. I had no muscles in the back of my leg, which meant I couldn’t stand up at all, and had to lean or sit down all the time, but they were telling me I was fit for work.”

An appeal against the DWP’s decision in January 2018 was dismissed when the DWP insisted Smith had not scored sufficiently high in an assessment of limited capability for work. Smith spent most of the last year of his life fighting against the DWP’s decision to deny him ESA.

At a tribunal held in January this year, the DWP decision was overturned as the judge could clearly see Smith not capable of working. His ESA was restored and more than £4,000 awarded in back payments for benefits denied over the course of more than a year. Smith had to sign himself out of the hospital to attend the hearings.

In a cruel irony, the £4,000 back payment will be used to pay for his funeral.

After he had struggled for many months, Smith had turned to the Community Advice Service Association (CASA).

The CASA was set up at the end of an 850-day strike in 1998 by sacked dockers to give advice and assist anyone suffering poverty.

The WSWS spoke to Terry Craven, who works at CASA advising people on benefit claims and their rights. He described Smith’s first attempt to appeal against the March 2017 decision to remove ESA: “All that stress for someone already living in poverty, when the health care professional scored Smith it meant he was fit for work.

“He went on his Zimmer frame … he was obviously struggling to breathe. He went to the assessment alone. Like lambs to the slaughter … he should never have been found fit for work in a million years. But once the decision is made, that’s it. The Independent Assessment Service—There’s no comeback with them … they are getting seven out of ten assessments incorrect.”

Craven said he went to see Smith after he was admitted to hospital on December 21 last year. He represented him at the tribunal in January.

At the tribunal hearing a doctor acting for the DWP referred to medical notes on Smith from 20 years ago. The doctor claimed Smith was a heavy drinker, which Smith denied. “All of a sudden I realised they may not have read the papers properly … The qualification for ESA and to get into the support group—is that you unable to walk 50 metres without pain, breathlessness, etc.”

Smith was awarded Personal Independence Payment (PIP) in September 2017. PIP is paid to people with poor mobility because of illness or disability. To qualify for PIP a claimant has to show they cannot walk 20 metres without pain, etc. As Smith had qualified for PIP, the DWP could not argue he could walk 50 metres and conceded that his ESA must be restored.

“We had started to put a case together with a solicitor with a view to suing the DWP and or the Independent Assessment Service (formerly ATOS),” Craven said. “There could be a charge of corporate manslaughter for reason of gross negligence. I just feel so angry that he didn’t even get the benefit of the back-payment.”

Smith’s death shorty after having his right to benefit restored was not the first such case and will not be the last. Jeff Hayward died in June last year aged 52 from a heart attack. Prior to his heart attack, he spent 18 months trying to overturn a decision not to award him ESA in November 2016. This was despite his GP deeming him unfit for work. The ESA health assessor awarded him zero disability points.

With the help of the Ribble Valley Citizens Advice group, Hayward lodged appeals. Following his death, his daughter Holly pursued his case and in January this year the family was paid the backdated entitlement he should have originally been awarded. The medical evidence used to overturn the original decision was that submitted in the original application for ESA.

Analysis of DWP figures in 2015 showed that from December 2011 to February 2014, around 90 people a month had died shortly after being found fit for work after a work capability assessment. WCAs were first brought in by the Labour government in 2007, with its strict criteria tightened by successive governments.

The number of deaths where welfare cuts have contributed was uncovered in a Freedom of Information request from disability campaigner Gail Ward. An article on the Welfare Weekly site noted, “shocking statistics reveal that 111,450 ESA claims were closed following the death of claimants between March 2014 to February 2017.”

While no direct causation can be made between the ending of ESA entitlement and deaths, it noted, “The DWP has since been urged to update these statistics to include individuals who flowed off ESA after being found ‘fit for work’ and who died soon after this time.”

Speaking to Welfare Weekly, Ward said, “The fact the DWP know that disabled people are dying in such large numbers and refuse to adjust policy to reduce the stress on claimants and make sure the right outcome is 100% all the time, and with Universal Credit coming with such strict criteria, doesn’t bode well for the future for the disabled community’.”

The cases cited above give lie to the claim by the Conservative government that the era of austerity is at an end. Austerity is the response of capitalist governments all over the world to make the working class pay for the bailout of the banks and super rich after the 2008 global financial crisis. The tragic death of Stephen Smith confirms that the attack on the right to welfare is a permanent feature of that response.",JustBadNews,0
"Erdogan hits back at 'hypocritical' Western recognition of Armenian Genocide, calling deportations 'appropriate'",http://alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/4/24/erdogan-claims-armenian-genocide-deportations-were-appropriate,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday hit back at Western nations for recognising the Armenian genocide, claiming the mass deportation of Armenians by Ottoman troops had been ""appropriate"" at the time.

Erdogan's comments came as he addressed a symposium on Turkey's archives at the presidential palace in Ankara on 24 April, recognised by many as the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day.

""The relocation of the Armenian gangs and their supporters, who massacred the Muslim people, including women and children, in eastern Anatolia, was the most reasonable action that could be taken in such a period,"" said Erdogan, according to Sabah.

Turkish officials have often justified the mass deportation and killings of Armenians during World War One by referring to the ""rebellion"" of armed Armenian groups against Ottoman rule and those groups' alleged ""collaboration"" with the Russian Empire during the war.

While some Armenians may have been involved in fighting against the Ottoman Empire, most were innocent civilians, including women and children, international scholars say.

Historians estimate around 1.5 million Armenians were killed in what many scholars call the first genocide of the 20th century, although Turkey disputes this figure.

At least 30 countries have recognised the Armenian genocide, including Canada, France and Germany, and its denial is criminalised in several European states.

""We see that those who attempt to lecture us on human rights over the Armenian issue themselves have a bloody past,"" Erdogan said on Wednesday, accusing France of having committed genocides in Rwanda and Algeria.

Ankara and Paris in February experienced renewed tensions over President Emmanuel Macron's decision to recognise 24 April as a national commemoration day for the Armenian genocide.

Turkey on Monday recalled its ambassador from Austria after parliamentarians in Vienna held a minute's silence for the victims of the genocide. The country has also previously recalled its ambassadors from Germany, the United States and the Vatican over the issue.

Calling on countries to consult Turkey’s official archives in order to find out the ""truth"" of the matter, Erdogan also accused other Western nations of hypocrisy over the Armenian genocide.

""Those who today wear the mask of human rights and democracy apostles are responsible for the biggest massacres humanity has witnessed in recent centuries,"" he said, recalling the Crusades.

""Those who talk about genocide seem to have forgotten [their] concentration camps,"" the president added.

While Erdogan implied that the contents of the Turkish archive would contradict recognition of the events as a genocide, historians say documents from the archives have allowed historians to provide more robust accounts of the genocide in recent years.

""The whole 'our archives are open' line gets stranger and stranger every year,"" tweeted historian James Ryan, who focuses on Turkish history. ""It's definitely true, but this position pretty much tells you how much time RTE's [Erdogan] spent there.""

Erdogan also addressed Aram Atesyan, General Vicar of Turkey's Armenian Patriarchate, in a letter on Wednesday.

""I remember with respect the Ottoman Armenians who lost their lives under [the] harsh conditions of the First World War and offer my sincere condolences to their grandchildren,"" he wrote, according to the Turkish Presidency's official Twitter account, describing the shared ""grief"" of Turks and Armenians.

""I kindly request you to avoid helping those who seek to create hatred, grudge and hostility by distorting our common history.""",JustBadNews,0

It’s just — it’s gone. natalie kitroeff Did you ever expect to feel the way that you feel about the company now? swampy Oh, absolutely not. Natalie, I still lose sleep every night. I just — I guess, I don’t know, I got a conscience or something, I don’t know. But I just — I have to get it addressed. That’s why I keep telling my story. Somebody’s got to step in and get it addressed.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today —

archived recording 1 Indonesia’s Search and Rescue Agency says that a Lion Air passenger flight has crashed into the sea. archived recording 2 An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 traveling from Addis Ababa to Nairobi has crashed, with death reported.

michael barbaro

After the two crashes of Boeing’s 737 Max jets, regulators and lawmakers began asking questions about whether the race to get that jet built and the competitive pressure may have led Boeing to miss safety risks in the plane’s design.

archived recording The F.A.A. and Boeing say faulty sensors on new 737 Max jets can cause the plane to go into a steep dive.

michael barbaro

In reporting that story, my colleague Natalie Kitroeff began to look into whether that pressure extends beyond the 737 Max. It’s Tuesday, April 23. Natalie, where does this story start?

natalie kitroeff

In the wake of the two crashes of the 737 Max jet, we began looking into whether that frenzied pace, whether those pressures might have had an impact not just on the engineering decisions around the design of the aircraft at the highest levels, but whether it also plays out on the factory floor and affects the people who are actually building Boeing planes.

michael barbaro

Basically, is there a larger cultural issue here?

natalie kitroeff

That’s the question we were asking. Then we hear from attorneys who are representing multiple whistle-blowers who work on the factory floor at Boeing. And it turns out that these whistle-blowers have been trying to get attention to these issues, to their concerns for a very long time. And any time you hear about there being several whistle-blowers with the same concerns at a company like Boeing, you pay attention.

[music]

[phone rings]

natalie kitroeff

So one of these whistleblowers was named John.

swampy Hello. natalie kitroeff Hey, Swampy? swampy Hey, how you doing, Natalie?

natalie kitroeff

Or Swampy.

michael barbaro

Swampy.

natalie kitroeff

He goes by Swampy. It’s short for Swamp Dog.

swampy Yeah, one day I was at work just cutting up with some guys and one of them popped off, well, hell, you’re just a damn double swamp dog from the swamps of Louisiana. And it just stuck. [LAUGHS]

natalie kitroeff

So I start talking to Swampy.

natalie kitroeff Can I ask why you decided to become a whistle-blower? swampy Wow. So that’s a lot — a lot.

natalie kitroeff

And that leads me to many other whistle-blowers.

speaker We’re not talking about cars. If your car breaks down, you can pull over to the side of the road. There is no pulling over.

natalie kitroeff

And ultimately —

speaker Then, there’s other things about the plane, the actual material —

natalie kitroeff

My colleague and I talk to more than a dozen current and former employees. And we review hundreds of pages of internal emails, company documents, federal records. We speak with the F.A.A. and with Boeing. And we begin to piece together an entirely new narrative about the way that manufacturing is done at Boeing that we never expected to find.

archived recording Ladies and gentlemen, your 787 Dreamliner!

natalie kitroeff

So it starts with the 787 Dreamliner, another of Boeing’s crown jewels.

archived recording (barack obama) This is the first commercial airplane to be made with 50 percent composite materials.

natalie kitroeff

It was unveiled in 2007. And it was Boeing’s most important offering in a generation.

archived recording (barack obama) And it looks cool. [LAUGHTER]

michael barbaro

I remember reading about this plane. This had giant windows, the kind of unusually big nose. It was going to be the next big thing in airlines.

natalie kitroeff

Oh, yeah.

swampy Oh, that was the news of the month. New airplane, new technology, state-of-the-art.

natalie kitroeff

And for a while, it was.

swampy That was our future, absolutely. That’s why it’s the Dreamliner, because it’s our future. Fully composite, carbon fiber-reinforced —

natalie kitroeff

It was a big deal.

archived recording The fortunes of the Boeing company are flying on the wings of the Dreamliner. So any word of a delay is not going to be well-received on Wall Street.

natalie kitroeff

But pretty quickly, the 787 program begins to run into problems.

archived recording 1 So it is delaying this. And Boeing’s saying, in fact, it’s not going to know, even for the next few weeks, when it is going to reschedule — archived recording 2 Well, now, the company is dealing with two new 787 incidents in the past two days. archived recording 3 Yet another delay for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. The U.S. plane maker pushed back the schedule for the fourth time.

natalie kitroeff

To the point where Boeing begins to get a bit concerned about whether it’s going to meet the deadlines that it set for the program.

archived recording Elsewhere, a confident Boeing is going to build a second plant to make its 787 Dreamliner.

natalie kitroeff

So Boeing decides it’s going to open a brand new factory.

michael barbaro

And how big a deal is that for Boeing?

natalie kitroeff

This is a huge deal for Boeing. Boeing has been making its commercial aircraft in two factories in Washington. This would be a foray into a new state, a new assembly line. You’re talking a manufacturing hub that needs to be state-of-the-art, that can manufacture one of the most advanced aircraft in the world, a major investment both in real estate and in jobs.

[music]

michael barbaro

And where they end up building the facility?

archived recording Do I even need to say it is a great day in South Carolina?

natalie kitroeff

They pick Charleston, South Carolina.

archived recording We are telling the entire world that we build things in South Carolina. We build cars. We build tires. And now we build dreams. Big, mack daddy, 787 dreams.

natalie kitroeff

The issue is that Boeing has promised to create 3,800 local jobs. But Charleston doesn’t have the thriving aerospace workforce that you would see in Washington, where Boeing has nurtured generations of aircraft builders. And they bring people like Swampy, managers from the Washington area, over to Charleston to get things started.

swampy I’m originally from Louisiana. I’m a Louisiana boy, so when they opened up the Boeing South Carolina plant, looked at it as a great opportunity, not only get closer to my family, but to help build it from the ground up. So I wanted to be a part of that. natalie kitroeff Was the culture of the factory in Charleston the same as the culture of the factory in Washington? swampy Oh, absolutely not. It’s like night and day. They hired a lot of people from the South Carolina state that really had no experience with building airplanes, and building commercial airplanes, and understanding what procedures were, and the criticality of them. So that was the big difference I saw was they just didn’t have the experience down here.

natalie kitroeff

So they are furiously trying to train all of these new workers. But they’re really far behind on the 787 program, years behind. Eventually, the plane comes out. But a couple years later, they run into a problem.

archived recording The F.A.A. suddenly announced they are grounding the Dreamliner.

natalie kitroeff

The F.A.A. grounds the fleet after a problem with batteries overheating that could cause a fire.

archived recording It’s grounded until it can prove to the federal government that the airline has fixed the problem with a battery that continues to overheat.

natalie kitroeff

They come up with a fix, but what I am learning from people like Swampy, from the more than a dozen current and former employees that we talk to, is that the batteries weren’t the only problem — that there was pressure on the factory floor that was creating a litany of other issues.

[music]

natalie kitroeff What was your title when you moved to Charleston? swampy Quality manager, multifamily quality manager.

natalie kitroeff

So as a quality control manager, part of Swampy’s job was to check the insides of planes to make sure that, as workers are building the planes, nothing is left behind, no debris is left inside the aircraft.

swampy So I was called out to the airplane to look at an issue. And that’s where we discovered all this debris, these three-inch-long titanium slivers laying around. It’s just debris everywhere.

natalie kitroeff

And while he’s doing these inspections, he begins to notice that there are clusters of metal slivers that are hanging over the wires that control the plane.

swampy The risk here is these metal slivers will migrate into a power panel, any kind of power, any kind of electronic equipment, and short it out and cause a fire. And if it’s at 40,000 feet, that’s a problem. natalie kitroeff Is this normal? swampy No. No. Absolutely not. This is a first.

natalie kitroeff

And so he brings the issue to his managers. And he says, we need to clean this.

swampy I physically showed him the airplane. I took pictures, sent him pictures. And a peer of mine walked in on the conversation. And he was telling my peer, you need to go inspect line 230. I said, that’s what we just looked at. These are the pictures I sent you. I said, I won’t sign off on it. I won’t accept it. So I was removed from it. natalie kitroeff So you’re saying, you alerted your manager to the debris that you found on this plane. And in response, he took you off the plane and gave it to someone else to inspect. swampy Yes, that’s correct. natalie kitroeff Did that ever get cleaned? swampy It was delivered without being cleaned.

natalie kitroeff

And it’s not just the metal slivers on these planes. Swampy and several other employees at Boeing have said that there is a ton of stuff that is being left inside of the aircrafts — nuts, bolts, fasteners, rags, bubble wrap, trash, tools. And it’s not just in the build process. They’re finding this stuff on the flight line as the planes are being prepared for delivery.

michael barbaro

And when you say inside the plane, you mean inside the guts, the machinery of the plane, not the passenger parts of the plane.

natalie kitroeff

Right, it’s inside the bowels of the aircraft. So we heard this story of a representative for American Airlines who found a bolt, a stray bolt, inside of an engine. And this was on a plane that had already gone up for a test flight with Boeing pilots. We heard about a ladder inside of a tail of a plane that had also already gone up for a test flight. The workers pointed to these as examples of shoddy, sometimes sloppy workmanship. We heard, for example, of a technician who found chewing gum holding together the lining of a door. Just a cosmetic issue, but again, sloppiness. With some of the objects, though, there were safety risks, employees said. And I asked Swampy about all this.

natalie kitroeff Swampy, I think some people might hear a lot of the stuff that you saw and say, look, it sounds like a lot of that is sloppy. But maybe it doesn’t affect safety. What would you say to that? swampy I’d say, probably about 60 percent of the stuff, I would agree. It’s sloppy. But just shooting from the hip, I mean, 40 percent of this is critical stuff. I mean, look, you got metal shavings floating around the electronics equipment.

natalie kitroeff

If you’ve ever put your head against the window of an airplane, you know how much a plane vibrates while it’s flying. Imagine then, a bolt, or a ladder, or these metal shavings vibrating near wiring or near critical parts of the plane. That bolt, had it migrated inside of the engine, it could have caused the engine to malfunction.

[music]

natalie kitroeff

So Swampy sees this pressure for speed resulting in all of this sloppiness. But he’s even more troubled by something else he’s seeing as a reflection of this culture.

swampy So let me tell you this. Let me tell you kind of what’s going on. So I was assigned to M.R.S.A., quality manager of M.R.S.A.

natalie kitroeff

Swampy, at a certain point, is in charge of the area of the factory that houses defective parts. And he says that hundreds of defective parts are going missing, with no record of where they’ve gone.

swampy So basically, they’re just gone. And we tried to figure out who took them, where they went. We had no idea where they went. We just don’t know.

natalie kitroeff

And he suspects and fears that they are ending up on airplanes.

swampy I think it’s highly likely they’re on airplanes, absolutely.

natalie kitroeff

Those fears are confirmed in a particularly troubling episode.

swampy So I was actually out of office that day. And I come in, I don’t know, it was the next day or the day after. And my team started telling me about it. One of my inspectors was telling me, hey, this is what happened. And there was three of us here. And we tried to tell him he couldn’t do it.

natalie kitroeff

Where he hears from the inspectors who report to him that a manager has come in to that area for defective parts, taken a defective, a dented hydraulic tube out of that area, given it to another manager who installed it on an airplane.

michael barbaro

A Dreamliner.

natalie kitroeff

A Dreamliner.

swampy And like three of my inspectors jumped up and said, no, you cannot do that. That’s a serious process violation. And he basically told them the same thing. Don’t worry about it. natalie kitroeff Is the hydraulic tube, is it essential to the plane? swampy Oh, yeah, because, yeah, the hydraulics is what operates your flaps, and your slats, and anything that requires hydraulic movement, which is typically all your flight control systems. Yeah, that’s where your hydraulic flumes go.

natalie kitroeff

The reason that his inspectors know that this happened is that it looks as though someone has unsuccessfully tried to rub off the red paint that is on this part. There’s red paint on the part because it’s defective. That is meant to signal, do not install this part on a plane.

michael barbaro

So someone went into that pile of red-painted, defective stuff, grabbed something out, tried to disguise it as non-defective, non-red, and had it installed in the plane.

natalie kitroeff

Boeing said that it investigated this issue and did not substantiate Swampy’s claims. But Swampy says it wasn’t just anybody that did this. It was a senior manager. Someone above Swampy has done this. And so he calls that person, he says, and he says —

swampy Hey, I’m hearing that you did this. Is it true?

natalie kitroeff

Did that happen?

swampy And he said, yup, I did. And don’t you worry about it. I got it taken care of.

natalie kitroeff

That manager said it did, and let it go. We have it handled.

[music]

natalie kitroeff

And again, Swampy submitted a complaint about this issue to the F.A.A. The F.A.A. investigated and found that defective parts had gone missing.

swampy So now you’re getting into the culture at Charleston, right? And the culture here is push the planes out. Just find a way. Get ‘em out. Get ‘em out.

natalie kitroeff

Remember that in this factory, there is a huge amount of pressure to produce these planes as fast as possible. And if you don’t have the part that you need to finish the job, just one job on the airplane, that holds you back. That holds the whole production line back. And so, if it’s easier and faster to just go grab a defective part and put it on the plane, that might be what you do in that scenario.

swampy In fact, I had one senior manager one day tell me that — actually, there was a few of us standing around talking about inspection, and he said, we don’t need inspectors. These planes are too smart to fall out the sky. It’s like, oh my God, with that mentality running the show down here? That’s scary. natalie kitroeff And Swampy, were managers rewarded for production? swampy Yes, actually, it’s almost measured hourly at times. I mean, yeah, there’s a lot of pressure to meet schedule. natalie kitroeff And folks are getting — managers are getting judged by their superiors based on an hourly — swampy The number of jobs they get sold, yes. natalie kitroeff Based on an hourly count of the work that they’re doing, of the jobs that they complete and get approved by quality inspectors. swampy Exactly, exactly. And it’s held against them if they create defects. So there is an incentive not to report your defect that you created, because it’s going to be held against you.

[music]

michael barbaro

What does Boeing say about this idea that there is a conflict between the safety that they proclaim and the on-the-ground pressures that you’re describing from employees to get these planes out the door?

natalie kitroeff

Boeing pushes back on the idea that there is a cultural problem. They reject that notion altogether. In response to our reporting, Boeing insisted that safety is its number one priority and said, we prioritize safety and quality over speed. But all three can be accomplished while still producing one of the safest airplanes flying today. And to be clear, the 787 Dreamliner has never crashed. It has a pristine safety record. And there’s no evidence that any of the problems that we document has led to major safety incidents. But since the crashes of those two 737 Max jets, the question that is being raised by lawmakers, by regulators, and by employees within Boeing is whether those three factors, safety, quality and speed, are always in balance — or whether sometimes, the competitive pressures that exist at the highest levels of this company are bearing down not just on the engineers as they design how this aircraft is going to work, but also on the factory floor, on the people who are responsible for assembling and manufacturing these aircraft. Does the push to produce sometimes lead senior-level managers to overlook or ignore or sometimes dismiss the concerns raised by the people who are making these planes.

swampy I just think it’s critically important that the activities going on within Boeing are made aware to the people whose lives could be affected. I mean, look at the 737 Max. I mean, those lives and those families. And as a quality manager at Boeing, you’re the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public. So as a quality manager, being the last line of defense, that’s a huge responsibility. Everything I put my name on, I’m certifying that it meets the requirements, the regulatory requirements, is in safe, airworthy condition. And I haven’t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I’d put my name on that’s saying it’s safe and airworthy.

[music]

natalie kitroeff

Swampy is just one employee. But he retired a couple of years ago because of the pressure that he felt to not report violations.

natalie kitroeff I think a lot of people listening to this may have flights booked on 787s. And I wonder what you would tell them. swampy Well, I would say just — I mean, what could I say? I mean, just understand what you’re getting into. I mean, understand that just because it’s a brand new airplane from Boeing don’t mean that it was built right. natalie kitroeff Would you fly on a 787 Dreamliner out of Charleston? swampy No, ma’am. You couldn’t pay me. Uh-uh. natalie kitroeff Swampy, thank you. swampy You’re welcome.

"Seriously ill, emaciated man who was denied benefits by DWP dies | Society | The Guardian",http://theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/21/stephen-smith-liverpool-seriously-ill-emaciated-man-denied-benefits-dwp-dies,"A man with multiple debilitating illnesses who was denied benefits and deemed fit to work, sparking a national outcry over the government’s welfare system, has died.

Stephen Smith, 64, who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis and an enlarged prostate that left him in chronic pain, made headline news earlier this year. Shocking pictures showed him emaciated in hospital with pneumonia as his weight dropped to six stone, leaving him barely able to walk.

He failed a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) work capability assessment in 2017, which meant that his employment support allowance (ESA) payments were stopped. Instead, he was told to sign on to receive a £67 a week jobseeker’s allowance, visit the jobcentre once a week and prove that he was looking for work.

The man’s plight, first reported by the Liverpool Echo, prompted widespread outrage and an apology from the DWP.

A friend of Smith confirmed to the Guardian that he had died last Monday and that his family had asked for privacy. One friend, quoted by the Liverpool Echo, said Smith had never recovered from pneumonia. “He was a good soul of the earth. He would do anything for anyone,” they added.

News of Smith’s death prompted renewed anger over his treatment. Within hours, nearly 300 people had taken to the local newspaper’s social media pages to express their disgust. One said it was “absolutely heartbreaking” and added: “RIP poor poor man, you should never [have] been put through this.”

Smith, who lived alone, said in February that he did not know where to turn as his health deteriorated. “I could only make it to the kitchen to make food once a day. I had no muscles in the back of my leg, which meant I couldn’t stand up at all, and had to lean or sit down all the time, but they were telling me I was fit for work.”

Smith’s case was taken up by Liverpool’s Casa community centre and Terry Craven, a benefit claims adviser. Opinions were sought from two doctors, who confirmed that Smith experienced significant difficulty and pain when completing simple movements and daily activities.

A note written by one of them stated: “It is my opinion that Mr Smith could not walk 20 metres without pain or exhaustion.”

The opinions were submitted as evidence to bolster Smith’s case, but in January last year his appeal was rejected by the DWP. It informed him that he had not scored the requisite number of points to be deemed as having limited capability for work.

His ESA was only reinstated 12 months later when a judge saw Smith’s condition for himself. Smith had been forced to get a pass to discharge himself from hospital, where he was being treated for pneumonia, in order to attend the tribunal and fight his case.

A DWP spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Stephen Smith.



“We are committed to ensuring that people with health conditions get the support they’re entitled to.”",JustBadNews,0
"Half of UK consumers willing to pay more to avoid plastic packaging - Eight in 10 trying to cut plastic waste and 46% feel guilty about it, survey shows",http://theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/19/half-of-uk-consumers-willing-to-pay-more-to-avoid-plastic-packaging-survey-shows,"Exclusive: eight in 10 trying to cut plastic waste and 46% feel guilty about it, survey shows

Eight in 10 consumers are trying to reduce their plastic waste and half would be willing to pay higher prices for eco-friendly packaging, according to a survey that highlights the impact of the Blue Planet documentary and the campaign to reduce such rubbish.

The research by YouGov shows 46% of people in the UK feel guilty about the amount of plastic they use, which is motivating them to consider changes in their behaviour, including paying more so companies will find alternatives to single-use plastics.

The Blue Planet effect: the plastics revolution is just the start | Fiona Gell Read more

The sense of guilt was most pronounced among young people: 51% of positive respondents were in the 18-24 age bracket, and the least pronounced (43%) among people in their late 40s and early 50s.

Shoppers’ efforts to reduce purchases of products in plastic packaging were focused on the fresh fruit and vegetable aisle (81%), following by household and cleaning products (36%), homeware (32%), health, oral and hair items (27%) and cosmetics (18%).

Fifty per cent said they would be willing to pay a higher price for goods in biodegradable packaging. Only 33% were opposed.

Out of a weekly shop of £100, 50% of people were ready to pay at least £2 more, while 27% were prepared to add at least £5 to their grocery bill for this purpose.

The study also revealed people wanted the government to do more about plastic packaging. Sixty-nine percent agreed companies should be required by law to produce eco-friendly packaging, even if it meant prices going up, 71% were in favour of extending the mandatory 5p charge for plastic bags to smaller retail outlets, and 80% supported a deposit return scheme for bottles such as those in Denmark, Sweden and Germany.

The results highlight growing public awareness of the problem of plastic waste. Scientists and environmental campaigners have warned about the link to carbon emissions and the dangers to marine life since the turn of the century, but it is only in recent years that it has become a mainstream concern. This is widely attributed to David Attenborough’s 2017 Blue Planet II documentary series, but a year before this, Greenpeace secured 350,000 signatures on a petition to ban microbeads.",JustBadNews,0
'Unlawful & unrecognized': Twitter heaps criticism as US maps show Golan Heights as part of Israel,http://rt.com/news/456782-us-israel-golan-heights-map/,"The Trump administration has released a controversial new US government map of Israel that shows the Golan Heights in Syria as being part of Israel, much to the outrage of many online.

Special envoy to the Middle East, Jason Greenblatt, shared the updated map on Twitter on Tuesday. Israel occupied the Syrian region in the 1967 Six Day War and later annexed it in 1981 in a move that was not recognized by the international community or the UN Security Council.

China increases coal production,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/What-Is-Pushing-China-Back-To-Coal.html,"Data released by the Chinese energy bureau this week shows that the country added a whopping 194 million tonnes of coal mining capacity over the course of 2018. This revelation comes in direct contrast with China’s widely publicized promises to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels, especially dirty coal, as well as specific avowals to do away with excess mining capacity.

By the end of last year, according to numbers from the National Energy Administration, China’s total coal mining capacity had gone from 3.34 billion tonnes at the end of 2017 to 3.53 billion. These numbers do not even take into account a further 1.03 billion tonnes per year of already-approved coal capacity currently under construction, nor do they include another 370 million tonnes per year that are currently being extracted as part of a trial operation. What’s more, China’s National Energy Administration has already greenlighted an additional seven coal mining operations which altogether would have a capacity of million tonnes per year within a period of time which already started at the beginning of 2019.

According to data published by China’s National Bureau of Statistics, Chinese mines produced 3.55 billion tonnes of coal last year, a 5.2 percent increase as compared to 2017. The bureau also reported that in 2018 the country generated a total of 4.979 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity from coal-fired power plants, 6 percent higher than the same measure in 2017.

While coal mining capacity has seen an overall increase, however, the total number of coal mines in China has actually declined. At the end of 2018, the Chinese National Energy Administration reported 3,373 domestic coal mines, down from 3,907 in 2017. The majority of the coal mines that have been shuttered recently were small and ineffective operations in eastern China. At the same time, production in the west has seen considerable expansion in capacity. Related: Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 Oil

This increase in Chinese coal capacity has attracted negative attention from the international community, with critics voicing concern that this development goes directly against the nation’s promise to decrease the amount of coal used in their total energy mix, and therefore will prevent the world’s second-largest economy from meeting its committed goal of capping their carbon emissions by 2030.

In fact, according to a report released by the International Energy Agency this week, not only are global carbon dioxide emissions continuing to climb, but ever-increasing energy demand around the world has led to record-high emissions from particularly dirty coal-fired plants. Last year the world’s energy demand grew by 2.3 percent, and 70 percent of that demand was met by fossil fuels, with a large contribution from relatively young coal-fired plants in Asia. Thanks in large part to these plants, global emissions from coal-fired power plants surpassed 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide for the first time in history.

These newly released numbers deal a crushing blow to any optimism about decreasing global emissions and even the overall effectiveness of the Paris climate agreement. For a while, things were looking up: emissions decreased, although very slightly, from 2014 through 2016, and coal emissions, in particular, went down. But now that progress appears to be in reverse. In response to this week’s International Energy Agency report, Stanford University professor of Earth system science Rob Jackson told the Washington Post, “We are in deep trouble. The climate consequences are catastrophic. I don’t use any word like that very often. But we are headed for disaster, and nobody seems to be able to slow things down.”

China is only one part of the problem. Discouragingly; the United States and Europe have seen an increase in admissions as well. That being said, countries with massive and rapidly expanding middle classes such as China and India can be expected to continue driving up demand and therefore emissions, especially if they continue to lean on fossil fuels to fill their populaces’ growing need. What’s more, China’s fleet of coal plants are mostly young--around an average of 12 years old with a total lifespan of 40 years--and as their capacity continues to increase, we can expect coal-fired emissions to keep breaking records in the coming years.

A woman has revealed the depraved abuse she suffered at the hands of her step-grandfather.



Charlotte Wade, 22, of Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan was raped, beaten and sexually abused from the age of 5 by vile paedophile, Raymond Hodges.



Horrifically, the sick monster even performed a homemade abortion on her, using a coat hanger, after he got her pregnant.



In November 2016, Charlotte eventually found the strength to report him to the police.



And eight months later, in July 2017, Hodges was convicted of a string of offences against Charlotte, including rape, indecent assault and using an instrument to procure abortion.



He was jailed for 25 years.

Now Charlotte, who works at McDonalds, has waived her right to anonymity to urge others to speak out.



She says: “I’m slowing piecing my life back together.



“And it helps to know that he’s rotting behind bars – and that my evidence helped to put him there.""

Raymond was Charlotte’s step-dad’s father and, although, he lived in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, he travelled 200 miles once a month to Charlotte’s home in Barry, South Glamorgan, to stay with them for a couple of weeks.



In 2002, when Charlotte was 5, Raymond offered to babysit her while her stepdad went out and her mum went to work.



She says: “I loved Raymond like he was my real grandad. He always brought me chocolate when he visited.



“But that day, Raymond was different and asked me if I knew how to kiss like a grown up.



“When I said no, he kissed me on the lips. Afterwards, he told me it was our secret.



“And he’d do it every time we were alone.”



The abuse escalated, and the next time Raymond stayed over, he made Charlotte touch him while her parents were asleep.



Soon she began to dread his visits.



In 2003 when Charlotte was six, Raymond moved to Barry to be closer to the family.



Charlotte says: “I felt sick.



“He moved to a flat just minutes from our house and I’d stay at his most weekends.



“There he’d force me to touch him and he’d touch me on my privates.



“He threatened to hurt my brothers if I told anyone. I was desperate to protect them, so I kept quiet.”

A year later when Charlotte was seven, Raymond took her to his flat, pushed her onto the living room floor and raped her.



She says: “The pain was unbearable. He told me this is what grown ups did.



“Afterwards, he bought me sweets from the shop as if nothing had happened.



“I was trapped.



“A year later, he began to film the sexual assaults.



“At first, I refused, but he kicked me in the stomach and then raped me anyway.



“I was powerless.



“The next time I refused, he forced my hand onto a scalding kettle.”



In 2009 when Charlotte was 12, she missed two periods.



She says: “Grandad was abusing me so regularly that he noticed and forced me to take a pregnancy test.



“He wouldn’t let me see the results and nothing was mentioned for a few weeks.”

How WalesOnline reported the court case “Depraved” Raymond Hodges was jailed for 25 years at Cardiff Crown Court in July 2017. He was found guilty following a trial of 20 child sex offences, including rape and using an instrument to procure abortion, he pleaded guilty to four counts. Representing Hodges, of Monmouth Way, Barry, Claire Pickthall said she could offer limited mitigation for her client. Speaking about the defendant’s health, she said: “He has arthritis and now suffers with anxiety and depression. “I am in no way seeking to minimise the offending the jury found Mr Hodges guilty of – there has been a profound effect on [the victim]. “It may be that Mr Hodges never walks as a free man again.” Sentencing, Judge Philip Harris-Jenkins said: “This is a case of extremely depraved sexual abuse upon a young girl for a number of years. “Your actions were sadistic on more than one occasion.” He added: “This was nothing other than the most depraved and horrific campaign of sexual abuse.” The judge said the abuse was “reinforced” by threats to his victim that he would attack her family. “There was a long history of beatings, scaldings and burns done in order to subject her to your control and there was further evidence of sexual pleasure you took from domineering this poor child.” Judge Harris-Jenkins said Hodges – who placed his head on the desk in front of him as he was jailed for 25 years – had “shown no remorse whatsoever”. Read the full court report here.

The next month, while Charlotte was at Raymond’s flat a friend of his turned up.Out of nowhere, his friend shoved Charlotte to the ground and pinned her down.Charlotte says: “I was terrified and thought he was going to rape me, then Grandad appeared with a coat hanger, pulled down my knickers, and pushed it inside me.“I’d never felt pain like it.“I felt like I was going to die.“Afterwards he told me that I wouldn’t be pregnant anymore, then he left me bleeding on the floor.“I cleaned myself up but I was in agony for the next few days.“And I was desperate to tell someone.""

Over the next two years, Raymond continued to rape Charlotte every week.



But when she hit her teens, the attacks became less frequent.



Then, aged 14, Raymond argued with her mum and stopped coming round.



Charlotte says: “Even after Grandad left, I never felt safe.



“I suffered terrible flashbacks and self-harmed. And I tried to end my life several times.



“I realised that Grandad needed to be punished for what he’d done to me.



“So in November 2016, I reported him to the police.



“A week later, he was arrested and charged.”

In July 2017, Raymond Hodges, now 73, of Monmouth Way, Barry, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court charged with 24 offences against Charlotte.



He pleaded guilty to one count of rape of a female child under the age of 13, one count of sexual assault of a female under the age of 13, assault of a female child under the age of 13, and causing or inciting a female child under 13 to engage in sexual activity.



He denied the rest of the charges, forcing Charlotte to give evidence.



After a two-week trial, Hodges was found guilty on all the remaining 20 charges.



Judge Philip Harris-Jenkins said Hodges had shown no remorse for what he called ‘the most depraved and horrific campaign of sexual abuse’.



He jailed Hodges for 25 years and ordered him to sign the sex offenders’ register for life.



Charlotte says: “When the police told me, I fell to the floor sobbing.



“Speaking out has helped me move forward with my life – and I want to urge others to do the same.



“My sick grandad may have deprived me of a happy childhood, but I refuse to let him ruin my future.”",JustBadNews,0
Media boycotts Russian parliament in sexual harassment row,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/russian-media-outlets-boycott-parliament-in-harassment-row,"Around 20 Russian-language media outlets have withdrawn their journalists from covering Russia’s lower house of parliament or limited their coverage in protest at a sexual harassment scandal involving an MP.



RBC, TV Rain, RTVI and Echo of Moscow have withdrawn their journalists from the Duma in the past 24 hours after an ethics committee cleared Leonid Slutsky of any wrongdoing over a series of alleged unwanted sexual advances towards reporters.

The boycott is an unusual show of solidarity over sexual harassment, a problem that is often laughed off in Russia and recently has been painted as a pet issue of western liberals at odds with traditional Russian values.

RBC announced on Wednesday it would recall its journalists. “This decision by the ethics committee, in fact, admits the norm of the possibility of sexual harassment toward journalists by newsmakers,” it said in a statement. “We do not agree with this approach and refuse to consider the Duma’s position in this question to be adequate.”

Two popular business dailies, Kommersant and Vedomosti, said they would limit their correspondents’ interactions with Slutsky.



Three female journalists have publicly accused Slutsky, the head of the Duma’s foreign affairs committee, of making unwanted sexual advances towards them while they negotiated with him over interviews. One said she had an audio recording of the encounter.

In one case, Slutsky was accused of asking a journalist to become his mistress and touching her inappropriately. In another, a journalist said Slutsky locked her in his office and tried to kiss her.

“He asked me to come without a camera,” said the journalist, Ekaterina Kotrikadze, in a live broadcast on the RTVI television station, where she is now a deputy editor. “He brought me into his office, locked the door and tried to pin me against the wall and somehow kiss and touch me. I got away and ran.”

Otari Ashiba, the head of the Duma ethics committee, said it had found no “violations by Slutsky of behavioural norms” and suggested the accusations were a provocation.

“The members of the commission have noted that the accusers announced their accusations of Slutsky nearly simultaneously, during the presidential election campaign, and after a significant amount of time – from one to three years – after the supposed incidents took place,” she said.",JustBadNews,0
Woman Dies After Receiving This Gwyneth Paltrow-Approved Treatment,https://www.inverse.com/article/42675-live-bee-acupuncture-woman-dies?utm_campaign=organic&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=inverse,"A 55-year-old Spanish woman has died after receiving an acupuncture treatment that uses live bee stings instead of needles. Researchers are calling the procedure — infamously touted by Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Middleton, and others — “unsafe and unadvisable.”

According to a new study describing the case published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology, the patient had been receiving “apitherapy” treatment every four weeks over a period of two years in order to “improve muscular contractures and stress.”

Though the woman had tolerated her other treatments, this time, she had an adverse reaction to the live bee stings, which caused her to quickly develop wheezing, labored breathing, and loss of consciousness. The apitherapy clinician did not administer adrenaline but did call an ambulance, which took 30 minutes to arrive at the scene. The patient died in a hospital one week later as a result of complications from anaphylaxis.

“In sensitized persons, venom compounds can act as allergens, causing the release of mast-cell mediators and a spectrum of allergic reactions that can range from mild, local swelling to severe systemic reactions, anaphylactic shock, or even death,” the researchers write. “Furthermore, repeated exposure to the allergen was found to carry a greater risk of severe allergic reactions than in the general population.”

Previous studies have warned against using apitherapy for any reason, despite its popularity among alternative medicine circles. A 2015 study published in the journal PLOS One analyzed 145 other studies about bee venom therapy and concluded it could cause a host of deleterious effects including skin inflammation and, in the worst case, death.

“Adverse events related to bee venom therapy are frequent; therefore, practitioners of bee venom therapy should be cautious when applying it in daily clinical practice, and the practitioner’s education and qualifications regarding the use of bee venom therapy should be ensured,” the researchers write.

While apitherapy is extremely dangerous, painful, and potentially fatal, that hasn’t stopped its fans from getting treatments for various ailments. In 2016, Gwyneth Paltrow told the New York Times she’d experimented with it, because of course she did.

“It’s a thousands of years old treatment called apitherapy,” Paltrow said. “People use it to get rid of inflammation and scarring. It’s actually pretty incredible if you research it. But, man, it’s painful.”

Please don’t inject bee venom into your body, no matter what Gwyneth Paltrow says.",JustBadNews,0
"Meredith Plans 1,200 Layoffs & Will Sell Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune And Money",http://deadline.com/2018/03/meredith-plans-1200-layoffs-will-sell-time-sports-illustrated-fortune-and-money-1202351049/,"Meredith Corp., which bought Time Inc. last year for $1.85 billion, has confirmed plans to lay off 1,200 workers by year-end and explore the sale of four key brands as the integration of the two companies continues.

“We have made significant progress executing on these initiatives since we closed on the acquisition just six weeks ago,” said Meredith President and CEO Tom Harty.

Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money are all going on the block, as had been rumored, a move that follows the sale of Time Inc. UK and Golf. That leaves People and Entertainment Weekly as prominent titles staying in the fold at Des Moines, Iowa-based Meredith, whose portfolio includes female-skewing consumer titles like Better Homes and Gardens. Of the brands being shopped, Harty said, “These are attractive properties with strong consumer reach. However, they have different target audiences and advertising bases, and we believe each brand is better suited for success with a new owner. We are pleased with the inbound interest we have received.”

The job losses are primarily in operational and business units and are aimed at achieving up to $500 million in cost savings. About 200 workers have already left, with the remaining 1,000 departing over the next 10 months. Those job losses follow the elimination of 600 positions in subscriptions and fulfillment. As part of the report on what it called its “aggressive execution” of the integration plan, Meredith said it will also launch a brand-centric sales group and strategy next week combining digital, print and other platforms into a single offering for advertisers.",JustBadNews,0

Mueller III, the special counsel, on Wednesday for the continuing investigation into Russia’s 2016 campaign meddling, even as a former C.I.A. director said during a morning news show that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia may have compromising information on Mr. Trump.

After a weekend of attacking Mr. Mueller — against the advice of his own lawyers — Mr. Trump picked up again in early morning tweets when he said he was quoting a former Harvard professor stating that Mr. Mueller should never have been appointed to be the special counsel to investigate Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. That investigation has expanded into inquiries into Mr. Trump’s aides and his own business dealings.

Mark Meechan, 30, appeared at Airdrie Sheriff Court on trial for allegedly committing the offence by uploading the footage on to YouTube.

Meechan, from Coatbridge, filmed the video according to him to wind up girlfriend Suzanne Kelly, 29, and turn her dog into the ""least cute thing imaginable"".

And the online comedian says he has received death threats and has failed to land himself a job due to the ongoing court case.

Today, he was found guilty under the Communications Act.

Sheriff Derek O'Carroll said: ""The accused is quite obviously an intelligent and articulate man.

""The accused knew that the material was offensive and knew why it was offensive.

""Despite that the accused made a video containing anti-Semitic content and he would have known it was grossly offensive to many Jewish people.""

Mr O'Carroll did not believe Meechan had made the video to annoy his girlfriend and ruled it 'anti-semitic'.

He found Meechan guilty of a charge under the Communications Act that he posted a video on social media and YouTube which was grossly offensive and aggravated by religious prejudice.

Meechan had earlier told the court he only ever intended the video to be seen by a small group of friends on his account and insisted he still found it funny.

Sentencing has been deferred until April 23.

3 The video was watched by millions

Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson arrived at Airdrie Sheriff Court to show his support for Meechan - even interviewing him outside Sheriff Court during a recess in the trial.

The outspoken political activist told his Facebook followers on Monday that he would be heading to Airdrie over the ""joke"" because it was a ""free speech issue"".

He said: ""There’s a court case in Scotland where a character made a joke with his dog and he’s been prosecuted.

""He’s in court tomorrow. This is a huge free speech issue and the shut down of people’s ability to even have humour now.

""That’s the current state of affairs in Britain.""

U.S. loses bid to halt children's climate change lawsuit,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-climatechange-lawsuit/u-s-loses-bid-to-halt-childrens-climate-change-lawsuit-idUSKCN1GJ2UO,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected the U.S. government’s bid to halt a lawsuit by young people claiming that President Donald Trump and his administration are violating their constitutional rights by ignoring the harms caused by climate change.

By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the administration had not met the “high bar” under federal law to dismiss the Oregon lawsuit, which was originally brought in 2015 against the administration of President Barack Obama.

The potentially far-reaching case is one of a handful seeking to have courts address global warming and its causes.

Twenty-one plaintiffs, now aged 10 to 21, accused federal officials and oil industry executives of knowing for decades that carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels destabilise the climate, but refusing to do anything about it.

They said this has deprived them of their due process rights to life, liberty and property, including to live in a habitable climate.

U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken in Eugene, Oregon in November 2016 refused to dismiss the lawsuit, saying a quick dismissal without addressing the merits could sanction the government’s alleged “knowing decision to poison the air.”

In seeking to overturn that ruling, the government said letting the case proceed could lead to burdensome litigation, and provoke a “constitutional crisis” by pitting courts against Trump and the many other Executive Branch officials named as defendants.

But in Wednesday’s decision, Chief Judge Sidney Thomas said the dismissal request was premature, and deciding whether the plaintiffs’ claims were too broad could be addressed through the normal legal process.

“Litigation burdens are part of our legal system, and the defendants still have the usual remedies before the district court for nonmeritorious litigation,” Thomas wrote. “C1aims and remedies often are vastly narrowed as litigation proceeds; we have no reason to assume this case will be any different.”

The U.S. Department of Justice, which handled the government appeal, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Julia Olson, who represented the plaintiffs and is executive director of Our Children’s Trust, which advocates for improving the climate, in an interview welcomed the decision.

“It’s very exciting,” she said. “It will be the first time that climate science and the federal government’s role in creating its dangers will go on trial in a U.S. court.”

The lawsuit was returned to Aiken for further proceedings.",JustBadNews,0
Israeli town halts sale of new home plots as more than 50% of buyers are Arab citizens,https://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/9434,"Adalah: Kfar Vradim's racist move, aimed to keep Arab citizens out and ""preserve town's Zionist-Jewish-secular character,"" tramples most basic tenets of democracy.

A Jewish town in the Galilee region of northern Israel has canceled the sale of land for new home construction in the community after it became clear that more than 50 percent of those purchasing the plots were Arab citizens.

Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel issued a statement this morning, 18 March 2018, condemning the racist actions of Kfar Vradim's council leader.

According to a report published today in Haaretz [Hebrew], Kfar Vradim local council leader Sivan Yehiel canceled the town's land tenders and informed residents that he is ""trusted with preserving the Zionist-Jewish-secular character of Kfar Vradim… [and that I have decided] to bring to the relevant government ministries our demand to create solutions that will enable the preservation of demographic balances.""

Yehiel also promised in his statement to residents, according to Haaretz, that he would not sell any more land plots in the town ""until we find a worthy solution that will ensure our ability to preserve the community life and character of Kfar Vradim as it is today.""

Adalah strongly condemned Yehiel's actions:

""The words and actions of Kfar Vradim's local council leader are motivated by racism. To prevent Arab citizens of Israel from purchasing homes due strictly to their national identity is an illegitimate act and stands in absolute contradiction to the principles of equality to which the local council is obligated. The Israel Land Authority must make it utterly clear to the local council leader that his statements are patently unacceptable and that he must refrain from all interference in land tenders.

""In a climate in which the Israeli Knesset continues to promote racist legislation targeting Arab citizens, Kfar Vradim's council leader feels emboldened to promote racist policies and to trample the most basic of democratic principles. Successive Israeli governments have confiscated lands from Arab citizens and intentionally prevented the development of Arab communities. This racism continues today via resident selection practices and the exclusion of Arab citizens of Israel.""

No bump stocks turned in to Denver police after ban,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/front-range/denver/no-bump-stocks-turned-in-to-denver-police-after-ban,"DENVER (AP) — No bump stocks have been turned over to Denver authorities after the city banned the accessories used in last year’s mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and injured hundreds.

Denver Police police last month invited city residents to turn in any bump stocks in their possession but Denverite reports that none have been handed over.

The ban on bump stocks approved by the city council in January was considered largely symbolic. Denver had previously banned the types of semi-automatic rifles that can be modified with bump stocks.

The council also made it illegal in most situations to possess magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition.

Fines, possible jail time for not turning them in

While the ban on bump stocks is largely symbolic, Denver police do say not turning them in could incur a fine between $100 and $999 or be subjected to spend between 10 to 180 days in jail.

The department defines bump stocks as “any device for a pistol, rifle, or shotgun that increases the rate of fire achievable with such weapon by using energy from the recoil of the weapon to generate a reciprocating action that facilitates repeated activation of the trigger.”",JustBadNews,0

Police have been accused of 'victim blaming' the children who were abused by grooming gangs in Telford.

Officers investigating the Telford sex abuse scandal, in which some of the victims were just 11, were reportedly sent an internal message saying 'in most cases the sex is consensual'.

Child abuse lawyer Dino Nocivelli slammed West Mercia Police for the way they investigated the case.

It comes after Telford's police chief said that the number and scale of girls sexually abused there had been 'sensationalised'.

Mr Nocivelli, of Bolt Burdon Kemp, told the Daily Mirror: 'The authorities just don't seem to get it. Children cannot agree to sex.

'Just because a child is not being physically forced to carry out sexual acts, it doesn't mean they consented.

'Many of these children will have been groomed and manipulated by their abusers and would have been threatened to keep silent. How can you say an 11-year-old is capable of consenting to sex with a 40-year-old? This is rape.'

Yesterday, West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding has 'significantly disputed' claims that 1,000-plus children may have been groomed over four decades in the Shropshire town.

He said: 'I don't believe Telford is any worse than lots of places across England and Wales'.

It came as Theresa May told the Commons has said it is important that an inquiry into child sexual exploitation (CSE) in Telford gets under way as quickly as possible.

The Prime Minister said 'we have all been shocked' by the 'horrific' case, and said she was pleased that an inquiry would happen.

Becky Watson suffered two years of sex abuse at the hands of a grooming gang, which began when she was 11 and she died in a car incident when she was 13. Vicky Round (right), a friend of Becky's, was abused by the same gang. She was just 20 when she died of a suspected overdose.

West Mercia Police has said that tackling child sexual exploitation remained its 'number one priority' for officers in Telford, whose approach had been 'subject to independent scrutiny' from the Home Office last year.

But Mr Harding, Superintendent for Telford and Wrekin, today disputed the scale of abuse.

He told the BBC: 'I am confident that, in the main, we do know the scale of CSE. Therefore, I significantly dispute the 1,000 plus figure and do feel it is sensationalised.

'Read the headlines, read the reports. What are they actually discussing? They're discussing cases from 20 or 30 years ago, offending back in the 1990s.

'We've never said there aren't cases, there are always cases we are working on and seeking to prosecute.'

It is feared there are still 46 girls in Telford at risk from grooming gangs.

In Telford brutal sex gang targeted the innocent girls over a 40-year period in what may be Britain's 'worst ever' child abuse scandal.

Lucy Lowe was 16 and pregnant with her second child when she was murdered alongside her sister Sarah, 17, and their mother Eileen, 49, in a house fire in Telford set by Lucy's boyfriend, Azhar Ali Mehmood

Girls in the town of Telford in Shropshire were drugged, beaten and raped at the hands of the violent groom gang which was active since the 1980s.

Three people were murdered and two others died following incidents linked to the sickening scandal.

Lucy Lowe, 16, died alongside her mother and sister after the man who had been abusing her, 26-year-old Azhar Ali Mehmood, set fire to their house.

The taxi-driver first targeted Lucy in 1997. She gave birth to his child when she was just 14.

Mehmood was jailed for murdering Lucy, her mother Eileen and her sister Sarah, 17.

However, he was never arrested or charged with any sex abuse crimes over his involvement with the young girl.

Becky Watson, 13, was killed after a car she was in crashed. At the time the incident was reported as a 'prank'.

However, it was revealed she had suffered two years of sex abuse at the hands of a grooming gang, which began when she was 11.

Vicky Round, a friend of Becky's, was abused by the same gang.

They forced her into a crack cocaine addiction aged 12. By the age of 14 she was taking heroine regularly.

She died aged 20 after a suspected drug overdose.

Azhar Ali Mehmood was later jailed for life after being convicted of three counts of murder – but was never arrested or charged over sex abuse

Mubarek Ali, 34, (left) and his brother Ahdel Ali, 27, (right) from Telford were both jailed after sexually abusing young girls in a child sex abuse ring

A victim of a grooming gang in Telford told yesterday how she endured a 'whirlwind of rape' on a daily basis, as police, youth workers and medical staff apparently ignored tell-tale signs of her ordeal.

The woman, calling herself 'Holly', suffered four years of abuse as the ring sold her 'countless times' for sex.

Holly said she only escaped the cycle of abuse by leaving her home in the Shropshire town – where up to 1,000 children may have been abused over four decades – to live in hiding 40 miles away.

Seven members of the gang were eventually jailed in 2013 after a police investigation.

But detectives said at the time that up to 200 men from across the country had been involved in the ring – with a 'huge percentage of them' unidentified.

According to Home Office figures, Telford, a town of 170,000 people, has the third highest number of child sexual offences recorded in the UK, after Blackpool and Rotherham.

Holly told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I was abused from the ages of 14 to 18. My abuse started with boys my own age, who went on to sell my phone number to older men.

'And from there it was just a whirlwind of rape every day, basically. I was going into the doctor's and the youth sexual health clinic to get the morning-after pill, probably twice a week, and nobody even questioned anything.

'I had two abortions, still nothing was said to me. I was in cars that were stopped by the police and they asked me no questions of why I was there with a much older man...

'It got to the point where I tried to commit suicide, and still nobody asked me any questions about what was going on in my life and why I was reacting the way I was reacting.'

Holly was interviewed by police during the inquiry, known as Operation Chalice, which resulted in the 2013 prison sentences, but in the end decided she could not face her abusers in court.

She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire she was taken to a 'rape house which was set up for the purpose of young girls being sold to men'. But the worst thing that ever happened to her during the cycle of abuse was when she was gang raped after turning 16.

She recalled: 'After that I tried to commit suicide. I genuinely wanted to die because I thought it was the only way out.'

Holly appeared to make a reference to the August 2000 murder of 16-year-old Lucy Lowe, who died in a house fire set by her 26-year-old boyfriend, and who has now been linked to the grooming epidemic.

'The only reason I kept going back [to the men] was because they were threatening me with burning my house down, which was a real threat in Telford because it had happened previously,' Holly said. 'They would [also] say to me that they would rape my mum and my sisters.'

In a U-turn yesterday, Labour-run Telford and Wrekin Council called on Home Secretary Amber Rudd to commission a public inquiry into cases of child sexual exploitation in the town.

The council, which said it has 'nothing to hide' over its handling of cases of grooming and sexual abuse of children in the town, previously insisted that the issue could be examined as part of the national ongoing Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse.

During PMQs, Tory Telford MP Lucy Allan said: 'Like many towns and cities across the country, Telford has had some experiences of distressing cases of child sexual exploitation.

'The authorities in Telford have now agreed to conduct an independent inquiry to find out what happened and to give victims answers'.",JustBadNews,0
"China to bar people with bad 'social credit' from planes, trains: People who would be put on restricted lists included those found to have committed acts like spreading false information about terrorism and causing trouble on flights, as well as those who used expired tickets or smoked on trains.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-credit/china-to-bar-people-with-bad-social-credit-from-planes-trains-idUSKCN1GS10S,"Passengers wait to board trains ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year, at Nanjing Railway Station in Jiangsu province, China January 31, 2018. China Daily via REUTERS

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China said it will begin applying its so-called social credit system to flights and trains and stop people who have committed misdeeds from taking such transport for up to a year.

People who would be put on the restricted lists included those found to have committed acts like spreading false information about terrorism and causing trouble on flights, as well as those who used expired tickets or smoked on trains, according to two statements issued on the National Development and Reform Commission’s website on Friday.

Those found to have committed financial wrongdoings, such as employers who failed to pay social insurance or people who have failed to pay fines, would also face these restrictions, said the statements which were dated March 2.

It added that the rules would come into effect on May 1.

The move is in line with President’s Xi Jinping’s plan to construct a social credit system based on the principle of “once untrustworthy, always restricted”, said one of the notices which was signed by eight ministries, including the country’s aviation regulator and the Supreme People’s Court.

China has flagged plans to roll out a system that will allow government bodies to share information on its citizens’ trustworthiness and issue penalties based on a so-called social credit score.

However, there are signs that the use of social credit scoring on domestic transport could have started years ago. In early 2017, the country’s Supreme People’s Court said during a press conference that 6.15 million Chinese citizens had been banned from taking flights for social misdeeds.",JustBadNews,0
Taiwanese women exploited by American MMA fighter's porn videos,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3383468,"Update 03/16/2018:

As of 12:50 p.m. Taipei time, Schulte has taken down all of the pornographic videos from his PornHub account.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese women are among the 36 Asian women who have unwittingly appeared in the online pornographic videos of an American mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter and self-proclaimed ""pick-up artist.""

A Taiwanese woman yesterday on the Facebook group Breaking News Commune (爆料公社) posted a warning that a 32-year-old American MMA fighter named Jaymes Schulte has been secretly filming one-night-stands with Taiwanese women and posting them on a porn website for profit. It is not clear whether she was also a victim of these alleged unauthorized videos.

She also said the names and descriptions of the videos contain obscene and degrading language and she fears many Taiwanese women have been victimized. She reminded any women that come in contact with him to be extremely cautious and if they discover they have been included in any of his videos online, they should contact the authorities immediately.

According to his numerous social media accounts, Schulte is an American professional MMA fighter and he claims to be a ""Pick Up Artist"" who enjoys shooting ""travel porn videos."" On the adult video website PornHub, Schulte has an account titled ""TravelPorn,"" with over 3,000 subscribers and 800,000 views, which contains videos of at least 36 Asian women performing sexual acts with him.

In one Instagram post, Schulte says that he was accused of rape by a Japanese tourist in Hawaii, and was held for a day in jail. However, he claims that after police saw the sex video he shot of him having consensual sex with the woman, the charges were dropped.

On his PornHub page, he charges US$10 for individual sex videos and US$250 for a lifetime membership and lists PayPal and bitcoin as methods of payment.

Also on the page, Schulte says that he has sex with over 100 women a year, whom he claims he has met through his pick up artist tactics. He offers viewers a US$250 fee for lessons.

From his Instagram, it is evident that in addition to Taiwan, he has also recently traveled to Mexico, Indonesia, Hawaii, Guam, Thailand, Japan, Shanghai, Beijing. In each location, he can be seen posing with young Asian women he has apparently met in those locales.

On Tuesday (March 13), he announced on Facebook that he has encountered financial difficulties and decided to sell his sex tapes so that he can save about US$5,000 and return to Asia.

Schulte, who goes by the MMA fighting nickname the ""Underdog,"" has a less than impressive professional fight record of 2 wins and 4 losses, with both wins coming from fighters with losing records.

UN: All of Syria's Warring Parties Violating International Humanitarian Law,https://www.voanews.com/a/un-syrias-warring-parties-violating-international-law/4296508.html,"GENEVA - The U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria is condemning the flagrant violation of International Humanitarian Law by all of Syria's warring parties and calls for them to be held accountable for their crimes. The commission has presented its latest report to the U.N. Human Rights Council.



Seven years into the Syrian conflict, the killing goes on with no end in sight. Commission Chair Paulo Pinheiro told the Human Rights Council the killing fields have never gone away. They have just moved.



He said now it is the turn of eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus with nearly 400,000 residents, that is under siege and being subjected to deliberate starvation and relentless bombardments.



Before, he said, it was eastern Aleppo City, Raqqa, Deir el-Zour, and Madaya that dominated the headlines as civilians were denied humanitarian assistance and killed and maimed from indiscriminate attacks.



""This recent resurgence of violence perpetuates the illusion that the solution to the conflict will come through a military victory,"" he said. ""This illusion has been fueled by the unwillingness of influential states to enforce discipline on the warring parties and demand their serious engagement in finding a sustainable political solution.""



Pinheiro is calling for an immediate end to intentional and indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations and for the delivery of food, water, medicine and other critical aid to besieged and hard-to-reach areas, especially to the suffering population in eastern Ghouta.



Pinheiro said only a political solution will end the conflict. But he warns there must be no amnesties or pardon for those responsible for gross human rights violations, war crimes or crimes against humanity in any agreement that emerges.



In his response, Syrian Ambassador Hussam Edin Aala refuted the accusations in the report, saying they were based on false sources and on sources related to terrorist organizations, such as the White Helmets, a volunteer civilian rescue group.",JustBadNews,0
The CIA's new nominee director Gina Haspel once ran a torture site and destroyed evidence,https://qz.com/1227879/who-is-gina-haspel-the-first-woman-nominated-to-run-the-cia-destroyed-evidence-of-us-torture/,"This story has been updated.

As CIA director Mike Pompeo moves to become the United States’ secretary of state, deputy director Gina Haspel has been nominated to lead the agency. If confirmed by the Senate, she will become the first woman to run the CIA.

Haspel’s nomination will be controversial; she played a leading role (paywall) in running a US torture site abroad and later destroyed the evidence of it.

In 2002, she oversaw a secret prison in Thailand that had tortured two terrorism suspects. That torture took place within the CIA’s “extraordinary rendition” program, in which suspected terrorists are sent to US allies, and interrogated in “black sites” on their soil.

One of the men, known as Abu Zubayda, was waterboarded 83 times in one month and was slammed into walls by the head. He was deprived of sleep and kept in a coffin-like box. Interrogators later decided he didn’t have any useful information.

Updated March 15, 7:35pm: Haspel took charge of the prison after Zubaydah’s ordeal ended in August, according to a new report by ProPublica, and she did not oversee his interrogation. According to the New York Times, Haspel’s tenure in Thailand began in late Oct. 2002 and ended in December, during which time another detainee was reportedly waterboarded three times.

CIA videos of the torture were destroyed in 2005, on the orders of a cable drafted by Haspel. Her then-boss Jose Rodriguez, the CIA’s director of operations for counterterrorism, signed off on the order. “The cable left nothing to chance. It even told them how to get rid of the tapes,” he wrote in his memoir, according to ProPublica. “They were to use an industrial-strength shredder to do the deed.”

The European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, a Berlin-based NGO, has been pushing Germany’s public prosecutor to arrest Haspel for her alleged role in the torture program.

She is not the only member of the administration with a questionable record on the matter: Trump himself has publicly flirted with the idea of the US returning to the use of torture, claiming that waterboarding “works.” He was reportedly persuaded by defense secretary Jim Mattis that the method is an ineffective intelligence tool.

New secretary of state Mike Pompeo has also defended US torture. In 2014, when senator Dianne Feinstein, then chair of Senate Intelligence Committee, released a comprehensive condemnation of the CIA’s torture program, Pompeo attacked the report, saying, “Senator Feinstein today has put American lives at risk,” and described agents who had tortured people as “heroes, not pawns in some liberal game.”",JustBadNews,0
"Britain's 'worst ever' child grooming scandal exposed: Hundreds of young girls raped, beaten, sold for sex and some even killed: Authorities failed to act over 40 years - despite repeated warnings to social workers - with up to 1,000 girls, some as young as 11, abused in Telford.",http://mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britains-worst-ever-child-grooming-12165527,"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbiz Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email

Up to 1,000 children could have suffered in Britain’s worst known abuse scandal - where sex gangs targeted girls as young as 11.

The rape hell of vulnerable young girls in one town - Telford - went on for a shocking 40 years, the Sunday Mirror can reveal.

As many as 1,000 children could have suffered at the merciless hands of perverts and torturers in Telford since the 1980s.

Girls as young as 11 have been lured from their families to be drugged, beaten and raped in an epidemic that, say victims, is still ongoing.

THREE people were murdered and two others died in tragedies linked to the scandal.

Despite similar high-profile cases in Rochdale and Rotherham, authorities in Telford ­repeatedly failed to stamp out a network of abusers.

The Mirror’s 18-month investigation reveals abuse on unprecedented levels. We found:

Social workers knew of abuse in the 1990s but police took a decade to launch a probe

Council staff viewed abused and trafficked children as “prostitutes” instead of victims, according to previously unseen files

Authorities failed to keep details of abusers from Asian communities for fear of “racism”

Police failed to investigate one recent case five times until an MP intervened

One victim said cops tried to stop her finding out why her abusers had not been prosecuted because they feared she would talk to us

The scale of the abuse uncovered in Telford – population 170,000 – is feared to be the most brutal and long-running of all.

The Rotherham toll was put at 1,500 – but that was in a community of 260,000.

Telford’s Tory MP Lucy Allan has demanded a public inquiry and said our ­findings were “extremely serious and shocking”.

If you or someone you know has been affected by the abuse in Telford, please contact the Sunday Mirror: geraldine.mckelvie@sundaymirror.co.uk

She said: “There must now be an independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Telford so that our community can have absolute ­confidence in the authorities.”

Specialist child abuse solicitor Dino Nocivelli, of Bolt Burdon Kemp, said: “These children were treated as sexual commodities by men who inflicted despicable acts of abuse.

""The survivors deserve an inquiry. They need to know how abuse took place for so long and why so many perpetrators have never been brought to justice.”

Our investigators have spoken to 12 victims, most of them unconnected.

They accused more than 70 abusers and claimed that violent rapes were still taking place just months ago.

One 14-year-old, groomed and abused after her phone number was sold to paedophiles, said: “I hated what was happening and my abusers made my skin crawl but I was told that if I said a word to anyone they’d come for my little sisters and tell my mum I was a prostitute.

“Night after night, I was forced to have sex with multiple men in disgusting takeaways and filthy houses.

""I must have been getting the morning after pill from a local clinic at least twice a week but no one asked any questions.

“I fell pregnant twice and had two abortions. Hours after my second termination, I was taken by one of my abusers to be raped by more men.

""The worst moment came just after my 16th birthday when I was drugged and gang raped by five men.

""Days later, the ringleader turned up at my house and told me he’d burn it down if I breathed a word of what had happened.”

Documents which will be passed to the Home Office reveals authorities knew of the horrors a decade before investigating – and shows how they tried to hamper our probe.

We presented our findings to Professor Liz Kelly, from the Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit at London Metropolitan University.

She helped estimate the number of victims based on figures gathered by our investigators.

Prof Kelly said: “We are acting as if we didn’t know about child sex abuse rings. We have an unfortunate capacity to choose to forget.”

Sheila Taylor, of the NWG Network, worked on the Rotherham Inquiry. She said the true scale of the Telford problem might never be known because many victims were unlikely to come forward.

She said: “There is probably a whole cohort of young people that are not identified.

""We are good at identifying white girls but are less able to ­identify young men, young people from ethnic minority backgrounds, from travelling communities, or with learning or other ­disabilities.”

A police investigation called ­Operation Chalice identified more than 100 potential victims abused between 2007 and 2009.

Cops also said there could be as many as 200 perpetrators – but just nine were caged and the case was then closed.

Today our investigation reveals the authorities were told of the abuse epidemic more than a decade before Chalice.

Our probe – backed by documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act – found two predatory paedophiles began targeting girls from a local children’s home in 1981.

One of the abusers earned thousands a night for years trafficking girls around the country for sex with hundreds of men, according to one victim.

In another case, a 14-year-old was groomed by an 18-year-old Asian man in 1985.

After she had his baby he passed her to friends to have sex with and allegedly rape her.

The girl, now 47, says she reported her abuse to the council and school but does not believe action was taken.

She says her doctor said she was mentally ill and should take medication.

The vast majority of those targeted were young white girls but teenagers from the Asian community also fell victim.

One report commissioned by local Telford and Wrekin Council in 2013 admitted: “From the late 1990s professionals had concerns about the nature of some of the child sexual abuse cases presented to them.”

But it blamed “understanding and learning at that time” and “existing procedures”.

Two separate investigations were launched at the same time as Operation Chalice after two victims named dozens more abusers.

The victim in one case – groomed at 13, sold for sex and gang raped – said she pulled out of the investigation because she “didn’t feel she was being emotionally supported” by police.

Another victim claims officers discouraged her from pursuing her request for evidence after she told them she was speaking to the Mirror.

Victims: Five dead as abusers' tentacles leave trail of pain and tragedy

A mum and four girls have died in tragedies linked to the abuse.

Lucy Lowe, 16, was killed in 2000 along with her mother and sister after her 26-year-old abuser Azhar Ali Mehmood set fire to their house.

Cabbie Mehmood targeted Lucy in 1997 and she was just 14 when she gave birth to his daughter.

He was jailed for murdering Lucy, her mum Eileen and 17-year-old sister Sarah.

But he was never arrested nor charged in connection with any child sex crimes over his illegal relationship with the schoolgirl.

Lucy’s death was used as a warning to other girls, according to victims. One, drugged and gang raped by nine men two years later, said the threats drove her to attempt suicide.

She said: “I was scared my family would die like Lucy’s. I thought they’d only be safe if I killed myself.”

In 2002, 13-year-old Becky Watson died in a car accident that was reported at the time as a “prank”.

The Mirror investigation found she suffered two years of abuse by an Asian grooming gang which began when she was just 11.

Tragic diaries obtained by the Mirror reveal her torment at being made to “sleep around”.

Her mum Torron Watson said she repeatedly told police that Becky was being abused – and even gave them a list of suspects.

She told the Sunday Mirror: “Girls like Becky were treated like criminals. I was crying out for help but it felt like I had nowhere to turn. If Becky’s abuse had been properly investigated by the authorities more girls could have been saved from going through this hell.”

Vicky Round, a friend of Becky’s, was abused by the same gang who got her hooked on crack cocaine aged 12 and on heroin by 14.

She died aged 20 of a drugs incident and her sister Emma told us: “I have no doubt Vicky would still be here if she hadn’t been so badly abused – yet the people who made her life hell still walk the streets.”

Telford timeline of abuse Early 1980s Vulnerable Telford girls are targeted by groups of mainly Asian men. 1996 A concerned resident claims she tells police about the activities of a key abuser selling underage girls for sex. Late 1990s Files reveal social workers learn of the problem but do little to help. 2000 Lucy Lowe, 16, is killed alongside her mum and sister in an arson attack by abuser Azhar Ali Mehmood, who made her pregnant at 14. 2002 Abuse victim Becky Watson, 13, is killed in a road accident described as a “prank”. 2009 Becky’s friend Vicky Round dies in a drugs-related incident after enduring nine years of sex hell at the hands of a string of paedophiles. 2010-2012 Police probe dubbed Operation Chalice identifies a potential 200 abusers but only nine are jailed. Two further probes collapse. August 2016 The Sunday Mirror reports that the problem is continuing outside underage discos in the town but some complaints provided by volunteer street pastors are not properly logged. September 2016 MP Lucy Allan calls for a public inquiry but police and council officials in Telford write to Home Secretary Amber Rudd saying this isn’t necessary. March 2018 The Sunday Mirror reveals there could be up to 1,000 victims of the scandal and links five deaths to the abuse.

Response: These horrific crimes are a No.1 priority say police and council

(Image: Warwickshire Police)

Police and local authority chiefs yesterday said all reports of child sex exploitation were taken “extremely seriously”.

Martin Evans, Assistant Chief Constable for West Mercia Police, said: “We are aware of the information you have provided.

“Tackling such horrific offences is the number one priority for police in Telford and we have not only increased officer numbers to tackle this type of offending, but use all of our resources and technology available to prosecute anyone who sexually offends against children whether that offending took place today, yesterday or decades ago.

“Operation Chalice in 2013 was one of the first national complex critical investigations into grooming offences. It centred on historic offending in Telford and Wrekin and ultimately resulted in seven men jailed for a total of 49 years.

“Over the subsequent years we have continuously focused on this area, whilst working very closely with our communities to ensure there is confidence to report issues people become aware of. Last year officials from the Home Office paid thanks to the commitment of staff working to protect young people at risk from sexual exploitation.”

A spokesperson for Telford and Wrekin Council said yesterday: “Child sexual exploitation (CSE) is a vile, evil crime. It’s an issue right across the UK and has been for a long time.

“Telford will be covered by the national CSE review. We welcome this. All agencies continue to work very closely together and this remains our top priority.

“Our approach to CSE is now very different from 10-20 years ago. We have learned lots of lessons and are constantly on the lookout for indicators of CSE so that we can pass information on to police and bring these evil criminals to justice. Indeed, further cases are now coming to court.”

An OFSTED inspection into Telford’s child services in 2016 said: “Work with children and young people at risk of sexual exploitation is very strong... work to protect children who go missing from home or care is thorough and improving.”",JustBadNews,0
"Russian Military Cargo Plane Crashes, Killing 39 on Board",https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/dozens-killed-after-russian-cargo-plane-crashes-in-syria-1.5883294,"A Russian military transport plane crashed in Syria on Tuesday, killing all 39 people on board, Russian news agencies quoted the defense ministry as saying, sharply raising the death toll from the Kremlin's intervention in the Syrian war.

President Vladimir Putin, who is running for re-election later this month, declared in December that the Russian mission in Syria was largely completed, but casualties continue to mount.

The defense ministry was cited as saying that the plane, a Soviet-designed An-26, crashed at Russia's Hmeymim air base in Latakia Province and that initial information suggested the incident may have been caused by a technical fault.

""According to the latest updates, the An-26 transport aircraft, which crashed while landing at Hmeymim airbase, was carrying 33 passengers and six crew. All of them were members of the Russian Armed Forces,"" Interfax news agency quoted the defense ministry as saying.

""The crew and the passengers were killed.""

Originally, Russian news agencies cited the defense ministry as saying that 32 passengers and crew were killed in the crash, but this was later revised.

Russian state TV cited military officials as saying the aircraft had not been brought down by enemy fire. It said the crash happened as the plane came into land at Hmeymim, and that it came down around 500 metres (550 yards) short of the runway.

Putin, on an election campaign stop in the Ural mountains, was briefed on the crash via telephone by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and expressed his condolences to the relatives and colleagues of those killed, the Kremlin said.

Costly campaign

Russia's armed intervention in Syria turned the tide of the conflict in favour of Putin's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It has been portrayed inside Russia as a display of Russia's resurgent military might.

It has, though, come at a cost.

According to a Reuters tally based on official announcements before Tuesday's crash, 44 Russian service personnel have died in Syria since the operation started in September 2015.

In one incident last month, Syrian rebels shot down a Russian warplane. The pilot ejected and died on the ground in a gunfight with rebels.

In addition to those deaths, in December 2016 a plane carrying a Russian military orchestra to Syria crashed in the Black Sea, killing all 92 people on board.

Under a decree signed by Putin, the Russian authorities do not have to disclose all deaths of service personnel in Syria because they are classified as a state secret.

The official toll does not include private military contractors who, according to people familiar with the deployment, are in Syria fighting in support of the Russian operation. Moscow denies they exist.

About 300 men working for a Kremlin-linked Russian private military firm were either killed or wounded in Syria last month when their column was attacked by U.S.-led coalition forces, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

Russian officials said a handful of Russian citizens may have been killed in that incident, but said they were not members of Russia's armed forces.

Opinion polls indicate most Russians support the Syria operation. But Dmitry Gudkov, a former member of parliament and a member of the anti-Putin opposition, said the Kremlin had questions to answer about the campaign.

""How does the draw-down of forces look now? For the sake of what are these people dying? When will this senseless war end?"" Gudkov said in a social media post.",JustBadNews,0

State Dept. denies US has suspended high-level dialogue with Poland,"http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/352687,State-Dept-denies-US-has-suspended-highlevel-dialogue-with-Poland","The US State Department has denied that America has suspended security cooperation or high-level dialogue with Poland over a contested Polish law on Holocaust responsibility.

“The reports that allege any kind of a suspension in security cooperation or high-level dialogue – all of that is simply false,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Tuesday.

She said that America’s “security posture, as it pertains to our ally, Poland, is not changing. People are trying to find distance or space between our longstanding relationship, and there is no space there.”

Nauert added: ""Poland is a close NATO ally. That will remain; that hasn’t changed.""

Nauert was asked by reporters to respond to a report that America has decided the US president and vice president will not meet top Polish leaders until Warsaw amends a contested law on Holocaust responsibility.

The onet.pl news website has reported that Polish leaders have unofficially been designated ""persona non grata"" in the White House over an anti-defamation law that came into force in Poland on March 1.

The website added that the United States was threatening to block the financing of joint military projects.

Senior Polish official Jacek Sasin, who heads the government’s Standing Committee, said that the onet.pl report was designed to deliver “a blow to the Polish government and [as] an attempt to cause great anxiety in Polish society, because we highly value good relations with the United States -- this is a guarantee of our security.”

Sasin added: “This shows what kind of informational war is being waged at the moment against the Polish government.”

The onet.pl website is controlled by the German-Swiss group Ringier Axel Springer.

Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Bartosz Cichocki has responded to the onet.pl report by saying: “It's not true. There was no ultimatum of this kind.”

Despite pressure from the United States and Israel, Polish President Andrzej Duda last month signed the new law, which could impose a jail term on anyone who accuses Poland of being complicit in Nazi German crimes.

In Poland, the new rules are seen as a way of fighting the use of the phrase “Polish death camps,” which many say implies the country's involvement in the Holocaust during World War II.

U.S. trade deficit jumps to more than nine-year high,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-trade-deficit-jumps-to-more-than-nine-year-high-idUSKCN1GJ1W0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit increased to a more than nine-year high in January, with the shortfall with China widening sharply, suggesting that President Donald Trump’s “America First” trade policies aimed at eradicating the deficit will likely fail.

The trade gap continues to widen a year into the Trump presidency. Trump, who claims that the United States is being taken advantage of by its trading partners, has imposed tariffs on imports of some goods and threatened punitive measures on others to shield domestic industries from competition. The protectionist measures have sparked fears of a trade war.

“Trump’s economics team is trying to turn back the clock on trade, but we doubt they will succeed as they are interfering with the business decisions made by thousands of American companies over the years,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “This is a trade war with ourselves.”

The United States has been running trade deficits for decades, with the trend worsening over the last 30 years as companies shifted manufacturing to countries like China.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the trade deficit jumped 5.0 percent to $56.6 billion. That was the highest level since October 2008 and exceeded economists’ expectations of an increase to $55.1 billion. Part of the rise in the trade gap in January reflected higher commodity prices.

The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China surged 16.7 percent to $36.0 billion, the highest since September 2015. The deficit with Canada soared 65 percent to a three-year high of $3.6 billion. China and Canada are the United States’ top trading partners.

Trump in late January imposed broad tariffs on imported solar panels and large washing machines. Last week, Trump announced he would slap import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum to protect domestic producers.

While these actions may prove politically popular with Trump’s working class political base, especially in states hard-hit by factory closures and import competition, analysts warn they could undercut economic growth.

There are fears that the tariffs could jeopardize talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) linking Canada, Mexico and the United States. Trump ordered a renegotiation of the trade pact to offer terms more favorable to Washington.

Worries of a trade war were heightened on Tuesday by the resignation of Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic advisor, spooking financial markets. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower while prices for U.S. government bonds rose, attracting safe-haven bids. The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies.

FULL EMPLOYMENT

Trump’s “America First” trade policies are part of an attempt to boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustainable basis. The government in January slashed corporate and individual income taxes.

But with the economy almost at full employment, the increase in demand spurred by the $1.5 trillion tax package will probably be satisfied with imports, further worsening the trade deficit.

The economy’s strong fundamentals were underscored by a separate report on Wednesday from ADP Research Institute showing private employers added 235,000 jobs in February.

The report, which is jointly developed with Moody’s Analytics, was published ahead of the government’s more comprehensive employment data on Friday.

According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 200,000 jobs last month, matching January’s gains. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.0 percent, which would be the lowest level since December 2000.

The surge in the January trade deficit was flagged by an advance goods trade deficit report last week. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit increased to $69.7 billion from $68.5 billion in December.

The so-called real trade deficit is above the fourth-quarter average of $66.8 billion. This suggests trade would subtract from first-quarter gross domestic product unless the deficit shrinks in February and March. Trade sliced 1.13 percentage points from fourth-quarter GDP growth.

“Strong growth in U.S. domestic demand should continue to pull in non-petroleum imports going forward,” said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Net exports likely will exert another significant drag on overall GDP growth in the first quarter.”

The economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 2.0 percent pace.

In January, exports fell 1.3 percent to $200.9 billion, weighed down by a $1.8 billion drop in civilian aircraft. Crude oil exports also declined. But exports of consumer goods rose to a record high and those of motor vehicles, parts and engines were the highest since July 2014.

Exports to China tumbled 28.1 percent. Imports were unchanged at $257.5 billion in January amid a $1.3 billion drop in cellphone imports as well as a $0.9 billion decrease in civilian aircraft. Crude oil imports increased by $2.2 billion, reflecting higher prices. Imports from China rose 2.9 percent.

A third report from the Labor Department showed worker productivity flat in the fourth quarter instead of declining at a 0.1 percent rate as reported last month. Sluggish productivity could make it difficult for the Trump administration to achieve its 3 percent growth target.

Almost one-fifth of Europe's wood beetles are at risk of extinction due to widespread decline in ancient trees...demise could have devastating knock-on effects for other species. Study says 18% of saproxylic beetles now exist on conservation plane between ?vulnerable? and ?critically endangered?.,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/05/a-fifth-of-europes-wood-beetles-at-risk-of-extinction-as-ancient-trees-decline,"Almost one-fifth of Europe’s wood beetles are at risk of extinction due to a widespread decline in ancient trees, according to a new report which suggests their demise could have devastating knock-on effects for other species.

The study says 18% of saproxylic beetles – which depend on dead and decaying wood for some of their lifecycle – now exist on a conservation plane between “vulnerable” and “critically endangered”.

Another 13% of the insects are considered “near threatened” and their disappearance could have a disastrous impact on biodiversity and ecosystems, according to the new red list released by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Wood beetles are a key food source for small mammals, bats and for birds such as woodpeckers, nut hatchers and treecreepers. Some species are also pollinators.

Dr Keith Alexander, an ecological consultant who contributed to the report, told the Guardian: “Saproxylic beetles are intimately tied to everything else in the places where they occur. If you start to erode the varieties of life, then the ecosystem heads towards collapse.”

“In western Europe, there are already lots of intensively cultivated places where the fauna is incredibly poor compared to what it should be. We expect that things have started to unravel in these places, which have been simplified by people removing dead wood and changing the habitat’s whole structure.”

Healthy and varied wood beetle populations need large volumes of dead and decaying wood. Some species will only lay their eggs in hollow cavities containing mould that takes hundreds of years to form.

Logging and tree loss is “by far” the greatest menace to their way of life, the IUCN report says. But they also face a staggering array of threats, from urbanisation and tourism to arable farming, pollution and climate change.

One of the most avoidable hazards confronting wood beetles is the rigidity of the EU’s common agricultural policy’s (CAP) payment system, according to Luc Bas, the IUCN’s Europe director.

“It is critical for the CAP to promote the appropriate management of wood pasture habitats containing veteran trees across Europe,” he said.

“Currently, management practices lead to the transformation of wood pastures into either woodland or grassland, destroying the essential vegetation mosaic many saproxylic beetles need.”

The European commission funded the IUCN paper, which assessed 700 species of beetle, and was increasingly engaging with the effects of its CAP policies, Alexander said.",JustBadNews,0

"Australia 'under attack' for 15 years from group of Muslim men, judge tells court","http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-16/australia-under-attack-by-a-group-of-muslim-men,-judge/9453516","Australia has been ""under attack"" from a group of Muslim men wanting ""to kill as many unbelievers as they can"" for about 15 years, a Supreme Court judge has said.

Justice Desmond Fagan made the comments while sentencing Tamim Khaja, 20, who pleaded guilty in October to planning and preparing a terrorist attack two years ago.

The then 18-year-old was arrested while preparing for a lone wolf massacre, either at the US embassy in Sydney, an Army barracks in western Sydney, or at a court complex at Parramatta.

Tamim Khaja pleaded guilty to planning a terror attack in Sydney. ( Facebook )

Counsel for the defendant, Ian Temby QC, tendered to the court a list of recent sentences handed down to other men who had been convicted of terror offences.

In response, Justice Fagan told the court that Australia had ""been under attack for 15 years by about 40 Muslim men, to kill as many unbelievers as they can and impose Sharia law.""

""The ideology that underlies each is Islam.""

Sitting at Sydney West Trial Courts at Parramatta, Justice Fagan referred to verses in the Koran which he said described the duty of ""a Muslim to wage Jihad"".

He said he was not making generalisations about Islamic beliefs and that his courtroom was ""not a forum for the rights and wrongs of the Islam or Christian religions"".

An agreed statement of facts tendered to court revealed that Khaja had twice attempted to travel to Syria or Iraq, where he ""intended to join the Islamic State terrorist organisation and engage in hostile activities"".

After his passport was cancelled in March 2016, Khaja began communicating via an encrypted messaging app with an overseas police officer, who he believed to be an ISIS supporter.

On May 7, 2016, Khaja told the police officer, known as Person A, that he ""wanted so badly to be on the battlefield with my brothers"", but since his passport had been cancelled, he would ""fulfil my obligation here"".

""I am currently sourcing a glock [handgun] but I want to do big damage,"" Khaja told Person A.

""I am thinking more along the lines of Boston Marathon .. I know how to make a portable microwave b..b [sic]""

Even with a handgun I would be able to cause a lot of damage.""

Khaja told person A that he had been considering locations for an attack, including the US Embassy in Sydney, but it was likely to be heavily guarded, court documents revealed.

He told Person A that another option was the Timor Army Barracks in Dundas, where he could ""launch an attack by ramming the lot of them by car and then firing head shots when they are on the ground"".

Tamim Khaja was arrested by police at Parramatta car park on May 17, 2016. ( Supplied: NSW Police )

Mr Temby argued that at the time of the arrest Khaja was only at ""a preliminary stage"" of planning the offence and that he ""had no accomplice"".

However the crown prosecutor said Khaja had accessed documents about bombs and creating suicide vests.

Justice Fagan said Khaja had spoken about ""killing innocent people as many innocent people as he could, like [he was] planning a picnic"".

That data comes from the U.S. Global Forecast System, a computer model of the Earth’s weather and climate. While there’s a chance the model is wrong about the temperature, independent measurements have confirmed that the temperature in the Arctic is around freezing temperatures.

That means the Arctic is now about 50 degrees warmer than it usually is this time of year. It also means Arctic ice is already beginning to melt. This is particularly alarming because the winter months are supposed to be when the Arctic builds ice, and Arctic ice is already at a record low.

So what’s causing the abnormal warming? Scientists believe it’s at least partly due to the lack of Arctic sea ice. January saw one of the lowest ice-building months on record, and the lack of sea ice means the ocean is less insulated from the atmosphere. Without ice, warmer ocean water can heat the atmosphere, leading to the kind of record-breaking warmth seen this past month.

This also suggests that the problem will get exponentially worse, as a lack of sea ice leads to warmer temperatures that prevent the building of more ice. There’s a good chance this month’s record will only last until next winter, and it’s likely this will be one of the last years in which there’s any sea ice in the Arctic oceans at all.

Russia ?Previewed? Plan to Disseminate Emails with Trump Campaign,https://www.justsecurity.org/53241/russians-previewed-plan-disseminate-emails-trump-campaign/,"A significant recent revelation in the Russia investigation has been largely overlooked in the rush of several breaking news stories over the past few days. A nugget of information is contained in the memo written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee (the so-called Schiff Memo), which was released on Saturday morning.

Prior to the memo, we knew that a Russian agent told Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos of “Moscow possessing ‘dirt’” on Hillary Clinton “in the form of ‘thousands of emails,’” according to Papadopoulos’s plea statement. The memo went a legally significant step further. As Rep. Adam Schiff recently told Chris Hayes, “our memo discloses for the first time that the Russians preview to Papadopoulos that they could help with disseminating these stolen emails.” Rep. Schiff added, “When Donald Trump openly called on the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails, they’d be richly rewarded if they released these to the press, his campaign had already been put on notice that the Russians were prepared to do just that and disseminate these stolen emails.” (The full transcript and video clip is below.)

This new revelation is legally important and, if true, could have exposed Papadopoulos and potentially other campaign officials to significant criminal liability. I spoke with several leading experts in campaign finance law and former federal prosecutors to gather their views.

Rep. Schiff’s statement adds clarity to two stray statements in the memo itself. The memo states, “Russian agents previewed their hack and dissemination of stolen emails.” The memo also refers to this part of the record in stating, “We would later learn in Papadopoulos’s plea that that[sic] the information the Russians could assist by anonymously releasing were thousands of Hillary Clinton emails.”

A legally important question is what the Trump campaign did after the Russians previewed that they could help disseminate the stolen emails. If Trump campaign officials consulted with the Russians on their plans to disseminate the emails, it could involve direct violations of campaign finance laws (see the statement below from leading election law expert Paul Seamus Ryan). If Trump campaign officials gave tacit assent or approval or support, it could directly implicate them in the “conspiracy to defraud the United States” by evading the Federal Election Commission—the very conspiracy for which Mueller has already indicted thirteen Russian nationals (see the statement below by former White House official and also top election law expert Bob Bauer). If Papadopoulos intentionally encouraged the Russians and if he was instructed to do so by other campaign officials, they could be liable as accomplices (see statements below from law professors and former federal prosecutors Barbara McQuade and Alex Whiting). The Trump campaign as an organization could also be criminally liable (see statement below from McQuade). Finally, if members of the Trump campaign tried to conceal the facts of a crime (potentially including either the original DNC hack or the dissemination of the stolen emails) they could be guilty of “misprision of a felony” (see statements below by former federal prosecutors including Renato Mariotti).

First, consider how the new revelation might fit into Mueller’s recent conspiracy charges against Russian officials. Bauer wrote to me in an email:

We have learned time after time that we know far less than the special counsel and his team do, and we should be ready to be surprised. But the facts that have come to light suggest that it is wrong to dismiss a legal case based on an electoral alliance between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. It appears that the Russians made a point of secretly advising the campaign that they had stolen emails and were planning to disseminate them, and that the campaign either a) gave tacit assent or approval to the Russian plan, or b) more expressly approved and supported the scheme. Mr. Trump’s public appeal to the Russians to find and release the emails may well look less and less like another norm-busting “Trumpism,” and more like an overt act that, in the context of a wider, private understanding with the Russians, furthered the criminal conspiracy that Mueller alleged in his recent indictment of the thirteen Russian nationals.

Paul Ryan, Vice President of Common Cause, explained how consultation or other communications between Papadopoulos and the Russians on a plan to influence the election through the dissemination of stolen emails could violate federal campaign finance laws:

Federal campaign finance law prohibits a candidate campaign committee from coordinating with a foreign national on any expenditure made by the foreign national for the purpose of influencing a U.S. election. More specifically, federal law treats an expenditure made in coordination with a candidate as a “contribution” to such candidate. Foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions to U.S. candidates, and U.S. candidates are prohibited from receiving contributions from foreign nationals. “Coordinated” is defined in the law to mean “in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of a candidate, his authorized political committee, or their agents.” Papadopoulos was an agent of the Trump campaign. If any Russian made any expenditure to disseminate the stolen emails for the purpose of influencing the 2016 presidential election, and did so in cooperation or consultation with or at the request or suggestion of Papadopoulos, then both the Russian and the Trump campaign violated federal law.

In addition to direct involvement in campaign finance law violations or a conspiracy, Alex Whiting, a professor at Harvard Law School and former federal prosecutor, spelled out in detail the potential case for accomplice liability for Papadopoulos and any other campaign officials who may have given him instructions. The most relevant legal question here turns on whether Papadopoulos intentionally encouraged the Russians once they previewed that they were prepared to disseminate the stolen emails:

Assuming that the dissemination of the stolen Hillary Clinton emails formed part of the conspiracy to defraud the United States that Mueller has already alleged against multiple Russian citizens and entities — on the theory, for example, that such dissemination constituted a foreign national expenditure or financial disbursement for the purpose of influencing federal elections — Papadopoulos could be charged with accomplice liability if at the time he learned of the Russian plan he knowingly and intentionally encouraged them to go forward. Such encouragement could take the form of words or actions. The key piece of information that we have learned is that Papadopoulos learned of the Russian plan before they acted. What we do not yet know, though Mueller presumably knows, is how Papadopoulos reacted to this information. Did he stand mute, or did he push the Russian plan forward? His own liability, and the liability of those who might have been telling Papadopoulos what to do, could turn in part on this question.

What about the subsequent actions of other Trump campaign officials like Donald Trump Jr. and his interactions with the Russians? Whiting explained:

Donald Trump, Jr.’s excitement some weeks later at the prospect of receiving “dirt” on Hillary Clinton certainly suggests a posture of encouragement within the campaign with respect to the actions by the Russians. To the extent we are looking for indications that the campaign aided and abetted the Russian activities through words or actions, the Don, Jr. emails provide a big clue.

Barbara McQuade, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and former federal prosecutor, explained that if Papadopoulos encouraged the Russians efforts to disseminate the stolen emails, he could potentially be liable under aiding and abetting or conspiracy, and so could the campaign itself be criminally liable as an organization:

The language in the FISA application supports a legal theory that, if the facts pan out, Papadopoulos may have aided and abetted or conspired with others to defraud the United States by interfering with the fair administration of our election. Mueller would need to show the Papadopoulos either intentionally helped or encouraged the commission of the crime. The conduct could be imputed to the campaign if Mueller can establish that Papadopoulos was acting in the scope of his employment for the benefit of the campaign.

Bauer has also twice written for Just Security on the potential criminal liability of the Trump campaign as an organization.

Finally, what about the potential crime of helping to conceal the Russians’ felony? Just Security’s Renato Mariotti explained how “misprision of a felony” requires not just knowledge of the underling crime but also that the defendant “actively conceal the commission of a felony.” How might that apply to the revelations in the Schiff memo? A former federal prosecutor told me:

Misprision of a felony may be an especially fruitful avenue in this case if the Russians informed the campaign about their plans to disseminate the stolen emails. We know that Papadopoulos himself lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russians, and that other former campaign officials misled federal authorities about the campaign’s contacts with the Russians. These could add up to a strong case of misprision in having not only failed to notify authorities but more importantly in also having actively concealed important information about the Russians’ involvement in the DNC hack and dissemination of those stolen emails.”

So what do we know about Trump associates’ actions subsequent to the Russians’ previewing their plan to disseminate the stolen emails? Rep. Schiff highlighted the potential connections with Donald Trump’s calling on the Russians to hack and disseminate Clinton’s emails, and Don Trump Jr.’s positive response to being offered dirt on Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” One could add to those instances Don Jr.’s direct communications with WikiLeaks, Roger Stone’s communications with Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks, and the head of Cambridge Analytica reaching out to Wikileaks to help release Clinton emails. There is, of course, also a long series of former Trump campaign officials’ misleading federal authorities about the campaign’s contacts with the Russians, and recent reporting that Hope Hicks allegedly said that Don. Jr. emails “will never get out” in discussions with President Trump about releasing a false statement to cover up the Trump Tower meeting with the Russians.

In short, the new revelation in the Schiff memo adds an important piece to the puzzle, and helps explain why Mueller’s team is asking former campaign associates what they knew about the Russian hack and plans to disseminate stolen emails and when they knew it.

Full text of Rep. Schiff’s remarks on All In with Chris Hayes:

REP. SCHIFF: “It’s also I think significant that our memo discloses for the first time that the Russians previewed to Papadopoulos that they could help with disseminating these stolen emails. So weeks later when Don Jr. goes into that meeting, when he writes back to those offering dirt on Hillary Clinton, he says, ‘If it’s what I think it is, I would love it.’ And we now know and we can talk publicly about that fact that the campaign, at least George Papadopoulos, was aware both that the Russians had these stolen emails and that they were prepared to help with the dissemination of those emails.” HAYES: “That was one of several things that stuck out to me. Can you speak a little bit more about that? We know that there was this sort of cut out figure that was telling him that the Russians had the emails. Tell us, what did they say further about help in disseminating them?” REP. SCHIFF: “Well, unfortunately, I can’t go beyond what the Department of Justice has authorized us to disclose in the memo, but I think it’s the first time the public’s been able to see one of the links here. And that is we knew from the Papadopoulos plea that the Russians had told the Trump campaign very early on in April 2016 that they were in possession of these stolen emails. We now know that the Department of Justice presented to the FISA Court information that the Russians previewed what they would do with this information, their dissemination of it. So when Donald Trump openly called on the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails, they’d be richly rewarded if they released these to the press, his campaign had already been put on notice that the Russians were prepared to do just that and disseminate these stolen emails.”

Greenburgh residents say snail mail is failing them,https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/greenburgh/2018/02/26/snail-mail-fail-greenburgh-residents-making-hundreds-complains-postal-service/372970002/,"Snail mail fail: Greenburgh residents making hundreds of complains about postal service

Richard Liebson | Rockland/Westchester Journal News

GREENBURGH — Almost two years after U.S. Postal Service Chief Operating Officer David Williams assured residents and Supervisor Paul Feiner that delivery service would improve, Feiner said he's receiving ""snail mail"" complaints at a record pace.

""If I had something very important to mail, I wouldn't send it through the U.S. Postal Service because you can't be sure it will be delivered,"" Feiner said. ""We've received hundreds of complaints in the past year — at least five a day.""

The town is one of several, including Larchmont, New Rochelle and others in southern Westchester, that have experienced mail problems over the past year or so. Complaints range from mail being late or delivered to the wrong address to medications, checks and bills not being delivered at all.

GREENBURGH: Mail woes plague town

LARCHMONT: Where's the mail?

SCHUMER: Fix mail issues once and for all

""If people don't get their mail one day, they can live with it. But when you're talking about 4-5 days waiting for medications or tax documents or checks, that's a real problem,"" Feiner said.

Last week, the postal service's Office of the Inspector General confirmed that it was launching an investigation into the spotty haphazard service. In response to Feiner's inquiries about recent problems, Patricia Irons, the postal service's manager for public policy planning and analysis, said the matter has been forwrded to the Inspector General.

The office, she said, ""is responsible for investigating any complaints... including mismanagement.""

Feiner remains skeptical. He said that despite receiving promises from local and regional officials over the past year that postal service was being monitored and improvements were in the works, his office continues to receive a steady flow of emails describing problems.

""It's the number one complaint we get,"" he said. ""We've had problems for several years now, but in the past few months it's been really bad.""

Typical is an email sent by a Hartsdale resident: ""We have gone days without mail, and when I call to ask, several days (worth of deliveries) show up the next day. We have many days where we get no mail at all.""

Another Hartsdale resident wrote that ""I received a call from my medicine provider that my package was returned to them, saying that I no longer resided at our address! Can you imagine my dismay and suprise to hear that? Thank goodness they reshipped it right away.""

""I rely on online orders even more than the average person, "" wrote a disabled Hastings-on-Hudson resident who doesn't drive. Since the fall, she said ""there have been considerably more issues with mail delivery,"" including a failure to deliver medications.

In October, she said, a relative in California sent her a box of fresh fruit via ""priority mail,"" which should have taken two or three days to deliver. Instead, she said, ""a torn box of rotten, sticky, stinking produce"" arrived at her home more than a week after it was shipped.

""People count on the mail service, and it's become very unreliable,"" Feiner said. ""They say they'll investigate, but who knows if they will? I'm going to write to the Post Master General and invite her to come to Greenburgh and meet with some of the people who've had problems. That might finally get us some results.""

U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Rep. Elliott Engel, D-Bronx, made a similar request in a January letter to U.S. Postmaster General Megan Brennan. The letter urged the postal service to schedule a local meeting in Larchmont to discuss the problems there. Schumer and Engel made a similar request four months earlier.

To this date, no meeting has been scheduled.

Westchester District postal officials will be in 22 post office lobbies from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. March 3 to thank customers for their business, share mailing tips and listen to feedback about concerns and problems. Check with your local post office to see if they are hosting a Customer Appreciation Day event.

Residents can also contact the toll free Customer Care Centger at 1-800-275-8777 with specific complaints or compliments. Customers can also send postal officials email by logging onto USPS.com and clicking on the ""Contact Us."" link at the bottom of the page.

Girl dies after being turned away from doctor's appointment 'because she was 10 minutes late?,https://m.independent.ie/world-news/europe/britain/girl-5-dies-after-being-turned-away-from-doctors-appointment-because-she-was-10-minutes-late-36648809.html,"The opportunity to potentially save a five-year-old girl with life-threatening asthma was missed after she was turned away from an emergency appointment because she was late, a coroner has ruled.

Ellie-May Clark arrived at the Grange Clinic in Newport, South Wales, five minutes after her emergency appointment at 5pm on January 26 2015, an inquest heard.

Newport Coroner's Court heard her mother Shanice Clark, who had an eight-week-old baby and did not have a car at the time, was given just 25 minutes to get Ellie-May to the surgery on time.

Miss Clark told the surgery she would be later but when she arrived with Ellie-May, who was wheezing and had been unable to walk, Dr Joanne Rowe refused to see the girl.

The inquest was told that Dr Rowe had a ""10-minute rule"" where patients who were more than 10 minutes late for appointments were turned away.

Ellie-May collapsed at home at 10.30pm and died in hospital, with a pathologist later finding that her death had been caused by bronchial asthma.

A letter sent by her consultant to the Grange Clinic - received by Dr Rowe - months before her death warned she was at risk of ""an episode of severe/life-threatening asthma"".

Wendy James, senior coroner for Gwent, recorded a narrative conclusion and said it was ""not acceptable"" for Ellie-May to have been turned away from her emergency appointment without any clinical assessment or advice for what to do if her condition worsened.

""From the evidence before me, it is not possible for me to determine with certainty whether an earlier intervention would have altered the outcome for Ellie but nonetheless Ellie should have been seen by a GP that day and she was let down by the failures in the system,"" she said.

""Ellie-May Clark died of natural causes where the opportunity to provide potentially life-saving treatment was missed.""

The coroner said she would write to the surgery, the Aneurin Bevan health board, the health inspectorate of Wales, the chief coroner and Miss Clark to prevent future deaths.

Ellie-May's family had asked the coroner to find neglect in her case but Mrs James said there was no evidence to prove the failings caused or contributed to her death.

The girl suffered a wheezy chest from a young age and was first admitted to hospital in November 2011, two months before her second birthday.

She was prescribed inhalers but was admitted to hospital five times between February 2013 and March 2014. In May 2014, her hospital consultant wrote the letter to her surgery to highlight her ""life-threatening condition"".

""Ellie-May has previously had severe exacerbations of asthma requiring admission to the high dependency unit,"" it said.

""This places her at risk of having another episode of severe/life-threatening asthma.""

Dr Rowe did not place this prominently on Ellie-May's medical records. Ellie-May continued to attend the surgery regularly for treatment for her asthma, including steroids.

Miss Clark kept Ellie-May off school in the week before her death and she was taken on January 22 to see a doctor who said her condition did not require steroids.

On January 26, Ellie-May's school phoned at 1.30pm reporting that she had required her inhaler. When Miss Clark collected her at 3pm, a teacher advised her to take Ellie-May to a doctor.

""During the short walk from school, Ellie was crying, asking for her pink medication (steroids) and asking to be taken to the doctor,"" Mrs James said.

""Ellie asked her mother to carry her because she couldn't walk.""

Miss Clark phoned the surgery at 3.30pm reporting that her daughter was wheezing and could not walk but was not phoned back until 4.35pm, when she was offered the 5pm appointment.

After arriving at the surgery, Ellie-May and her mother waited for a receptionist to finish a phone call and deal with a patient in front of them in the queue. They spoke to receptionist Ann Jones between 5.10pm and 5.18pm.

Mrs Jones phoned Dr Rowe saying Ellie-May had arrived for her emergency appointment.

""Dr Rowe replied that she wouldn't see Ellie as she was late and she would need to come back the following day,"" Mrs James said.

Neither Mrs James nor Dr Rowe asked why Ellie-May was late or the reason for her emergency appointment. The doctor did not open Ellie-May's clinical notes or ask a colleague to see her.

Miss Clark said Ellie-May was upset after leaving the surgery and asked: ""Why won't the doctor see me?""

She told the inquest she did not believe her daughter needed to go to hospital, adding: ""Obviously now I would do things differently.""

They returned to the family home in Malpas, Newport, where Ellie-May went to bed at about 8pm.

Miss Clark checked on her daughter every 10-15 minutes and went in at 10.30pm after hearing her coughing.

She immediately called 999 after seeing that Ellie-May's face and hands had turned blue and she girl was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later.

A post-mortem examination by Andrew Bamber found Ellie-May had died from bronchial asthma and may have suffered a seizure before her death due to a lack of oxygen.

At the conclusion of the inquest, a statement from Dr Rowe read: ""Dr Rowe knows that nothing can be said to Ellie-May's family to make a difference but she would like to say how truly sorry she is.""

Justin Chisnall, of Harding Evans Solicitors, read a statement from Ellie-May's family saying they were ""disappointed"" the coroner did not find neglect in her case.

""The family acknowledge the apology from Dr Rowe, especially as they have been waiting in excess of three years for an outcome and to receive answers to their questions,"" he said.

The panel of advisors is managed by Dawn Butler MP, who is the Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities.

Munroe Bergdorf, 30, made history when she was hired as L'Oreal's first transgender model, but was fired days after the appointment when critics unearthed comments she made in response to the far-right march at Charlottesville.

The model, from East London, was recently appointed to Labour's LGBT+ advisory group and posted the news on Twitter, illustrated with a picture of her meeting Jeremy Corbyn.

She wrote: ""Thrilled to announce that I've been asked to be part of an LGBT+ advisory board for The Labour Party - To advise Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, Dawn Butler MP, on issues affecting the LGBT+ community, to help form and push through fairer and more effective policy change.""

Twitter Post Translation: Posters produced by women's activists on the theme of street harassment

Iranian women's rights activists are demanding the authorities enforce a law that would see men guilty of harassment, catcalling and manspreading in public receive up to 74 lashes.The Tehran municipality has been presented with a series of posters designed by a feminist group calling attention to a law that provides for corporal punishment for men harassing women.The posters, which the activists reportedly want the authorities to place in public, recall that Iran's Islamic Criminal Code punishes ""immoral acts"" in public, which they say includes harassment against women.The proposed posters show men occupying outsized spaces on public transport - a practice known as manspreading - men in cars and motorbikes catcalling a woman; and men chasing a solitary woman on a street.The posters have been retweeted thousands of times, triggering a fierce debate on social media.They were re-tweeted by Shahindokht Molaverdi , a mininster and the Iranian president's special assistant for citizens' rights.The posters received some criticism for apparently endorsing corporal punishment.Under Iran's interpretation of Islamic law, a wide range of offences, including homosexual and extra-marital relations, are punishable by death, lashes or even crucifixion.Some also recalled the authorities' ill-treatment of women in the Islamic Republic.Iranian women have recently been protesting the state-imposed dress code that forces them to wear the headscarf in public or face prosecution.Scores have been arrested in recent weeks.The Islamic Republic's dress code - in place since the 1979 revolution - considers Islamic veiling or hijab obligatory for any female aged above 13.It also states that women should cover themselves from head to toe, while disavowing any figure-hugging dress.",JustBadNews,0
Leaked email shows Tesla's intention to blacken Ecotricity name with politicians and the media.,https://www.driving.co.uk/news/dale-vince-vs-elon-musk/,"IN A windswept storage yard at a service station off the M25 lies a forlorn reminder of Britain’s electric superhighway dream. Standing amid the discarded boxes from Burger King at the back of South Mimms services is a packing case festooned with faded shipping notices to say that it belongs to the electric car company Tesla.

Inside the case is high-powered charging equipment that not long ago was seen as the future of long-distance electric motoring. But it has never been used, the victim of one of the most extraordinary stand-offs in eco-friendly history and one that could end up costing the taxpayer millions of pounds in wasted government grants, as well as setting back by as much as two years Britain’s lead in emission-free car travel.

The dispute is between two of the most high-profile green entrepreneurs. In one corner is Elon Musk, head of Tesla, a maverick billionaire with a buccaneering style and a penchant for big, ambitious projects. In the other is Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, a one-time hippie from Norfolk who struck it lucky with a prescient move into wind power and is now worth more than £100m. His luck appeared temporarily on hold at the weekend when his ex-wife won a ruling to take him to the family court and claim a share of his earnings.

At the root of the dispute is Ecotricity’s ownership of the rights to build recharging stations at motorway services. Having a way to recharge cars quickly and conveniently on the main road network is seen as the key to establishing electric cars in the mainstream. Ecotricity had entered into a partnership with Tesla, allowing the American firm to build its own, faster, rechargers on sites leased by Ecotricity. The hope was for Tesla to do what it had done in California, Germany and Norway, where rechargers have been installed at sites along motorways to create highways along which electric car owners can now travel free of so-called range anxiety.

But the idealism of the venture soon unravelled to reveal a tale of alleged corporate skulduggery that would be more at home in an episode of Dallas — except without the oil. And it began with an email.

It began with an email sent in error from a Tesla employee to someone at Ecotricity with the same first name as its intended recipient. The cost of the “fat-fingered” blunder has yet to be determined, but it could easily run into the millions

In the City they call them fat-fingered trades — when a trader inadvertently hits the wrong key on his computer and costs his bank millions. The price of the email — sent in error late on Sunday, May 18, last year from a Tesla employee to someone at Ecotricity with the same first name as its intended recipient — has yet to be determined, but it could easily run into the millions too.

The email allegedly made clear Tesla’s plans to break up the partnership it had built with Ecotricity to install chargers in service areas and instead to make a direct approach to their operators. Ecotricity says that the email — written in haste after an article last year in The Sunday Times that disclosed Musk’s concept of an electric superhighway in Britain — also revealed Tesla’s intention to blacken Ecotricity’s name with politicians and the media. Instead of being sent to Simon Sproule, then Tesla’s head of corporate communications, the email was sent by mistake to Simon Crowfoot of Ecotricity, alerting the company to Tesla’s plans.

Vince said the email was evidence not only of underhandedness but of a “brutal” corporate culture within the American firm.

“I have never seen anything approaching Tesla’s behaviour and we have been around 20 years this year and we’ve had some run-ins, you know. I do think it’s cultural — I just think that’s how they operate.”

Tesla had wanted to install charging points on a route from Dover along the M20 and another from Bristol along the M4, converging on the M25 before following the route of the M1.

It has declined to comment on Vince’s specific allegations, but in a published interview Musk dismissed Ecotricity’s behaviour as outrageous. It said the British company was making excessive demands that in effect blocked Tesla’s access to motorway sites.

“I’ve never even met the guy,” he said of Vince. “Initially when we tried working with him he started making all sorts of outrageous demands, so we thought, ‘Well, OK, we’ll just not work with you’ — and then he sued us.”

It has been whispered that ideological differences may underpin the row. Musk was appointed Britain’s “electric car tsar” with a brief to advise the present coalition government. Vince, the boss of Ecotricity, is a Labour supporter and recently donated £250,000 to the party.

Regardless, the stalemate is real. The two sides are locked in a battle at the High Court that could go on for another year, with Musk countersuing to fend off Vince’s demand for damages. And while lawyers rack up fees, the dream of electric motoring in Britain is starting to fade. Not just because Tesla owners can’t recharge quickly on motorways, but because Britain’s role as a leader in emissions-free car technology is under threat.

There is anger at the apparent intransigence of the two companies, but even more so at the government’s failure to intervene. The Office for Low Emission Vehicles, a quango with links to the Department for Transport, has £900m to spend by 2020 on promoting electric cars, yet seems powerless to act, even though the government controls the motorways next to which the chargers are needed. It also seems oblivious to the fact that unless electric cars gain credibility soon — something Tesla’s supercharged network has achieved elsewhere — the millions of pounds in green subsidies it has already invested in electric schemes will have been wasted.

A model for the UK? Watch our test of Tesla’s Californian supercharger superhighway

Baroness Kramer, the transport minister who is in charge of public spending on Britain’s electric car charging network, said the government could not get involved in the dispute and appeared to dismiss Tesla owners’ concerns as the interests of a wealthy elite.

“I can’t comment on a legal dispute. We can’t get into the middle of the fight. I hope they will go away and have their fight and sort themselves out. My focus is on the bulk market, on the ordinary person buying the ordinary EV, and making sure that they get what they want. People who are paying super-premium prices for super-premium services, that’s… I think there are others who will take that role on.”

Kramer’s focus may be on the “bulk market”, but she risks being accused of backing the wrong horse. Although there has been an upturn in the number of electric cars sold in recent months — 728 vehicles eligible for the government’s £5,000 plug-in grant were registered in February, against 122 in February 2014 — the proportion is still tiny: a total of 76,950 cars were sold in February. In fact just over 25,000 electric cars have been sold since the plug-in grant was introduced in 2011.

Many in the industry claim that attempting to change driver behaviour from the ground up with small, slow-charging city cars aimed at the mass market is a mistake. Instead, they say, new technology will be adopted only from the top down: if it becomes desirable in exclusive, top-of-the-range cars, the technology will gradually filter down of its own accord. This is part of the reason why many see cars such as the BMW i8, Tesla Model S and plug-in Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid as our best hope for the wider adoption of battery power.

Many in the industry claim that new technology will be adopted only from the top down: if it becomes desirable in exclusive, top-of-the-range cars, the technology will gradually filter down of its own accord

Tesla’s plan for fast chargers on motorways to supplement overnight charging at the owner’s home appears to offer the best hope for an electric future, yet the government seems wedded to another philosophy — that of chargers on urban streets. So far this has failed to ignite the public’s interest. A sample study of 30 charging points in London and Bristol found that 18 had problems and seven others were blocked by non-electric cars. Critics say urban chargers are best suited to an early generation of electric cars whose maximum range of about 100 miles has failed to impress car buyers. Models such as the Citroën C-Zero and the Peugeot iOn sold in tiny numbers, despite huge discounts. By contrast, Tesla’s Model S, with a maximum range of 300 miles and the ability to recharge much faster than rivals, is a bestseller in the US and Scandinavia.

Edmund King, president of the AA, summed up the frustration of electric car owners and taxpayers. He said the government had failed drivers by giving up control of strategically vital service areas. “Motorway service areas are in a monopoly position and should be obliged to provide services for all road users — that includes Tesla road users as well as other EV road users,” he said.

“We think at a time when the government is talking about lower emissions and when government taxation is based on emissions, it seems to be shooting itself in the foot if it can’t intervene to help drivers get the resources they need to drive their cars. In a rush to give up responsibility for motorway service areas, the government left open various loopholes whereby the consumer, the driver, isn’t getting the best deal.”

Critics also point out that Ecotricity’s contracts with the operators of motorway service areas — some lasting 10 years — give the company in effect a stranglehold on motorway car charging. Though electricity is free at the moment, Vince warned in a radio interview last week that motorists would probably have to pay from early next year. The operators defend the arrangement, saying that Ecotricity saw a commercial opportunity and seized it.

Andrew Long, chief executive of Extra, which operates nine motorway services in Britain, confirmed that Tesla was unable to install its chargers at Extra motorway services “without a renegotiation of existing arrangements”. Long said that Ecotricity had been a “straightforward company to deal with”, adding: “Tesla I felt was very slow off the mark to be able to offer a commercial product so it basically got left behind, in my opinion, by Ecotricity.”

Without government involvement, there seems little immediate prospect of a resolution, unless one or the other side backs down. That seems unlikely: the last hearing took place in November in the High Court Chancery Division and during exchanges between the two sides, there was more than a little sense of posturing.

Even the judge — Master Bowles — appeared to lose patience: “I am troubled in this case. There is a large chunk of me which wonders how much this litigation and perhaps even this application is position-taking [for] commercial negotiations. I am afraid obviously I will treat this as a piece of purist litigation, but I am just troubled that there are these — how can I put it? — undercurrents knocking about.”

For now at least the battered equipment at South Mimms service area — once the great white hope of electric motoring in Britain — remains very much out of order.

China Communist Party calls for removal of term limits so Xi Jinping can remain leader after 2023,https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/02/25/just-china-communist-party-calls-removal-term-limits-xi-jinping-can-remain-leader-2023/,"China’s Communist Party is calling for the removal of presidential term limits, the official Xinhua news agency reported Sunday, paving the way for Xi Jinping to remain as head of state after 2023.

The party’s Central Committee has proposed deleting from the constitution the stipulation that a president “shall serve no more than two consecutive terms” of five years, Xinhua said.

Xi, who is also party chief and considered to be China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, has been president since 2013 and would step down in 2023 under the current system.

The proposed change, which would also apply to the vice-president, will be submitted to legislators at the annual full session of the National People’s Congress starting March 5.

At the 19th five-yearly party congress last October, Xi saw his personal political philosophy included in the party’s charter, an honour only accorded to one previous leader, Mao, during his lifetime.

Since taking over as party general secretary in late 2012, Xi has waged a remorseless battle against corruption, which has seen more than one million people punished. Some see the campaign also as a means for him to eradicate internal opposition.

Xi’s presidency has been marked by the return of a personality cult and a major crackdown on democracy and human rights.

Florida shooting: armed guard 'failed to act',http://www.theweek.co.uk/91860/florida-shooting-armed-guard-failed-to-act,"An armed sheriff’s deputy on campus at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school during last week’s deadly shooting has resigned after it emerged that he had “failed to act” to stop the massacre.

Broward County sheriff Scott Israel said yesterday that deputy Scott Peterson, who was the school resource officer, approached the building where the shooting was taking place but did not enter it or engage the gunman.

Peterson was reportedly in uniform and armed with a gun at the time of the shooting, which lasted for six minutes and killed 17 people, and had previously said that he had entered the building during the incident.

His claims were found to be false after the Broward County sheriff’s office conducted a review of security camera footage and interviewed several witnesses, including Peterson himself.

“What I saw was a deputy arrive at the west side of building 12, take up a position, and he never went in,” Israel said. The footage made him feel “sick to my stomach”, he added.

Peterson “resigned from the department on Thursday after being told he would be suspended”, The Guardian reports.

CNN says a further two deputies have been placed on restricted duty while the sheriff’s office “investigates their actions during calls to the gunman's home before the shooting”.

The sheriff’s office is conducting a review over the possible mishandling of at least 23 tips spanning nearly ten years about the shooting suspect, including one in 2017 that he was amassing a collection of knives and guns.

The New York Times says the reports have “added to a growing list of failures and missed signs” by local authorities that may have helped to prevent the shooting.",JustBadNews,0
San Francisco's 'Diseased Streets' Are Being Compared to Some of Worst Slums in the World,https://www.westernjournal.com/san-francisco-diseased-streets-compared-worst-slums-world/,"The offices of The Western Journal are closed on Sundays to allow employees to rest, spend time with their families, and worship if they choose. Therefore, we are sharing this popular article as a service to our readers.

A combination of discarded needles and piles of feces on the streets of San Francisco has caused least one expert to say that the city’s slums are comparable to those in developing countries.

Reporters with KNTV investigated what they referred to as the “diseased streets” of the city, and found that each of the 153 downtown blocks they surveyed — an area that encompasses playgrounds, hotels and government buildings — is littered with garbage. Included in this trash were at least 100 drug needles and 300 piles of feces.

Dr. Lee Riley, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, Berkeley, warned that not only do the needles cause viral diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis, but dried fecal matter can release airborne viruses like the rotavirus.

“If you happen to inhale that, it can also go into your intestine,” he said, leading to potentially fatal results.

TRENDING: Biden's Worst Nightmare as 7,000 Cars Show for Trump Parade in Vital Swing State

Riley, who has researched and written about conditions in slums across the world, believes that some parts of San Francisco may be worse than the world’s dirtiest slums.

“The contamination is … much greater than communities in Brazil or Kenya or India,” he said, while pointing out that in those countries, slums often serve as long-term housing, and thus, their residents work to maintain them.

But in San Francisco, he suggested that the homeless do not make an effort to keep the streets clean because they are forced to move around frequently.

The situation on the streets of San Francisco is particularly dangerous for children.

“We see poop, we see pee, we see needles, and we see trash,” said Adelita Orellana, a preschool teacher. “Sometimes they ask what is it, and that’s a conversation that’s a little difficult to have with a 2-year old, but we just let them know that those things are full of germs, that they are dangerous, and they should never be touched.”

A’Nylah Reed, a 3-year-old preschooler, explained that “the floor is dirty,” making her walk to school difficult.

“There is poop in there,” she said. “That makes me angry.” Reed’s mother, meanwhile, noted that she often has to physically intervene to ensure that her daughter doesn’t step on needles or human feces.

Some city officials are convinced that the solution is to provide short-term housing for the city’s homeless population.

“Unacceptable. Absolutely unacceptable,” said city Supervisor Hillary Ronen. “We’re losing tourists. We’re losing conventions in San Francisco. All of this is happening because we aren’t addressing the root cause, which is we need more temporary beds for street homelessness.”

The city currently has about 2,000 temporary beds, but Rosen believes about 1,000 more are needed, KNTV reported. This would likely cost roughly $25 million.

“We need to find a source of revenue,” she said. “Whether that’s putting something on the ballot to raise business taxes or taking a look at our general fund and re-allocating money towards that purpose and taking it away from something else in the city.”

Regardless, Ronen said the situation in San Francisco is a human “tragedy.”

“We’re not going to make a huge dent in this problem unless we deal with some underlying major social problems and issues,” she stated. “There’s a human tragedy happening in San Francisco.”

Until a permanent solution is decided upon, all the city can do is remove feces and needles from the streets, an effort that cost about $30 million in the 2016-2017 fiscal year, according to Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru.

Removing just one pile of human waste takes a half an hour, Nuru said.

“The steamer has to come. He has to park the steamer. He’s got to come out with his steamer, disinfect, steam clean, roll up and go,” he explained.

The dirty streets in San Francisco haven’t stopped it from being ranked among the most beautiful in the world. But the city is also one of the most expensive in the U.S., with Fox News noting that this accentuates a large “gap between the haves and have-nots.”

The NCAA says student-athletes shouldn't be paid because the 13th amendment allows unpaid prison labor,https://theintercept.com/2018/02/22/ncaa-student-athletes-unpaid-prison/,"Photo: Mark Humphrey/AP



In the United States, college athletes — particularly those who compete at some of the largest football and basketball programs — generate not millions but billions of dollars for universities, brands, and television networks. In 2015, the top programs college athletes — particularly those who compete at some of the largest football and basketball programs — generate not millions but billions of dollars for universities, brands, and television networks. In 2015, the top programs made a combined $9.1 billion . The NCAA, for its part, just signed an $8.8 billion-dollar deal with CBS to air March Madness, the college basketball championship tournament. College sports is a business – a very lucrative business. That very obvious dynamic undergirds a lawsuit filed by former NCAA athlete Lawrence “Poppy” Livers asserting that scholarship students who play sports are employees and deserve pay. The Livers case argues that student-athletes who get scholarships should at least be paid as work-study students for the time they put in.

What the NCAA did in response to the lawsuit is as vile as anything going on in sports right now.

What the NCAA did in response to the lawsuit is as vile as anything going on in sports right now. I had to see it for myself before I believed it. At the root of its legal argument, the NCAA is relying on one particular case for why NCAA athletes should not be paid. That case is Vanskike v. Peters. Only there’s an important detail: Daniel Vanskike was a prisoner at Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois, and Howard Peters was the director of the Illinois State Department of Corrections. In 1992, Vanskike and his attorneys argued that as a prisoner, he should be paid a federal minimum wage for his work. The court, in its decision, cited the 13th Amendment and rejected the claim. The 13th Amendment is commonly hailed as the law that finally ended slavery in America. But the amendment has an important carve-out: It kept involuntary service legal for those who have been convicted of a crime. “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,” the amendment says. It’s that phrase — “except as a punishment for crime” — that allows American prisons to force inmates to do whatever work they want or need them to do. The use of the case stems from several other law cases alleging unpaid labor; two of them are previous lawsuits against the NCAA in which the case was cited as precedent, and the NCAA won.

In their response to the NCAA’s motion to dismiss, Livers’s lawyers are arguing that the precedent was mistaken for applying the 13th Amendment exception for unpaid prison labor in a case dealing with non-prisoners. “Defense Counsel’s insistence that Vanskike be applied here is not only legally frivolous, but also deeply offensive to all Scholarship Athletes – and particularly to African-Americans,” Livers’s rebuttal to the NCAA’s motion says. “Comparing athletes to prisoners is contemptible.”

Russia blocks UN resolution on eastern Ghouta ceasefire,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/russia-un-resolution-eastern-ghouta-ceasefire-syria,"This article is more than 2 years old

This article is more than 2 years old

Russia has blocked a UN resolution that would have established a 30-day ceasefire and humanitarian deliveries in eastern Ghouta, saying that widespread reporting of heavy civilian casualties in the besieged area on the edge of the Syrian capital, Damascus, was a product of “mass psychosis”.



Medical crisis in east Ghouta as hospitals 'systematically targeted' Read more

The Russian envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told an emergency meeting of the security council on the situation in eastern Ghouta that Russia would not support the ceasefire resolution put forward by Sweden and Kuwait in its present form, calling it unrealistic.

He circulated a list of proposed Russian amendments, thought to involve opening broad loopholes in the ceasefire, allowing a range of rebel groups to be targeted. A western diplomat said that at first glance the Russian amendments were “likely to be unacceptable”. Diplomats said the resolution could go to a vote on Friday.

Moscow has vetoed 10 previous UN resolutions on Syria and has consistently used its permanent seat on the security council to shield the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, from concerted UN action on war crimes. In November, Russia used its veto to block a resumption of UN investigations into the use of chemical weapons by Syrian forces.

The ceasefire resolution put forward by Sweden and Kuwait was first circulated in the security council on 9 February but its drafting had been slowed by Russian objections, while in Syria, the Assad regime and its allies pursued its offensive in eastern Ghouta.

On Thursday, Nebenzia made clear that Russian support for Assad would continue, and portrayed the accounts and video footage of heavy civilian casualties in the rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta as fake news.

“The mass psychosis in global media outlets acting in coordination, disseminating the same rumours in recent days, in no way does anything to help improve understanding of this situation,” Nebenzia told the council session that Russia had called.

Quick guide What is the UN security council and why is it paralysed over Syria? Show Hide What is it? The security council is the UN’s most powerful body, the only one with the authority to issue legally binding resolutions that can be backed up by sanctions, blue-helmeted peacekeepers or by force of arms. Who is on it? There are five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and 10 temporary members at any one time, elected by the general assembly for two-year terms. Why hasn’t it taken stronger action against Syria? For a resolution to be passed, nine of the 15 council members must vote for it, but permanent members have a veto. Russia has repeatedly blocked resolutions targeting its ally, Syria. China has also vetoed resolutions on Syria. What can be done to solve the veto problem? One possible remedy is to expand the security council and its permanent membership, but the existing members have mixed feelings. The UK and France say they are in favour, the US and Russia are more tepid and China is against it. Another possible remedy involves reining in the use of the veto. France and others argue an immediate fix would be for permanent members to waive their veto rights in cases of mass atrocities, but Russia is adamant in its opposition.

Before the Russian envoy spoke, the council heard a report from the UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, Mark Lowcock, who said 50 civilians had been reported as killed and 200 wounded in heavy shelling in the 24 hours before the session.

He said humanitarian deliveries to besieged populations in Syria were sharply down this year. Convoys were reaching 22,000 trapped people a month in the past three months compared with an average in 2017 of 175,000 a month.

In a video link from Geneva, Lowcock read out messages from trapped civilians who were under fire, appealing for help from the international community. “You’re all as member states aware that your obligations under international humanitarian law are just that. They are binding obligations. They are not favours to be traded in a game of death and destruction,” he said.

“Humanitarian access is not a ‘nice-to-have’. It is a legal requirement,” Lowcock said. “Counter-terrorist efforts cannot supersede the obligation to respect and protect civilians. They do not justify the killings of civilians and the destruction of entire cities and neighbourhoods.”

Lowcock said seven civilian hospitals and clinics had been targeted with bombardment on Wednesday alone.

Nebenzia replied that the reports that Syrian forces and their backers were bombing health facilities were “a well-known tactic in information warfare”.

He said it was “fully clear” that fighters based themselves in medical and educational facilities. “However, this is an inconvenient truth that is not being disseminated,” he said. The Russian envoy said there were “several thousand fighters that have not yet been vanquished” in Ghouta.

Other security council envoys rejected the Russian suggestion that the bombing of civilians in eastern Ghouta was necessary for counter-terrorism.

Speaking for the UK, senior diplomat Stephen Hickey said: “The people of eastern Ghouta are not terrorists.” Hickey added that the al-Qaida affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, had only a small presence, representing “less than a quarter of 1%” of the district’s population.



“Nothing can justify the barbaric bombardment we’ve seen in recent days, or the blocking of humanitarian aid, or the denial of medical evacuations,” Hickey said.

Before the vote, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, denounced the mass killing of civilians in eastern Ghouta.

“What we currently see, the dreadful events in Syria, a regime fighting not against terrorists, but against its own people, the killing of children, the destruction of hospitals – all this is a massacre which needs to be condemned,” Merkel told Germany’s parliament.

The chancellor said her government would talk to Moscow and would “do everything that is within our power so that this massacre comes to an end”.",JustBadNews,0

The state's House of Representatives approved the resolution by a voice vote Tuesday, despite some members asking why the topic is being taken up at this time.

The resolution was sponsored by Representative Ross Spano, who is running for attorney general.

Spano said there's research showing a connection between pornography use and mental and physical illnesses, forming and maintaining intimate relationships and deviant sexual behavior. The resolution states a need for education, research, and policy changes to protect Floridians, especially teenagers, from pornography.

House Democrats in committees and on the floor have said the bill is a waste of the Legislature's time and that more important bills and topics need to be heard.

During a debate, Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith asked Spano if pornography has killed or physically injured anyone. He went one step further in asking Spano if pornography has caused any first responders to seek counseling. Spano said he did not know.

Smith has had his own bill that would ban assault weapons and large-capacity magazines get stuck in Spano's Criminal Justice Subcommittee.

""He was saying porn as a health risk was more important to address here in the Florida Legislature than the epidemic of gun violence,"" Smith said. ""These are their priorities. I don't understand the politics, to be honest, if I'm being honest.

Canada's stock market is the WORST in the world,http://www.macleans.ca/economy/money-economy/canadas-stock-market-is-the-worst-in-the-world/,"For years now, investor portfolios in Canada have been taking an undue amount of punishment from the oil and gas sector. So much so, that you’d figure it would grow tired of inflicting all that damage and start being nice again in 2018. Guess again. Canada’s stock market is being a real dog again this year and energy stocks are leading the way down.

In the last 10 years, the energy subindex on the S&P/TSX Composite has dropped by more than a third, acting as a major headwind on the broader market. The TSX has gained only 14% in that same period, compared to an advance of 101% for the S&P 500 in the U.S.

WATCH: From Moneysense: WT* is an employee stock plan?

Think about it; if you were unlucky enough to buy into the stock market at the peak in 2008, just before the financial crisis hit full force, your gains (excluding dividends) wouldn’t buy you much more than two loaves of price-fixed bread at Loblaws and a bag of President’s Choice sour grapes. If that was your nest egg and you need to start pulling the money out today to fund your retirement, that has got to hurt.

Here is the TSX in the last 10 years.

And here is what it looks like so far in 2018.

Source: Google

The good news is all those declines in energy shares means the sector isn’t throwing as much weight around on the index these days. Four years ago, the TSX was weighted 27% to energy. Today it’s dropped a few weight classes to about 18.5%, which means it should be punching lighter.

The bad news is, like a declining prize fighter, energy is still punching hard enough to hurt. And that’s pretty clear message to investors that too much of a volatile sector like oil and gas is not a great idea for your investment portfolio. Last year, energy dropped 10% to restrain the TSX to a meagre 6% advance (vs a gain of 19.4% for the S&P 500). So far this year, energy is the worst performing sector in Canada, helping to drag the broader market into a 5.3% slide.

With that kind of dim performance, Canada’s market is not only bad; it’s the absolute worst performing market in the world. Okay, we’re leaving Venezuela off the list, but among the 106 global markets tracked by Bloomberg, we are number 105. (The energy market is also devastating the Venezuelan market but that country’s crisis is a much more complex story, with inflation expected to hit 13,000% this year while unemployment climbs to 30%.)

Here in Canada, the economy is strong and pretty good when it comes to diversification, too. Not so the Canadian stock market, which is why we are all acutely feeling the painful effects of a bear market in energy and why this would be a great time to think about whether you’re getting enough diversification from your holdings.

In recent years, just three of the TSX’s 10 main sector groups—financials, energy and mining—managed to account for more than three-quarters of the TSX’s value. Today that concentration is down to two-thirds, which is still high. It’s not what’s in the TSX that’s the real problem; it’s what’s missing and would bring it some balance. In an age when technology is driving economic change and innovation at an accelerating pace, investors aren’t getting a piece of it; the TSX’s exposure to tech is just over 3.5%. We have no Nortel (OK, that one left a bad taste but was good for a long time), no Facebook, no Google, no Amazon, no Netflix, no Salesforce, no Nvidia, no Apple. Not even a boring, old Microsoft or IBM.

We do have Shopify and it’s on a major run, and happens to be the top performer in 2018 with a 40% gain. But there isn’t much else going on, except Constellation Software and most Canadians have never heard of it even though its shares are trading above $800. If the infotech subindex had a weighting of 20%, it’s safe to assume the TSX would be much more resilient and cushioned from energy’s ups and, mostly, downs.

Your MoneySense editors would love to find the tech companies of tomorrow, take them public and set them on a course to bulk up and diversify the TSX, but no one has asked us. Instead, we’ll just offer sensible advice, which is to make sure you have some exposure to tech in your portfolio and that means going outside Canada. We love exchange-traded funds and there are many to choose from with a good mix of leading U.S. names. You shouldn’t have all your money in the Canadian market anyway, so this is a good way to diversify by geography as well as by sector.

As for oil, conditions could improve or get worse. We aren’t going to guess. Right now, Canadian crude is trading at a deep discount to a barrel of West Texas Intermediate, so that’s part of the problem. We are big believers in putting most of your money to work in low-fee, diversified ETFs and leaving it to work, rather than trying to time the market. But we will say that bear and bull cycles balance out over time. And all you have to do is look at the 20-year picture to see that energy’s gains have outpaced the broader TSX’s by 50%.",JustBadNews,0
Refiner goes belly-up after big payouts to Carlyle Group,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-pes-bankruptcy-insight/refiner-goes-belly-up-after-big-payouts-to-carlyle-group-idUSKCN1G40I1,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Throughout 2016 and 2017, a rail terminal built to accept crude oil for the largest East Coast refinery often sat idle, with few trains showing up to unload.

Although little oil flowed, plenty of money did.

Under a deal Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) signed in 2015, the refiner paid minimum quarterly payments of $30 million to terminal owner North Yard Logistics LP - even if little crude arrived. Much of that cash, in turn, flowed to the investors that own both PES and North Yard, led by the Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with $178 billion in assets.

The deal in effect guaranteed lucrative payouts to Carlyle regardless of whether the refinery benefitted from the arrangement. When oil market conditions made the rail shipments unprofitable later that year, the refinery took heavy losses while its investors continued to collect large distributions for two more years.

The rail contract exemplifies the financial demands Carlyle imposed on PES in the years leading up to the refiner’s bankruptcy in January. The Carlyle-led consortium collected at least $594 million in cash distributions from PES before it collapsed, according to a Reuters review of bankruptcy filings. Carlyle paid $175 million in 2012 for its two-thirds stake in the refiner.

(For a graphic detailing how PES went bankrupt, see: tmsnrt.rs/2BzYUW2 )

More than half the distributions to the Carlyle-led investors were financed by loans against PES assets that the refiner now can’t pay back, the filings show. The rest came from the refiner’s operating budget and payments PES made under the terminal deal to North Yard, a firm with no offices or employees that PES spun off in 2015.

PES has blamed its bankruptcy on environmental regulations that require all U.S. refiners to cover the costs of blending corn-based ethanol into the nation’s gasoline. But the ill-fated train terminal deal and other large payouts to investors played key roles in the refiner’s collapse, according to filings and five current or former PES employees who were involved in the refinery’s decision-making. The employees spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The investor payouts, along with a slump in refining economics, left PES unable to cover its obligations under the decade-old U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard or the loans it took to finance the distributions to Carlyle, the filings show.

PES had $600 million in debt and $43 million in cash on hand when it filed bankruptcy last month. It now hopes to restructure and continue operations, which employ about 1,100 people.

Carlyle Group spokesman Christopher Ullman declined to comment on whether the distributions or the rail-terminal deal contributed to the refiner’s bankruptcy. PES spokeswoman Cherice Corley defended the payments to Carlyle and said the biofuels regulations played a “significant” role its collapse.

“We feel our capital structure was appropriate, and any suggestion that it was the cause of our restructuring is completely ignoring the significant effect of the flawed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS),” Corley said.

Other refiners and Pennsylvania officials have also blamed biofuels regulation for the South Philadelphia refinery’s failure, triggering renewed debate about the program on Capitol Hill.

Refiners without the necessary blending facilities, such as PES, are required to purchase regulatory credits, known as RINs, from firms that do such blending. The cost of compliance for PES rose from $13 million in 2012 to $218 million in 2017 as prices increased for the credits, which are traded in an open market.

The refiner, however, failed to pay a large portion of that obligation. In addition to its conventional debt, PES still owes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory credits worth about $350 million, an amount tied to the fuel it produced over the past two years, according to filings. The firm stopped buying RINs last year - and instead sold them to other refiners for what likely amounted to tens of millions of dollars, Reuters reported in November.

The corn and ethanol lobby has pushed back on the argument that biofuels regulation sunk PES, pointing out that other refiners governed by the same law are raking in their highest profits in years. The refinery’s failure had more to do with the hefty profits it paid to Carlyle as its cash reserves dwindled and its debt soared, said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Council.

“The Carlyle Group looks more like a corporate raider than a savior in this deal,” Coleman said.

Carlyle would not lose any of its gains on the PES investment under the refiner’s proposed restructuring plan, which has the support of almost all creditors, according to filings. PES also asks the bankruptcy court to entirely absolve its $350 million obligation to the EPA.

EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on the delinquent PES credit obligations, citing the bankruptcy proceedings.

CARLYLE RECOUPED INVESTMENT WITH DEBT

Carlyle bought its stake in PES as many other East Coast refineries were closing down because of weak margins. The previous owner, Sunoco - now Energy Transfer Partners ETP.N - contributed the refinery’s assets and became a non-controlling partner.

The $175 million Carlyle paid was its only investment in PES, filings show, and the firm soon recouped its acquisition costs through a loan against the refinery.

At the direction of its investor-controlled board, PES borrowed $550 million in March 2013 and paid $200 million of that to investors, according to bankruptcy filings.

PES then spent $100 million building the rail terminal that year and $30 million in 2014 to double its capacity. At the time, U.S. oil production was skyrocketing as improved drilling technology unlocked new reserves in places such as North Dakota. Carlyle saw an opportunity to tap this cheaper supply and wean PES off costly imports.

The plan worked well at first, in 2013 and 2014, and PES posted earnings of about $500 million for the two years combined.

In January 2015, PES spun off the terminal, creating North Yard as a separate firm. PES then signed a ten-year agreement with North Yard to pay $1.95 for each barrel unloaded and agreed to a minimum quarterly volume of 170,000 bpd, guaranteeing the $30 million quarterly payments to North Yard. For any barrel PES unloaded above the threshold, the refinery paid North Yard 51 cents.

The system was designed to reward PES for success, but had no contingency plan to protect the refiner against the failure that would quickly follow the deal. The rail terminal has averaged just 58,000 bpd since the contract was signed, according to figures provided to Reuters by energy intelligence service Genscape, because Carlyle and PES could no longer access crude at prices low enough to make the rail shipments profitable.

That left PES paying millions of dollars to Carlyle, through North Yard, for oil shipments it never received.

BAD BET ON CHEAP CRUDE

Carlyle’s purchase of PES and the rail terminal investment were bets that U.S. oil would remain cheap relative to imports. A glut of domestic production had caused U.S. crude to sell at a deep discount to imported barrels, with the gap averaging about $8.60 between 2012 and 2015.

But by late 2015, an oil price rebound slashed the domestic discount to less than $3 a barrel – not enough to cover the cost of a long rail journey.

PES nonetheless continued to pay North Yard a total of $298 million between 2015 until August 2017, filings show. The Carlyle-led investor group received $151 million, in eight distributions, of the total paid to North Yard.

In November of that year, PES took on more debt to finance more payouts to investors, borrowing a total of $160 million in two loans against the rail terminal and delivering the proceeds its Carlyle-led backers, filings show.

Corley, the PES spokeswoman said terminal investment more than paid for itself during its more profitable period. But for last two years, PES said in filings, the refinery remained largely cut off from the cheap crude it needed to survive.

“Perversely, it became cheaper to transport crude oil from North Dakota to points in Western Europe than it was to transport the same crude oil to Philadelphia,” the firm said.",JustBadNews,0

Romney tweet: Thank you Mr. President for the support. I hope that over the course of the campaign I also earn the support and endorsement of the people of Utah.

That acceptance itself was incongruous with what Romney had said in 2016 about Trump's endorsement from the prior presidential election.

Romney tweet: If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement

The 2012 Republican presidential nominee is fighting criticism that he is an outsider for the Senate seat — he mentioned Utah early and often in a video message announcing his candidacy.

""I have decided to run for United States Senate because I believe I can help bring Utah's values and Utah's lessons to Washington,"" he said. ""Utah is a better model for Washington than Washington is for Utah.""

Romney is aiming to replace 83-year-old Sen. Orrin Hatch in November's election. The longtime senator announced his retirement in January even as Trump pushed him to run again.

Romney heavily criticized then-candidate Trump in a 2016 speech, calling him a ""phony"" and a ""fraud."" He warned that Trump would cause economic instability and endanger Americans abroad.

Later, Romney unsuccessfully interviewed to be Trump's secretary of State. Since then, he has publicly rebuked Trump when he supported Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexually abusing teenagers, and when the president reportedly questioned why the U.S. needed immigrants from ""s---hole"" African countries.

For his part, Trump has also been critical of Romney, saying in the past that he ""choked like a dog"" during the 2012 run for the White House, and that he is ""a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue.""

Some of Trump's criticism of Romney:

Trump tweet: Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

Trump tweet: Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!

Trump tweet: Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who ""choked"" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!

Trump tweet: Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).

Trump tweet: .@MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke, and everyone knows it!

Trump tweet: Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!

If he wins the seat and criticizes Trump while in office, Romney would mark a stark shift from Hatch. Hatch has heaped praise on the president in recent months, calling him a ""heck of a leader"" after the GOP passed its tax plan in December. Trump reportedly begged the 83-year old Hatch to run for re-election one more time.

Dutch activate 'hard Brexit' plan and blame 'a lack of clarity' from the UK,https://news.sky.com/story/dutch-activate-hard-brexit-plan-and-blame-a-lack-of-clarity-from-the-uk-11258568,"The Dutch government has linked its decision to activate what it refers to as a ""hard Brexit"" plan for customs to ""divisions within the British Conservative Party"" and a ""remaining lack of clarity"" from the UK.

A letter seen by Sky News, from the country's finance ministry, sought to explain to Dutch parliamentarians exactly how many extra customs officers would be required to police new trade barriers at Europe's biggest port in Rotterdam, and Dutch airports.

Cabinet finance minister Menno Snel wrote that 930 would be required in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit, which is ""conceivable"" after ""difficult"" first-phase negotiations.

Perhaps as shocking is that 750 extra customs agents would be required even in the event of a Canada-style free trade deal with a transition period. Fifty have already been paid for.

As the finance ministry calculates it takes between nine and 22 months to train a customs officer, the Dutch government has green-lighted immediate recruiting, training, tendering of contracts and organising of housing.

Mr Snel wrote to Dutch MPs: ""The divisions within the British Conservative Party and the remaining lack of clarity about the British input continue to impede the smooth running of the negotiations.

""It is therefore clear that the scenario that the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and without a transitional period is still conceivable.

""The red lines of the UK for the future relationship with the EU (leaving the internal market and customs union) mean that the trade relationship can not go much further than a trade agreement like the one the EU has concluded with Canada.""

The Netherlands has traditionally been seen as a key ally of the UK, and stands to be among the most impacted by any radical change to UK-EU trading conditions - as when imports and exports are combined it is the UK's third largest trade partner.

On Wednesday, Theresa May is hosting Dutch PM Mark Rutte at Downing Street as part of her charm offensive to secure agreement for an implementation phase at the full EU Council next month.

The Brexit ""war cabinet"" will try to thrash out a common position on future trade arrangements at an away day at Chequers on Thursday.

Dutch politicians, including Pieter Omtzigt, the parliament's Brexit rapporteur, has said his country is only ""preparing for the stated policy of the UK government - the UK outside the customs union"", and that ""if we need hundreds of new customs and agricultural inspectors, the British are going to need thousands"".

The preparations being made across the North Sea come as Brexit Secretary David Davis implores Europe to recognise existing levels of trust in UK-EU relations that he argues will enable a more ambitious free-trade agreement after Brexit.

During a speech in Vienna, David Davis is arguing that the EU can trust the UK not to engage in a ""Mad Max dystopian"" race to the bottom on standards.

He says leaving the EU will instead create a ""race to the top in global standards"".",JustBadNews,0

NYC rape case highlights loophole that allows police to dodge sex assault charges,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyc-rape-case-highlights-loophole-that-allows-police-to-dodge-sex-assault-charges/,"ALBANY, N.Y. - The 18-year-old woman was driving with two friends near Coney Island in September when the two plainclothes detectives pulled her over and found marijuana. The officers released the two male passengers, handcuffed the woman and told her she was under arrest, prosecutors say.

Then, investigators say, detectives Eddie Martins and Richard Hall repeatedly sexually assaulted her before releasing her on Sept 5. The woman went to the hospital, where prosecutors say DNA was obtained that matched both men.

According to the victim, named Anna, the officers brutally took turns raping her inside an undercover NYPD van, CBS New York reports.

But the officers have pleaded not guilty to rape and other charges, and the case has highlighted an apparent loophole in the laws of New York and many other states that may allow police to escape sexual assault charges by claiming sex acts were consensual. While New York law already bars sexual contact between corrections workers and inmates, it doesn't apply explicitly to police.

""I was shocked,"" Democratic state Sen. Diane Savino said of when she learned of the oversight. ""It should be clear across the state for officers from every department, that when someone is in custody they do not have the ability to consent to sexual activity.""

Gov. Andrew Cuomo is part of a bipartisan push to close what the Democrat calls ""an egregious loophole"" with legislation that would make it clear that people in police custody cannot give consent. A bill has already passed the state Assembly and was pending in the Senate.

The case underscores a chronic problem that was documented in an Associated Press investigation in 2015 that found about 1,000 officers across the country had lost their badges in a six-year period for rape, sodomy and other sexual assault. That total didn't even include New York or California because those states didn't track the number of officers fired for such offenses.

Bowling Green State University criminal justice Professor Philip Stinson has studied sexual misconduct by police around the country and confirmed such loopholes exist in many state laws.

But he cautioned that the legislation in New York might create new loopholes. Citing cases in which officers requested sexual favors in exchange for dropping a ticket or the threat of arrest, Stinson said motorists or pedestrians stopped by police are still under the power of the officer even though they haven't been formally arrested or detained.

But laws are needed, he said, as are internal department policies and programs that make it easy and safe for victims to file complaints. A study released two years ago reviewed policies of 35 policy departments and found that only about half had rules relating to sexual misconduct by officers.

In New York City, for example, a police watchdog group announced just this past week that it will begin investigating allegations of sexual misconduct by officers. Previously, such allegations were handled internally by the department.

Stinson said his research shows that the small minority of officers who engage in sexual misconduct often target drug addicts, sex workers, children, young women or others that they believe will be too frightened to come forward.

""It's the most vulnerable girls and women - and sometimes teenage boys and men - that I worry about,"" he said. ""The ones who are perceived by officers as being throwaways.""

In New York, the two detectives resigned from the department before they were to face an administrative proceeding that could have resulted in their firing. Their criminal trial has yet to begin. Martins' attorney Mark Bederow wouldn't talk about the defense, but stopped short of saying his client denied all contact with the woman.

""The allegation that there was any non-consensual sexual activity is patently false,"" he said.

"Iceland male circumcision ban: MP behind plan 'didn't think it was necessary to consult' Jewish and Muslim groups, amid growing anger",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/iceland-male-circumcision-ban-religious-leaders-outrage-mp-bill-proposed-a8217696.html,"Religious leaders have reacted with outrage to a bill proposed by MPs in Iceland that would criminalise male circumcision.

The bill proposes a six-year prison term for anyone found guilty of “removing sexual organs in whole or in part”.

Salmann Tamimi, president of the Muslim Association of Iceland, described the proposal as an “attack on religion”.

Circumcising girls has been illegal in Iceland since 2005, but there are currently no laws to regulate the practice against boys.

Describing circumcision as a “violation” of young boys’ rights, the bill states the only time it should be considered is for “health reasons”.

Young men would be given the opportunity to decide for themselves once they reached the age of consent.

Male circumcision is one of the most common surgical procedures in the world, with one recent study estimating that around 38 per cent of men globally have undergone the procedure.

According to the same study, around half of circumcisions are carried out for religious or cultural reasons.

While the importance of male circumcision in Islam is disputed – some Muslim groups say it is obligatory, others only recommend it – it remains a major and celebrated rite wherever Islam is practised.

For Jews, circumcision carries profound religious significance and most baby boys born into Jewish families are circumcised within a week of birth.

The Bishop of Iceland, Agnes M Sigurðardóttir, has criticised the bill for criminalising the religious beliefs of Jews and Muslims, recommending instead a ban on unsafe circumcision.

In a statement to The Independent, Chief Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt, president of the Conference of European Rabbis, said he was “extremely concerned” about the proposed legislation.

“Whilst the Jewish population in Iceland is small, we cannot ignore the dangerous precedent this sets within Europe and the implications it has on Jews’ ability to carry out our religion in an open and free manner.”

A spokesperson for Milah UK, which campaigns to protect the right of the Jewish community to carry out male circumcision, described the practice as ""a non-negotiable element of Jewish identity"". A ban would make ""sustainable Jewish life in the country impossible,"" he said.

There are no official figures on the number of Jews living in Iceland but estimates in 2010 by the Pew Research Center suggest they make up less than 0.1 per cent of the population (fewer than 320 people).

Mr Tamimi said he was particularly concerned about the potential impact of the bill on the small Jewish community.

“Even if there is just one Jew, it is very bad to criminalise him,” he said. “It’s very bad for Iceland to get that name, that they don’t want Jews. This is one way of saying they are not welcome.”

He warned the legislation was an attack on religion more broadly – ""they are interfering in religious freedom” – and said he was frustrated that religious groups were not consulted before the legislation was proposed. “There was not a single word,” he said. “We read about it in the newspaper.”

Progressive Party MP Silja Dögg Gunnarsdóttir is the driving force behind the legislation.

“I didn’t think it was necessary to consult,” she told The Independent. “I don’t see it as a religious matter.”

“Jews are welcome in Iceland. But this is about child protection and children’s rights. That comes first, and before the religious rights of the adult.

“Every individual, it doesn’t matter what sex or how old… should be able to give informed consent for a procedure that is unnecessary, irreversible and can be harmful. His body, his choice.”

She said she was surprised when she learned that male circumcision was still legal, despite the ban on circumcising girls.

“The body parts are different, the procedures are different, but in both cases they can be lethal and harmful to the child,” she said.

Guidance issued in 2013 by the Nordic Ombudsmen for Children and paediatric experts concluded that “there are no health-related grounds to circumcise young boys in the Nordic countries”.

According to the paper, the procedure “violates fundamental medical-ethical principles, not least because the procedure is irreversible, painful and may cause serious complications"".

In the wake of that report, doctors working for Iceland’s national health system stopped carrying out the procedure.

Ms Gunnarsdóttir argued that if just one person has complications after circumcision, “that is one too many”.

But there is significant disagreement in the global medical community regarding the potential harms or benefits of male circumcision.

Mr Tamimi is keen to support any legislation that would make male circumcision safer. But he rejects a complete ban.

This bill “is built just on feelings without any thinking about what it means to criminalise circumcision”, he said. “We don’t accept it.”

The legislation has been debated once in the Icelandic parliament and will go through several stages of discussion and consultation before it could become law.",JustBadNews,0
China demands 'severe' punishment for American accused of breaking off terracotta warrior's thumb after selfie,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/19/china-condemns-us-man-stealing-terracotta-warriors-thumb-posing/,"China has demanded an American man be ""severely punished"" after he was alleged to have stolen a thumb from a terracotta warrior after taking a selfie with the statue while it was on display at a museum in the US.

There comes a time in everyone's life when they badly need to let the wind pass in a public space and no one should feel ashamed to some extent.It’s not always dignified but if you are about to have an accident then it’s a very good idea to rush for the nearby restroom and do the required business.An unidentified older gentleman on a Transavia Airlines plane was forcibly removed from the aircraft after it made an unscheduled stop in Vienna, Austria.Two men who were sitting next to the person in question asked the man to control the passing of wind, which has been going on for some time, according to the reports.The man may possible have a medical condition or doing it on purpose to irritate those around him but the smell of the wind was so bad that a fight reportedly broke out.After many warning from the staff and an intervention from the pilot personally, the team decided to force the plan to land so that police can handle the situation properly.Austrian police officers were alerted and came onboard with dogs to remove the flatulent individual.A video clip of the incident went viral after it was shared on social media by Alfred Dekker.Police also removed two sisters from the same row of seats, who were heard using abusive language and misbehaving as well.However, passenger Nora Lachhab said that they had done nothing wrong. She said, “It was crazy that we were included, we had no idea who these boys were, we just had the bad luck to be in the same row and we didn't do anything.”She continued, “They did not do anything to justify the bizarre behaviour of the Transavia crew. Do they sometimes think that all Moroccans cause problems? That's why we do not let it sit. We had to find our own flights home with another airline. All I will say is that the crew were really provocative and stirred things up.”The airline confirmed that four people had been issued with travel bans but those removed have not been arrested.A spokesperson from Transavia said in a statement, “Our crew must ensure a safe flight. When passengers pose risks, they immediately intervene - Our people are trained for that. They know very well where the boundaries are. Transavia is therefore square behind the cabin crew and the pilots.""This article originally appeared on The Independent",JustBadNews,0
"Turkey sentences six journalists to life in jail over alleged role in failed coup in 2016, condemned as devastating precedent that shows disregard for rule of law.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/16/turkey-sentences-six-journalists-life-imprisonment-failed-coup,"A Turkish court has sentenced six defendants, including three prominent journalists, to life in prison over allegations of involvement in a 2016 coup attempt, drawing fierce condemnation from the UN and press freedom advocates.

The convictions followed a months-long trial during which the prosecution alleged that the journalists sent “subliminal messages” via TV appearances and newspaper columns urging the overthrow of the government, and that they maintained contact with members of the Fethullah Gülen network, a movement widely believed in Turkey to have orchestrated the coup attempt.

The first conviction of media figures in relation to the failed putsch constitutes a major defeat for press freedom in the Nato member state, which has cracked down on dissent in the aftermath of the coup. At least 73 journalists remain behind bars, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which ranks Turkey the world’s worst jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt.

Fethullah Gülen: who is the man Turkey's president blames for coup attempt? Read more

The prominent journalists handed life sentences were the brothers Ahmet Altan and Mehmet Altan, who have been detained since 2016, and Nazlı Ilıcak. The conviction defies an order by Turkey’s highest court to release Mehmet Altan, after it found last month that his imprisonment had violated his constitutional rights.

“The court decision condemning journalists to aggravated life in prison for their work, without presenting substantial proof of their involvement in the coup attempt or ensuring a fair trial, critically threatens journalism and with it the remnants of freedom of expression and media freedom in Turkey,” said David Kaye, the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression.

Sarah Clarke, the policy and advocacy manager for the writers’ association PEN International, tweeted that the sentences marked an “apex of the disintegration of the rule of law in Turkey. “This sets a devastating precedent for scores of other journalists charged with similarly groundless charges,” Clarke wrote.

The International Press Institute said it was appalled by the verdict.

Ilıcak, 73, was one of the very first journalists arrested in July after the coup attempt. Briefly an MP from 1999, she wrote for several daily newspapers including Hurriyet. Ahmet Altan, 67, is a novelist and journalist who has written for some of papers including Hurriyet and Milliyet as well as founding the now closed opposition daily Taraf. Mehmet Altan, 65, has written books on Turkish politics.

The court also handed down life sentences to Yakup Şimşek, a former marketing manager for the Gülen-affiliated Zaman newspaper, Zaman layout designer Fevzi Yazıcı, and police academy instructor Şükrü Tuğrul Özsengül. Gülen has denied any links to the coup attempt.

The sentencing came on the same day another Turkish court ordered the release of Deniz Yücel, a German-Turkish journalist who spent just over a year in pre-trial detention without an indictment, in a case that tested relations between Ankara and Berlin and highlighted the precarious state of press freedom in Turkey.

A criminal court in Istanbul decided to release Yücel pending a trial after prosecutors said they had completed their investigation into the journalist. The court accepted the indictment filed by prosecutors, who are seeking an 18-year prison sentence over allegations of spreading propaganda on behalf of a terrorist organisation.

The order to release him was confirmed by the state-run Anadolu Agency, the German foreign minister, and Yücel’s lawyer, Veysel Ok, who tweeted a photograph of Yücel embracing his wife after he was freed.

The Die Welt correspondent was detained on 14 February 2017 after going to an Istanbul police station for questioning. He got married in prison and spent months in solitary confinement at Silivri maximum security prison outside Istanbul. He spent 366 days in detention without formal charges.

Yücel’s detention came amid a deep rift in relations between Germany and Turkey. Berlin barred Turkish ministers from holding rallies in Germany with Turkish citizens ahead of a referendum on presidential powers, and condemned growing authoritarianism under the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who in turn has condemned rising Islamophobia in Europe. Talks on Turkey’s future membership of the EU have been stalled for years.",JustBadNews,0
Entire family removed from Carnival Legend cruise ship over violent brawl,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-16/police-on-board-carnival-legend-after-violence/9454728,"An entire family group who were removed from a Carnival cruise after a brawl overnight were involved in other incidents during a 10-day South Pacific cruise, Carnival Australia says.

The company confirmed that the 23 people taken off the Carnival Legend by police were members of an extended family that became involved in ""violent and disruptive acts"" onboard about 1:30am.

Police boarded the vessel, anchored off Eden on the NSW far south coast on Friday, after the captain of the Legend refused to take the group any further.

Carnival Australia president Sture Myrmell told reporters in Sydney that the company had a zero-tolerance policy to ""excessive behaviour"".

""We felt we had to take immediate action to remove an element that has caused the disturbance onboard the ship, and that is in line with our policy on excessive behaviour,"" he said.

Vision taken by a passenger of the brawl that broke out in a restaurant area of the ship surfaced online.

Police said the brawl happened about 220 kilometres off the coast of Jervis Bay. ( Supplied: 3AW )

The ship's crew and security can be seen struggling to break up the fight and are seen kicking two men on the ground.

Ship staff attempted several times to stop the passenger from filming the violence.

Mr Myrmell was asked by reporters if the company's zero tolerance to excessive behaviour extended to members of the crew.

""Excessive behaviour of all kinds is something that we do not tolerate, regardless of guests or crew members, but until we have conducted the investigation, it's too early for us to comment,"" he said.

Booting family from cruise 'an unprecedented incident'

Jennifer Vandekreeke, vice-president and General Manager of Carnival Cruise Line, said the decision to remove an entire family group from a cruise was ""unprecedented"".

Police boarded the Carnival Legend to remove 23 passengers. ( Supplied: Carnival )

She also confirmed that the family had been involved in other incidents during the 10-day South Pacific cruise, but did not elaborate on the nature of the incidents.

""There were limited and isolated events with the family in question,"" she said.

""Disembarking a family from a cruise is an unprecedented incident.

""It is always our last resort.""

NSW police said they were investigating a fight between several men onboard the cruise ship which occurred while it was about 220 kilometres off the coast of Jervis Bay.

Police said six men and three teenage boys were removed from the ship and that a further 14 passengers, including women and children, also left the ship.

Crew of the ship tried to prevent the passenger from recording the fight. ( Supplied: 3AW )

The removed passengers were transported to Canberra Airport where other travel arrangements were made, police said.

Passengers were heard cheering loudly as the 23 passengers were removed from the ship.

One woman yelled that she had been mistreated on board as she was being removed.

North Korean Cheerleaders caught off guard by fake Kim Jong Un,https://reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1FY1ID,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - A group of North Korean cheerleaders were briefly wowed by the apparent, sudden arrival of their leader, Kim Jong Un, at a Winter Olympics ice hockey game on Wednesday.

Slideshow ( 8 images )

Some cheerleaders immediately averted their gaze as the impersonator, who later only identified himself as Howard, smiled and waved to crowds who came to watch a unified Korean team play Japan at the Pyeongchang Games.

“They are playing a good game, they scored one goal. As a president, it’s all I can ask for,” Howard told Reuters, shortly after plain-clothed officials from South Korea’s National Counter-terrorism Centre moved him away from the cheerleaders, who he said had been doing a very good job.

“I mean I trained them by myself so, of course, they’re the best in the world,” Howard said.

Howard had caused a commotion during last Friday’s opening ceremony when he and a person dressed as U.S. President Donald Trump were swiftly shown out of the stadium by security staff.

He said he was briefly detained inside a police office during Wednesday’s match then “politely asked” to leave.

“My face is too political,” the dejected impersonator said as he walked slowly out of the ice hockey stadium.

“I was born with this face, I’ve got to live with it.”

In North Korea, anyone impersonating a member of the ruling Kim family would be considered blasphemous. Images of the North Korean leadership are tightly choreographed and controlled by the reclusive nation’s state propagandists.

Still, Howard’s entrance was so spectacular that the North Korean cheerleaders struggled to stifle a quick laugh in between chants of “We are one!” and “Unify the motherland!”

“It shows you we’re human after all,” Howard said. “Doesn’t matter if they’re South or North Koreans, a sense of humor and a bit of political satire is always needed.”

Students walk out of anthropology lecture after professor uses the word ?n****r?,http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2018/02/students-walk-out-of-anthropology-lecture-after-professor-uses-the-word-nr,"Several students walked out of an anthropology lecture Tuesday afternoon when a professor allegedly asked a question in which he used the word “n****r,” according to several students in the class. Another student said he intends to drop the class due to the professor’s remarks.

Recordings of the incident were also provided to the ‘Prince.’

According to students, during lecture for the course ANT 212: Cultural Freedoms — Hate Speech, Blasphemy, and Pornography, anthropology professor Lawrence Rosen asked students, “What is worse, a white man punching a black man, or a white man calling a black man a n****r?”

The lecture focused on the topic of oppressive symbolism.

“He was describing what is acceptable as free speech and what is not,” explained Devyn Holliday ’18 in an interview with The Daily Princetonian.

According to students, Rosen allegedly said the word “n****r” twice more as part of discussions after his original question.

Rosen was unavailable for comment at the time of publication.

“All the black students were looking at each other, as if asking whether he actually said that,” said Destiny Salter ’20. There were about six black students in the lecture, Holliday said.

According to Holliday, E Jeremijenko-Conley ’20, who identifies as white, responded to Rosen by saying, “I’m not comfortable with a white professor using the N-word.”

Holliday told the ‘Prince’ that Malachi Byrd ’19 allegedly asked Rosen, “So are you just going to keep using the N-word?”

According to Salter, Rosen allegedly responded, “Yes, if I think it’s necessary.”

After this, Byrd walked out of lecture. Later on, three more students also walked out, according to Jeremijenko-Conley.

Byrd did not respond to request for comment.

Byrd later returned to class and allegedly confronted Rosen using an expletive, according to an anonymous source.

According to Holliday, Rosen did not directly address the students’ concerns. Instead, he walked around the question, and defended his use of language. Rosen allegedly said, “It’s supposed to deliver a gut punch, so that’s why I used it.”

“Every single time he used the N-word, he used the word in its entirety,” said Salter. “He said ‘you need to suspend your disbelief for the sake of this class.’”

Byrd eventually re-entered the hall and asked if the professor would continue to use the word n****r in lecture. Students began to argue with Rosen, demanding he apologize. Holliday and Salter both said that the students argued with Rosen for the duration of lecture, because he would not give an apology.

According to Salter, Rosen allegedly said in the class, “I don’t think I need to apologize; I did not oppress anyone.”

Holliday expressed concern that before changing the topic of the lecture to pornograhic images, he said to students, “I’m going to give you the option of whether you’d like to see them.”

However, this option was not provided before Rosen said the N-word, according to Holliday.

Jeremijenko-Conley and Salter said that they filed a complaint with Justine Levine, director of studies for Rockefeller College.

Levine said in an email that she will work with the students to resolve the issue, according to Jeremijenko-Conley and Salter.

Kevin Ramos ’21 said he plans to drop the class in light of the incident.

“The professor saw how uncomfortable the students were with his language,” said Ramos. “If he doesn’t respect the students’ opinion, then it’s not worth learning from him.”

Rosen has been awarded a MacArthur Fellowship as well as Guggenheim Fellowship for Social Sciences.",JustBadNews,0

German court rules Facebook use of personal data illegal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-facebook/german-court-rules-facebook-use-of-personal-data-illegal-idUSKBN1FW1FI?il=0,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A German consumer rights group said on Monday that a court had found Facebook’s use of personal data to be illegal because the U.S. social media platform did not adequately secure the informed consent of its users.

FILE PHOTO - A giant logo is seen at Facebook's headquarters in London, Britain, December 4, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville

The verdict, from a Berlin regional court, comes as Big Tech faces increasing scrutiny in Germany over its handling of sensitive personal data that enables it to micro-target online advertising.

The Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzvb) said that Facebook’s default settings and some of its terms of service were in breach of consumer law, and that the court had found parts of the consent to data usage to be invalid.

“Facebook hides default settings that are not privacy-friendly in its privacy center and does not provide sufficient information about it when users register,” said Heiko Duenkel, litigation policy officer at the vzvb.

“This does not meet the requirement for informed consent.” The vzvb posted a copy of the ruling on its website. A court spokesperson confirmed that a judgment had been handed down but declined further comment.

FACEBOOK TO APPEAL

Facebook said it would appeal, even though several aspects of the court judgment had been in its favor. In a statement, it said it had already made significant changes to its terms of service and data protection guidelines since the case was first brought in 2015.

“We are working hard to ensure that our guidelines are clear and easy to understand, and that the services offered by Facebook are in full accordance with the law,” Facebook said.

Further, Facebook would in the meantime update its data protection guidelines and its terms of service so that they comply with new European Union-wide rules that are due to enter force in June.

Facebook, which counts more than 2 billion users worldwide, already faces scrutiny from Germany’s competition authorities over its handling of its users’ personal data.

The Federal Cartel Office, in an interim update on an investigation into Facebook, said in December that it objected to the way the company gains access to third-party data when an account is opened.

This includes tapping information from its own WhatsApp and Instagram products - as well as how it tracks which sites its users access.

One concern highlighted by the consumer rights group was that, in Facebook’s app for smartphones, a service was pre-activated that revealed the user’s location to the person they were chatting to.

Also, in the privacy settings, ticks were already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user’s timeline, meaning that anyone would be able quickly and easily to find a user’s profile.

“The judges ruled that all five of the default settings on Facebook that vzvb complained about are invalid,” the group said in a statement, adding that several other of Facebook’s terms of use were found to be illegal.",JustBadNews,0
"YouTube suspends Logan Paul's ad revenue, blames 'recent pattern of behavior",https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16994364/logan-paul-youtube-suspends-advertising,"Has controversial YouTuber Logan Paul changed? It seems YouTube doesn’t think so. Citing his “recent pattern of behavior,” the Google-owned platform announced this morning that it had “temporarily suspended” ads on Paul’s channels — stopping an income stream estimated to be worth more than a million dollars a month.

In a statement given to The Verge, a YouTube spokesperson said: “After careful consideration, we have decided to temporarily suspend ads on Logan Paul’s YouTube channels. This is not a decision we made lightly, however, we believe he has exhibited a pattern of behavior in his videos that makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers but also potentially damaging to the broader creator community.”

According to YouTube, this behavior includes a number of different incidents. Most notably, the YouTuber caused international controversy when he filmed a suicide victim in Japan’s Aokigahara forest at the beginning of the year. He stopped producing his daily vlog for a month in response to the outcry, but returned to the platform late last month, claiming he had learned from his mistakes and grown as an individual.

YouTube says his infractions include trying to monetize a video that violates the company’s advertiser-friendly guidelines, encouraging his followers to do the Tide Pod challenge, and, in one recent video, taking a fish out of his pond to jokingly give it CPR and then tasering a dead rat.

In response to Logan Paul’s recent pattern of behavior, we’ve temporarily suspended ads on his channels. — YouTube Creators (@YTCreators) February 9, 2018

From YouTube’s statement, it’s clear that the company is not just concerned with Paul’s moral development, but how his actions might cause controversy for advertisers. Its guidance on this are clear: “If you monetize content that violates our guidelines, you may lose access to monetization features.”

Suspending all ads on Paul’s channels would be the harshest punishment YouTube has doled out to Paul thus far. Following his vlog from Japan’s so-called “suicide forest,” the company initially responded with a lukewarm statement saying it “prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner.” The company later removed Paul from its lucrative Google Preferred platform, which gives advertisers easy access to the most popular YouTubers, and suspended his content deals with paid streaming service YouTube Red.

At the time, though, YouTube said it was exploring “further consequences” for Paul, and now seems to have found some. Social media analysts SocialBlade estimate that Paul earns up to $1.2 million a month in ad revenue from his YouTube channels. This income stream is now on hold, though for how long is uncertain. It’s worth noting also that this is only part of Paul’s business, with the YouTuber relentlessly promoting his clothing line and merchandise in each video. It’s not clear how much money he makes from these sales.

Canadian man charged for allegedly breaching abortion clinic no-protest zone,https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/wj4d5x/man-charged-for-allegedly-breaching-abortion-clinic-no-protest-zone,"An Ottawa man is facing what appear to be the first charges laid under a week-old law that implemented no-protest buffer zones around all abortion clinics across Ontario.

Ottawa Police arrested the man on Wednesday near The Morgantaler Clinic and charged him with violating the Safe Access to Abortion Services Act, which came into effect on Feb. 1 as a way to protect women who access abortion-related healthcare. The man’s identity is currently unknown, something that’s typical for provincial offences.

Police spokesperson Marc Sousy told VICE News that investigators are still waiting to hear from the courts about the exact wording of the offences the man will face as the law is still brand new.

There’s a 164-foot protest-free zone around all eight abortion clinics in Ontario in which no forms of protest, harassment or intimidation of patients accessing them can take place. Other health facilities such as hospitals and pharmacies may submit an application to the province to implement similar buffer zones of more than 490 feet.

Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said last year he was inspired to pursue such a law in response to rising rates of anti-abortion activities, including at a clinic in his riding where a woman reported being spat on by protesters outside. Similar measures to protect access to abortion services also exist in British Columbia, Newfoundland, and Quebec.

The Ottawa man was carrying a sandwich board outside the clinic with a sign that read: “Freedom of Expression and Religion, No Censorship” with a large crucifix above it, according to the Ottawa Citizen.

Amanda Carver, an organizer with the Ottawa Women’s March on Parliament Hill, told the newspaper that she also saw the man near the clinic.

“He chose that specific location to deliver a specific message to people accessing that clinic,” she said. “Sure, his signage is off, but how is this not menacing people accessing the clinic?”

The man, who will appear in Provincial Offences Court on March 23, could face a fine of $5,000 for his first offence under the Act or up to six months in jail. Repeat offenders can face fines of up to $10,000 and a year in jail.

In response to concerns over whether the no-protest zone law compromises free expression, Naqvi has argued the law does no such thing.",JustBadNews,0

"NJ dealer caught with 83 bricks of heroin gets 6 months of rehab, no prison",http://nj1015.com/nj-dealer-caught-with-83-bricks-of-heroin-gets-6-months-of-rehab-no-prison/,"TOMS RIVER — An admitted drug dealer who was caught with about 4,150 doses of heroin worth $25,000 was sentenced to just six months of rehab and five years of probation.

Gary Fox, 30, of Toms River, who has a criminal record that includes previous drug convictions, avoided prison by being accepted by Drug Court and pleading guilty to two counts of third-degree possession with intent to distribute and a count of possession.

Fox, however, does face an alternate prison sentence of 10 years in prison with 3 1/2 years of parole ineligibility if he fails to complete the Drug Court program, according to a spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, who added Wednesday that the sentence was not a result of a plea deal with prosecutors.

The Drug Courts, part of Gov. Chris Christie's reform efforts in the wake of a massive heroin addiction epidemic gripping the state, are meant to provide drug users with rehabilitation instead of placing them behind bars. Drug Courts, however, are not for violent or hardened criminals.

The courts found Fox eligible for the program and he began rehab in November, remaining in custody until his guilty plea in January, prosecutors said. Court records show he spent 168 days in county jail.

Toms River police arrested Fox in May, saying he had 80 wax folds of heroin and $740 in cash. A search of his storage unit found an additional 83 bricks of heroin, which amounted to 4,150 doses and a cash value of close to $25,000, police said at the time.

A month later, police at his Old Street home found another 40 wax folds of heroin, more than 1.5 pounds of marijuana, $2,000 in cash, prescription medications, a scale and packaging materials.

Fox was initially charged with possession of heroin, possession of heroin with intent to distribute, possession of over 50 grams of marijuana, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of Alprazolam and Suboxone, and possession of drug paraphernalia.

He plead guilty to two counts of third-degree possession with intent to distribute and one count of possession.

Police on Tuesday said they could not provide more details about the investigation.

This is not the first time Fox has been sentenced to rehab as a result of drug charges.

In 2009, he received the same sentence from a different judge in Ocean County for arrests in 2006 and 2007 on charges of possession of cocaine and Percocet.

Fox was represented by the Public Defender's Office.

The RTA reported the email to Dubai Police.

Presiding judge Mohammad Jamal handed out the Dhs500,000 fine for mocking and offending a government department via email after the defendant pleaded not guilty.

“The mobile device that was used in the crime will be confiscated. The defendant will be deported following the completion of his punishment,” he was quoted as saying.

McDonald's french fries might lead to a cure for baldness. No, not by eating them.

Researchers at Japan's Yokohama National University used a chemical found in the fries to grow hair follicles on mice, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Biomaterials.

The study focuses on the large-scale transportation of hair follicles to areas where there is no hair. Researchers used dimethylpolysiloxane as part of an ""oxygen permeable"" solution to prepare 5,000 hair follicle germs.

""These self-sorted hair follicle germs were shown to be capable of efficient hair-follicle and shaft generation upon intracutaneous transplantation into the backs of nude mice,"" reads an excerpt from the study.

Although researchers note more studies are required, the findings could lead to a potential strategy for hair regeneration.

According to nutrition information found on McDonald's website, dimethylpolysiloxane is used as an anti-foaming agent in the oil used to fry foods including french fries, Chicken McNuggets and fried fish sandwiches.

Adam Schiff sent his staff to try and collect 'classified materials for the FBI' after Russian pranksters told him Putin has NAKED blackmail pictures of Trump,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5355713/Adam-Schiff-spoofed-Russian-claim-nude-Trump-pic.html,"The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee was the victim of a prank phone call by Russian comedians who offered to give him 'compromising' dirt on Donald Trump – including nude photos of the president and a Russian reality show star.

DailyMail.com can disclose that after the prank, his staff engaged in correspondence with what they thought was a Ukrainian politician to try to obtain the 'classified' material promised on the call.

On an audio recording of the prank call posted online, Adam Schiff can be heard discussing the committee's Russia investigation and increasingly bizarre allegations about Trump with a man who claimed to be Andriy Parubiy, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament.

The call, made a year ago, was actually from two Russian comedians nicknamed 'Vovan' and 'Lexus' who have become notorious for their phony calls to high-ranking American officials and celebrities, including UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Elton John.

Its existence was first reported by The Atlantic but not how a staff member working for the minority on the House Intelligence Committee pursued the information after the call.

Schiff's office said the congressman suspected the call was 'bogus' from the beginning and reported it to authorities afterward.

But in a recording of the eight minute conversation, Schiff appeared to take the call seriously – or at least played along convincingly - and emails from the Democrat's staff to the fake politician afterwards said he had found it 'productive'.

Spoofed: Adam Schiff, the ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, had a seven-minute conversation with Russian comedians who offered him fake 'kompromat' including naked pictures of the president, which he said he would report to the FBI

Elaborate story: The two claimed that Trump had an affair with Russian glamour model Olga Buzova (left) after a Miss Universe pageant in 2013 - and that naked pictures of him were passed to Vladimir Putin by his 'goddaughter' Ksenia Sobchak (right)

Russian pranksters: Vladimir 'Vovan' Kuznetsov, 30, and Alexei 'Lexus' Stolyarov, 28, called Schiff and persuaded him to stay on the call for seven minutes as they outlined their fake claims

Laughed at: Vovan and Lexus posted their Schiff call to YouTube. Vovan posed as 'chairman' Andriy Parubiy for the call, and the duo then engaged in an e-mail correspondence with Schiff's staff

Feud: The president has attacked 'Little Adam Schiff' on Twitter and accused him of leaking

Schiff began the call by thanking the 'chairman' Andriy Parubiy for his time and warning him that Russian spies were likely listening in.

'I would caution that our Russian friends may be listening to the conversation so I wouldn't share anything over the phone that you wouldn't want them to hear,' said Schiff.

Vovan, who was posing as Parubiy, reassured Schiff: 'I don't think that will impact on our investigation.'

The fake Parubiy claimed the Ukrainian government had obtained recordings and documents that proved Vladimir Putin was blackmailing Trump with naked photos taken during an affair between the president and a Russian glamour model.

Vovan also claimed the Ukrainians recorded secret meetings between a Trump campaign aide and a famous Russian singer-turned-spy that took place at a non-existent mafia hangout in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brighton Beach.

Schiff appeared to be taking notes on the conversation and repeatedly asked for spellings of names and documentation he could send to the FBI.

I'll be in touch with the FBI about this. And we'll make arrangements with your staff. I think it probably would be best to provide these materials both to our committee and to the FBI Schiff to bogus Ukrainian politician

'I'll be in touch with the FBI about this. And we'll make arrangements with your staff. I think it probably would be best to provide these materials both to our committee and to the FBI,' said Schiff during the conversation, which lasted around eight minutes according to the recording posted to YouTube.

A spokesperson for Schiff confirmed he was on the call but claimed the congressman had suspicions that the caller might not be Parubiy and reported it to law enforcement last April.

'Both before and after the call, we were aware that it was likely bogus and had already alerted appropriate law enforcement personnel, as well as after the call,' the spokesperson said.

'Obviously, it was bogus - which became even more evident during the call - but as with any investigation that is global in scale, we have to chase any number of leads, many of which turn out to be duds.'

The spokesperson declined to address on the record why a staff member pursued the 'politician' after the call if the congressman thought it was fake.

The FBI said it could not comment on whether it received or investigated any information about nude Trump photos or other alleged Russian 'Kompromat' from Schiff.

'We do not disclose whether not a complaint has been received,' an FBI spokesman told DailyMail.com. 'We neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.'

Center of claims: The elaborate plot revolved around the idea that Putin had been given naked pictures of Trump during an affair the now president conducted briefly at the 2013 Miss Universe.

Correspondence: These are the emails one of the professional staff on the Democratic minority exchanged with the 'politician' and the material which the comedian said he sent to the staffer.

Schiff and Trump have publicly feuded over the past week in the wake of a classified memo released by House Intelligence Committee Republicans, which alleged that the FBI used abusive tactics to obtain a surveillance warrant against a Trump campaign aide.

Schiff has been one of the most high profile Democrats in congress investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials during the election.

Trump slammed Schiff on Twitter on Monday, calling the congressman 'Little Adam Schiff' and claiming he leaked classified information from closed hearings of the House Intelligence Committee.

'Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper!' said Trump on Twitter. 'Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!'

The congressman from California shot back that the president was spreading 'false smears.'

'[T]he American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else,' said Schiff on Twitter.

The comedians Vovan and Lexus – whose real names are Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov – drew international attention last year for their prank calls to Turkish President Recep Erdogan and Sen. John McCain.

The phone conversation with Schiff took place early last April as the House Intelligence Committee ramped up its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election.

Vovan and Lexus told DailyMail.com that it took them just 30 minutes to get the congressman on the phone after calling his office pretending to be Parubiy.

'[Schiff] was pretty serious. He wrote all what we said on the paper. Remembered all the details,' said Lexus.

Lexus said the congressman's aide also followed up with them by email after the call and asked them to send the materials to the Ukrainian embassy so that one of Schiff's staffers could pick up the documents.

The comedians claimed they would transfer the documents to Schiff through the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Valeriy Chaly.

Lexus and Vovan provided emails to the DailyMail.com which appear to show Schiff's staff discussing the documents after the call.

'I understand Mr. Schiff had a productive call with Mr. Parubiy, and that Mr. Parubiy would like to make some material available to Mr. Schiff through your embassy,' wrote Schiff aide Rheanne Wirkkala to the pranksters, according to the April 4, 2017 email.

'Please let me know how best to arrange pick-up of those materials from your Embassy in Washington, D.C.,' the email continued.

In another email on April 5, 2017, Schiff's aide asked: 'do you know when we might be able to meet your colleagues at the Ukrainian embassy here in Washington, DC to pick up materials?'

Schiff's office did not respond to a request to confirm the emails.

During the call, the pranksters concocted an elaborate story about Trump having a tryst with a Russian glamour model named Olga Buzova after a Miss Universe pageant in 2013, which led to Vladimir Putin obtaining nude photos of the president.

Other individuals they claimed were involved in the scheme included a former Playboy model and Russian journalist named Ksenia Sobchak and Russian pop star Arkadiy Ukupnik.

Buzova 'got compromising materials on Trump after their short relations,' one of the pranksters told Schiff.

'And what's the nature of the Kompromat?' asked Schiff.

'Well, there were pictures of naked Trump,' said the caller.

The pranksters told Schiff that Sobchak was a Russian secret agent and Putin's goddaughter, and claimed she gave the Russian leader the compromising pictures of Trump to use as blackmail.

Meeting: The prank call claimed that disgraced national security advisor General Mike Flynn ad agreed to drop sanctions against Russia

Venue and codeword: Trump met Russia figures in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and was also told to use 'It rains again on Brighton Beach' as a codeword. They told Schiff to use it to Trump to see his reaction

Two-part claim: The pranksters also suggested that Schiff use the passcode 'The weather is good on Deribasivska' the next time he talks to Trump and 'look at how his face will change color'. The street is in Odessa, the Black Sea port in Ukraine

They also claimed the Russian government used pop star Ukupnik as a go-between to meet with former Trump aide Mike Flynn at a mafia-run restaurant in the Russian neighborhood of Brighton Beach, New York.

'It was Russian singer, very famous singer, Arkadiy Ukupnik, who met with Mr. Flynn on Brighton Beach in Brooklyn in special Russian café Langeron,' said the prankster.

'And do you know what was discussed?' asked Schiff.

The prankster said they 'discussed many things' and used passwords to recognize each other, including 'It rains again on Brighton Beach' and 'The weather is good on Deribasivska.'

Schiff, seeming to have difficulty understanding Deribasivska, the name of a street in Odessa, asked the caller to repeat himself several times.

In fact Weather Is Good on Deribasovskaya, It Rains Again on Brighton Beach is the name of a 1992 Russian-American comedy movie about secret agents, with its title taken from the intentionally absurd passwords they use.

The street has slightly different names in Ukrainian and Russian and the comedian used the Ukrainian version.

Schiff eventually said he would have his staff call the Ukrainian legislator's office later to 'get spellings and more details on this.'

The prankster promised to send the materials, and also offered to have Sobchak and Buzova extradited to the United States 'and you can put them to your special jail Guantanamo.'

'Well, I'll be in touch with the FBI about this,' said Schiff. 'And we'll make arrangements with your staff. I think it probably would be best to provide these materials both to our committee and to the FBI. So we'll make arrangements between my staff and yours on how to facilitate that. And we'll also obviously let the FBI know about Buzova and Sobchak's plans to travel to Ukraine.'

The caller also suggested that Schiff use the passcode 'The weather is good on Deribasivska' the next time he talks to Trump and 'look at how his face will change color.'

'And so those passwords were used with Mr. Trump?' said Schiff.

'Yes, of course,' said the caller.

'We will be back in touch with you through our staff to make arrangements to obtain these materials for our committee and the FBI. I appreciate you reaching out to us,' said Schiff.

The comedians posted the video of the call online with the caption: 'Democratic Senator Adam Schiff believed Russian prankers Lexus and Vovan that Ukrainian intelligence has confirmation that Russian 'scouts' Ksenia Sobchak , Olga Buzova and Arkady Ukupnik collected dirt on US President Donald Trump.'",JustBadNews,0

Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to plan a military parade that would see soldiers marching and tanks rolling down the streets of Washington, it was reported on Tuesday.

The move was instantly criticised, with one veterans’ group comparing the president to “a wannabe banana republic strongman”.

Trump is seeking a grand parade similar to the Bastille Day celebration in Paris, according to the Washington Post. He outlined the plan at a meeting at the Pentagon on 18 January that included defense secretary Jim Mattis and joint chiefs of staff chairman General Joseph Dunford, the paper said, citing an unnamed military official.

“The marching orders were: I want a parade like the one in France,” the official told the Post. “This is being worked at the highest levels of the military.”

The White House confirmed that an event is in the works, though it did not offer further details. “President Trump is incredibly supportive of America’s great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,” press secretary Sarah Sanders said. “He has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation.”

Trump, who did not serve in the Vietnam war after receiving five draft deferments, has long spoken of his admiration for tough military figures such as General George Patton and frequently makes reference to “my generals”.



The president was deeply impressed by a parade in Paris on 14 July last year. American and French soldiers marched together on the Avenue des Champs-Elysees to mark the centenary of America’s entry into the first world war and France’s annual Bastille Day holiday. It included tanks, armoured vehicles and a flyover of US and French military jets.

Trump told reporters in September: “To a large extent because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on the Fourth of July in Washington down Pennsylvania Avenue. We’re actually looking into it.”

But not for the first time in Trump’s short political career, such a display is likely to prove divisive. On Tuesday retired general Paul Eaton, senior adviser to VoteVets, a progressive political action committee for military veterans, said: “Donald Trump has continually shown himself to have authoritarian tendencies, and this is just another worrisome example.”

In the past, Eaton noted, Trump has praised the tactics of autocrats such as Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin. He added: “Unfortunately, we do not have a commander in chief right now as much as have a wannabe banana republic strongman.”

Richard Painter, former White House ethics lawyer for George W Bush, tweeted: “Cool. Just like in North Korea and Russia. But what do we do about those traitors who don’t clap during our Dear Leader’s speech?” – a reference to Trump’s criticism of Democrats who did not applaud during his state of the union address.

And journalist Joy Reid wrote on Twitter: “Oh my god ... he wants to be Kim Jong-un.”

A date for the event has not yet been chosen. Options include Memorial Day on 28 May, Independence Day on 4 July and Veterans Day on 11 November, which would coincide with the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. If the route includes Pennsylvania Avenue, it would pass by Trump’s controversial hotel.

But the Post added: “The cost of shipping Abrams tanks and high-tech hardware to Washington could run in the millions, and military officials said it was unclear how they would pay for it.”

Thomas Crosson, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said: “We are aware of the request and are in the process of determining specific details. We will share more information throughout the planning process.”",JustBadNews,0

The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2018

In reality, thousands marched in London over the weekend to demand more National Health Service (NHS) funding, which has been slashed as a result of British Conservatives' relentless agenda of austerity and privatization.

""They are marching to protect [the NHS],"" British journalist David Ottewell wrote in response to the U.S. president. ""Not to replace it with a privatized system.""

Despite its issues, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) works much better than American healthcare.

Trump's tweet comes months after the GOP attempted to ram through a bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and taken healthcare from as many as 32 million Americans.

While Republicans and the president have largely abandoned their efforts to totally repeal the ACA, they remain engaged in a campaign to sabotage the law on numerous fronts.

Meanwhile, an unprecedented number of Democrats have co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) Medicare for All bill, which he introduced last September.

Polls conducted over the past year have consistently found that a growing number of Americans are rapidly ""shifting toward the political left"" on healthcare and embracing the idea of a publicly-funded system that guarantees coverage to all as a right.

According to an AP/NORC poll published last July, 62 percent of Americans believe it is ""the federal government's responsibility to make sure that all Americans have health care coverage."" Under the current U.S. healthcare system, nearly 30 million Americans lack healthcare—a number that has risen significantly since Trump took office.

Trump has even signaled support for ""universal healthcare"" and praised the publicly-funded healthcare systems of other nations in the past, as many were quick to note in response to his tweet on Monday.",JustBadNews,0
Newsweek Fires Editors and Reporter Who Investigated the Company,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/business/media/newsweek-firings.html,"Two top editors and a reporter at Newsweek were fired on Monday, and two other reporters left in limbo, in a purge that targeted employees involved in coverage of the company’s financial and legal troubles.

The Median Young Family Has Nearly Zero Wealth,http://peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/02/05/the-median-young-family-has-nearly-zero-wealth/,"Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, I calculated various wealth series for young families with heads below the age of 35.

Here is median net worth for young families. I include both the net worth concept used by the Federal Reserve and a modified net worth concept that excludes vehicles. Insofar as vehicles are rapidly depreciating consumer durables, many argue that they should not be counted as assets for these purposes. Without these vehicles, the median young family had a net worth of $1,250 in 2016. This was down from the $7,846 peak in 1995.

Here is the same graph but using means rather than medians.

The next graph provides greater detail for the mean wealth of young families. It shows the value of various assets that go into calculating mean wealth. One major trend here was the run up of home values just before the Great Recession. In 2007, the mean young family had primary residence assets equal to $113,079. In 2016, they only had primary residence assets equal to $69,076.

The next graph also provides greater detail for the mean wealth of young families. It differs from the prior graph in that it shows major debt categories rather than major asset categories. Once again, the most conspicuous trend here is the run up of home debt during the housing bubble and the subsequent decline of that debt after the bubble burst.

Another major debt trend is student debt. This is better seen in the graph below, which shows how debt levels have changed in percent terms since 1989. Student debt increased over this period by 702%. The next closest debt category was vehicle debt, which only increased by 40.7%.

Rising student debt levels in part reflect the fact that more kids are going to college than ever before. This ever-increasing rate of college attendance is promoted on the theory that pushing people through college increases aggregate “human capital,” which will drive incomes higher. But the incomes of young families haven’t gone up. Both the mean and median income of young families peaked in 2001.

Younger people have lower incomes, higher debts, and virtually no wealth to speak of. They have seen their schooling not pay off and spent the entirety of their young working life in an economy operating below full employment. You don’t need to be an economic reductionist to understand why they were primed for Bernie Sanders and why so many view “socialism” favorably.",JustBadNews,0

'This is over': Puigdemont's Catalan independence doubts caught on camera,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/31/this-is-over-puigdemonts-catalan-independence-doubts-caught-on-camera,"The ousted Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, has admitted privately that his attempt to secure regional independence is over and claims he has been sacrificed by his own side, according to messages sent to a colleague and captured by TV cameras.



On Wednesday, a Spanish TV show published messages that Puigdemont had sent to his former health minister Toni Comín while the latter was at an event in Leuven, Belgium, the previous evening.

Profile Who is Carles Puigdemont? Show In a little over a decade, Carles Puigdemont has gone from obscurity to becoming the Spanish government’s bête noire and the pubic face of the Catalan independence movement.

A staunch and long-standing independence campaigner who has been the regional president of Catalonia since January 2016, Puigdemont was born to a family of bakers in the Catalan province of Girona in 1962. He studied Catalan philology at university before becoming a journalist on the Girona-based daily El Punt and helping to launch Catalonia Today, an English-language paper. He was elected in 2006 to the Catalan parliament as an MP for the Convergence and Union party representing the Girona region and five years later became the mayor of Girona. Puigdemont found himself thrust into the Catalan presidency in January 2016 after his predecessor, Artur Mas, stepped aside to facilitate the formation of a pro-independence coalition government.

Sent using the Signal messaging app and written in Catalan, the texts were caught by a TV camera behind Comín and aired by Telecinco’s Ana Rosa programme.



They mention “the last days of republican Catalonia” and suggest the deposed leader is preparing to abandon his attempt to return to office.

“I guess you’ve realised that this is over,” reads one. “Our people have sacrificed us. Or at least me.” It goes on to refer to the pro-independence Catalan MP Joan Tardà, who suggested at the weekend that Puigdemont could step aside to allow another candidate to become president: “You will be ministers (I hope and wish) but I’ve already been sacrificed just like Tardà said.”

Another says “The [Spanish government’s] plan has won,” before expressing the hope that the victory will lead to the release of the four Catalan leaders in prison.

The texts were sent around the same time that Puigdemont issued a defiant message on social media, calling for unity and saying he intended to return to the presidency after last December’s election, in which pro-independence parties held on to their majority in the regional parliament.

Appearing in a video hours after the speaker of the Catalan parliament postponed a debate on the presidential investiture, in which Puigdemont was the only candidate, the former leader said he was intent on resuming office.



He confirmed on Wednesday morning that he had sent the messages, but insisted he was still the best candidate to represent the Catalan people.



“I am a journalist and I have always understood that there are limits, such as privacy, which should never be violated,” he wrote on Twitter. “I am human and I, too, have moments of doubt. I am also the president and I will not fold or back away out of respect for the gratitude I feel towards – and the commitment I have – to the citizens and the nation. Onwards!”

Timeline Eight key moments in the Catalan independence campaign Show Spain’s constitutional court strikes down parts of a 2006 charter on Catalan autonomy that had originally increased the region’s fiscal and judicial powers and described it as a “nation”. The court rules that using the word “nation” has no legal value and also rejects the “preferential” use of Catalan over Spanish in municipal services. Almost two weeks later, hundreds of thousands protest on the streets of Barcelona, chanting “We are a nation! We decide!” At the height of Spain’s economic crisis, more than a million people protest in Barcelona on Catalonia’s national day, demanding independence in what will become a peaceful, annual show of strength. The pro-independence government of Artur Mas defies the Madrid government and Spain’s constitutional court by holding a symbolic vote on independence. Turnout is just 37%, but more than 80% of those who voted - 1.8 million people - vote in favour of Catalan sovereignty. Carles Puigdemont, who has replaced Mas as regional president, announces an independence referendum will be held on 1 October. Spain’s central government says it will block the referendum using all the legal and political means at its disposal. The Catalan parliament approves referendum legislation after a heated, 11-hour session that sees 52 opposition MPs walk out of the chamber in Barcelona in protest at the move. Spain’s constitutional court suspends the legislation the following day, but the Catalan government vows to press ahead with the vote. Police arrest 14 Catalan government officials suspected of organising the referendum and announce they have seized nearly 10 million ballots destined for the vote. Some 40,000 people protest against the police crackdown in Barcelona and Puigdemont accuses the Spanish government of effectively suspending regional autonomy and declaring a de facto state of emergency. Close to 900 people are injured as police attempt to stop the referendum from taking place. The Catalan government says 90% voted for independence on a turnout of 43%. Spanish government takes control of Catalonia and dissolves its parliament after secessionist Catalan MPs voted to establish an independent republic. Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, fires regional president, Carles Puigdemont, and orders regional elections to be held on 21 December.

A spokesman for Puigdemont’s Catalan European Democratic party declined to comment on the messages, saying: “We don’t send out WhatsApp [sic] messages, we send out official messages like the one Puigdemont sent last night. That’s what’s important to us.”



Comín’s lawyer told the Catalan radio station RAC1 that while he did “not deny the veracity” of the leaked messages, they had been obtained “in an illegal manner” and would result in legal action against Telecinco.

Catalonia has been under the direct control of the Spanish government since the end of October, when the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, responded to the Catalan parliament’s unilateral declaration of independence by sacking Puigdemont and calling fresh elections. Puigdemont fled to Brussels shortly afterwards and faces arrest on possible charges of rebellion, sedition and misuses of public funds if he returns to Spain.",JustBadNews,0
German police sue American woman for slander for calling them 'Nazis',https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/26/german-police-sue-american-woman-slander-calling-them-nazis/1068397001/,"German police sue American woman for slander for calling them 'Nazis'

Deutsche Welle | USA TODAY

An angry American traveler found herself plunged into German legal waters this month after allegedly calling federal police officers ""Nazis"" during a dispute at Frankfurt International Airport.

Police say the woman, a 49-year-old professor, became ""unreasonable and irritated"" when they told her she had too many liquids in her carry-on during a screening for explosives.

The issue of too many liquids morphed quickly — by her own account – into a tail-chasing argument over her deodorant: They insisted it must go; she claimed that made no sense since it was a solid.

It was approximately at this point that police allege she called them ""f--ing bastards"" and ""f--ing German Nazi police."" But she says she never called the police ""Nazis."" What they heard was her wondering why she caught flack instead of the ""Nazi-looking dude"" with a ""Hitler's youth haircut"" in line behind her.

The result of the altercation: preliminary criminal proceedings against the woman on suspicion of slander, plus a $260-bill (€207) upfront for any subsequent legal expenses. Days later, her case got worse when she published an incendiary 4,000-word tirade about the incident in the Huffington Post.

Why it's such a big deal

Nazi insults have a long history in postwar Germany, mainly in the form of comparisons to Hitler or Goebbels or references to the Gestapo and concentration camps. In 1947, Der Spiegel nicknamed the minister for denazification the ""blond Hitler,"" in a not-so-subtle reminder that he had been very friendly with the regime before it collapsed. Less than 20 years later, a West German paper compared East Germany to a concentration camp with its leader Walther Ulbricht as the overseer.

None of this, however, means these comparisons have ever been acceptable in Germany. As linguist Thorsten Eitz notes in a 2010 essay called Loaded words, each time this taboo is broken publicly, the media quickly reprimand the word choice ""because it violates the consensus in German society about the singular nature of Nazi crimes."" Hence, it's a disproportionate comparison.

The disproportion is even greater when it's hurled at an individual, says Heidrun Kämper, an expert in cultural linguistics and terminology at the Institute for the German Language in Mannheim.

Calling someone a Nazi invokes ""the entire spectrum of a totalitarian dictatorship, the belief in conforming to one reality,"" Kämper tells DW. ""It conjures up the oppression known under that type of state.""

And, of course, the word formation lends itself well, she says. Nazi. Two syllables like the crack of a whip, and much more biting than calling someone the word it's derived from: ""Nationalsozialist.""

The line between slander and freedom of speech

Despite outcry over minimizing the horrors of the Third Reich by relativizing this word, cases still test the line between freedom of speech and slander.

In April 2017 two lawsuits – one against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party's Alice Weidel and the other against Green politician Volker Beck – gave more leeway to satire and political freedom. In Weidel's case, a Hamburg court threw out her cease-and-desist request against a show that had called her a ""Nazi bitch,"" since it was clearly satire.

Beck, on the other hand, lost a slander case in which a far-right politician called him Obergauleiter of hordes of members of the Nazi paramilitary SA. The nation's top court reversed an earlier regional court ruling because the two politicians had been involved in a verbal sparring match. Thus, the words against Beck were considered polemical rather than slanderous.

But these cases involve politicians. German courts expect them to have a thicker skin. Less prominent citizens, on the other hand, have comparably more cause to take slander to court.

It's a big deal, but is it illegal?

Under paragraph 185 of the German penal code, slander is a criminal offense. Shouting ""You old a--hole,"" landed an impatient driver with a €1,600 fine in 2016; that same year a teen was ordered to do community service after flashing police with ""ACAB"" (""All cops are bastards""), which was tattooed on the inside of his lip.

Comparing people to Nazis, or to the Third Reich, is in a class of its own.

""If I say, you're a moron, you're an idiot, you're a Nazi, there's of course more to it than the insult 'you're dumb.' Saying 'Nazi' implies unscrupulous acts and barbarism,"" law professor Manfred Heinrich of Kiel University told DW.

As Heinrich emphasizes, Germany has outlawed the glorification of Nazism. But no law forbids calling someone a Nazi.

What is illegal is what German law refers to as ""hurting someone's honor"" — in this sense, meaning somebody's worth or hurting someone's reputation through verbal abuse. Violating this principle constitutes slander.

Given the millions of lives lost under the Nazi regime either through systematic extermination or war, not to mention other unspeakable horrors committed in the name of Adolf Hitler, comparisons to the Third Reich are simply no ordinary insults.

""You could call it overly sensitive. But in Germany most people don't want to be put into that category. Those were terrible things that happened and people don't want to be compared to that.""

Macron says he won't recognize Palestine in response to Trump's Jerusalem move,https://www.timesofisrael.com/macron-says-he-wont-recognize-palestine-in-response-to-trumps-jerusalem-move/,"DAVOS, Switzerland — French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that he would not recognize Palestine as an independent state as a reaction to US President Donald Trump’s declaration of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

“I will not take any decision in reaction to any decision,” Macron told reporters in response to a Times of Israel question on the potential recognition of a Palestinian state.

The comments came during a photo op with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ahead of their closed-door meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The meeting lasted nearly an hour.

Several European nations, including Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Slovenia, are reportedly mulling recognizing an independent Palestine in response to Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem. The Slovenian foreign minister has already confirmed his country’s intention.

Macron began his statement by saying bluntly, “What we have to do is we have to work fairly on a peace process in the short run.”

Macron said he wanted to “accompany and facilitate” the two sides in a peace process, but added that France’s positions on the end result of such talks had not changed.

“Our philosophy is very clear from the very beginning, with recognition of two states. Jerusalem will be the capital of two sides and common frontiers recognized according to international rule,” he said in English.

Macron went on to emphasize again that a decision to recognize an independent Palestine will not be a reaction “following some other decision,” apparently referring to Trump’s December 6 proclamation.

The French president then touted his relationship with Netanyahu, saying he saw as crucial Paris’s ability to be a “partner for the security of Israel and also to be a strategic partner for the whole region with you,” he said, looking at Netanyahu.

The prime minister responded that “this is definitely true,” adding that Israel’s partnership with France “is also important for the security of Europe.”

Just last week, Channel 10 reported that Macron dispatched his foreign policy adviser to a secret visit in Ramallah, where the latter implored Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbass not to rule out a peace plan being prepared by the Trump administration.

“Don’t reject Trump’s peace plan off the bat,” Channel 10 quoted Lechevallier as telling Palestinian officials. “Give it a chance.”

Abbas met with Macron last month in Paris, where he rejected any role in a US peace process.

During talks last month, Netanyahu reportedly told the French president that he would be prepared to make “compromises and concessions” to the Palestinians, within the framework of Trump’s plan.

The separate Channel 10 report, which quoted unnamed senior European diplomats familiar with the content of the two men’s discussions, was denied by the Prime Minister’s Office.

The TV channel said Macron’s efforts to reassure Abbas have been coordinated with Trump, and the two leaders speaking by phone multiple times in recent weeks.",JustBadNews,0
"Rape victim writes letter to PM Modi, CM Adityanath in blood; seeks action against accused. In her letter, the victim wrote: ?Kindly save me and my family. The accused's father is in governor's house, therefore police are taking no action and accused is troubling us in various ways to withdraw FIR.",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/rape-victim-writes-letter-to-pm-modi-yogi-adityanath-in-blood-seeks-action-against-accused-5036807/,"The victim, who belongs to Rae Bareli district, was a first year student in a private engineering college in Barabanki district. (Photo for representation) The victim, who belongs to Rae Bareli district, was a first year student in a private engineering college in Barabanki district. (Photo for representation)

An 18-year-old rape survivor has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in her blood seeking security for her family and action against the accused, who have allegedly been putting pressure on her to withdraw the case. According to the police complaint filed by her father, she was raped in February last year.

In her letter dated January 20, the survivor, who had dropped out from an engineering college, wrote: “Kindly save me and my family…police are taking no action and accused is troubling us in various ways to withdraw FIR. Please take strict action before I take my life.” In her letter, she also alleged that her attacker’s father was employed in a government office.

The rape case was lodged against Divya Pandey and Ankit Verma in March 2017. A chargesheet had been filed against both, but no arrests were made as the accused obtained a stay against arrest from the Allahabad High Court, said police.

The survivor, who is from Rae Bareli district, was a first year student in a private engineering college in Barabanki district before dropping out around three months ago. Her younger sister, a Class XI student in Rae Bareli, also stopped going to school around the same time after a fake Facebook profile was allegedly created in her name and her morphed obscene pictures were uploaded on it last October. A case was lodged in this regard in Rae Bareli the same month, said police.

The girl’s father, who works as a clerk in a government department, alleged that Divya Pandey used to harass his elder daughter when she stayed in her college hostel. “Pandey used to force my daughter to go out with him and had assaulted her publicly on campus when she resisted his advances,” he added.

“On February 27 last year, Pandey and his friend Ankit dragged my daughter inside a car outside campus and took her to Ankit’s flat in Lucknow where she was thrashed and raped by Pandey. They snatched her phone too,” he further claimed.

He also said he suspect that the accused was behind his younger daughter’s fake profile as his elder daughter’s mobile phone was in their possession and they would have obtained the pictures from it.

The girl’s father said that his daughter had complained to college authorities, but no action was taken. After his younger daughter’s photos were uploaded, he filed a police complaint, on the basis of which a case was lodged on March 24 at Barabanki’s City Kotwali police station on charges of rape and under the Information Technology Act against Divya Pandey and Ankit Verma.

Station House Officer, City Kotwali (Barabanki) Raj Kumar said, “Chargesheet against both accused has been filed in court. They were not arrested as both have procured arrest stay from Allahabad High Court.”

“The Facebook account on which objectionable photographs were uploaded is not active anymore. A letter has been sent by Rae Bareli’s superintendent of police to the Facebook headquarters in California seeking details of the account. We are yet to receive their response,” said Additional Superintendent of Police (City), Rae Bareli, Shashi Shekhar Singh. “Four policemen have been deployed for security at her house,” he added.

Finland warns EU it will not help fill the ?15bn Brexit budget black hole,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/01/24/finland-warns-eu-will-not-help-fill-15bn-brexit-budget-black/,"Stumping up more cash to fill the €15bn (£13bn)-a-year black hole left in the EU's budget by Brexit would be ""unbearable"" for Finland, its Europe minister has told the Telegraph, as deep divisions open up on the continent over how the bloc's spending should be reformed.

Sampo Terho said it was crucial that the EU cut its budget rather than rely on members to pay more, warning that Finland would use ""whatever tools we can"" to ensure costs did not rise.

“When the EU becomes smaller the budget should become smaller. That’s all there is to it. That’s the logic we abide by,” Mr Terho said in an interview with the Telegraph in Helsinki.

“Because your country was so big, and still is at the moment, that will leave a big hole. If that gap were to be filled with other countries’ payments, I see that as an unbearable solution. We must cut the budget.”

The position puts him on a collision course with the Brussels' budget commissioner and leading EU powers, like Emmanuel Macron's France, who have called for a deep expansion of the EU budget as part of a radical mission to reboot the bloc after Brexit.",JustBadNews,0
Presidents Club: Leading businessmen caught 'groping' and 'exposing themselves' to female hostesses at men-only charity gala,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/presidents-club-dorchester-hotel-men-only-charity-groping-sexual-harassment-what-happened-london-a8175256.html,"Senior businessmen at an all-male charity dinner groped and propositioned women hostesses who were told to wear “black sexy shoes” and black underwear, it has been claimed.

Undercover Financial Times reporters said they witnessed the behaviour at the annual Presidents Club charity dinner in London’s Dorchester Hotel on Thursday night.

The black-tie event, attended by 360 leading figures from business, politics and finance, allegedly included auction lots involving a free lapdance at a Soho club and plastic surgery that could be used to “add spice to your wife”.

The FT reported that by midnight an unnamed “society figure” was telling a hostess “I want you to down that glass [of champagne], rip off your knickers and dance on that table.”

The FT alleged: “Groping and similar abuse was seen across many of the tables in the room.

“Hostesses reported men repeatedly putting hands up their skirts; one said an attendee had exposed his penis to her during the evening.”

A 19-year-old was reportedly asked by a man in his seventies whether she was a prostitute, which allegedly led to her admitting she found working at the dinner ""f***ing scary"".

The event was hosted by the comedian and children’s author David Walliams, who is not the subject of any allegations and is understood to have behaved correctly throughout the night.

It allegedly began with another male compere – not Walliams - telling the men “Welcome to the most un-PC event of the year”.

The event has now been condemned by MPs including the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson who reacted to the allegations by saying the FT’s report showed that “a rotten, sexist culture is still alive and kicking in parts of the business community.”

The dinner came under further fire from Labour MP Jess Phillips and other critics who were upset that it had excluded women guests in the first place.

The President’s Club charitable trust, which said the event raised millions of pounds for disadvantaged children, said it was “appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour” and pledged to investigate.

The fall-out from the dinner may also place pressure on the Conservative Party.

A co-chairman of the charitable trust was said on Wednesday afternoon to have ""stepped down"" from his position as a non-executive board member of the Department for Education, while the FT also reported that Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, the newly appointed undersecretary of state for children and families, had attended the dinner.

Mr Zahawi has, however, reportedly said he left early.

The Stratford-on-Avon MP told ITV news: ""I didn't stay long enough to really comment on the occasion.""

The FT said the 130 hostesses were hired by the agency Artista, which allegedly required that the women were “tall, thin and pretty”, and paid them £150 for the night, plus £25 for a taxi home.

The FT said that at their initial interviews, Caroline Dandridge, the founder of Artista, warned the women that the men at the dinner might be “annoying”.

Ms Dandridge was reported to have told one hostsess: “It’s a Marmite job. Some girls love it, and for other girls it’s the worst job of their life and they will never do it again. You just have to put up with the annoying men and if you can do that it’s fine.”

Two days before the dinner, Artista allegedly emailed the hostesses to say they should bring “black sexy shoes”, black underwear and do their hair and make-up in a style suitable for a “smart sexy place”.

At the event, Ms Dandridge is said to have briefed the women that if any of the men became “too annoying” they should tell her.

The FT reported that some men among the “mix of British and foreign businessmen, the odd lord, politicians, oligarchs, property tycoons, film producers, financiers, and chief executives” were holding hostesses’ hands as the starters arrived.

During the night a 28-year-old woman claimed to have been repeatedly fondled on the bottom, hips, stomach and legs, with one man inviting her upstairs to his hotel room.

The 19-year-old who was reportedly asked if she was a prostitute was quoted by the FT as later admitting “I’ve never done this before, and I’m never doing it again. It’s f***ing scary.”

The report of what happened at the dinner immediately prompted calls for David Meller, co-chairman of the Presidents Club charitable trust, to resign from his other position as a non-executive board member of the Department for Education.

Mr Meller, joint chairman of the luxury goods supplier the Meller Group, has held his Department for Education position since June 2013.

Calling for him to resign from his education role, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said: “Organise a group event where women are offered up as meat all you like but if you do you don’t get a say in my kids schools.”

Asked to comment on Mr Zahawi and Mr Meller’s involvement in the dinner, a Department for Education spokeswoman said: “This charity event was attended in a personal capacity. It was not official departmental business and as such we are unable to comment further.”

Hours later, however, it was reported that Mr Meller had ""stepped down"" from his position on the Department for Education board.

The charity auction at the dinner included a lot offering a lunch for six co-hosted by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

It is not thought that Mr Johnson attended the Presidents Club dinner itself and it was not immediately clear what – if anything – he knew about the event.

The Foreign Office has been asked for comment.

The Presidents Club told the FT: “The Presidents Club recently hosted its annual dinner, raising several million pounds for disadvantaged children.

“The organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters.

“Such behaviour is totally unacceptable. The allegations will be investigated fully and promptly and appropriate action taken.”

Ms Dandridge, of Artista, was quoted by the FT as responding to the allegations by saying: “This is a really important charity fundraising event that has been running for 33 years and raises huge amounts of money for disadvantaged and underprivileged children’s charities.

“There is a code of conduct that we follow, I am not aware of any reports of sexual harassment and with the calibre of guest, I would be astonished.”

When contacted by The Independent, a spokesman for Artista provided the same statement as that provided by the Presidents Club.

The Dorchester Hotel told the FT it had a zero-tolerance policy regarding harassment of guests or employees.",JustBadNews,0

Project Davos: what's the single best way to close the world's wealth gap? Read more

In a report published on Monday to coincide with the gathering of some of the world’s richest people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Oxfam said billionaires had been created at a record rate of one every two days over the past 12 months, at a time when the bottom 50% of the world’s population had seen no increase in wealth. It added that 82% of the global wealth generated in 2017 went to the most wealthy 1%.

The charity said it was “unacceptable and unsustainable” for a tiny minority to accumulate so much wealth while hundreds of millions of people struggled on poverty pay. It called on world leaders to turn rhetoric about inequality into policies to tackle tax evasion and boost the pay of workers.

Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB chief executive, said: “The concentration of extreme wealth at the top is not a sign of a thriving economy, but a symptom of a system that is failing the millions of hardworking people on poverty wages who make our clothes and grow our food.”



Booming global stock markets have been the main reason for the increase in wealth of those holding financial assets during 2017. The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, saw his wealth rise by $6bn (£4.3bn) in the first 10 days of 2017 as a result of a bull market on Wall Street, making him the world’s richest man.

Oxfam said it had made changes to its wealth calculations as a result of new data from the bank Credit Suisse. Under the revised figures, 42 people hold as much wealth as the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorer half of the world’s population, compared with 61 people last year and 380 in 2009. At the time of last year’s report, Oxfam said that eight billionaires held the same wealth as half the world’s population.

The charity added that the wealth of billionaires had risen by 13% a year on average in the decade from 2006 to 2015, with the increase of $762bn (£550bn) in 2017 enough to end extreme poverty seven times over. It said nine out of 10 of the world’s 2,043 dollar billionaires were men.

Young people warned: economic focus on short-term growth is failing you Read more

Goldring said: “For work to be a genuine route out of poverty we need to ensure that ordinary workers receive a living wage and can insist on decent conditions, and that women are not discriminated against. If that means less for the already wealthy then that is a price that we – and they – should be willing to pay.”

An Oxfam survey of 70,000 people in 10 countries, including the UK, showed support for action to tackle inequality. Nearly two-thirds of people – 72% in the UK – said they want their government to urgently address the income gap between rich and poor in their country.

In the UK, when asked what a typical British chief executive earned in comparison with an unskilled worker, people guessed 33 times as much. When asked what the ideal ratio should be, they said 7:1. Oxfam said that FTSE 100 bosses earned on average 120 times more than the average employee.

Goldring said it was time to rethink a global economy in which there was excessive corporate influence on policymaking, erosion of workers’ rights and a relentless drive to minimise costs in order to maximise returns to investors.

Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “Oxfam is promoting a race to the bottom. Richer people are already highly taxed people – reducing their wealth beyond a certain point won’t lead to redistribution, it will destroy it to the benefit of no one. Higher minimum wages would also likely lead to disappearing jobs, harming the very people Oxfam intend to help.”

"Gun owners in Massachusetts are being warned if they own bump stocks, they have two weeks to get rid of them.",https://www.necn.com/news/politics/Massachusetts-Sends-Bump-Stock-Deadline-Letter-to-Gun-Owners-1-Month-Late-470226803.html,"Gun owners in Massachusetts are being warned if they own bump stocks, they have two weeks to get rid of them.

The Massachusetts legislature voted last year to ban them and Feb. 1 is the deadline to comply or face criminal charges.

""This is not a joke,"" said Jim Wallace, executive director of the Gun Owners Action League. ""A violation of this new law is up to life in prison.""

Wallace says many bump stock owners may not be familiar with the new law, and a warning from Massachusetts state officials to gun owners — despite being dated Dec. 18 — only went out Friday, more than a month later.

""Oh, it should have been sent out a long time ago,"" said Wallace.

Bump stocks made international headlines when a gunman opened fire from a hotel room in Las Vegas back in October. The shooter, Stephen Paddock, used bump stocks to increase the rate of fire.

Lawmakers in Massachusetts then voted to ban them.

""Gun owners are facing a very important deadline coming up, and the state has not done their due diligence in notifying gun owners,"" said Wallace.

It's unclear why the letter just went out Friday. It's now being mailed to all gun owners to explain the consequences of not surrendering bump stocks.

There are no exceptions.

State Rep. David Linsky, who was behind the bump stock legislation, said

""The ban ... was extremely well publicized,"" said Massachusetts Rep. David Linsky, who was behind the legislation. ""People who still own them are well aware of the changes in the law.""

Bump stock owners are supposed to call their local police department or Massachusetts State Police to make arrangements to have them destroyed.",JustBadNews,0
Canadian Billionaire and Wife Believed to Have Been Murdered by Multiple Killers.,http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/toronto/barry-and-honey-sherman-were-murdered-by-multiple-killers-private-investigators-believe-source-1.4496686,"Private investigators believe that the billionaire Toronto couple found dead at their home in December were murdered by multiple killers, a source with direct knowledge of the parallel probe into their mysterious deaths told CBC Toronto.

The new information contradicts a widely circulated theory that Barry and Honey Sherman died as a result of a murder-suicide — a notion that is regarded as fiction by those who knew the Shermans well.

Barry, 75, and Honey, 70, were found dead by a real estate agent in the basement of their Toronto mansion on Dec. 15. The source said their bodies were in an upright seated position on the floor near an indoor pool. Police deemed the deaths ""suspicious"" but have said little else since their investigation began.

The Sherman family has hired a team of experts, which includes a number of former Toronto homicide detectives, to conduct a separate, independent investigation.

The private investigators have found evidence that both Barry and Honey Sherman had their necks wrapped with leather belts that were then knotted around a handrail that runs adjacent to the pool, the source told CBC Toronto. A coroner previously ruled that the couple had died from ""ligature neck compression,"" or strangulation.

Their wrists showed evidence that they had been, at one point, bound together. No rope or other materials that could have been used to tie their wrists were discovered, the source told CBC Toronto.

Their bodies were otherwise limp and their arms unbound when they were discovered, the source said. The day the Shermans were found police said that there was no evidence of forced entry into the home.

The team of private investigators believes that the Shermans were, in fact, killed on Dec. 13, two days before they were found. This conclusion is based on the fact that Honey was wearing the same clothes she was last seen in, on Dec. 13, according to the source.

Private investigators also believe that Honey struggled with her killer or killers. She had cuts on her lip and nose, and was sitting in a pool of her own blood when she was discovered. However, there was comparatively little blood apparent on her upper-body clothing, suggesting that she had been face-down on the tile, bleeding, for some time before being bound to the handrail in an upright position, the source said.

Neighbours continue to drop flowers outside the Shermans' home. The couple was highly visible in Toronto, often lending their names and fortune to charitable causes and also philanthropic work that extended beyond Canada. (James Morrison-Collalto/CBC)

Various media outlets have reported that Toronto homicide detectives are probing the deaths as a possible murder-suicide. The couple's four children, who plan to have their parents' North York home demolished once a team of private forensic investigators have had time to scour it, have soundly rejected that theory. So have close friends of the Shermans.

Barry Sherman is the founder of Canadian pharmaceutical giant Apotex, and both he and his wife have been recognized internationally for their generous philanthropy. The couple, who were quite socially active among the city's gala class, was believed to have amassed a fortune of some $4.77 billion before their deaths.

Neighbour Eli Kanter said he was unsurprised to hear that private investigators are approaching the case as a double murder. He told CBC Toronto that he's been skeptical about the possibility that the Shermans died in a murder-suicide since it was first reported as a possibility that the police are considering.

""They wouldn't do that. They wouldn't end that way,"" he said.

Contacted by telephone on Saturday morning, a Toronto police spokesperson said the force's own investigators have no updates at this time.",JustBadNews,0
Gay couple who ordered wedding programs got religious pamphlets about Satan instead: lawsuit,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/01/18/gay-couple-who-ordered-wedding-programs-got-religious-pamphlets-about-sin-lust-temptation-instead-lawsuit.html,"The day before their wedding in September, Stephen Heasley and Andrew Borg received a package containing what they thought would be the programs for their ceremony.

“Celebration,” their design said in bold letters at the top. “Welcome to Andrew & Stephen’s wedding.”

But when they opened the package, they say, they found 80 copies of a religious pamphlet instead of the 100 copies of the wedding program they had ordered. The pamphlet spoke ominously of sin, lust and temptation, according to a lawsuit they filed in United States District Court in Massachusetts.

Australian Parliament allows same-sex marriages after national survey strongly endorses change

“Fight the good fight of the faith,” read a copy of the pamphlet included in the lawsuit, titled “Understanding Temptation.” “The supreme tempter is Satan, who uses our weaknesses to lead us into sin.”

Heasley and Borg, both residents of Australia reportedly in their 30s, are suing the company they had hired to print their wedding programs, Vistaprint, alleging that the pamphlets “were clearly sent to intimidate, threaten and harass Plaintiffs because they are gay men.” The lawsuit charges that the two were discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. Vistaprint, a Dutch company, runs its operations in North America out of Lexington, Massachusetts. Heasley and Borg were married in Pennsylvania.

The lawsuit says the couple seeks a judgment declaring the company’s conduct was unlawful as well as an unspecified award for the “economic damages, mental anguish and emotional distress” they have suffered as a result.

The couple had paid $79.49 for the programs, according to the suit.

The pamphlet comes from a Catholic campaign called Battle Ready. The pages presented in the lawsuit do not include explicit references to homosexuality. They are illustrated with a picture of a soldier holding his head near an image of a medal.

“Satan entices your flesh with evil desires,” it reads. “If you did not desire it, you would not be tempted by it.”

In a statement, Vistaprint said it was conducting an investigation into what happened after it was notified of the incident when the lawsuit was filed Tuesday.

“To know that any customer could feel treated in such a way, especially during a time that should be filled with joy, is extremely disheartening,” the company said. “We have never been more disappointed to let a customer down. Vistaprint in no way condones — and does not tolerate — discrimination against any of our customers based on their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.”

The company said it had learned that “the materials that were intended to be printed for one customer were incorrectly sent to this couple by a 3rd party fulfiller.”

In a statement, Heasley and Borg’s lawyer, David Gottlieb, said it was “unfortunate that not all corporations are tolerant of the wide array of lifestyles that make up their customer base.

"Syria Vows To Shoot Down Turkish Jets As Erdogan Orders Putin ""Do Not Oppose"" Assault",https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-01-18/syria-vows-shoot-down-turkish-jets-erdogan-orders-putin-do-not-oppose-assault,"According to the Associated Press, this morning Syria said it would shoot down any Turkish jets carrying out attacks inside Syria. This comes as preparations continue for an imminent large-scale Turkish attack of Kurdish militia groups currently holding Afrin near the Turkish border.

Multiple regional outlets have confirmed a build-up of forces that could constitute the largest external intervening force thus far in the entirety of the Syrian war, including special forces troops, Army units, Turkish-backed Syrian rebels and Turkey's air force.

In response to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vowing military action to ""destroy all terror nests"" in Syria - a reference to the US-backed YPG (which makes up the core of the SDF) which holds vast territory along Turkey's border spanning into northeast Syria - the Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Fayssal Mekdad told reporters Thursday that Syrian defense systems have regained full operational power and stand ready to destroy Turkish air targets in Syrian airspace should Afrin be attacked. Mekdad also stated that Damascus would consider any Turkish attack on Afrin an act of aggression.

Sporadic fighting and shelling has already occurred according to reports from the region. Though Turkish shelling of Kurdish positions along the border is nothing new in the conflict, should Turkey mobilize its air force in support of ground forces this would mark a dramatic escalation, especially given that both Russia and the US operate over Northern Syria, with Russia controlling the airspace over Afrin Canton and Idlib.

Whether the operation against Syrian Kurds moves forward or not into a full scale Turkish assault by land and air depends in large part on Russia, which has administered 'deconfliction' zones in the Afrin area, and has sponsored trilateral talks with Turkey and Iran which seeks cooperation among the three powers to wind down the war in Syria. Russia is also widely reported to have long had military advisors on the ground in Afrin, which have in the past helped coordinate the fight against ISIS.

THREAD: This follows an extended conversation with v credible source in Damascus immediately following the speech of Sec. Tillerson on Syria. While vow to stay in Syria 'for the foreseeable future"" seems to have received lots of attention, this source wasn't too surprised by it=> — EHSANI2 (@EHSANI22) January 18, 2018

Though it's uncertain how Russia will interpret new Turkish statements and claims that it has Russian ""coordination"" in its impending Afrin campaign, Reuters reports:

Turkey said on Thursday Russia ""should not oppose its operation in Syria’s Afrin"" and will coordinate with Moscow on the situation of Russian observers there. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also told broadcaster CNN Turk that Turkey will coordinate with Russia and Iran on an air operation in Afrin.

Thus far there's been no confirmation of this coming out of the Russian Defense Ministry, and the statement has the tone of an ultimatum rather than an agreed upon fact.

Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag says if the country's demands are not met, Ankara will not hesitate to take steps in Afrin and other regions across its border with Syria https://t.co/y1OOzCEAf2 pic.twitter.com/lib2I6q2bI — TRT World (@trtworld) January 17, 2018

Turkey's saber rattling and ground mobilization - a massive mustering of forces which has now been confirmed through video and reports on the ground - is largely in response to recent US efforts to ramp up support for the Kurdish dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes a new initiative to establish and train a new approximately 30,000 member strong ""Syrian Border Security Force"" - in the words of Pentagon officials.

And with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson outlining a plan Wednesday for US forces staying in Syria indefinitely for the stated purposes of countering Iran, pressuring Assad, and to conduct ""stabilization initiatives in liberated areas"" - this has Ankara concerned that the United States is effectively backing a de facto Syrian Kurdish state or autonomous zone.

Last weekend Erdogan slammed US plans for its SDF partners, saying during a speech in Ankara, “A country we call an ally is insisting on forming a terror army on our borders."" He further vowed of the new US initiative to bolster a Kurdish dominated border security force, ""Our mission is to strangle it before it’s even born.""

"New report from Germany's Federal Network Agency has revealed country has abysmally slow broadband speeds - for staggering 29% of users, internet speeds were less than half of what companies promised in contracts...almost no one, even those paying premium, reached ""maximum"" speeds promised.",http://www.dw.com/en/germany-land-of-woefully-slow-internet/a-42195241,"A new report from Germany's Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) has revealed that the country — known the world over for ingenuity and efficiency — has abysmally slow broadband speeds.

And smartphone mobile data speeds are even worse.

According to the study published Wednesday, the BNetzA studied Germany's leading service providers for a year between October 2016 and September 2017.

The results were somewhat surprising. For a staggering 29 percent of German users, internet speeds were less than half of that which companies promised in their contracts. And almost no one, even those paying a premium for the best service, reached the ""maximum"" speeds vendors promised.

The numbers were even more unimpressive for smartphones. Only 18.6 percent of users reached even half the contractually agreed speed and bandwidth for mobile data. This means that the situation is only getting worse — in 2015, the number was 27.6 percent.

Technical difficulties

The study showed that a mere 1.6 percent of German smartphone users can reach the promised internet speeds on their devices.

Providers do not seem concerned how bad their service is for the German economy, as slow internet speeds are problematic for businesses fighting international competition.

Despite the poor performance figures, the BNetzA is not in a position to sanction or fine providers.

Industry association Bitkom responded to the report by saying that ""technical reasons"" sometimes hindered companies from providing promised speeds.",JustBadNews,0

Chinese credit rating agency downgrades US's rating over political 'deficiencies',http://thehill.com/policy/finance/369098-chinese-credit-rating-agency-downgrades-uss-rating-over-political-deficiencies,"A Chinese credit agency has downgraded the United States's credit rating from A- to BBB+, citing increased reliance on debt, Reuters reported Tuesday.

Dagong Global Credit Rating Co., one of China's largest firms, said in a statement Tuesday that it had also given the U.S. sovereign ratings a negative outlook, specifically citing the GOP's recently-passed tax-reform plan as a reason why.

""The perennial negative impact of the superstructure on the economic base has continued to deteriorate the debt repayment sources of the federal government, and this trend will be further exacerbated by the government's massive tax cuts,"" the firm said in a statement.

In the statement, Dagong also hits the U.S. for ""political deficiencies,"" as well as the U.S.'s reliance on debt-driven economics, which it says are hindering further economic development.

""The government did not discover from the financial crises that it is the debt-driven mode of economic development that has hindered the country from making ends meet,"" Dagong said.

“Deficiencies in the current U.S. political ecology make it difficult for the efficient administration of the federal government, so the national economic development derails from the right track,” Dagong added.

This policy, Dagong predicts, will lead to the federal government being forced to raise the debt ceiling with more frequency.

The Treasury Department said in November that ""extraordinary measures"" would allow the government to run through January, but warned that the government would be forced to raise the debt ceiling again sometime this month.

""Extraordinary measures will allow the government to continue to meet its obligations through January 2018. It is currently too early to provide a more precise forecast as to how long the extraordinary measures will last,"" said a report from the department in November.",JustBadNews,0
North Korea says Donald Trump nuclear button tweet the 'spasm of a lunatic'.,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-donald-trump-nuclear-twitter-us-kim-jong-un-reaction-weapons-a8161281.html,"North Korea’s state-run media has labelled Donald Trump’s tweet about having a bigger nuclear button than leader Kim Jong Un’s the “spasm of a lunatic”.

Rodong Sinmun, the ruling party newspaper, criticised the US President after he tweeted: “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”

A summary of the commentary by North Korea’s official news agency described the tweet as “the spasm of a lunatic”.

“The spasm of Trump in the new year reflects the desperate mental state of a loser who failed to check the vigorous advance of the army and people of the DPRK,” the article said, using the acronym for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

“He is making [a] bluff only to be diagnosed as a psychopath.”

The tone of the commentary is not uncommon for the North Korean media. But Mr Trump’s willingness to respond in kind – he has repeatedly called Mr Kim “little rocket man” – is rare for an American leader.

Mr Trump has more recently suggested he might be willing to meet with Mr Kim, and reportedly told the Wall Street Journal the two “probably have a very good relationship”.

The US President’s controversial “nuclear button” tweet was in response to Kim’s New Year’s Day warning that North Korea’s nuclear arsenal is a real threat and that he has a nuclear launch button on his desk at all times.

Mr Kim said the entire US was within range of North Korean nuclear weapons, adding: “This is reality, not a threat.”

Rodong Sinmun also recently ran a story about the book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which casts the president as a leader who does not understand the weight of his office and whose competence is questioned by aides. Mr Trump and other White House officials have blasted it as inaccurate.

Last summer, Mr Trump threatened North Korea with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” in an exchange of taunts with the North, which claimed it was examining plans to launch missiles towards the American territory of Guam.

The North Korean article said the sales of the exposé reflect “rapidly surging anti-Trump sentiments in the international community.”

“The anti-Trump book is sweeping all over the world so Trump is being massively humiliated worldwide.”

The book’s popularity “foretells Trump’s political demise,” it concluded.

Toronto police say reported hijab attack on 11-year-old girl 'did not happen'.,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/scarborough-hijab-attack-1.4487716,"An 11-year-old girl's report last week that a man tried to cut off her hijab as she walked to school didn't occur, Toronto police said Monday.

""After a detailed investigation, police have determined that the events described in the original news release did not happen,"" police said.

""The investigation is concluded.""

The girl reported Friday that a man attempted twice to cut off her hijab as she walked to school with her younger brother. Police said last week that the alleged attack was being investigated as a possible hate crime.

CBC News is not naming the 11-year-old out of a concern for her interests.

The girl, along with her mother and representatives from the Toronto District School Board, spoke to reporters inside her school Friday after she had talked to police.

Her story captured national attention, and drew public condemnation from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and Toronto Mayor John Tory.

No legal consequences

""These allegations were extremely serious and not surprisingly, they received national and international attention,"" police spokesperson Mark Pugash said in an interview.

Toronto police on hijab attack that 'did not happen' 1:31 Mark Pugash, spokesperson for Toronto Police Service, details the investigation into the reported hijab attack and how they came to the conclusion it 'did not happen.' 1:31 ""Investigators worked extremely hard since the allegations on Friday. They gathered evidence from a variety of sources,"" before concluding the story was untrue, Pugash said, adding that the girl who reported the incident will not face any legal consequences.

On Monday afternoon, the prime minister said he was relieved that the incident hadn't in fact taken place.

""We have seen an unfortunate pattern of increased hate crimes in past months directed towards religious minorities, particularly towards women,"" he said, calling such violence ""a warning sign of increased intolerance.""

""We are a country that defends freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and people's rights to go to school without being fearful or harassed,"" he said. ""This is fundamental to who we are.""

In a statement issued Monday afternoon, Tory said ""it is good to know"" that no attack actually took place.

TDSB 'thankful' assault didn't happen

Pugash said police don't know how the story escalated. He stressed it's ""quite rare"" for someone to make false allegations of this type, and said he hopes it will not discourage others from coming forward.

In a brief statement, the school board said it is ""very thankful that this assault did not in fact happen.

""We won't be commenting further.""

Sabreena Ghaffar-Siddiqui, a researcher at Hamilton's McMaster University who focuses on hate crimes against Canadian Muslims, said her initial reaction to news that the incident did not happen was concern that it might eclipse real hate crimes.

""Hate crimes toward Muslim people are real,"" she said. ""I have heard stories of Muslim girls having their hijab pulled off their head, pushed, thrown to the ground. These are real stories ... and the reaction that we got from the government and leaders needs to still be there.""

Amira Elghawaby, a human rights advocate based in Ottawa, said she was saddened to learn that the girl's story was not true, adding it will likely only serve to embolden ""those who do hold discriminatory views of Muslims.""

She also stressed that, as an 11-year-old, ""she probably doesn't really understand the full implications of what she's done"" and deserves compassion from adults.

""Hindsight is 20/20 and I'm sure the police, and the school and everyone will be reviewing how this was addressed. And we, as community members, all we want to do is think about this young girl — give her support — we don't want her to be vilified,"" said Elghawaby.

""And we do deal with real issues of hate and discrimination too frequently in our society, and we must continue to address that.""

CBC News has discontinued using the name and images of the 11-year-old in this story. Following our customary practice, because they represent the record of what took place, we are not altering previous stories.",JustBadNews,0
Israeli soldiers shoot 3-year-old Palestinian child in the head during West Bank military training exercise,http://mondoweiss.net/2018/01/palestinian-training-exercise/,"Army shoots a child in the head ‘during training’

IMEMC 10 Jan — Israeli soldiers shot, Wednesday, a Palestinian child with a live round in the head, during “military training” near Tubas, in northeastern West Bank. The Palestinian Health Ministry said the child, only three years of age, was shot with a live round in the head, and is currently in a stable condition. It added that the child was rushed to Tubas Turkish governmental hospital, and is currently at the Intensive Care Unit. The child was shot by Israeli soldiers who were conducting live-fire training near Palestinian communities in Tubas. The Israeli military frequently conducts training in Palestinian communities in Tubas, the Jordan Valley of the occupied West Bank, Hebron, and several other areas. In many incidents, Palestinian families are ordered to leave their communities during the military drills, and later return after the army is done with its live-fire training, including the use of explosives, which are sometimes left behind, leading to casualties, including fatalities. In several incidents, many Palestinians, including children, were injured and even killed, when explosives dropped by the soldiers during training went off near them.

Israeli forces to open new road for settlers near Tubas

TUBAS (WAFA) 9 Jan – Israeli forces embarked on opening a new road on Tuesday to serve Israeli settlers from Rohei settlement, illegally built to the east of Tubas town in the Jordan Valley area, according to local sources. Mutaz Besharat, who monitors settlement activities in the Jordan Valley, told WAFA that Israeli authorities embarked on construction of the road, which will link the settlement with nearby agricultural lands. Israel is planning to transform the Jordan Valley, which makes up one third of the occupied West Bank, into a completely Israeli area, primarily in agriculture, which some speculate to prevent a territorial contiguity between a future Palestinian state and the rest of the Arab world.

Israeli soldiers kill a Palestinian child near Nablus

IMEMC 11 Jan — Israeli soldiers killed, on Thursday evening, a Palestinian child from ‘Iraq-Burin village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, after the army fired live rounds at dozens of Palestinians who intercepted an attack carried out by colonialist settlers into their village. Media sources in Nablus said many armed Israeli colonialist settlers infiltrated into the village and attacked several Palestinians before locals intercepted them and forced them out. Israeli soldiers then invaded the village and fired dozens of live rounds, rubber-coated steel bullets, concussion grenades and gas bombs at the Palestinians.

Medical sources said one child, identified as Ali Omar Nimir Qeino, 17 [Wafa: Omar Kino Qadous, 16] was shot with a live round in the head, before he was rushed to Nablus Specialized Hospital, where he died from his serious head injury. Locals said Qeino was shot by an Israeli army sharp-shooter. It is worth mentioning that, on Wednesday, the soldiers placed concrete blocks at the western entrance of the town, and installed a military roadblock. Qeino was shot in an area not far from the military roadblock, and the concrete blocks.

Detained, arrested, and harassed: The life of Palestinian teens in Jerusalem

Haaretz 11 Jan by Dina Kraft — Under Israeli law, minors can be arrested only in rare circumstances and held for the shortest time possible. But rights groups say the security services ride roughshod over this when it comes to young Arabs in neighborhoods like Silwan — The first time the Israel Police came to arrest the Palestinian teenager with a shy half smile and thick dark eyebrows, he was 14 and sleeping in the small bedroom he shares with his younger brother. Yazan Rajabi, now 17, awoke that summer night to the sound of banging and commotion. He was disoriented but made out the order “Open up!” The clock read 3 A.M. He says several Border Policemen were in the house, their faces masked in black. They did not let him change out of his pajamas, he says, so he was still wearing them when he was bundled into the back of the police jeep and taken in for questioning. He remembers being told he was under suspicion of throwing stones at police – an accusation he denied. “I was confused and scared,” he recalls. “I asked if my father could come with me and they said no.” Rajabi says he was released the next day and, according to his family, the case ended without an indictment. The police told Haaretz they had no specific comment on the case. He recounts the story now, five months after his most recent arrest, which he says is his third, in the living room of his family home in Silwan – a densely populated, poor Palestinian neighborhood of boxy concrete houses on the southern slopes of Jerusalem’s Old City and the Mount of Olives….

Israeli settler killed in shooting attack near Nablus

NABLUS (Ma‘an) 10 Jan — An Israeli settler, 35, was killed late Tuesday as he succumbed to wounds sustained in a shooting attack near the Surra village, south of Nablus City in the northern occupied West Bank. Israel media identified the settler as Raziel Shevah. Reports said that Shevah came under fire while driving in his car. The assailants, who remain unknown, reportedly fired 22 shots at his vehicle. Shevah was transferred to the Meir Hospital in Kfar Saba in central Israel, where he was declared dead.

Following the attack, Israeli forces closed the Yitzhar-Nablus road, a main road in the northern West Bank, and heavily deployed in the area. Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian vehicles passing on the street with rocks and empty bottles.

Palestinian security sources told Ma‘an that more than 20 Israeli military jeeps raided the Surra village following the attack in search for the shooters.

Around 500 settlers attack villages east of Qalqilia

QALQILIA (WAFA) 10 Jan – A group of around 500 Israeli settlers Wednesday attacked two villages east of Qalqilia, said eyewitnesses. According to residents of the Jit and Farata villages, a large group estimated at around 500 settlers from nearby settlements attempted to forcefully enter the two villages and attack its residents, but were chased off by the local men and youth.

Israeli forces are currently stationed at the entrance to Jit. This comes after an Israeli settler was shot dead on Tuesday night on a main road outside the illegal Israeli outpost of Havat Gilad located near Nablus.

Search for justice drags on for slain Palestinian teen

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Al Jazeera) 10 Jan by Ylenia Gostoli — Nearly four years after Nadeem Nawarah, 17, was killed by a single live round fired into his chest by an Israeli police officer, his family is still relentlessly pursuing justice. At a court hearing on Tuesday, the prosecutor asked for a 20 to 27-month prison sentence for the officer, Ben Deri, 21 at the time. He has pled guilty to a negligent killing charge, and sentencing is now scheduled for April 26. “The court [hearing] was like a drama. Of course there is no justice,” Siam Nawarah, Nadeem’s father, told Al Jazeera. Surrounded by large portraits of his son at his Ramallah home, Siam recounted how hope for justice progressively slipped away. “Court hearings were always postponed with no valid reason. If Nadeem had killed Ben Deri, what would have happened? I think the court would have made a decision after two or three weeks and put him in jail,” he said. At one time under house arrest, Ben Deri now walks free.

Stored on his laptop, Siam Nawarah keeps files of every video, article, blog post, and TV news segment that was ever published or broadcast about Nadeem’s killing. He sold his three hairdressing salons in order to follow the case – and perhaps because they reminded him of the time when most of his customers were Nadeem’s friends. He travelled to the US to lobby Congress because “Nadeem was killed by American weapons.” He later founded an association that offers psychological and legal support to other families who went through the same excruciating experience.

Gunned down — On May 15, 2014, Nadeem was shot and killed at a demonstration near the Ofer military prison in the West Bank on Nakba Day, when Palestinians commemorate the displacement of hundreds of thousands in 1948. Another teenager, Mohammad Abu Daher, 16, was shot in the back and killed in exactly the same spot an hour later….

Video: The paramedics of Jerusalem

Al Jazeera 10 Jan by HyoJin Park — In an ambulance, every second counts. A patient’s chances of survival depend on how long it takes an ambulance to respond to a case and transfer the person to the appropriate hospital. In most communities around the world, eight minutes is the recommended response time for urgent cases. But in Palestine, not even ambulances have freedom of movement. Palestinian ambulances can be stopped at every checkpoint, the vehicle searched and emergency responders interrogated. According to data provided by Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS), checkpoints delay ambulances by an average of 15 minutes. This does not include the time an ambulance spends in traffic leading up to the checkpoints. There is only one lane leading to and from each checkpoint, causing a bottleneck traffic jam that gets especially bad during rush hours. PRCS ambulances respond to both emergency and transfer cases. In emergency cases, patients can only go to the hospitals in their area of residence, whether it be in the West Bank, Gaza or East Jerusalem. If the patient requires further treatment not available in their area, they then have to submit a request to Israeli authorities for a transfer….

Israel blocks off villages south of Nablus

NABLUS (WAFA) 11 Jan – Israeli army forces Thursday closed a junction connecting between two villages south of Nablus with cement cubes, said a local government source. Ghassan Doghlas, who monitors settlements activities in the north of the West Bank told WAFA that Israeli soldiers blocked off the junction connecting Tell and ‘Iraq Burin, south of Nablus. He said Israeli military jeeps accompanied by truck carrying cement blocks were seen at the entrance of the villages of Beita and Beit Furik, while Israeli soldiers continue to close the road connecting Ramallah and Nablus. Israeli checkpoints at Huwwara and Zatara have been seeing strict measures where Israeli soldiers continue to inspect vehicles and personal identification cards after an Israeli settler was shot dead on Tuesday night on a main road outside the illegal Israeli outpost of Havat Gilad located near Nablus.

Wounded prisoner, mother, appeals for release to receive proper medical treatment

JERUSALEM (WAFA) 11 Jan – Isra Jaabis, 32, a mother of a baby child and a resident of Jabal al-Mukkaber neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem, appealed to the Israeli High Court against her 11-year sentence levied against her in November 2016 after she was charged of attempting to blow up an Israeli army checkpoint outside Jerusalem in October 2015. The High Court deliberated her appeal on Thursday and said it will send its decision to Jaabis’ attorney at the end of deliberations.

Jaabis, who is married to a Palestinian from Jericho, had a gas cylinder in her car when it blew up, apparently accidently, when she was only meters away from the checkpoint to the east of Jerusalem. Her family said at the time that she was moving her stuff from Jericho to a new place in Jerusalem when the cylinder blew up by accident. The army, however, decided otherwise and said Jaabis was intending to blow up the checkpoint. The Jerusalem resident was seriously hurt in the accident with third degrees burns on 60 percent of her body and face. She also lost eight fingers. During her detention, Jaabis did not get proper medical treatment, says her family and activists, and therefore her condition has worsened. Activists launched a campaign to demand her release to get badly needed medical treatment. According to her family, their daughter’s health situation has deteriorated. She suffers from constant pain and fever and that she needs years of treatment and physical and psychological rehabilitation. Jaabis sent an urgent message from her prison cell this week complaining of pain and ache all over her body and of medical negligence in prison. She said she is suffering from cramps in her hands and feet, which prevent her from doing the most basic things of life and make her feel humiliated and ashamed because she is in constant need of assistance from her cellmates….

61-year-old Palestinian detainee on hunger strike for 20th day

AL-KHALIL (PIC) 11 Jan — 61-year-old Palestinian detainee Rizq al-Rajoub has been going on an open-ended hunger strike for the 20th day in a row to protest an Israeli court rule to deport him to Sudan. According to the Palestinian human rights network in charge of prisoners’ affairs, Anin al-Qaid, Rajoub who is a native of al-Khalil’s town of Dura, in the southern occupied West Bank, said that he will not retract his decision until the Israeli prison authorities either release him or file a list of indictments against him.

The network also stated that the elderly detainee is suffering from hard health conditions. Nevertheless, he is held in a dungeon under unhealthy and inhuman conditions. He has several diseases including low blood level and problems in the heart. Israeli occupation forces arrested al-Rajoub on November 27, 2017. He had been locked up for a total of 23 years in Israeli jails, including 10 years in administrative detention, with neither charge nor trial.

Israel seized Gaza fishermen featured in photostory

Electronic Intifada 10 Jan by Ali Abunimah — The new year has brought no respite for Gaza fishers, who continue to be targeted by Israeli occupation forces. On Tuesday morning, Israeli gunboats opened fire on two fishing boats as they were approximately five nautical miles from the coast of northern Gaza and one mile from the Israel-Gaza maritime boundary, according to the human rights group Al Mezan. The Israeli forces detained six fishers on board including two children. Two of those detained – Akram Abu Foul, 34 and his son Muhammad, 11 – were featured in a photostory for The Electronic Intifada last October about the annual crab catch. Israel took the fishers – all of them residents of Gaza’s Beach refugee camp – to an unknown location and seized their boats and equipment, Al Mezan stated.

In a separate incident Monday morning, Israeli forces attacked another boat in the waters off northern Gaza and detained two fishers on board, Jihad Suheil Hasan Murad, 25, and Mustafa Muhammad Mustafa Murad, 18. Both are also residents of Beach camp. Al Mezan stated that Jihad bore marks from six rubber-coated bullets fired by Israeli forces during the attack.

Israel reportedly released all but one of the eight fishers detained late Tuesday night at the Erez checkpoint on the boundary with Gaza, but has not returned their boats and equipment.

These were the latest incidents in Israel’s regular attacks on Gaza fishers. In 2017 Israel killed two fishers, detained 39, seized 13 boats and destroyed seven others, according to Al Mezan….

Almost half of Gaza patients seeking treatment abroad had their exit permit delayed: WHO report

JERUSALEM (WAFA) 10 Jan – Almost half of the Palestinian patients seeking treatment outside the besieged Gaza Strip who applied for an Israeli exit permit were delayed and therefore lost their hospital appointment date, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. In its report on Health Access for Referral Patients from the Gaza Strip covering the month of November, the report said out of 2,047 patient applications for permits to exit Gaza through the Israeli Erez checkpoint for health care, 54% of applications were approved; 2% were denied; and 44% were delayed, receiving no definitive response from Israeli authorities by the date of hospital appointment. Losing the appointment date means the patients have to re-schedule their hospital appointment before they can re-apply for an exit permit, a process that can take months and therefore cause long delays for possibly badly needed treatment not available in Gaza. Most of the referrals are for hospitals in East Jerusalem and Israel, with some to the West Bank and Jordan and many are for cancer patients … The report said 58 patients (37 males; 21 females) were requested for interrogation by Israeli General Security Services at Erez during November. Only seven were approved permits to travel for health care….

Over 2,000 Gaza refugee families to receive shelter cash assistance from UNRWA

JERUSALEM (WAFA) 11 Jan – The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) will disburse in the course of this week a total of $1.3 million as Transitional Shelter Cash Assistance (TSCA) to eligible families covering the last quarter of 2017, an UNRWA statement said on Wednesday. The funds will reach a total of 2,069 refugee families across the Gaza Strip who lost their homes during the 2014 Israeli war on Gaza. “The Agency remains committed to supporting affected families with Emergency shelter – including support for home repairs, reconstruction and interim shelter solutions, yet requires new additional funding to continue this program,” it said. UNRWA is under threat of losing financial aid from the United States, its largest donor, which could augment its already difficult financial situation and relief programs….

Islamic State declares war on Hamas as Gaza families disown sons in Sinai

Irish Times 12 Jan by Iyad Abuheweila & Isabel Kershner in Rafah — Three brothers from the dusty Gaza border town of Rafah paid smugglers to spirit them through underground tunnels across the border into Egypt. There they joined the Sinai affiliate of the Islamic State terror group, which is battling the Egyptian army in the Sinai Desert. One brother was killed about 18 months ago, at the age of 20. Last week the eldest, Hamza al-Zamli (25), showed up in a shocking video, railing against Hamas, the Islamic group that dominates Gaza, and describing its fighters as “apostates”. In the finale of the 22-minute production, al-Zamli, a firebrand with long hair flowing from a black turban, instructs another fighter clad in camouflage to shoot to death a kneeling captive accused of smuggling weapons to Hamas. The video exposed new levels of enmity between Hamas and the Sinai branch of Islamic State, injecting another layer of instability into an already volatile region. And it has roiled Gaza, prompting two families whose sons are shown in the video to disown them. The video accuses Hamas of betraying Palestinians by imprisoning extremists in Gaza, failing to prevent the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and being supported by Iran. It urges attacks on Hamas’s members, courts and security positions, as well as on Shias and Christians in Gaza, according to the Washington-based Site Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamic State propaganda…

“It pains me that bloodshed was committed by my own son, Hamza,” said al-Zamli’s father, Adel al-Zamli (51), a teacher and an imam in a local mosque. Speaking in a room lined with religious books, he said Hamza had taken his younger brothers “to perdition”. Hamza’s mother, Mariam, said that after seeing the video, she was sorry she had given birth to him. Soon after the video emerged, the al-Dajani family issued a statement saying they were proud of belonging to Hamas and its military wing and describing their son’s act as “criminal” and “contrary to our religion and our people’s values”….

Senior Hamas figure critical after shooting accident

Jacaranda FM 9 Jan — Imad al-Alami, a founding member of Hamas and former member of its highest political body, was wounded while “inspecting his personal weapon in his home and is in critical condition”, Hamas spokesman Fawzy Barhoum said in a statement. There was no independent confirmation of that account. Alami was rushed to hospital in Gaza City, where he was visited by Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar and his deputy Khalil al-Hayya, an AFP photographer said. Hayya told journalists the version of events described in the statement was based on “testimony of family and witnesses at home”. He said doctors had operated on him but he remained in critical condition. Alami has for decades been a senior member of Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip….

Exclusive: 2017 goes down as worst in Gaza unemployment

GAZA (Asharq Al-Awsat) 9 Jan — Khodr Ayesh serves long watch hours at the bottom of one of Gaza’s high-rise towers while serving affluent families living in the residence. Despite the paining long work hours, he is on a low payroll that does not even come close to stacking his home’s pantry or settling big bills. Ayesh, 41, runs a 7:00 am to 7:00 pm shift for the low rate of 750 shekels ($200) a month which against skyrocketing prices, cannot make ends meet. His only solace in working long hours on low income is being able to provide, although a little, to his family. Father to six children, among which is Ahmed who goes to the Faculty of Arts at the Islamic University in Gaza, Ayesh noted that he had to borrow from some relatives to save money for his son’s education. Sending Ahmed to a four-year program at university came after a huge debt which Ayesh said he does not know how to repay. Better off than many workers and citizens in the Gaza Strip, Ayesh is lucky to be employed with hundreds of thousands of workers and citizens living with unemployment and below the poverty line….

The government of Belgium’s generous support to education in emergencies gives Gaza children a voice

UNRWA 11 Jan — “You hear my voice, you hear that sound, like thunder gonna shake your ground…’Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar!” sing the Gaza teens at the UNRWA Asma School for Girls (A) over a patchy broadband connection to their peers in Brussels. Students from the Athenee Bruxelles School II are inspired to join in by voicing the Katy Perry pop-song lyrics. The online exchange is part of the My Voice-My School education project, which empowers Palestine refugee children by giving them a voice and an opportunity to communicate with their peers overseas. Gazan and Belgian students are among the 300 young people participating in these virtual exchanges, which involve fifteen schools in Gaza, Syria, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Norway. For most of the Gaza UNRWA students, this is the first time they meet ‘foreigners’. Paired with overseas partner schools, they are working to advocate for the right of every child to a quality education, wherever they are. Today, the Gaza girls are presenting the results of surveys they have designed and carried out on improving education in their school to their peers in Belgium. The class has identified noise as a factor affecting students’ education. There is a loud generator which provides electricity to the school….

More than 1,000 settlement homes approved in West Bank

Al Jazeera 11 Jan — Israel has approved the construction of more than 1,000 settlement units in the occupied West Bank, the Peace Now NGO has reported. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Maliki criticised the plan, blaming the United States for “giving the green light” to Israel to do “whatever it wants with Palestinian land”. Speaking to the Voice of Palestine Radio, Maliki said that the new settlement units was “one outcome of US President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.” The Israeli Peace Now organisation, which is opposed to settlements, said the homes would be constructed in 20 settlements.

Israeli forces inform Hebron family of home’s demolition order

HEBRON (WAFA) 10 Jan – Israeli forces Wednesday handed a family living south of Hebron a demolition order of a residential structure in use, said local sources. According to Rateb Jabour, who monitors Israeli activities in the southern West Bank, Israeli forces raided Umm al-Khair locale east of Yatta and handed Zaid Hathalin a demolition order of an in-use residential structure. He was given until the 24th of January to evict and prepare for demolition.

Jewish clergy urge Netanyahu not to demolish Palestinian village in West Bank

MEMO 11 Jan — More than 300 Jewish clergy have written to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging him not to allow the mass demolition of Palestinian homes in Susiya, reports the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Israeli occupation authorities have said they intend to carry out mass demolitions in Susiya, located in the southern West Bank, on the basis that the structures were built “illegally”. Palestinians are routinely denied permits in so-called “Area C” of the West Bank, some 60 per cent of the territory. “The village of Susiya, like its counterparts throughout Area C of the West Bank, has consistently had its applications for building permits denied,” said the letter sent Tuesday. “We are taught in the Torah that there must be one law for all, yet the settlers living alongside Susiya are allowed to participate in the planning and development of their own communities.” The 315 signatories “covered the gamut of religious streams, including Orthodox, Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist clergy,” reported JTA.

‘You want a girl? How many?’: Tapes reveal how right-wing group tried to make East Jerusalem Jewish

Haaretz 10 Jan by Nir Hasson — “You want a girl? One, two, how many do you want … how old do you want?” The speaker is Matityahu Dan, chairman of the Ateret Cohanim organization and a driving force behind Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. He is offering a girl, plus Viagra if needed, to the Palestinian owner of a property his organization seeks to acquire. The above conversation took place about two decades ago. Since then, Ateret Cohanim has acquired many properties. This and other recordings obtained by Haaretz offer a glimpse into how Jewish groups acquire Palestinian property in East Jerusalem. In them, Dan and other Ateret Cohanim employees, including the group’s attorney, Eitan Geva, speak freely about how their end justifies any means. Aside from offering sex services (as long as the girls aren’t Jewish), they threaten to publicize the negotiations, which could endanger the Palestinian owner’s life, if he refuses to sell….

Party of Nelson Mandela calls to increase boycott of Israel

MEMO 11 Jan — The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has called for greater solidarity with the Palestinian people while urging South Africa’s Minister of Home Affairs, Comrade Ayanda Dlodlo, to re-evaluate the country’s visa policy with Israel following the decision by the government in Tel Aviv to blacklist BDS South Africa along with dozens of other organisations. The party of Nelson Mandela, which voted to downgrade South Africa’s embassy in Israel last month, cautioned the Israeli government for blacklisting supporters of the BDS movement. The organisations listed, including a Quaker group that helped save Jews from Hitler’s Nazi regime, will not be allowed entry to Israel-Palestine due to their support for BDS. The list also singles out BDS South Africa, whose members include prominent figures from the ANC. In its statement, released following the publication of the blacklist, the ANC denounced its inclusion, pointing to many of its members that are currently serving as government ministers and who have been appointed to senior positions within the Parliament of South Africa. These MPs, premiers and mayors, said the ANC, are “vocal” in their “public supporters of Palestine”….

French NGOs call for firm action against Israel over entry bar

MEMO 11 Jan — The France-Palestine Solidarity Association (AFPS) and BDS-France have denounced the Israeli government’s decision to include them on a list of 21 foreign NGOs whose members are banned from entry. AFPS, the largest French organisation supporting the Palestinian cause, issued a statement denouncing the Israeli government’s decision, describing it as “political” saying the Netanyahu government wants to silence all voices that uncover its daily policies and violations against the Palestinian people’s rights. The association said the decision officially targets foreign citizens which is a flagrant violation of international conventions and treaties, stressing that it will not be intimidated and will continue its actions and activities in order to defend the Palestinian people’s rights and expose Israel to the French and European public. Bertrand Heilbronn, the organisation’s president, called on the French government to respond firmly to Israel by calling for the immediate cancellation of these measures….

The Tamimi family

‘I’m not sorry’: Nur Tamimi explains why she slapped an Israeli soldier

[includes video of interview with Mohammed] Haaretz 12 Jan by Gideon Levy & Alex Levac — A not-unexpected guest arrived at Nur Tamimi’s house last weekend: Mohammed Tamimi, the 15-year-old cousin and neighbor, who was shot in the head. He came over to congratulate Nur on her release on bail from an Israeli prison. She was delighted to see him standing there, despite his serious head wound. Last week, when we visited Mohammed, he hadn’t yet been told that Nur, 21, and their 16-year-old cousin Ahed, had been detained. Nor did he know that it was the bullet fired into his head from short range that had prompted the two cousins to go outside and attack two trespassing soldiers. Now, at home, surrounded by television cameras, Nur confirms that the assault on the two soldiers was partly motivated by the fact that they invaded Ahed’s yard on December 15 – but the main reason was that they had just then read on Facebook that Mohammed had suffered an apparently mortal wound. He was shot a few dozen meters from Nur’s home. Ahed’s home is also a few steps away – all of the cousins live close to the entrance of the village of Nabi Saleh, near Ramallah. Ahed and her mother, Nariman, have now been in prison for three weeks, Mohammed is recovering from his wound and Nur is back home after 16 days in detention – an ordeal she would never have had to endure if she weren’t a Palestinian. Nur was involved in the incident with the soldiers, but the video of it shows clearly that she was far less aggressive than Ahed: She barely touched the soldiers….

[Nur’s father] Naji is 55 and speaks Hebrew quite well, having picked up the language in the 1980s when he worked in Israel polishing floor tiles. You have to spend time with Naji and Bushra – and also Ahed’s parents, Bassem and Nariman – to grasp how degrading, inflammatory and ignorant the Israeli right-wing propaganda is that has labeled these impressive people a “family of murderers.” Naji works in the Palestinian Authority’s Coordination and Liaison Office, but stresses that has no direct contact with Israelis. A pleasant, sociable individual and a veteran member of Fatah, he’s the father of three daughters and two sons. The text on the newly coined poster above his head in the spacious living room states: “No one will turn off the light [nur, in Arabic]. #FreeNur.”…

Lieberman imposes collective punishment on Tamimi family

MEMO 11 Jan — Israeli Defence Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, issued orders to the concerned occupation authority to impose collective punishment and punitive measures against the Tamimi family. The move comes after video footage circulated showing members of the family driving away occupation soldiers from in front of their home in the village of Nabi Saleh on 15 December. The punitive measures imposed by the occupation authorities on Lieberman’s orders include isolating the family by revoking the entry visas of 20 of its members. This is under the pretext of the entire family being involved in acts of “violence and incitement of terrorism”. In addition to this, Lieberman signed an order banning Ahed Tamimi’s father, Bassem, from travelling, according to the security institution. Her father is a former security prisoner due to his acts of resistance against the occupation. According to Israel Hayom newspaper, Lieberman signed Bassem’s travel ban because “he has a long history of imprisonment due to his involvement in past security cases”. The newspaper quoted Lieberman saying: “Dealing with Tamimi and her family has to be severe, exhaust all legal measures and generate deterrence,” adding, that his office “would not tolerate incidents where Palestinian protesters accost Israeli soldiers and incite terrorism.” The military prosecution presented an indictment against Ahed Tamimi to the Military Court in the occupied West Bank, on two counts of assaulting an Israeli army soldier. A similar indictment was presented against her cousins Iman and Nur Tamimi, on counts of assaulting occupation soldiers and threatening to throw stones at them.

Israeli army sues Palestinian family for damages caused to vehicle that killed their son

RAMALLAH (WAFA) 11 Jan by Ihab Rimawi – In an unprecedented and bizarre move, the Israeli army is suing a Palestinian family for damages caused to a military vehicle that ran into a wall while chasing their son at high speed and then flipped over him and killed him. Abdullah Ghneimat, 22, from the village of Kufr Malik, east of Ramallah, was chased by an army jeep in the early morning hour on June 14, 2015 when he was returning home from work. He was surprised to see soldiers in his village and therefore ran away, prompting the soldiers to go after him. Ghneimat took cover behind a wall, but the jeep ran into the wall and then turned over and fell on him, killing him. Not only that, the soldiers also opened fire at a bulldozer the village residents had brought to lift the army jeep to release Ghneimat’s body and they refused to remove the jeep for three hours, according to witnesses. The family wanted to sue the army for killing its son in that manner. Attorney Naela Attiyeh filed a lawsuit against the army in a military court hoping to bring some justice and comfort to the bereaved family.

However, the attorney and family where surprised when two days ago they got an email telling them that the army is suing Abu Ghneimat’s family for $28,000 to pay for damages caused to the army vehicle that killed their son. “This is the first time that the army sues a family of a Palestinian its forces have killed demanding financial compensation,” said Attiyeh. “They kill him and then they ask for reparations.” “If they want reparations, they should first bring our son back,” said Ghneimat’s father, Iyad. “This case is pure extortion,” he said. “They want to pressure us to drop the lawsuit against them, but we insist on it regardless of the price even though we know that the army and the court are two faces of the same coin.”

[This version of the story is being included here since it wasn’t clear in the IMEMC story (in the 8 Jan newslist) how much the army is suing for in damages. The IMEMC story said 95.260 Israeli shekels, which depending on whether the period in the amount was being used in the American or the European sense could have been either about $28 or about $28,000.]

Palestinian refugees live in fear of Trump aid cuts

BETHLEHEM, occupied West Bank (Al Jazeera) 10 Jan by Ibrahim Husseini — Palestinians living in refugee camps have expressed deep alarm over US threats to potentially cut funding for a relief agency tasked with providing aid and services to them. For nearly 70 years, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) has been the lifeline to the more than five million registered Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and neighbouring countries. It offers support in food supply, access to education, healthcare, social services and employment. “Today, more than two-thirds of refugees are children who go to UNRWA schools. If the schools shut down, there will be a big problem,” Salah Ajarmeh, a 44-year-old living in Aida refugee camp outside of Bethlehem, told Al Jazeera. “The refugee issue is a red line.” The US is the largest contributor to UNRWA – in 2016, it donated more than $364m to the agency. It also provides the Palestinian Authority – the governmental body which administers pockets of the West Bank – with some $400m annually. But on January 3, less than a month after prompting Palestinian anger and international outcry for naming Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, US President Donald Trump threatened to cut aid to Palestinians …

Al Jazeera visited the ‘Aida and Dheisheh refugee camps in the occupied West Bank town of Bethlehem and asked several Palestinians living there about their reaction to the potential cuts. Many of them hail from Palestinian villages that were ethnically cleansed during the establishment of Israel in 1948, known to Palestinians as the Nakba – or “catastrophe”….

EU, Norway to hold emergency meeting on Palestine aid

MEMO 11 Jan — The EU and Norway will be convening an emergency meeting at the end of this month for donor groups providing aid to Palestinians, following the US’ threat to cut funding to UNRWA, according to Haaretz. The conference is due to take place on 31 January, with Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Yoav Mordechai representing Israel. Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Marie Soreide and European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini are also expected to be in attendance. The meeting comes amid US President Donald Trump’s threat to cut funding to the Palestinians if they do not resume negotiations with the US. The Palestinian Authority (PA) cut ties with the Trump Administration following America’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel … Earlier this week, UNWRA warned that US funding cuts, which amount to some $300 million – a third of the agency’s budget – will hurt half a million Palestinian children.

Ahmad Tibi: No deal for Palestine under Donald Trump

JERUSALEM (Al Jazeera) 9 Jan by Ali Younes — Ahmad Tibi, a prominent Arab member of Israel’s Parliament, said a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict under US President Donald Trump would be impossible. Speaking to Al Jazeera from his office in the Knesset, Tibi said there is no political solution in the cards, despite US statements to the contrary. “There was nothing on the horizon when Trump came to power, and now that he is in power, a solution is impossible,” he said. Tibi also dismissed the so-called “deal-of the-century”, which, according to media reports offers the Palestinians a state in Gaza and parts of the West Bank, minus Jerusalem. According to Tibi, Trump and his allies have made a radical departure from previous US policies, especially on the issues of Jerusalem and illegal Israeli settlements. Prior to Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, US policy considered the city occupied territory and a subject to final status talks between the two sides. “No doubt that the Trump decision is a complete adaptation of the Israeli narrative about Jerusalem and is a complete departure from the US foreign policy on the Middle East,” Tibi said. In 1947, the UN’s partition plan in Palestine envisioned dividing the territory into two separate states, but would have left Jerusalem under an international administration.

However, Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s minister of regional cooperation, told Al Jazeera that Trump’s decision on December 6 should not hinder Palestinian claims to have occupied East Jerusalem as their capital. “We claim that Jerusalem is our capital and should not be divided, but that’s only a claim, not a diktat,” Hanegbi, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s Likud party, told Al Jazeera. “Palestinians can claim East Jerusalem as their capital and we can negotiate a settlement. Although we annexed East Jerusalem, it is still up for negotiations,” said Hanegbi. Jerusalem remains at the core of the perennial Israel-Palestine conflict….

Palestinian education ministry denies UC incitement claims

MEMO 11 Jan — The Palestinian Ministry of Education yesterday denied US claims that Palestinian textbooks are riddled with incitement and call for violence, Quds Press reported. Curriculum chief Tharwat Zeid said: “We reject American criteria to evaluate and degrade the Palestinian textbooks based on the Israeli vision.” The Palestinian education ministry “is not ready to have any side check Palestinian textbooks and compare them with the Israelis which clearly include incitement and calls for violence.” Zeid stressed that the Palestinian syllabus “maintains the Palestinian principles”, adding: “We are in the stage of a national liberation. The oppressed Palestinians have been suffering from Israeli violations for tens of years and they are calling for the return of their rights.” He also said that the Palestinian syllabus “reinforces the Palestinian national culture, history, values and heritage.” He called for Israeli textbooks to be checked for their use of “dirty words to describe the Arabs and frankly call for killing them, practicing violence and racism against them.” The Palestinian education ministry said that this “violent attack on the Palestinian syllabus aims to undermine the Palestinian national identity and the role of education in reinforcing this identity.”

Porn Star Builds Darth Vader Out Of 300 Sex Toys ? Kayla-Jane Danger,http://mrhairybrit.com/2018/01/12/porn-star-builds-darth-vader-out-of-300-sex-toys-kayla-jane-danger/,"Porn Star Makes Darth Vader Out Of 300 Sex Toys, Kayla-Jane Danger // Hardcore and Lesbian Porn star Kayla-Jane Danger and the team at Wood Rocket have built life size sex toy Darth Vader out of dildos, rubber fists, vibrators, anal beads, handcuffs and more.

Actress Kayla-Jane Danger, 29, recently built a 7-foot-tall Darth Vader statue made entirely out of sex toys. “It’s easily the most unique thing I’ve done in porn,” Danger told The Huffington Post.

The statue, dubbed “Darth Vibrader,” used more than $3,000 worth of sex toys, including 200 vibrators, 10 paddles, a whip, two rows of anal beads, a rubber fist and a pair of what Danger called “hooker boots.”

It took Danger and her co-creators, special effects artist Todd Devlin and porn producer Seth Beard more than eight hours to consummate the sex toy statue. “We had to do two additional sex toy runs because we didn’t have enough,” said Danger, a former student at New York’s Parsons School of Design.

Amazingly, Danger wasn’t a Star Wars fan growing up. “It wasn’t until my late teens that I could watch it without falling asleep,” she said. “Plus, I used to get teased a lot because I would wear my hair Princess Leia-style. One of my friends wanted me to do that for this, but I said no.”

Police say Christa Leigh Steele-Knudslien was stabbed and beaten to death by her husband.

Steele-Knudslien is the first known transgender person to be killed this year, LGBT organization GLAAD said. She was found dead in her North Adams home on Friday evening. Her husband, Mark Steele-Knudslien, pleaded not guilty to murder on Monday, days after police say he admitted hitting her with a hammer and stabbing her after an argument.

Christa Steele-Knudslien Facebook via Human Rights Watch

Christa Steele-Knudslien, 42, was well known in the Massachusetts transgender community for her activism and helped launch the first New England Trans Pride event a decade ago, friends said. She and other advocates later started the Miss Trans New England Pageant, which brought together transgender women from across the region, said A. Vickie Boisseau, who officiated at her wedding last April.

Another longtime friend, Justin Adkins, said, ""Her thing was always that transgender women are beautiful and need a venue for trans women to be seen as beautiful.""

South Korea's president credits Trump for talks with North Korea,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/10/moon-jae-south-koreas-president-credits-donald-tru/,"South Korea’s president said Wednesday that President Trump “deserves big credit” for renewed talks between South and North Korea, and that Mr. Trump has offered to negotiate personally with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

“It could be a resulting work of the U.S.-led sanctions and pressure,” President Moon Jae-in told reporters. “I think President Trump deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks.”

Mr. Trump told Mr. Moon in a phone call that he is open to talking with North Korea, the South’s presidential office said. Mr. Trump also said there would be no military action while talks are ongoing, the statement said.

The White House said that Mr. Moon thanked the president “for his influential leadership in making the talks possible.”

The North-South talks, held on Tuesday, were the first in two years, and North Korea announced that it would send a delegation to the Olympics in Pyeongchang next month. Mr. Trump said Vice President Mike Pence will lead the U.S. delegation to the games.

In their phone call, the White House said the two leaders “underscored the importance of continuing the maximum pressure campaign against North Korea.”

“President Trump expressed his openness to holding talks between the United States and North Korea at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances,” the White House said.

Mr. Moon said he wanted to show Mr. Trump his gratitude.

Mr. Trump tweeted last week that he believes his pressure on Pyongyang has produced results.

“Does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total ‘might’ against the North,” the president tweeted, adding that “talks are a good thing!”

Mr. Trump has raised the pressure on North Korea for the past year, pressing China to isolate Pyongyang economically and diplomatically. He also has imposed new U.S. sanctions and gained new U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile programs.

Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, an ally of the administration, said on Twitter that the North-South talks “are a waste of oxygen.”

“We’ll have scenes of the two Koreas parading on TV at the Olympic opening ceremony, but as far as the North Korea nuclear threat is concerned, it won’t change a thing,” Mr. Bolton said.

China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats: IEEFA report says China will dominate international investment in renewable technology over the next several decades,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says,"IEEFA report says China will dominate international investment in renewable technology over the next several decades

China is moving towards becoming a global leader in renewable technology as the US pulls away, a new report has said.

China is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and still invests in coal but in recent years it has become the largest investor in domestic renewable energy. The country is now on track to lead international investment in the sector, according to the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

“As the global transition toward renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicles technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself up to dominate these sectors globally over the next several decades of this century,” said IEEFA.

Global coal consumption forecast to slow Read more

IEEFA identified a record high spend of more than US$44bn by China on international takeovers and projects worth more than $1bn – a 38% year-on-year growth.

China’s One Belt One Road agenda, which drives infrastructure investment along ancient trade routes, is leading the country’s growth. $8bn of solar equipment has been exported from China since it began, and the country has overtaken the US and Germany to become the number one exporter of environmental goods and services.

“China’s presence in wind power globally is also on the rise, led by international activities of companies such as Goldwind and by China Three Gorges’ diversification away from hydroelectricity,” the report said.

The trajectory is in stark contrast to that of the US, which last year pulled out of the Paris climate accord and has renewed its support for the coal industry. The decision to abandon the Paris agreement “led to China’s quick reaffirmation of its emissions-reduction pledge”, the report said.

“That allows it to further project itself globally as a responsible major power while addressing its domestic air pollution concerns and building world-leading capacity in new energy markets.”

As part of its Paris commitments, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 while making best efforts to peak earlier. It would also increase the share of renewable or nuclear energy sources to 20%.

Co-author of the report and director of IEEFA, Tim Buckley, said China was setting itself up as a global technology leader “whilst the US government looks the other way”.

“Although China isn’t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.”

The report noted the August 2017 merger of China’s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the “big five” power utilities, China Guodian Corp.

The newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world’s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua’s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal.

“[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China’s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,” the IEEFA said.

The report also found China was “outmanoeuvring other economies” in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles.

Energy agency rejects Trump plan to prop up coal and nuclear power plants Read more

On Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants.

Last year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called “war on coal”.

However, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid.",JustBadNews,0

Plastic microbeads can no longer be used in cosmetics and personal care products in the UK, after a long-promised ban came into effect on Tuesday. The ban initially bars the manufacture of such products and a ban on sales will follow in July.

Thousands of tonnes of plastic microbeads from products such as exfoliating face scrubs and toothpastes wash into the sea every year, where they harm wildlife and can ultimately be eaten by people. The UK government first pledged to ban plastic microbeads in September 2016, following a US ban in 2015.

The huge problem of plastic pollution choking the oceans has gained a high profile with recent revelations that there are five trillion pieces of plastic floating in the world’s seas and that the debris has reached the most remote parts of the oceans, Microbeads are a small but significant part of this which campaigners argued was the easiest to prevent.

“The world’s oceans are some of our most valuable natural assets and I am determined we act now to tackle the plastic that devastates our precious marine life,” said environment minister Thérèse Coffey. “Now we have reached this important milestone, we will explore how we can build on our world-leading ban and tackle other forms of plastic waste.”

Dilyana Mihaylova, at Fauna & Flora International, said: “We are delighted that a robust UK microbeads ban comes into force today. We hope this ban signals the dawn of a new era in the fight for cleaner, healthier oceans.”

Pressure is now mounting for action on plastic bottles – a million are bought every minute around the world and they make up a third of the plastic litter in the seas. In December, the UK’s environmental audit committee (EAC) of MPs called for a deposit return scheme, which has successfully increased recycling rates in other countries.

Mary Creagh MP, EAC chair, said: “The microbead ban is a step in the right direction, but much more needs to be done. Since we called for a ban, my committee has also recommended the deposit return scheme, a latte levy for plastic-lined coffee cups and reforms to make producers responsible for their packaging. We look forward to hearing the government’s response.”

On Sunday, the prime minister, Theresa May tweeted: “In 2015 we introduced the 5p charge on plastic carrier bags, we now see 9bn fewer bags being used. It’s making a real difference. We want to do the same with single use plastics. Nobody who watched #BluePlanet2 will doubt the need for us to do something - and we will.”

May’s government has signalled a series of environmental moves, including a ban on ivory sales and on wild animals in circuses, as well as tougher sentences for those convicted of abusing animals and retracting a manifesto pledge on a parliamentary vote to reinstate fox hunting.

Political observers say the moves are intended to woo younger voters and the prime minister is expected to give a speech on the environment later this week. However, on the major policy issue of the illegal levels of air pollution in most urban areas that cause many thousands of premature deaths, the government’s action has been condemned as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors.",JustBadNews,0

Comcast fired 500 despite claiming tax cut would create thousands of jobs,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/comcast-fired-500-despite-claiming-tax-cut-would-create-thousands-of-jobs/,"Comcast reportedly fired about 500 salespeople shortly before Christmas, despite claiming that the company would create thousands of new jobs in exchange for a big tax cut.

Comcast apparently tried to keep the firings secret while it lobbied for the tax cut that was eventually passed into law by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President Trump in late December. The Philadelphia Inquirer revealed the Comcast firings this week in an article based on information from an anonymous former employee, Comcast documents, and other sources in the company.

The former employee who talked to the Inquirer ""could not be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement as part of a severance package,"" the article said. The Inquirer headline notes that Comcast was able to implement the firings ""quietly,"" avoiding any press coverage until this week.

Ars asked Comcast today if all 500 fired employees had to sign those nondisclosure agreements, but we didn't receive an answer. We also asked why the firings were necessary given that the tax cut was supposed to create more Comcast jobs, and we asked if Comcast has specific plans to create jobs in other areas.

Comcast gave us this statement but offered no further details: ""Periodically, we reorganize groups of employees and adjust our sales tactics and talent. This change in the Central Division is an example of this practice and occurred in the context of our adding hundreds of frontline and sales employees. All these employees were offered generous severance and an opportunity to apply for other jobs at Comcast.""

A Comcast spokesperson also confirmed the firings to the Inquirer.

“Thousands of new direct and indirect jobs”

The firings happened around December 15. On December 20, Comcast announced that, because of the pending tax cut and recent repeal of net neutrality rules, it would give ""special bonuses"" of $1,000 to more than 100,000 employees and invest more than $50 billion in infrastructure over the next five years.

""With these investments, we expect to add thousands of new direct and indirect jobs,"" Comcast said at the time.

We examined Comcast's investment claims in an article on December 21. As it turns out, Comcast's annual investments already soared during the two-plus years that net neutrality rules were on the books, and the $50 billion amount could be achieved if those investments simply continued increasing by a modest amount.

Comcast was one of the most active companies lobbying for lower corporate tax rates in 2017, Vox reported shortly before the tax changes passed in December.

The 500 fired employees were ""managers, supervisors, and direct sales people in Chicago, Florida, and other parts of Comcast's Central region, mostly in the Midwest and Southeastern United States,"" the Inquirer reported.

These include many salespeople ""who walk neighborhoods and troll apartment complexes to pitch [Comcast's] telecom and TV services."" When Comcast announced the firings internally, the employees were told that a new direct sales system requires fewer humans, the fired employee told the Inquirer.

Comcast explained the firings to the Inquirer with this statement:

The Central Division is creating a new territory-based sales model that will connect more closely with residential prospects and customers in their communities. By giving highly trained sales professionals direct responsibility for entire neighborhoods, we can provide a better experience for those who are interested in our services, during and after the sale.

Comcast also told the Inquirer that terminated employees can receive a ""$1,000 supplemental severance payment"" that matches the size of the bonus given to workers who are still employed.

""Comcast offered severance and several months of health-care coverage, [the Comcast spokesperson] said,"" according to the Inquirer.

It stands to reason that more firings could follow if Comcast rolls the same new sales model out to other parts of its nationwide territory. The company, including the NBCUniversal division, has about 159,000 employees.

The Inquirer article included personal stories about the fired Comcast workers:

One employee kept holding his head and saying, ""I can't believe it. I can't believe it."" Another worried about how to find new healthcare coverage. A third employee was close to purchasing a new home and feared the personal income hit.

UPDATE: Separately, Comcast is also laying off 405 employees from a single facility in Atlanta, and moving other employees from the facility to different sites, according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle. Comcast told the paper that ""impacted employees are being encouraged to apply for more than 180 open, similar positions in metro Atlanta, as well as jobs elsewhere in the company."" Comcast apparently estimated that the layoff will ""impact"" 290 people or jobs in a notice filed with the Georgia state government.

AT&T lays off workers after saying tax cut would create jobs

Comcast isn't the only company whose actions contradict statements that workers would benefit from the corporate tax cut. AT&T claimed that it would invest another $1 billion because of the tax cut and said that ""research tells us that every $1 billion in capital invested in telecom creates about 7,000 good jobs for the middle class.""

But as we wrote yesterday, AT&T is now laying off thousands of employees and is facing a lawsuit from a workers' union that is trying to stop the mass layoffs.",JustBadNews,0

The federal grand jury handing down indictments for special counsel Robert Mueller doesn’t appear to include any supporters of President Donald Trump, according to one witness who recently testified before the panel.

“The grand jury room looks like a Bernie Sanders rally,” my source said. “Maybe they found these jurors in central casting, or at a Black Lives Matter rally in Berkeley [Calif.]”

Of the 20 jurors, 11 are African-Americans and two were wearing “peace T-shirts,” the witness said. “There was only one white male in the room, and he was a prosecutor.” Mueller was not present.

The Washington, DC, grand jury, which meets only on Fridays, handed down its first indictments in October, charging Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and his partner Rick Gates with money laundering and failing to register as foreign agents. The two are pleading not guilty.

Mueller’s team is expected to bring more charges against Manafort relating to his work on behalf of the Ukrainian government in the years before Trump became a candidate.

Sol Wachtler, the former chief judge in New York, once called for abolishing grand juries because they are so easily manipulated that they would “indict a ham sandwich.”

Trump accuses DOJ of being part of 'deep state',https://apnews.com/8720fde079e84237b8e6cca4219aafb2/Trump-accuses-DOJ-of-being-part-of-'deep-state',"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump accused the Justice Department Tuesday of being part of the “deep state” and urged prosecution against a top aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey.

He also claimed that U.S. sanctions on North Korea were having a “big impact” and that he was responsible for preventing commercial aviation deaths in 2017.

Trump’s latest tweets pressed familiar arguments for the president, who is set to begin his first full year in office with the victory of tax legislation but the Russia investigation still hanging over his administration.

“Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents,” Trump tweeted in an apparent reference to a report by the conservative Daily Caller.

“Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others,” he added.

As he remains shadowed by the special counsel’s Russia investigation, Trump has seized on recent revelations of anti-Trump behavior by some FBI officials, including some who once worked on special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, to claim bias against him.

The president’s reference Tuesday to “Deep State Justice Dept” suggests that federal law enforcement is part of an entrenched bureaucracy that Trump and his supporters say didn’t want him to be elected and is actively working to undermine his presidency.

Trump’s reference to sailors likely referred to a Navy sailor convicted of taking photos of classified areas inside a submarine.

Trump’s blast at the Justice Department came after he returned to the White House from a holiday getaway to face legislative challenges, midterm elections and global threats. He issued confrontational tweets targeting Iran, which in recent days has been rocked by anti-government protests, and Pakistan.

“The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their ‘pockets.’ The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!”

On Monday, Trump slammed Pakistan for “lies & deceit,” saying it had played U.S. leaders for “fools” by not doing enough to control militants.

“The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” Trump said.

Pakistani officials, including Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif, said the country would make clear “the difference between facts and fiction.”

It was not immediately clear what prompted Trump to comment on Pakistan. The U.S. has long accused Pakistan of allowing militants to operate relatively freely in its border regions to carry out operations in neighboring Afghanistan. The U.S. said in August that it would hold up $255 million in military assistance for Pakistan until it cracks down on extremists threatening Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Monday the United States should be aware that his country’s nuclear forces are now a reality, not a future threat. To that, Trump said only: “We’ll see.”

At home, Trump is hoping for more legislative achievements after his success on cutting taxes. He plans to host Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin at Camp David next weekend to map out the 2018 legislative agenda.

Republicans are eager to make progress before attention shifts to the November midterm elections. The GOP wants to hold the House and Senate, but must contend with Trump’s historic unpopularity and some recent Democratic wins, including the pickup of a Senate seat in deeply Republican Alabama.

The White House has said Trump will come forward with his long-awaited infrastructure plan in January. Trump has also said he wants to overhaul welfare and recently predicted Democrats and Republicans will “eventually come together” to develop a new health care plan.

Ryan has talked about overhauling Medicaid and Medicare and other safety-net programs, but McConnell has signaled an unwillingness to go that route unless there’s Democratic support for any changes. Republicans will have just a 51-49 Senate majority — well shy of the 60 votes needed to pass most bills — giving leverage to Democrats.

Congress also has to deal with a backlog from 2017, including agreeing on a spending bill by Jan. 19 to avert a partial government shutdown. There’s also providing additional aid to hurricane victims, lifting the debt ceiling, extending a children’s health insurance program and extending protections for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump has said he wants money for a border wall in exchange for protecting those immigrants.",JustBadNews,0
"Apple: Yes, we're slowing down older iPhones",http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/21/technology/apple-slows-down-old-iphones/index.html,"Apple has acknowledged what many iPhone owners long suspected: It has slowed older phones.

The tech giant issued a rare statement of explanation on Thursday, saying that it has used software updates to limit the performance of older iPhones that may have battery issues that would cause them to turn off suddenly.

Tech analysts and angry customers have reported in recent days that operating system updates had caused older iPhones to slow considerably, with some suggesting that Apple could be using the tactic to encourage fans to buy new phones.

Apple insists the updates were made with a different goal in mind: It said the performance of lithium-ion batteries degrades over time, which can sometimes cause phones to suddenly shut down in order to protect their components.

The company said its software updates for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, iPhone SE and iPhone 7 are designed to ""smooth out"" peak power demands, prevent these surprise shutdowns and ultimately prolong the lifespan of batteries.

But the updates can also lead to disappointing speeds.

Doron Myersdorf, CEO instant-charging battery startup StoreDot, said that ""smoothing out"" means that phones will reorder incoming commands to make sure not all of them are done in parallel.

""The inevitable outcome of it will be an inherent slowdown of the average response times by the system,"" he explained.

Apple (AAPL) said in its statement that it will continue to use the feature with other products in the future.

""Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices,"" it said.

The revelation sparked an outcry among Apple fans, with some suggesting they may switch to rival Samsung.

Washington State: Comcast was ?even more deceptive? than we thought,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/washington-state-comcast-was-even-more-deceptive-than-we-thought/,"The attorney general of Washington has filed a new amended complaint in an ongoing lawsuit against Comcast, claiming that ""new evidence"" reveals ""even more deceptive conduct than previously alleged.""

The lawsuit, which was initially submitted in August 2016, alleged that hundreds of thousands of Washington residents were ""deceived"" into paying ""at least $73 million in subscription fees over the last five years for a near-worthless ‘protection plan.’""

According to the amended complaint, which was filed in King County Superior Court on Thursday, newly obtained recorded calls between Comcast and its Washington customers who subscribed to its ""Service Protection Plan"" show ""that Comcast may have signed up more than half of all SPP subscribers without their consent. Comcast deceived consumers even when mentioning the SPP, telling them the SPP plan was ‘free’ when they signed up, when in fact, Comcast would automatically charge them every month after the first month.""

In a statement, Attorney General Bob Ferguson called this new evidence ""even more egregious than we first realized.""

""The extent of their deception is shocking, and I will hold them accountable for their treatment of Washington consumers,"" he continued.

As Ars reported earlier, Comcast’s claims are misleading for several reasons, according to the Washington AG’s office. The service plans do not cover repairs of wire concealed within walls (or ""wall-fished""). Some customers were told that the plans cover work outside their homes, even though repairs to Comcast equipment or outside wiring ""are already covered [for free] by Comcast's Customer Guarantee promises,"" the lawsuit said.

""In short, due to limitations in the Terms and Conditions, the SPP often ends up failing to cover any repairs at all,"" the complaint continued.

""The short coaxial cable running from a customer's outlet to the cable box is typically Comcast Equipment that is covered by the Comcast Guarantee rather than the SPP, as are the HDMI cables provided by Comcast, and in many houses all of the remaining wiring is wall-fished. And as noted above, the SPP does not cover repairs to customer equipment, Comcast equipment, or outside wiring, either. In its advertisements and sales scripts, Comcast omitted the fact that repairs to customer equipment are not considered part of a 'service call.' Likewise, the advertisements failed to disclose that the Comcast Guarantee already covers service calls that ""result from a Comcast equipment or network problem.""

Comcast did not require customers to sign any agreement or confirm that they read the service plan terms and conditions before subscribing, and Comcast doesn't train or require its sales reps to send a copy of the terms and conditions to customers, the lawsuit said.

In May 2017, Comcast was ordered by King County Superior Court Judge Timothy Bradshaw to provide recordings of previous phone calls illustrating instances where Washingtonians were sold the SPP. In response, Comcast turned over 1,500 such calls.

According to the attorney general office’s new statement, it analyzed a ""random sample"" of 150 calls and found that in half of these calls, the SPP was not even mentioned. But that wasn't the end of the story.

""Additional consumers in the sample explicitly rejected the SPP, but Comcast signed them up anyway,"" the statement continues. ""Consequently, Comcast enrolled more than half of these subscribers without their consent.""

Comcast, for its part, denied any wrongdoing.

""We strongly disagree with the Attorney General’s new claims,"" Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast vice president and spokeswoman, emailed Ars in a statement.

""The Service Protection Plan gives those consumers who choose to purchase it great value by covering virtually all service charges over 99 percent of the time. The Attorney General’s new assertions are largely based on a flawed methodology and assumptions, and today’s press conference misrepresented the facts. In fact, the court flatly rejected the AG’s mischaracterization of Comcast’s routine handling of agent call records. We will continue to vigorously defend this in court.""",JustBadNews,0
UN votes resoundingly to reject Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as capital,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/21/united-nations-un-vote-donald-trump-jerusalem-israel?,"The United Nations body’s debate and vote highlighted for a second time in a week the international isolation of the United States over the Jerusalem issue

This article is more than 2 years old

The United Nations general assembly has delivered a stinging rebuke to Donald Trump, voting by a huge majority to reject his unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

The vote came after a redoubling of threats by Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, who said that Washington would remember which countries “disrespected” America by voting against it.



Despite the warning, 128 members voted on Thursday in favour of the resolution supporting the longstanding international consensus that the status of Jerusalem – which is claimed as a capital by both Israel and the Palestinians – can only be settled as an agreed final issue in a peace deal. Countries which voted for the resolution included major recipients of US aid such as Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq.



Although largely symbolic, the vote in emergency session of the world body had been the focus of days of furious diplomacy by both the Trump administration and Israel, including Trump’s threat to cut US funding to countries that did not back the US recognition.

But only nine states – including the United States and Israel –voted against the resolution. The other countries which supported Washington were Togo, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Marshall Islands, Guatemala and Honduras.

Play Video 1:03 'We will remember this’: US slams UN Jerusalem vote – video

Twenty-two of the 28 EU countries voted for the resolution, including the UK and France. Germany – which in the past has abstained on measures relating to Israel – also voted in favour.

Thirty-five countries abstained, including five EU states, and other US allies including Australia, Canada, Colombia and Mexico. Ambassadors from several abstaining countries, including Mexico, used their time on the podium to criticise Trump’s unilateral move.

Another 21 delegations were absent from the vote, suggesting the Trump’s warning over funding cuts and Israel’s lobbying may have had some effect.

While support for the resolution was somewhat less than Palestinian officials had hoped, the meagre tally of just nine votes in support of the US and Israeli position was a serious diplomatic blow for Trump.



Immediately after the vote the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, described the result as a “victory for Palestine”. The Palestinians’ UN envoy, Riyad Mansour, described the result as a “massive setback” for the US.

“They made it about them,” Mansour told AFP. “They did not make it about Jerusalem, so when you make it about them and to only be able to get nine votes to say ‘no’ to it, I think it was a complete failure for their campaign.”

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected the UN vote out of hand.



“Israel thanks President Trump for his unequivocal position in favour of Jerusalem and thanks the countries that voted together with Israel, together with the truth,” said a statement from Netanyahu’s office.

Speaking to the assembly before the vote, Haley – who earlier in the week told members that the US “would be taking names” – returned to the offensive.



“I must also say today: when we make generous contributions to the UN, we also have expectation that we will be respected,” she said. “What’s more, we are being asked to pay for the dubious privileges of being disrespected.”

Haley added: “If our investment fails, we have an obligation to spend our investment in other ways … The United States will remember this day.”



Q&A Why is recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital so contentious? Show Hide Of all the issues at the heart of the enduring conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, none is as sensitive as the status of Jerusalem. The holy city has been at the centre of peace-making efforts for decades. Seventy years ago, when the UN voted to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, Jerusalem was defined as a separate entity under international supervision. In the war of 1948 it was divided, like Berlin in the cold war, into western and eastern sectors under Israeli and Jordanian control respectively. Nineteen years later, in June 1967, Israel captured the eastern side, expanded the city’s boundaries and annexed it – an act that was never recognised internationally. Israel routinely describes the city, with its Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy places, as its “united and eternal” capital. For their part, the Palestinians say East Jerusalem must be the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. The unequivocal international view, accepted by all previous US administrations, is that the city’s status must be addressed in peace negotiations. Recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital puts the US out of step with the rest of the world, and legitimises Israeli settlement-building in the east – considered illegal under international law.

In his own speech Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said UN members who backed the resolution were being manipulated. “You are like puppets pulled by your Palestinian masters,” he told the session.

While Thursday’s resolution was in support of existing UN resolutions on Jerusalem and the peace process, the clumsy intervention by Trump and Haley also made the vote a referendum on Trump’s often unilateral and abrasive foreign policy.

The debate and vote highlighted for a second time in a week the international isolation of the United States over the Jerusalem issue, following a similar vote in the security council on Tuesday in which it was outnumbered 14-1.



Trump's bullying and bluster on Jerusalem is bad news for the UN | Patrick Wintour Read more

The threatening US posture, which had been denounced as both counter-productive and “bullying”, only seemed to have hardened the resolve of countries in opposing Trump’s 6 December move.

The resolution, co-sponsored by Turkey and Yemen, called Trump’s recognition “null and void” and reaffirmed 10 security council resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city’s final status must be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

It also “demands that all states comply with security council resolutions regarding the holy city of Jerusalem, and not to recognise any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions”.

Earlier on Thursday, as it had become clear that the US and Israel would be heavily defeated, Netanyahu preemptively denounced the vote calling the UN a “house of lies”.

“The state of Israel rejects this vote outright,” Netanyahu said. “Jerusalem is our capital, we will continue to build there and additional embassies will move to Jerusalem.

“Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, whether or not the UN recognises this. It took 70 years for the United States to formally recognise this, and it will take years for the UN to do the same.”

Michael Oren, Israel’s deputy minister for diplomacy, called for Israel to cut its ties with the UN and expel the organisation from its Jerusalem offices.

“We must evict the UN from the scenic Governor’s House, where its bloated staff does nothing, and give this historic site to a school, a hospital or – best yet – a new US embassy.”",JustBadNews,0

The first rape took place on November 4, and saw a young woman raped by several assailants after a party in Segevång, north Malmo.

Just over a week later, a woman was attacked and raped by a number of men at a bus stop in Södervärn, central Malmo.

Saturday's rape took place just a few streets away in Sofielund, and saw the 17-year-old attacked by a group of men in a playground.

'This is a horrible, particularly severe crime with exceedingly brutal violence,' Andy Roberts, head of area police in North Malmo told Helsinborg's Dagblad.

He would not give the newspaper details of the violence the victim was subjected to, but added: 'There are limits, even for me, as an old experienced police officer.'

Fighting back: Protesters demanded that the government take action against rapists and that police do more to protect women in Sweden

Wave: Three young women have been gang raped in Malmo in less than three weeks by 'young men unknown to them'

A local newspaper reports that the victims in all three cases were teenagers.

Police say that while there is no obvious connection between the rapes, it cannot be ruled out as investigations are still ongoing.

All three incidents took place between midnight and 3am and assailants were all young men unknown to the victims, Sydsvenskan reports.

Yesterday's protest, filmed by a participant, saw demonstrators demand police protection, tougher punishment and that the government step in and push through proposed legislation on consent.

Bearing placards with messages such as 'no rapists on our streets' and 'Stefan Lofven, take your responsibility', directed at the country's Prime Minister, hundreds of protesters gathered in Malmo on Tuesday evening.

'I never thought I would be scared to walk around in my hometown,' one of the speakers Sara Wettergren said according to Kvallsposten.

Upset: A local newspaper reports that the victims in all three cases were teenagers

Referring to the famous gang rape of a young student in Delhi in 2012, she added; 'In India the perpetrators were convicted. In Sweden they walk free.'

In the wake of the #MeToo debate and the recent gang rapes, the issue of sexual violence against women is going to be a key issue ahead of next year's general election in Sweden.

The protesters in Malmo outlined a series of demands on the Swedish government: tougher punishment for rapes, a Minster of Justice with competence in sexual violence issues and a National Police Commissioner 'who cares about women'.

The demonstrators were also protesting police advice that women stay indoors, which was issued on Sunday.

'It's about common sense. We are not warning people not to be outside, but to think twice and maybe not walk alone late at night and instead go with others or take a taxi,' said Anders Nilsson of Malmo police who is leading the preliminary investigation.

After a national backlash, Malmo police retracted their statement come Monday, with Mr Nilsson saying he had been 'clumsy' choosing his words. .",JustBadNews,0

Slate: Flaws In Clinical Trials for Gardasil Made It Harder To Properly Assess Safety,https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/12/flaws-in-the-clinical-trials-for-gardasil-made-it-harder-to-properly-assess-safety.html,"Read a companion piece from Slate’s science editor on this investigation.

On a sunny autumn day three years ago, when Kesia Lyng was 30, she had a visit from her youngest sister, Eva. The two were close, and as they sat at the kitchen table in Lyng’s apartment, Eva confronted her chronically ill sibling with a painful fact: “You almost can’t take care of your own kids,” she told her. “You can’t keep pushing yourself so hard.”

Lyng, who was living with her husband and their two children in a lusterless part of Copenhagen, Denmark, had been struggling for years with inexplicable health problems: joint and muscle pains that came and left, powerful headaches, and a crushing exhaustion that even copious amounts of sleep could not cure. She was working part-time in the kitchen of her daughter’s kindergarten, the latest in a string of odd jobs. But her sick days had begun to multiply again. Often she would call her husband at work, sobbing from weariness, and ask to be picked up. At home, she was drained, with no energy to clean or cook or tuck the kids in bed. In her medical records, which she shared with me, her doctor noted that she was “having a very difficult time” and that she worried about losing her job if she asked for a sick leave.

On bad days, Lyng’s symptoms were incapacitating. “Your body is so tired you almost can’t move. Everything hurts. It hurts just to stretch, it hurts to get up. Your feet feel like big blocks. There’s this burning sensation in your body and the feeling that your muscles are about to cramp. Even small things, like having to go and buy milk, can be completely overwhelming,” she told me recently. “I’ve been incredibly frustrated at my body, because it’s so limiting.”

The trouble began in late 2002, just before Lyng turned 19. At first it felt like the flu, but there was no improvement. In the mornings, her body was stiff and achy and she found it increasingly hard to rise. When she was able to get up and go to school, she often fell asleep during class. If she ventured more than a few minutes away from home, she would nap on park benches or in cafes to summon the energy to get back. Eventually, she dropped out of school.

The abrupt transformation baffled people around the teenager. They saw a gregarious tomboy turn into someone who kept breaking dates, spent much of her time in bed, and used painkillers nonstop. “We thought it was a depression,” her friend Nanna Voltolina recalled. “She couldn’t do the same things as the rest of us. It was difficult for me to understand.”

Just before Lyng got sick, she had signed up to participate in a clinical trial of a then-experimental vaccine: Merck’s Gardasil was supposed to prevent infection from human papillomavirus, or HPV, a sexually transmitted disease. The virus causes no harm in the vast majority of people. But some HPV types can lead to genital warts, and others have been found to play a role in nearly all cases of cervical cancer, a malignancy that will affect 6 in 1,000 U.S. women at some point during their life. Lyng’s grandmother had died of cervical cancer the year before, so when a letter arrived offering her $500 to take part in a crucial international test of Gardasil, the decision was easy. She got her first shot of the vaccine at Hvidovre Hospital in Copenhagen on Sept. 19, 2002.

The symptoms snuck up on her shortly after her second shot on Nov. 14. They never abated. It wasn’t until 2016 that she received her diagnosis—chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The little-understood condition was once dismissed by many as a psychological problem, but is now recognized as a serious long-term illness that may have its roots in abnormal immune responses. There is no established treatment.

In recent years, Lyng has become suspicious that there is a connection between her disease and her Gardasil immunization. Her ailments evoke descriptions found in hundreds of news stories from women who also received the vaccine, as well as several medical case reports from around the world. As these stories began to make headlines, HPV-vaccination rates in Denmark and elsewhere have tumbled and controversy has erupted. Many pointed out, rightly, that the accounts amounted to no more than anecdotal evidence, and that none of them cited data proving that the vaccine had actually caused any harm. The women might have gotten sick anyway, as Lyng might have; indeed, one recent epidemiological study found no increased risk of CFS in Norwegian girls following Gardasil vaccination.

As these stories began to make headlines, HPV -vaccination rates in Denmark and elsewhere have tumbled and controversy has erupted.

It’s also true that more than 80 million girls and women have been vaccinated against HPV, and the vast majority have suffered no more than temporary discomfort at the injection site. In an emailed statement, Merck said it was “confident” in Gardasil’s safety profile, which “was established in clinical trials involving more than 25,000 females and males” and examined further in several surveillance studies. It also pointed out that regulators had found no scientific support for some of the most heavily publicized concerns, which focused on a couple of serious neurological disorders seen in vaccinated girls. Twice, the firm emphasized to me that according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the benefits of HPV vaccines “continue to outweigh their risks.” Health authorities across the globe share this view. Repeatedly, they have issued reassurances about the thorough randomized trials the vaccines were subjected to before approval. Such studies have long been researchers’ best yardstick to judge if something is a real risk or just a fluke. As the NIH’s National Cancer Institute notes on its website, all three HPV vaccines on the market today “have been tested in tens of thousands of people in the United States and many other countries. Thus far, no serious side effects have been shown to be caused by the vaccines.”

An eight-month investigation by Slate found the major Gardasil trials were flawed from the outset, however, and that regulators allowed unreliable methods to be used to test the vaccine’s safety. While these flaws do not mean Gardasil caused the rare crippling illnesses reported by the media, they are troubling. Public health officials use trials like these both to determine safety and, as evidenced by Merck’s statement above, to reassure the public when concerns like the ones about Gardasil arise. A flawed study design can complicate both tasks.

What is special about Lyng’s case is that she got sick during a clinical test—indeed, the largest-ever randomized placebo-controlled trial of Gardasil—years before the vaccine was approved (which it was, in 2006, in both Europe and the U.S.). Drug regulators tend to look much more seriously at potential side effects that surface during a pre-licensure study, which is what Lyng participated in, rather than after a product has already been found to be safe and been put on the market. But regulators never learned of Lyng’s plight. In fact, her repeated complaints of debilitating symptoms were not even registered in the study as potential side effects (“adverse events,” in medical parlance).

This study design put the cart before the horse, asking investigators to decide which symptoms might be side effects, rather than tracking everything in the same way.

Lyng’s experience was not unique. Interviews with five study participants and more than 2,300 pages of documents obtained through freedom-of-information requests from hospitals and health authorities suggest inadequacies built into Merck’s major clinical tests of Gardasil. To track the safety of its product, the drugmaker used a convoluted method that made objective evaluation and reporting of potential side effects impossible during all but a few weeks of its yearslong trials. At all other times, individual trial investigators used their personal judgment to decide whether or not to report any medical problem as an adverse event—essentially, as a potential side effect worth evaluating further. Other health issues went on a worksheet for “new medical history,” reserved for conditions that bore no relation to the vaccine. This study design put the cart before the horse, asking investigators to decide which symptoms might be side effects, rather than tracking everything in the same way. While the company now says otherwise, there is no indication in the confidential study protocol that it submitted to regulators for approval that it would use new medical history as a safety metric. And it hardly would have qualified as such: The worksheet allotted just one line per entry, with no measurement of symptom severity, duration, outcome, or overall seriousness. Even if the company then used the data in subsequent safety assessments, the lack of detail would have hampered meaningful analysis.

European health regulators worried about Merck’s methods during a review of the company’s marketing application for Gardasil 9, the latest version of the vaccine, but have not made their concerns public. In an internal 2014 EMA report about Gardasil 9 obtained through a freedom-of-information request, senior experts called the company’s approach “unconventional and suboptimal” and said it left some “uncertainty” about the safety results. EMA trial inspectors made similar observations in another report, noting that Merck’s procedure was “not an optimal method of collecting safety data, especially not systemic side effects that could appear long after the vaccinations were given.”

“If I were a research subject, I would feel betrayed,” Trudo Lemmens, a bioethicist and professor of health law and policy at the University of Toronto, told me. “If the purpose of a clinical trial is to establish the safety and efficacy of a new product, whether it’s a vaccine or something else, I would expect that they gathered all relevant data, including whether it had side effects or not.”

Merck, which is known as Merck Sharp & Dohme outside the U.S. and Canada, did not address the EMA’s safety concerns. But it said its clinical trials follow “laws, regulations and guidelines” wherever they take place, and proceed only after approval by regulators and ethics committees. The company also stressed that “collection of New Medical History occurred at each study visit and was mandatory for all study subjects. New Medical History includes the collection of non-serious adverse events.”

When I asked the EMA to expand on its confidential observations, I was told by email that the concerned inspectors had, after all, considered the trial data to be usable. The company had successfully mollified the agency during preapproval discussions. “The clarification from the applicant that collection of new medical history data was mandatory for all subjects, and did not appear to be passively collected, but for at each study visit [sic], was found to be reassuring,” the EMA informed me. “Therefore, it appeared that the safety surveillance in the studies captured all medically relevant events.” The agency did not comment on the limitations of relying on “new medical history” instead of straightforward reporting of adverse events.

Underreporting of adverse events, to the extent that it occurred here, is nothing new to medicine. Trial investigators often miss participants’ symptoms, researchers say, and the data they do collect may not always see the light of day. A review out in 2016 found “strong evidence that much of the information on adverse events remains unpublished and that the number and range of adverse events is higher in unpublished than in published versions of the same study.” In 2009, Dr. John Ioannidis of Stanford University put the problem succinctly in an Archives of Internal Medicine editorial titled “Adverse Events in Randomized Trials: Neglected, Restricted, Distorted, and Silenced.”

Much less clear is how adverse events are handled during the actual conduct of clinical trials, and what the impact is. Are symptoms recorded as separate entities when they are really part of a larger constellation of health problems? Do they appear as innocuous one-time occurrences when in fact they are, or may become, chronic? And how many safety problems are simply missed because of short follow-up?

Lyng’s was no isolated case: At least five other Danish women say they developed chronic health problems during the trial. Future 2, as it is known, enrolled more than 12,000 young women from 13 countries, including the U.S. It was the larger of the two major randomized, placebo-controlled Gardasil trials—technically known as pivotal trials—that Merck conducted to support its marketing application for the vaccine. (The other study, less than half the size, was called Future 1.) Together, the two trials account for a large portion of the data that drug regulators in both the U.S. and Europe used to judge Gardasil’s safety before it was approved.

At Aalborg University Hospital, one of the Future 2 trial sites in Denmark, Miam Donslund began to experience persistent flu-like symptoms as well as two infections, one of which required hospitalization, shortly after immunization. These incidents were recorded, but again only as new medical history, meaning they were not processed as adverse events.

Donslund, now 38, told me she became so tired during the trial that at one point she was accused of being a drug addict. The year after she was vaccinated, she developed severe pains that forced her to use a wheelchair for a while; today she regularly uses crutches. Doctors have told her she might have psoriatic arthritis, but she never received a definite diagnosis. More than a dozen years later, “I work two days a week and the rest of the time I’m at home in bed and I can’t do the most basic things,” she said.

Stine Sørensen, 34, got her first shot of Gardasil a few months after Lyng, also at Hvidovre Hospital. Around this time, she began to experience general discomfort, headaches, and a profound fatigue that often made her miss school. “My mom and dad asked me, ‘Stine, are you on drugs?’ And I clearly remember that I got so angry,” she told me. Sørensen, who is currently employed under a special agreement for people with chronic illness, says she told study personnel about her problems during the trial; her records mention none of them. (All three women received the vaccine in the trial.)

The trial investigator who dealt with both Lyng and Sørensen, Dr. Anette Kjærbye-Thygesen, an OB-GYN at Hvidovre, declined to be interviewed for this story. In an email, a hospital press officer told me, “Regarding registration of various symptoms and health data, the doctor states that she has followed the trial protocol.” The hospital also declined to address my questions.

But this is a false dichotomy that belies the complexity of medicine. Safety is not an absolute.

Imagining a link between HPV vaccination and CFS is not all that far-fetched, according to Dr. Jose Montoya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a CFS expert. The condition usually starts with an insult to the immune system—a severe infection, a car crash, a pregnancy. The first symptoms are flu-like, but months go by and the patient realizes she isn’t getting better. In a few genetically predisposed individuals, Montoya told me, it is “biologically plausible” that the vaccine, which mimics a natural infection, could also trigger an immune response powerful enough to lead to CFS. To find out if that is the case, trial investigators would need to carefully track participants’ symptoms “for at least one year,” he said.

Montoya was also quick to tell me that he is “pro-vaccine,” and he doesn’t think people should stop getting them. His eagerness to make that point underscores a larger issue with unpacking the shortcomings of Merck’s research: Acknowledging any uncertainty around the safety of vaccination can be a difficult exercise for health authorities, not least because of the debunked autism scare that continues to stoke anti-vax sentiments among parents. In today’s polarized conversation, either you believe vaccines are categorically safe, or you think they are so dangerous that you avoid them at significant personal risk.

But this is a false dichotomy that belies the complexity of medicine. Safety is not an absolute. Like drugs, vaccines are a varied lot, each with its own set of risks and benefits that relate to its particular use in particular individuals. And unfortunately, our knowledge about side effects is often woefully incomplete. To Lemmens, the University of Toronto bioethicist, the reluctance to have a frank discussion about the safety of Gardasil is counterproductive. “We do a disservice to science, and we play into the hand of the anti-vaxxers, if we’re not publicly discussing potential problems,” he told me.

Before I sent them to her, Lyng had never seen her trial records, which are owned by Merck. As we looked through them together, on a balmy day in August, she grew visibly upset. “What’s the use of testing a vaccine if you don’t register everything properly?” said Lyng, a pale and reedy woman with light-blue eyes. “It had enormous consequences for my life.”

We were sitting outside the house that she and her husband had recently bought on the outskirts of a small town near Copenhagen. There are fields at the end of their street, and a school just opposite their house that the children now attend. Lyng had been fired from her job as a kitchen helper in late 2014, but her sickness benefits and her husband’s salary kept the family afloat. The extra time to herself and her CFS diagnosis also gave her some peace of mind. Over the years, she had been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder, depression, even “soft” bipolar.

None of these diagnoses fully explained her problems, she felt. Why would she get sudden fevers and rashes that would disappear again just as suddenly? Why would her body hurt on some days and not others? Why would she need to rest for two weeks if she had volunteered to plan the menu for her church’s New Year’s Eve party? The diagnosis gave her at least one answer.

In Lyng’s records from Future 2, we discovered, there was no mention of fatigue, one of her most debilitating symptoms. Meanwhile, her family doctor began documenting the problem on March 20, 2003, nine days after she got her third and final shot of Gardasil. In 2004, after several lab tests and specialist consultations had come up empty, he noted that Lyng continued to have “periods of headache, fatigue, pain in large and small joints, poor concentration and sleep problems. Her mood is fluctuating. There has been no suspicion of depression.”

Lyng told me she brought up her symptoms with study personnel at every visit during the four-year trial. (Trial subjects met with investigators regularly over four years, but the later visits were meant to monitor the vaccine’s efficacy—in this case, whether it prevented HPV-linked cell changes.) She even told them her illness had forced her to quit school. But no one seemed to take her seriously: “They keep saying, ‘This is not the kind of side effects we see with this vaccine.’ ”

Kjærbye-Thygesen, the trial investigator who saw Lyng, and a staffer with the initials “BW,” presumably a nurse, did report the headache and the joint pain, and also gastroenteritis and influenza, but not as adverse events. Instead, they used the worksheet for medical history, which directed investigators to list “Any new background or concomitant conditions, drug allergies and surgeries/procedures.” A note in the records, initialed by Kjærbye-Thygesen, said the vaccine was “hardly” to blame for Lyng’s joint pains, offering no further explanation.

Despite the oxymoronic instruction to list new conditions as history, this was no mistake. Merck’s study protocol shows that for participants outside the U.S. and the U.K., who made up the majority of the trial, only adverse events that investigators considered serious were to be reported. Other health complaints would be registered in much less detail as new medical history. (In the U.S. and the U.K., both serious and nonserious events were reportable.)

In all the trial locations, Merck also chose to restrict the reporting of adverse events—what the study protocol calls the “clinical follow-up for safety”—to just 14 days following each of the three Gardasil injections in the trial. Illness occurring outside these narrow time slots again was relegated to a single line on the medical-history worksheet, whereas for each adverse event, several assessments would need to be carried out and reported. There was an exception: Deaths or serious adverse events brought to the investigator’s attention and felt to be related to the vaccine or a study procedure were to be reported at any time. This design put individual investigators in charge of deciding, for most of the trial’s duration, what would be assessed and reported as a potential side effect.

(Future 1 did report nonserious adverse events for all, but it relied on the same short follow-up as Future 2 and also labeled many adverse events as new medical history.)

This design put individual investigators in charge of deciding, for most of the trial’s duration, what would be assessed and reported as a potential side effect.

Experts I talked to were baffled by the way Merck handled safety data in its trials. According to Dr. Yoon Loke, a professor at the University of East Anglia who studies side effects, letting investigators judge whether adverse events should be reported is “not a very safe method of doing things, because it allows bias to creep in.” In essence, this feature meant that if you started out thinking the vaccine was safe, you would be less likely to find potential side effects. Of the short follow-up, Loke told me, “It’s not going to pick up serious long-term issues, which is a pity. Presumably, the regulators believe that the vaccine is so safe that they don’t need to worry beyond 14 days.”

A drug-safety adviser at a multinational pharmaceutical company told me, “Everything from the first injection to the last plus a follow-up period is what we call treatment-emergent adverse events.” She puzzled over the brief, interrupted follow-up periods in the Gardasil trials, as well as Merck’s choice not to report nonserious adverse events for all participants and its dismissal of many events as medical history. “This is completely bonkers,” she said, requesting not to be named for fear of compromising her position in the industry. “They’ve set up a protocol that seems very poorly thought through from a medical and safety perspective.”

According to the EMA’s emailed statement, “The scope of adverse experience collection in the clinical program for Gardasil reflected the standard across vaccine programs of this company.” It added, “The standard follow-up for a non-replicating vaccine [such as Gardasil] has been 14 days (Days 1 to 15) following each vaccination.”

There are no rules dictating the exact duration of adverse-event reporting in vaccine trials. For some studies, it can be measured in days; for others, it runs from start to finish, with all events recorded the same way regardless of their possible link to the vaccine. Indeed, reviews from 2005 and 2013 found striking variation in how vaccine researchers collected, analyzed, and presented safety data. The field has since seen efforts toward standardization, and health authorities are increasingly recognizing that some side effects may occur late. In guidelines published this year, the World Health Organization noted that while most vaccine side effects occur within two weeks, there may be “reasons to suspect that illnesses with onset many months after the last dose could be related to prior vaccination.”

Lyng and I also read the definition of “serious adverse experience” on the worksheets that investigators had to fill out at each visit following a vaccination. It included events resulting in “persistent or significant disability/incapacity,” meaning a “substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.” On all the forms, the only checked box was the one that said “None.” Was this an error? Arguably not, because Lyng’s symptoms, as recorded by the study personnel, began three to four weeks after her second shot—outside the protocol’s mandatory follow-up for safety.

A press officer from the Danish Medicines Agency, which approved Future 2 in 2002, pointed out that Merck’s study protocol contained no mention of “new medical history” or “new medical conditions.” In an email, she wrote, “We are also not aware of whether this category has been used in other clinical trials with drugs, as these are not terms that are used according to guidelines.”

She added that there had been no concerns at her agency over the safety testing in Future 2. “The safety measurements complied with applicable guidelines for vaccines,” she told me, adding that the 14-day follow-up “is in accordance with EMA’s scientific guidelines for vaccines.”

It was a description of a 15-year-old Colombian girl with neurological problems that first caught the attention of Dr. Rebecca Chandler, an American expat working at Läkemedelsverket, the Swedish Medical Products Agency.

Sweden is an EMA rapporteur for Gardasil and Gardasil 9, meaning that it was tasked with evaluating the marketing applications for the two vaccines on behalf of the European Union. As a clinical safety assessor at Läkemedelsverket, Chandler had been looking into post-marketing reports from Denmark and Japan about two serious, little-known neurological disorders in girls and young women vaccinated with Gardasil. In both countries, these cases had ignited vitriolic national debates that sent vaccination rates plummeting. When the application for Gardasil 9 arrived, Chandler decided to scrutinize the trial data to see if she found any references to the two conditions, known as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The syndromes overlap to some extent, and also share a number of features with CFS.

At first, she found nothing—no instance of either disease was listed in the company’s application. But the Colombian teenager’s symptoms, as described in the clinical trial data, made her suspect POTS, and she asked the drugmaker to comb through its database for similar cases. Three girls vaccinated with Gardasil 9 had been diagnosed with POTS, it turned out, and one with CRPS. There were also several cases of neurological disorders “of interest,” Chandler wrote in her 2014 assessment. But none of them had been reported by the company as adverse events; rather, they were all labeled as new medical history in accordance with Merck’s study protocols.

Chandler, who now works at the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, a leading drug-safety research institution in Sweden, told me she “argued quite much” about her findings at the agency, “because I was very concerned that the study design was not appropriate to pick up these things.” Her regulatory colleagues apparently shared her apprehension, laying out their misgivings in a series of confidential EMA reports leading up to the approval of Gardasil 9. (I obtained these reports from Läkemedelsverket through several freedom-of-information requests.) One confidential EMA report from 2014 called Merck’s approach to safety “an unconventional and suboptimal study procedure”; another observed that the design “brings some degree of uncertainty into the overall safety assessment.”

Chandler found Merck’s data bolstered concerns about an association between the vaccine and POTS, but she was overridden by her agency colleagues. Later, a contested EMA review from 2015 and a U.S. study based on post-marketing data also found no support for a link.

Officials inspecting a Gardasil 9 trial for the EMA also felt compelled to spotlight how Merck dealt with safety, despite considering it “a systemic issue related to study design and as such not an inspection finding.” The unorthodox design “complicated” the reporting of adverse events, the inspectors wrote, in part because the information on “new medical events” was “limited, as only symptoms were collected and no further medical assessments were made and no outcome was recorded.”

In their final report recommending conditional approval of Gardasil 9, the EMA rapporteurs asked the drugmaker to “discuss the impact of [its] unconventional and potentially suboptimal method of reporting adverse events and provide reassurance on the overall completeness and accuracy of safety data provided in the application.” Läkemedelsverket refused to share the company’s response. In the EMA’s public assessment of Gardasil 9, all mention of the safety concerns has been scrubbed.

In response to my questions, the EMA pointed out that its experts, in a public assessment of the original Gardasil vaccine from 2006, found Merck’s way of evaluating safety “established and appropriate.” But the agency failed to explain how that opinion squares with its unpublicized reservations about the Gardasil 9 research, which handled safety essentially the same way.

Dr. Susanne Krüger Kjær, a professor of gynecological cancer epidemiology at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the Danish part of Future 2, declined to address the safety concerns. “I can’t answer any of those questions because I didn’t design the trial,” she told me. She is one of the authors on the main scientific publication from the trial, which appeared in 2007 in the New England Journal of Medicine and contains no mention of new medical history.

In its statement, Merck said that using the “new medical history” category “allowed broad collection of potential safety events including new conditions, symptoms, and laboratory or imaging tests thereby allowing comprehensive safety assessment.” It cited a study from 2010 that analyzed new medical history and found “comparable” rates in trial participants given vaccine and placebo, respectively.

On a rainy day in September, I flew with Lyng to Berlin to visit Gerd Wallukat, a scientist at the biotech startup Berlin Cures. Wallukat, a heavyset man in his mid-70s, has pioneered research into a special class of autoantibodies—proteins made by the immune system that attack the body’s own cells instead of foreign invaders like viruses or bacteria. Researchers have been finding these “agonistic autoantibodies” in people with different diseases, including CFS, POTS, and CRPS, but their role is not fully understood. Berlin Cures is in the middle of early-stage trials to see if neutralizing them could have a therapeutic effect.

One of Lyng’s doctors in Denmark had been working with Wallukat to look for autoantibodies in girls and women who fell ill following Gardasil vaccination. Their preliminary, unpublished findings suggested that nearly all of these women harbor one or more agonistic autoantibodies, and Wallukat had offered to test Lyng, too. On the plane, she was nervous and chatty. She didn’t want to be sick, she explained, but it was taxing having to convince people around her—her caseworker, her family, even her husband—that she was physically sick while one test after another came up empty. She dreaded the thought of receiving yet another negative result.

She didn’t. “You have beta-2, nociceptin, muscarinic,” Wallukat told her, referring to three types of autoantibodies, “the classical pattern I’ve seen in patients after vaccination.” From a coffee shop, Lyng called her husband. “I’m completely overwhelmed. It’s the first time I’ve had a positive result,” she told him. “This means it’s not just in my head—all those doctors who’ve asked if it could be psychological.”

But Lyng’s positive test triggers more questions than it answers: What induced those autoantibodies, and how? Did they cause her symptoms, as her doctor speculated? And would neutralizing them bring about improvement, as Berlin Cures wagered? The test brought another piece to the puzzle that is Lyng’s case; but as so often happens in science, it did not bring certainty, and it proved nothing in the way of causality. Should it turn out that Gardasil does have serious side effects, it’s apparent that they must be rare. What’s more, the vaccine might still be worth that hypothetical risk—cervical cancer, though uncommon, is a terrible disease.

The test brought another piece to the puzzle that is Lyng’s case; but as so often happens in science, it did not bring certainty.

If there’s one clear lesson from Lyng’s experience, it’s that science is a work in progress. To borrow the words of the American psychologist Brian Nosek, “Science isn’t about truth and falsity, it’s about reducing uncertainty.” Not owning up to that uncertainty, when it is legitimate, likely will only slow scientific progress. In the controversial realm of vaccines, it will also create fodder for conspiracy theorists spreading overblown or unfounded fears among an already distrustful public.

One way to respond to public concerns is to acknowledge the limits of our current body of research and to welcome discussion about what we know and don’t know, according to Lemmens, the bioethicist.

“Transparency and open debate around side effects are essential to safeguard trust in the provision of medication and public-health planning,” he told me. Instead, as confidence in Gardasil nosedived in Denmark, regulators doubled down on the simplistic message that the vaccine has been thoroughly tested and is unquestionably safe.

At a press conference in May, Dr. Søren Brostrøm, the director general of the Danish Health Authority and an OB-GYN, told journalists that “for us, as authorities, there is no doubt about this vaccine’s efficacy and safety.” This seems to contradict the EMA’s own deliberations about the way Merck reported safety data in its trials. As Dr. Christian Gluud, who heads the Copenhagen Trial Unit, a research center at Copenhagen University Hospital, told me recently, “If we had tested our vaccines properly, we wouldn’t be having the discussion we’re having now.”

"Comcast, Cox, Frontier All Raising Internet Access Rates for 2018",https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/12/19/comcast-cox-frontier-net-neutrality/,"Comcast, Cox, Frontier All Raising Internet Access Rates for 2018

At least three major ISPs have already announced significant price hikes for 2018. News of the increases come just days after the FCC voted to roll back net neutrality protections.

The timing of this couldn’t be worse. But maybe that’s not a concern for major ISPs. Accordingly, at least three major ISPs have now announced rate hikes for 2018.

That is, January, 2018. So customers have very little time to react, modify their plans, or even cancel their accounts.

Just this morning, Karl Bode of DSLReports caught wind of numerous increases at mega-ISP Comcast. But that is simply the latest in a string of planned increases by the likes of Cox, Frontier, and even DirecTV and Dish Network.

In all cases, these are increases for essentially the same services, with Bode noting that American will be stuck paying ‘significantly more money for the same service in the new year’. In many cases, the changes are padded into existing bills, with most consumers failing to see the changes.

In the case of Comcast, increases are happening across the board.

That includes rates for conventional cable TV, but also a range of internet and internet-based services. “Even Comcast’s streaming TV service Instant TV, barely a year old, is seeing price hikes,” Bode noted.

“Users that subscribe to this service can expect to pay $3 to $3.50 more per month in the new year.”

Additionally, Comcast is jacking up its modem rental fees by 10%. “Modem rental fees will be bumped $1 to $11 per month, while missed payment fees are also being increased fifty cents to $10,” the report continues.

That’s likely the beginning of far broader increases.

Another major ISP, Cox, is increasing the rates for all of its internet service packages.

Here’s a quick rundown of those increases, based on a notice sent to Cox subscribers.

Starter will change from $34.99 to $36.99.

Essential will change from $52.99 to $55.99.

Preferred will change from $67.99 to $71.99.

Preferred 100 will change from $72.99 to $76.99.

Premier will change from $79.99 to $82.99.

That’s on top of a range of other increases affecting Cox’s cable TV packages, and are effective as of January, 2018. The rates were officially announced on December 9th, just days before net neutrality provisions were officially scrapped.

Similarly, Frontier Communications is tacking on a sneaky surcharge for internet customers.

Specifically, Frontier is wedging a $2 ‘Internet Infrastructure Surcharge’ onto most accounts. That includes promotional deals, which are advertised as being cheaper, but leave out a lot of hidden fees. “Beginning with this bill, customers not on an Internet Service term agreement, price protection plan or subject to other exclusions will be assessed a $1.99 per month Internet Infrastructure surcharge,” a Frontier notice states.

Other shoes dropping soon.

Both DirecTV and Dish are enacting heavy increases for most packages in 2018. At this stage, we’re not sure if packaged internet deals are getting affected (at least for 2018). Eventually, we’re betting they will.

We haven’t seen any (recent) changes from Charter, Verizon, and AT&T’s U-verse. But maybe they’re waiting until after Christmas.

US government recovered materials from unidentified flying object it 'does not recognise',http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pentagon-ufo-alloys-program-recover-material-unidentified-flying-objects-not-recognise-us-government-a8117801.html?amp,"The Independent employs over 100 journalists around the world to bring you news you can trust.

The Pentagon has reportedly recovered metal alloys from unidentified flying objects that scientists ""do not recognise”.

Materials, which are alleged to have “amazing properties”, are being stored in modified buildings in Las Vegas, the New York Times reports.

The US Department of Defence (DoD) has admitted to a secret $22m (£15m) programme, which ran between 2007 and 2012, that was tasked with investigating reports of UFOs.

“They have some material from these objects that is being studied, so that scientists can try to figure out what accounts for their amazing properties,” Ralf Blumenthal, one of the authors of the New York Times report, told MSNBC.

Mr Blumenthal said the DoD “do not know” what the materials are made of.

“It’s some sort of compound they do not recognise,” he added.

The Pentagon refused to comment when contacted by The Independent.

Researchers also studied people who claimed they had experienced physical effects from encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena, according to the New York Times.

A previously classified video released by the DoD shows Navy pilots reacting with astonishment after being sent to investigate a mysterious flying object as it hovered off the coast of San Diego.

The recently released footage shows a 2004 encounter between an apparent object, roughly the size of a commercial plane, and two Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets, from the aircraft carrier Nimitz.

Commander David Fravor and Lieutenant Commander Jim Slaight were on a routine training mission 100 miles out into the Pacific when they were asked to investigate the object.

Commander Fravor told The New York Times the object was about 40ft long, had no plumes, wings or rotors, and outpaced their F-18s. It was big enough to churn the sea 50ft below it, he said.

“No one knows what they are to this day, Mr Blumenthal told MSNBC.

“Research went into trying to identify their strange means of propulsion, their phenomenal aerodynamics which represent nothing on the face of this earth by any country.""

Experts warn there is usually a worldly explanation for apparent UFO sightings and caution that an absence of an explanation is not proof of extraterrestrial life.

An Islamic preacher in Turkey has drawn a backlash after suggesting that clean-shaven men sometimes ""cannot be distinguished from women"" and can cause ""indecent thoughts.""

Speaking on the private religious station Fatih Medreseleri (Madrasahs) TV on Dec. 16, preacher Murat Bayaral blasted beardless men and said there is no need to receive permission from wives for a man to shave his beards.

“Men should grow beards. One of the two body parts that separate men from women is the beard,"" Bayaral said.

""For example, if you see a man with long hair from afar you may think he is a woman if he does not have a beard. Because nowadays women and men dress similarly. God forbid! You could be possessed by indecent thoughts,” he added.",JustBadNews,0
BLM investigator alleges misconduct by feds in Bundy ranch standoff,http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2017/12/blm_investigator_alleges_misco.html,"A scathing memo from the lead investigator who assessed how federal officers handled the 2014 armed standoff with Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy accuses agents of far-reaching misconduct, recklessness and unrestrained antipathy toward the family.

The 18-page document, obtained Thursday by The Oregonian/OregonLive, is dated Nov. 27.

Prosecutors shared it last week with defense lawyers for Bundy, his two sons and co-defendant Ryan Payne as they were in the midst of their conspiracy trial, but it's not part of the public court record.

The memo prompted Cliven Bundy's lawyer to file a motion early Monday to dismiss the case, already in disarray over concerns raised previously about the government's failure to promptly share evidence with the defense.

The judge sent the jury home for more than a week as she tries to sort out the claims and prosecutors scramble to save their case.

The memo comes from Larry Wooten, who had been the lead case agent and investigator for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management after the tense confrontation outside the patriarch's ranch near Bunkerville. Wooten also testified before a federal grand jury that returned indictments against the Bundys. He said he was removed from the investigation last February after he complained to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Nevada.

Then last month he sent a whistleblower email to the U.S. Department of Justice, alleging a ""widespread pattern of bad judgment, lack of discipline, incredible bias, unprofessionalism and misconduct, as well as likely policy, ethical and legal violations among senior and supervisory staff'' at the Bureau of Land Management's Office of Law Enforcement and Security.

Wooten wrote that supervisory agents with the bureau repeatedly mocked the defendants in an ""amateurish carnival atmosphere'' that resembled something out of middle school, displayed ""clear prejudice'' against the Bundys, their supporters and Mormons, and prominently displayed degrading altered booking photos of Cliven Bundy and other defendants in a federal office and in an office presentation.

The memo described ""heavy handedness'' by government officers as they prepared to impound Cliven Bundy's cattle. He said some officers ""bragged about roughing up Dave Bundy, grinding his face into the ground and Dave Bundy having little bits of gravel stuck in his face.'' Dave Bundy, one of Cliven Bundy's sons, was arrested April 6, 2014, while videotaping men he suspected were federal agents near his father's ranch.

Wooten contends that supervisory agents failed to turn over required discovery evidence to the prosecution team that could help the defense or be used to question the credibility of a witness, as required by law.

The top agents also ""instigated'' the monitoring of jail phone calls between defendants and their wives without consent from the U.S. Attorney's Office or the FBI, Wooten wrote, though the memo noted that Steven Myhre, Nevada's acting U.S. attorney who is leading the prosecution of the Bundys, stopped the practice.

Myhre couldn't be reached for comment late Thursday. On Friday morning, Trisha Young, a spokeswoman for the Nevada U.S. Attorney's Office, said the office declined to comment.

Cliven Bundy, sons Ammon and Ryan Bundy and Payne are accused of conspiring to block federal agents from enforcing court orders to confiscate family cattle on public land after Cliven Bundy failed to pay grazing fees and fines for years.

They're also accused of using or carrying a firearm in a crime of violence, threatening a federal law enforcement officer, obstruction of justice and extortion. Their trial began Nov. 14 in Las Vegas.

Wooten accused Dan Love, the former special agent-in-charge of the cattle roundup for the Bureau of Land Management, of intentionally ignoring direction from the U.S. Attorney's Office and his superiors ""in order to command the most intrusive, oppressive, large scale and militaristic trespass cattle impound possible.'' He described Love as immune from discipline, though Love eventually was fired from the bureau for misconduct in an unrelated case.

Wooten said he learned from other agency supervisors that Love had a ""Kill Book'' as a ""trophy,'' in which he essentially bragged about ""getting three individuals in Utah to commit suicide,'' following a joint FBI-BLM investigation into the alleged trafficking of stolen artifacts.

Wooten said his supervisor took photos in a secure command post at FBI headquarters in Las Vegas of an ""Arrest Tracking Wall,'' where photos of Cliven Bundy and co-defendant Eric Parker were marked with an ""X'' over them, and emailed out the photos, although no photos were allowed to be taken in that area.

Wooten called prosecutors in the Bundy case and told Myhre and Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadia Ahmed, as well as FBI special agent Joel Willis, of his fears that his supervisors weren't sharing key witness statements with them.

On Feb. 16, Wooten said he asked Myhre if statements that Love made, such as ""Go out there and kick Cliven Bundy in the mouth (or teeth) and take his cattle'' or ""I need you to get the troops fired up to go get those cows and not take any crap from anyone'' would be considered evidence that must be shared with the defense. He said that Myhre replied, saying something like ""we do now'' or ""it is now.''

Two days later, Wooten said his supervisor took him off the investigation and another Bureau of Land Management agent confiscated files from his office and from a safe in his office.

The material included computer hard drives, collected emails, text messages, case notes and ""lessons learned,'' Wooten wrote.

""These items were taken because they contained significant evidence of misconduct and items that would potentially embarrass BLM Law Enforcement Supervision,'' the memo said. ""I am convinced that I was removed to prevent the ethical and proper further disclosure of the severe misconduct.''

Wooten said his supervisor told him that Myhre ""furiously demanded'' that he be removed and that Myhre had mentioned something about the bureau's failure to turn over all crucial evidence to his office.

Wooten noted that he was ordered not to contact the Nevada U.S. Attorney's Office.

He said he believed Myhre ""adopted an attitude of 'don't ask, don't tell''' or ""preferred ignorance'' when it came to potential information from the federal land management agency that would have been helpful to the Bundy defense.

He also said prosecutors relied on inaccurate talking points, particularly not disclosing at previous trials the fact there were government snipers on surveillance outside the Bundy Ranch before the April 12, 2014, showdown.

""Not only did Mr. Myhre in my opinion not want to know or seek out evidence favorable to the accused, he and my supervisor discouraged the reporting of such issues,'' Wooten wrote.

Wooten said he had held Myhre in the highest regard, but believes his judgment is ""clouded'' by personal bias and a ""desire to win the case at all costs.''

Wooten, now working as a bureau agent in Idaho, sent the memo to an associate deputy U.S. attorney general who serves as the U.S. Department of Justice's national criminal discovery coordinator. He obtained the lawyer's contact information during a training by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise, Idaho.

""I have tried to resolve these issues through my chain of command but I have failed,'' he wrote in the memo.

But he felt it was ""his obligation'' to report his findings, describing his memo as a ""last resort.''

He didn't return phone calls or messages Thursday night.

Cliven Bundy's lawyer Bret O. Whipple declined any comment on the memo, and would only describe the new information received as ""quite a development,'' one he hadn't seen in his 20-plus years of legal work.

""In my mind, I think the case should be dismissed by next Tuesday,'' Whipple said. ""I think I can get my client home for Christmas.''

U.S. District Judge Gloria M. Navarro has dismissed the jury until next Wednesday. She said she has at least seven to eight concerns about evidence or material that the government didn't share with defense lawyers in a timely manner. She indicated she would consider potential remedies if she found violations under the Brady disclosure law, ranging from striking testimony of a witness to delaying the trial or declaring a mistrial.

She gave both sides deadlines to file responses and is expected to reconvene court Wednesday with the lawyers from both sides and defendants at 8 a.m.

Warsaw (AFP)

Poland's media regulator has fined a major news channel over alleged biased coverage of anti-government protests in December 2016, with the broadcaster TVN24 vowing Tuesday to appeal.

Teresa Brykczynska, spokeswoman for the KRRiT regulator, told AFP that US-owned TVN24 was being fined because it ""failed to inform viewers that the December 16-18 protests held outside parliament were unlawful, and for urging viewers to participate in the illegal protests.""

TVN24, one of the EU country's two major news channels, is appealing against the unprecedented fine of nearly 1.5 million zloty (350,000 euros, $414,000), according to a statement posted on its website.

Dozens of liberal opposition lawmakers occupied parliament's main chamber last December in protest over plans by the governing rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS) to ban journalists from parliament, a measure it later dropped.

The PiS government accused the opposition lawmakers of trying to stage a coup d'etat as thousands of demonstrators rallied outside parliament in support of their stance.

Brykczynska said that the media regulator had received ""many complaints"" about TVN24's coverage of the events.

It said the channel had ""created a climate of tension and threat"" and that ""the plurality of information had not been respected"", she added.

TVN24 said ""the accusations made by the KRRiT are based on a report lacking objectivity and rigour"".

The channel says its coverage of the protests was balanced, and claims to have run live broadcasts and rebroadcasts of speeches made by powerful PiS party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

Since taking office in October 2015, the PiS government has been accused by media and rights groups of seeking to limit press freedoms, including by ramping up state control over public broadcasters.

In July, the European Union called for an end to the ""intimidation"" of journalists critical of the PiS government, saying that media freedom should be respected.

The 26-year-old died after falling from a 62-storey building in Changsha, the capital city of China's Hunan province, while performing one of his signature skyscraper performances. He died on 8 November, but it wasn't until a month later that his death was confirmed in a post on Chinese social media by his gilfriend. His death was also caught on camera.

Yongning's posts warn viewers not to imitate his dangerous stunts, and that he had had martial arts training. He had also previously taken part in some TV and film productions - but it was his rooftop performances that drummed up the most attention on social media - and, according to local media, these were the most lucrative, too.

According to the BBC, a family member was quoted as saying he was participating in a 'rooftopping' challenge with 100,000 yuan (£11,300 / $15,100) at stake in prize money. However, the details of the competition, and its sponsor is unclear.

""He planned to propose to his girlfriend (the day after the challenge),"" the South China Morning Post quoted his step-uncle as saying.

""He needed the money for the wedding, and for medical treatment for his ailing mother.""

Friends and fans have taken to Weibo to respond to the news, with fellow rooftopper Charlie_7U posting a photo taken with Yongning and saying: ""He went a bit over the top, always trying things that are beyond his ability.""

""I have even saved him once... we stopped playing together,"" he added.

But not everyone had positive comments to make about Yongning's death. One other user said: ""Why would you seek attention in such a dangerous way, just for your fans?

""I became speechless after I found out from news that you were doing all that to pay for your ill mother's hospital treatment. You are one of those people in this world, you will do anything for your loved ones, absolutely anything.""

Rooftopping involves climbing extremely tall buildings without safety equipment, which has become a popular trend across the globe recently. Many climbers say that the use of safety equipment detracts from the experience of rooftopping.

""The moment you start wearing safety equipment is the moment you've got doubt and when you've got doubt, that's when things can go wrong,"" UK climber James Kington said, speaking to the BBC last year.

Anyone over 21 could grow weed at home under proposed Ohio ballot initiative,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2017/12/11/local-group-denied-medical-marijuana-growers-license-plans-new-recreational-weed-initiative/935606001/,"Anyone over 21 could grow weed at home under proposed Ohio ballot initiative

A group of local investors who failed in their bid to secure a state license to grow medical marijuana on Monday announced plans for a statewide ballot issue that would fully legalize marijuana.

Jimmy Gould, chairman of Cincinnati-based Green Light Acquisitions, has proposed an Ohio constitutional amendment that would allow anyone 21 or older to grow marijuana in their homes for personal use or commercial cultivation.

Gould said the ballot issue would not conflict with Ohio's current medical marijuana law but would expand legalized marijuana use among qualified adults without a physician's recommendation.

Needed: More than 300,000 signatures

Gould said he would need 305,592 signatures to place the issue before Ohio voters next year. His group plans to finalize the language in the proposal and begin circulating it next month. The initial filing deadline for the ballot proposal is July 4, 2018.

"" I guess we’ll find out how much adult citizens want to be able to administer (cannabis) for themselves,'' Gould said. ""I think people want to have more control over their lives.''

Gould is a longtime proponent of decriminalizing marijuana, which he said can be a useful tool for dealing with a variety of chronic conditions, including opioid addiction, which continues to plague Ohio.

He co-founded the group ResponsibleOhio, which was behind Ohio's failed Issue 3 marijuana initiative in 2015 that would have legalized marijuana for both medical and recreational use.

The measure lost in all 88 Ohio counties, with nearly two-thirds of voters statewide voting ""no.''

But the new proposal ""is as different from Issue 3 as night and day,'' Gould said. ""We spent a lot of time and effort to get this right. This is not Issue 3 revisited.''

Dropped: Rules that doomed Issue 3

Gould said the new proposal tosses out many of the contentious items that he blames for Issue 3's ultimate defeat, including designating certain properties as the only places in Ohio where the cannabis plant could be legally grown - a stipulation would have benefitted only a handful of mega-growers.

""The concept of the rich getting richer goes right out the window with this,'' Gould said.

He said the new ballot proposal is a responsible way to fully legalize marijuana use, cultivation, possession, processing and dispensing, and regulate it like alcohol-related businesses in Ohio.

At least one critic charges the ballot proposal is simply an effort to use Ohio's democratic process for personal gain.

""The initiative constitutional amendment proposed today is yet another ill-conceived ballot initiative with dishonest intentions,'' said State Rep. Niraj Antani (R-Miamisburg), who has introduced a joint resolution to change the procedures for initiating statutes and constitutional amendments. ""This is another proposal attempting to use the Ohio Constitution as a means for a special interest to make a profit at the expense of the taxpayers of Ohio.''

Gould counters that his latest proposal would benefit consumers and entrepreneurs alike in a fair and equitable free-market system.

And he's confident now is the right time to introduce a new marijuana initiative, at least in part, because ""a lot of time has gone by'' since Issue 3 was defeated.

Has public opinion shifted enough?

Shifting public opinion shows more Americans are inclined to support legalized marijuana now, a trend underscored by the sheer number of states that have adopted such laws over the past several years, Gould noted.

Since 2015, more than a dozen states, including Ohio, have adopted legalized marijuana laws for either medical or recreational use or both.

Chris Lindsey, an attorney for the national advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project, said voters in Ohio ""just might'' embrace the new ballot proposal, although next year might not be the optimal time to introduce the measure.

""Voters are increasingly supportive around the country, and I'm sure there will be a lot of interest in Ohio,'' Lindsey said. ""Younger voters tend to be very supportive of legalization, and for that reason, some might suggest the presidential election in 2020 as the best time'' to introduce the new ballot proposal.

""But Alaska and Oregon certainly didn't wait,'' he added. ""They won at the polls and now have good programs.''

Both Alaska and Oregon passed legislation allowing adults to possess and grow marijuana in their homes in 2015 - a non-presidential election year.

Gould: I'll spend ""whatever it takes''

Gould and his investors in ResponsibleOhio spent more than $20 million to get Issue 3 on the ballot in Ohio. And Gould said he would spend ""whatever it takes"" through donations, fundraising and direct investment to get his new proposal on the ballot.

Gould said his new ballot initiative would ""run parallel'' to a lawsuit he plans to file against the state after his firm, CannAscend Ohio, and dozens of other applicants were denied ""Level 1"" licenses for large-scale medical marijuana growers.

The Ohio Department of Commerce earlier this month awarded 12 preliminary Level 1 licenses based on what Gould alleges was a deeply flawed selection process.

Hurting the credibility of the process is that fact that at least one of the application graders, Trevor C. Bozeman, was a convicted drug dealer. Bozeman pled guilty in 2005 to possession with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance in Pennsylvania and was sentenced to three years of probation.

""That stuff is just not OK,’’ Gould said. ""Commerce feel asleep at the wheel. They either didn’t know, or they didn’t do background checks'' on the application graders.

""This is incompetence at best, and borders on criminal at the worst,'' he added.

Proposed amendment: The basics:

* The ""Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Amendment'' would provide for the legal cultivation, possession, processing, dispensing, use and consumption of marijuana by anyone persons 21 years of age or older.

* The amendment would control the commercial production and distribution of marijuana under a system that licenses, and regulates the businesses involved; while also providing the lawful cultivation, sale, and processing of industrial hemp.

* The amendment would provide for the commercial cultivation, processing, and dispensing of marijuana by persons 21 or older: ""If you can own a bar, or make beer, wine or spirits, you will be able to own a marijuana dispensary, processor or cultivation.""

* The amendment would control the commercial production and distribution of marijuana under a system that licenses, and regulates businesses involved.

* Cities, villages and townships could approve the number of commercial marijuana businesses that may be permitted to operate in their community, and local voters would be allowed to decide if dispensaries can open in their precinct.

* No public consumption would be allowed. Smoking marijuana or marijuana products would be prohibited in any public place, in any place where smoking is prohibited, or on (or in) any form of public transportation.

* Commercial marijuana facilities could be no closer than 500 feet from a school, church day-care center or playground.

* Ohio farmers would be permitted to cultivate hemp and compete with farmers in neighboring states.

* People 21 and older would be allowed to grow marijuana in secure, private locations inaccessible by anyone under 21.",JustBadNews,0
Racial dispute at beloved bakery roils liberal college town.,https://apnews.com/b5d75cf4772d4912b8c9ca56762aa343,"OBERLIN, Ohio (AP) — Students at Oberlin College have long enjoyed pastries, bagels and chocolates from Gibson’s Bakery, a century-old, family-owned business near campus. That sweet relationship has turned bitter amid hotly disputed accusations of racism, roiling a school and town long known for their liberal politics.

The dispute, which began in November 2016 with the arrest of three black Oberlin students who tried stealing wine from Gibson’s, is now a lawsuit in which the exasperated bakery owners accuse the college and a top dean of slandering Gibson’s as a “racist establishment” and taking steps to destroy the family’s livelihood.

Caught in the middle are longtime residents of this town of 8,300 people, many of whom identify themselves as liberals but who have patronized Gibson’s for decades. Many believe the timing was right for the conflict to boil over; the arrests came the day after Donald Trump won the presidential election, electrifying students who had long heard suspicions of racial profiling at Gibson’s.

“I can understand why people were looking for some outlet for their frustration, but it’s just counterproductive to bend that anger towards a small family business that to my knowledge is not guilty of the sort of racial profiling that people accuse it of,” said retired Oberlin professor Roger Copeland.

The three students were arrested after punching and kicking the white shopkeeper. The 18- and 19-year-old students said that they were racially profiled and that their only crime was trying to buy alcohol with fake identification; the shopkeeper, Allyn Gibson, said the students attacked him after he caught them trying to steal bottles of wine.

The day after the arrests, hundreds of students protested outside the bakery. Members of Oberlin’s student senate published a resolution saying Gibson’s had “a history of racial profiling and discriminatory treatment.”

Few colleges put the “liberal” into “liberal arts” more than Oberlin, which in the early 1800s became the first in the country to regularly admit women and minorities. But it also more recently has become, for conservatives, a symbol of political correctness gone awry and entitled youth.

News articles in 2015 quoted students decrying the school dining hall’s sushi and Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches as cultural appropriation. The divisive, voice-of-a-generation actress Lena Dunham, famously a 2008 Oberlin alumna, was quoted in Food & Wine magazine as saying, “The press reported it as, ‘How crazy are Oberlin kids?’ But to me, it was actually, ‘Right on.’”

With Oberlin’s reputation preceding it and news of the Gibson’s protests spreading online, bikers and out-of-town counter-protesters soon converged on the town to jeer students and buy doughnuts from Gibson’s. Conservatives derided the students on social media as coddled “snowflakes” with a mob mentality, while students attacked the store as a symbol of systemic racism.

The three students arrested at Gibson’s pleaded guilty in August to attempted theft and aggravated trespassing and said in statements required by a plea agreement that their actions were wrong and that the store wasn’t racist.

Even so, students continue to boycott Gibson’s over perceived racial profiling, causing business to suffer. Pressed by a reporter to provide evidence or examples of profiling, they said only that when black students enter the store, they feel as though they’re being watched.

“Racism can’t always be proven on an Excel sheet,” said Kameron Dunbar, an Oberlin junior and vice chair of the student senate.

Copeland and other residents say the accusations of racism are unfounded.

“I’ve never seen evidence; it’s always hearsay,” Copeland said. “When your fellow student is shutting down a conversation because he or she is made uncomfortable, it leads to a hive mentality.”

On Nov. 7, the Gibsons sued Oberlin and Meredith Raimondo, vice president and dean of students, for slander, accusing faculty members of encouraging demonstrations against the bakery by suspending classes, distributing flyers, and supplying protesters with free food and drink.

It says Raimondo took part in the demonstration against Gibson’s with a bullhorn and distributed a flyer that said the bakery is a “RACIST establishment with a LONG ACCOUNT of RACIAL PROFILING and DISCRIMINATION.”

Today, the lawsuit says, college tour guides continue to inform prospective students that Gibson’s is racist.

Dave Gibson, the bakery’s owner, says the lawsuit is about standing up for his right to crack down on shoplifting without being branded as a racist. The suit says Oberlin demanded that he stop pushing criminal charges on first-time shoplifters and call school deans instead.

“I have not taken a paycheck since this happened more than a year ago,” Gibson said in an email. “Sometimes you have to stand up to a large institution. Powerful institutions — including Oberlin College — and their members must follow the same laws as the rest of us.”

Gibson’s loses thousands of dollars to theft, the lawsuit said. It rejects any accusations of racial bias, pointing to police figures in the past five years that show only six out of 40 adults arrested for shoplifting at the bakery were black.

The school said in a statement after the lawsuit was filed that it and Raimondo deny Gibson’s claims and that the college has stopped buying the bakery’s goods, ending what had been a decades-long relationship. Raimondo did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Attempts by the Oberlin Business Partnership to mediate between the school and bakery ended in failure, said partnership Director Janet Haar, with neither side appearing to be interested.

The clash has inspired Oberlin senior Jake Berstein, who said he witnessed the initial altercation, to produce a podcast trying to create a conversation that “isn’t being had” between the two sides.

“Gibson’s has become all that is wrong with America,” Berstein said. “It’s a classic case of those political bubbles that don’t communicate with each other, and don’t want to.”

Western Australian GM crop framers may be held liable if they contaminate other properties,http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2017-12-09/gm-crop-growers-may-face-contamination-crackdown/9241874,"Western Australian growers of genetically modified crops may be held liable if they contaminate non-GM properties and produce in future.

An upper house standing committee parliamentary inquiry is examining compensation mechanisms for farmers who lose money because of contamination from genetically modified material.

Earlier this year, Greens MLC Diane Evers tabled a petition calling for farmer protection legislation to compensate any non-GM farmer who suffers a loss from GM contamination.

The petition was sparked by the Marsh versus Baxter case, where an organic farmer unsuccessfully sued his neighbour for GM canola contamination.

Ms Evers said she hoped the inquiry would protect the premium that farmers received for non-GM produce.

""It is apparent from the case of Kojonup farmer Steve Marsh that the rights of non-GM farmers in WA, who outnumber farmers growing GM, are not sufficiently protected by law,"" she said.

""WA farmers should not lose their right to sell non-GM crops at a higher price, due to the actions of another grower.""

Sharing the risk

Minister of Agriculture Alannah MacTiernan has supported the inquiry and said one of the issues considered would be if strict liability needed to be imposed.

""It just seems to be common sense that where we want GM and non-GM farming to co-exist there needs to be a device whereby we can share the risk of cross contamination,"" she said.

""I think it is important that we have a look at whether or not the existing common law provisions are adequate or whether or not we need to embrace strict liability on cross contamination as we find in a number of European Union states.""

However Duncan Young, from lobby group WA Farmers, believed the Federal Government's 2005 review into GM gene technology addressed the issue of liability.

""It is already covered under common law so why do we need to change something,"" Mr Young said.

""You have also got to remember that GM canola is a legal and safe crop, so why are we making that an example?

""I am still wondering what the ulterior motives are here,"" Mr Young said.

Farmers may feel threatened

Chair of the Pastoralist and Graziers grains committee Gary McGill said farmers were used to sorting out problems between neighbours informally.

He believed the inquiry was designed to make farmers feel nervous about growing GM canola.

""They are trying to create this circumstance to make farmers hesitant to use it and try and get it to be seriously reduced or eliminated because farmers might feel threatened by something,"" he said.

""Go ahead and make my day is what I say, because we know that we would welcome an opportunity for this to be taken to the courts. We are also going to welcome the opportunity for this review.""

Public submissions to the Environment and Public Affairs Committee will be accepted until February 16 next year.",JustBadNews,0
"Donald Trump, Trump Jr. and others in the Trump Organization got an email in September 2016 offering a decryption key and link for hacked WikiLeaks documents",http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/08/politics/email-effort-give-trump-campaign-wikileaks-documents/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Correction: This story has been corrected to say the date of the email was September 14, 2016, not September 4, 2016. The story also changed the headline and removed a tweet from Donald Trump Jr., who posted a message about WikiLeaks on September 4, 2016.

Candidate Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and others in the Trump Organization received an email in September 2016 offering a decryption key and website address for hacked WikiLeaks documents, according to an email provided to congressional investigators.

The September 14 email was sent during the final stretch of the 2016 presidential race.

CNN originally reported the email was released September 4 -- 10 days earlier -- based on accounts from two sources who had seen the email. The new details appear to show that the sender was relying on publicly available information. The new information indicates that the communication is less significant than CNN initially reported.

After this story was published, The Washington Post obtained a copy of the email Friday afternoon and reported that the email urged Trump and his campaign to download archives that WikiLeaks had made public a day earlier. The story suggested that the individual may simply have been trying to flag the campaign to already public documents.

CNN has now obtained a copy of the email, which lists September 14 as the date sent and contains a decryption key that matches what WikiLeaks had tweeted out the day before.

The email came two months after the hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee were made public and one month before WikiLeaks began leaking the contents of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's hacked emails. It arrived about a week before WikiLeaks itself messaged Trump Jr. and began an exchange of direct messages on Twitter.

Trump Jr. told investigators he had no recollection of the September email.

Sources said Thursday that congressional investigators were trying to ascertain whether the individual who sent the September email is legitimate and whether it shows additional efforts by WikiLeaks to connect with Trump's son and others on the Trump campaign. The email also indicated that the Trump campaign could access records from former Secretary of State Colin Powell, whose hacked emails were made public by a Russian front group the day before the email was sent to the Trump campaign.

The email, which was described to CNN by multiple sources and verified by Trump Jr.'s attorney, came from someone who listed his name as ""Mike Erickson."" It was addressed to Trump, Trump Jr., Trump Jr.'s personal assistant and others, and turned over to Congress as part of the documents provided by the Trump Organization.

Congressional investigators are uncertain who the sender is, and CNN was unable to make contact with the individual. It's not clear whether the email was a legitimate effort to provide the hacked documents to the Trump campaign.

The individual was able to obtain the email addresses for Trump Jr. and his personal assistant, as well as an email that congressional investigators believe was for then-candidate Trump, although he rarely uses email.

Trump Jr. was asked about the WikiLeaks email Wednesday when he was questioned in the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors, several sources familiar with the exchange told CNN.

Trump Jr.'s attorney, Alan Futerfas, told CNN that his client said he had no recollection of the email and took no action on it. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and efforts to reach WikiLeaks for comment were unsuccessful.

In a statement Friday morning, Futerfas said that Trump Jr. did not know who Erickson was and reiterated the email was not responded to.

""We understand that the media reported 12 hours prior to this email that the DNC emails had been hacked or leaked,"" Futerfas said. ""We do not know who Mike Erickson is. We have no idea who he is. We never responded to the email.""

The attorney went on to criticize ""outrageous"" leaks coming out of the House Intelligence Committee.

After CNN's story published, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange tweeted that it was ""not clear what this has to do with @WikiLeaks.""

""Many enthusiastic readers emailed around archives of our publications during the election,"" Assange said.

The use of a website and decryption key as a means to provide information aligns with past WikiLeaks practices. The idea is that WikiLeaks posts a data file on the Internet, but it is encrypted and impossible to open without the key.

In 2010, for instance, Assange posted a ""poison pill"" on the Internet in the form of a 1.4-gigabyte file that contained damaging information, possibly about the US government. The file was encrypted, but Assange said a few trusted associates had the key to unlock it in the event that he was imprisoned or WikiLeaks was destroyed.

Last month, Trump Jr. released messages he exchanged on Twitter with WikiLeaks starting in September 2016, including about an anti-Trump PAC's password and a request from Trump Jr. and his father to push out links about the WikiLeaks' Podesta email release.

It's unclear whether the September 14 email has any links to the younger Trump's direct message exchanges.

In Wednesday's hearing, Trump Jr. downplayed his message exchanges with WikiLeaks over Twitter. He claimed that talking to WikiLeaks was equivalent to speaking with news organizations like CNN or NBC, according to multiple sources familiar with the testimony.",JustBadNews,0
Pakistan air force chief order: Shoot down US drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-air-force-chief-order-shoot-down-us-drones/articleshow/61967426.cms,"Representational Image

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief Sohail Aman said here on Thursday that he has ordered his force to shoot down any drones, including those of the US, if they violate the country’s airspace.

The announcement was made public about two weeks after a US drone strike targeted a militant compound in Pakistan’s tribal region near the Afghan border, killing three militants.

Pakistan had always condemned drone strikes on its soil but had never said they would shoot down the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). “We will not allow anyone to violate our airspace. I have ordered PAF to shoot down drones, including those of the US, if they enter our airspace, violating the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Air Chief Marshal Sohail Aman told an audience in Islamabad.

If he meant that US missile strikes on militant positions were a violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty, then these violations have been occurring since 2004. The CIA was responsible for all US drone strikes in Pakistan until November 30, 2017.

After every drone strike, the Pakistan foreign office issues a condemnatory statement claiming that it will not allow such strikes on its territory.

Hundreds of civilians, according to media reports, including women and children, as well as many senior members of terrorist groups have perished in these attacks. The status of many more people remains unknown.

Aman added that the most unfortunate tragedy in the PAF’s history was the attack on Kamra airbase . In August 2012, militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons carried out a brazen attack under cover of darkness on the PAF’s Minhas airbase at Kamra .

The PAF chief also told the gathering that in the attack on Kamra airbase, terrorists managed to completely destroy one PAF Saab plane and inflict considerable damage on another.

“After the attack on Kamra airbase not only did we set out to make the PAF better and stronger, but were also determined to guide the nations towards self-sufficiency. Now, Pakistan will make its own fighter jets.”

“Even Indian defence officials attest to our successes on the battlefield,” Aman claimed and alleged that India was behind the attack on Kamra airbase. “What do terrorists want from PAF planes?” he asked.

"EA's day of reckoning is here after 'Star Wars' game uproar, $3 billion in stock value wiped out",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/eas-day-of-reckoning-is-here-after-star-wars-game-uproar.html,"Electronic Arts' shareholders are running for the hills this month and for good reason.

The company's profitable business model is now at risk after angry gamers revolted over its aggressive in-game moneymaking strategy in ""Star Wars Battlefront II.""

EA's stock is down 8.5 percent month to date through Tuesday compared with the S&P 500's 2 percent gain, wiping out $3.1 billion of shareholder value. Its competitors Take-Two and Activision Blizzard shares are up 5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively during the same time period.

After EA gave a December quarter sales forecast slightly below Wall Street estimates on Oct. 31, some analysts suspected it was due to the ""Stars Wars"" title. The shares fell 4 percent the following day.

Then an uproar began after details about the game's character progression were revealed, a system so tedious players are resorting to rubber bands on controllers to acquire credits to level up.

The gaming community flooded social media and Reddit with thousands of negative posts, saying EA is unfairly compelling consumers to spend more money through micro-transactions for content that should be part of the initial $60 game price.

The controversy seems to be hurting the sales of the game, which was officially released on Nov. 17.

First week U.K. physical game sales of ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" declined 61 percent compared with ""Star Wars Battlefront"" from two years ago, according to GfK ChartTrack data. And the game is still not on the top 100 list of Amazon's best-selling video games year to date as of Tuesday.

One Wall Street analyst is also not impressed from his checks during the recent crucial holiday weekend.

""We were underwhelmed by sell-through for Star Wars: Battlefront II (EA) over the Black Friday weekend, which follows a controversial launch for the game,"" Stifel analyst Drew Crum wrote in a note to clients Sunday.

The game's weak sales are a secondary issue for Electronic Arts. The viability of its profitable micro-transaction strategy is now in question going forward.

Politicians vowed to take action to protect underage kids from the game's monetization practices. One Wall Street analyst is even calling for the industry to self-regulate before the government gets involved.



""Battlefront II is the pointy tip of the iceberg. … The biggest recent controversy has centered around EA's Star Wars Battlefront II, where early evidence suggests player anger over a mishandled loot box economy may in fact be impacting initial sales,"" Cowen's Doug Creutz wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""We think the time has come for the industry to collectively establish a set of standards for MTX implementation, both to repair damaged player perceptions and avoid the threat of regulation.""

However, with the increasing spotlight from the media and gaming community on the issue, Electronic Arts will likely be forced to dial back its extreme monetization strategies across its franchises, hurting future profitability.",JustBadNews,0
Air Force Failed to Report Dozens of Convicted Service Members to Gun Database,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/us/air-force-devin-kelley-gunman-texas.html,"In addition to the Air Force investigation, the Pentagon’s inspector general is looking into the handling of Mr. Kelley’s court-martial conviction records and whether procedures are in place to ensure cases from other service branches are also sent to the database as required. The Army chief of staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said that he believed there were also a significant number of omissions of soldiers’ records that should have been sent to the federal database.

And the number of cases that were not properly reported by the Air Force could grow: There have been about 60,000 incidents in the Air Force since 2002 involving service members that potentially should have been reported to the federal background-check database. All of those incidents are now being reviewed by Air Force officials to see which ones were required to be reported, and how many of those actually were. Air Force officials were unable to say on Tuesday how many of those 60,000 cases have gone through the review process so far.

While that review is expected to continue for several months, Air Force officials say they are moving to fix problems that prevented Mr. Kelley’s conviction from being reported. And officials emphasized that they would continue to send previously unreported cases to the federal database as soon as they discover them.

Among other things, the new directive includes a requirement that personnel at the Air Force Office of Special Investigations must confirm that reportable cases have been entered into the federal database by seeing either a printout or a screenshot from the database.

Don Christensen, who was the chief prosecutor in the Air Force and is now president of Protect Our Defenders, a nonprofit group that supports greater protections for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence in the military, said the measures were long overdue.

“I’m not surprised that they are finding these lapses, because this was clearly never a priority in the past,” Mr. Christensen said. “Earlier inspector general investigations found that they were not doing this properly, and the leadership never made it a priority to correct it.”

Even if Mr. Kelley’s conviction had been in the federal database, he could still have purchased a gun online or in person from private sellers not required to run a background check — an exemption known as the “gun show loophole.”",JustBadNews,0
Harvey Weinstein sued for alleged 'sex trafficking' in Cannes,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/27/harvey-weinstein-sued-for-alleged-sex-trafficking-in-cannes,"Harvey Weinstein has been accused of violating sex trafficking laws as an aspiring actor has launched a lawsuit against him.

Kadian Noble alleges that the disgraced producer invited her to his hotel room during the Cannes film festival in 2004 claiming that he wanted to cast her in a forthcoming movie. She claims that he proceeded to grope her before trapping her in the bathroom and forcing her to perform sexual acts.



Noble’s suit alleges that during the encounter, he told her: “Everything will be taken care of for you if you relax.” The suit is aimed not only at Harvey Weinstein but also his brother, Bob, and their company the Weinstein Company, citing “reckless disregard” on their parts.

The suit details the involvement of an unnamed producer at the company who spoke to Noble on the phone, instructing her to be “a good girl and do whatever he wished”.

In response, Weinstein’s spokesperson has denied the claims. “Mr Weinstein denies allegations of non-consensual sex,” his representative said. “Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”

The suit arrives in the same day as a civil claim in the UK from an anonymous woman who alleges that she was also sexually assaulted by Weinstein.

Both cases arrive after dozens of other women around the world have revealed similar stories about their experiences with Weinstein, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Rose McGowan.

It is believed that authorities in different cities are collaborating to try and build a legal case against the producer. Los Angeles detectives have been interviewing witnesses in preparation for a case to present to the district attorney; the NYPD has been investigating two rape complaints; and in London, three other cases are being handled.",JustBadNews,0
B.C. fish processors spewing potentially dangerous bloodwater into key salmon migration corridor,http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/b-c-fish-processors-spewing-potentially-dangerous-bloodwater-into-key-salmon-migration-corridor-1.3696793,"Salmon farming in British Columbia has long faced controversy, with concerns about fish escapes, antibiotic use, and the spread of viruses and sea lice.

Most of the anger and calls for change have been directed at fish farms, but CTV News has obtained video footage that shows fish processing plants may be contributing to problems as well.

The video shows a farmed-salmon processing plant in the Discovery Passage channel off Vancouver Island discharging bloody effluent from a pipe under the water – effluent that tests have shown contains a highly contagious fish virus.

In the video, large clouds of red liquid spew from the pipe directly onto the ocean floor, 30 metres under the surface. Sea urchins rest around the pipe, while the water around them shimmers with discarded fish scales and blobs of waste.

B.C. photographer Tavish Campbell recorded the video. Campbell dives all over B.C. to take underwater photos of wild salmon and sea life. But he says he's never seen anything quite like his footage of a thick column of blood gushing out of a pipe onto the ocean floor.

The pipe is connected to Brown's Bay Packing Co., a farmed Atlantic salmon processing plant near Campbell River, B.C. It's also near one of Canada's biggest wild salmon migratory routes.

“This current is going to disperse this stuff all over,” Campbell told CTV News. “It is insanity dumping this effluent right into the salmon migration corridor.”

Along with the footage, Campbell also grabbed water samples directly from the pipe's outflow.

Activist and researcher Alexandra Morton has long raised concerns that Atlantic salmon farming is contributing to declining numbers of wild Pacific salmon. She asked Campbell to collect the water samples and then sent them on to the Atlantic Veterinary College for analysis.

Morton told CTV News that she found living intestinal worms in the samples. In addition, the college says it found Piscine reovirus, or PRV, a virus that was first detected in Canada in 2011 and that is now commonly found in farmed salmon. In some salmon, PRV causes no problems. In others, it is linked to HSMI, or heart and skeletal muscle inflammation, a potentially fatal condition that causes heart lesions and organ hemorrhaging.

HSMI poses no health concerns to humans but it can wipe out up to 20 per cent of a farmed fish population.

So far, the effect of releasing bloody effluent from fish processing plants is not known but Morton believes it could easily spread PRV to wild salmon species.

“You are distributing the virus in a way that nature could never possibly do, and the risk to wild salmon is just astronomical,” she said.

Brown’s Bay Packing Co. is an independent processor that prepares farmed salmon for several foreign-owned fish farming companies.

Dave Stover, the manager of Brown's Bay Packing, told CTV News in a phone interview that he hasn’t seen Campbell’s video and would not comment on it.

Stover confirmed that the company has a waste water effluent pipe and he said they have “an effluent permit” from the province. He said Brown’s Bay Packing follows industry standards.

""Our most stringent standard comes from the Global Aquaculture Alliance, which has a BAP (Best Aquaculture Practices) standard ... and those standards are sort of the highest levels and we meet or exceed those,” he said.

Stover denied CTV News’ request to see the company’s waste water effluent system.

The managing of waste material in other food industries, such as poultry processing, is typically highly regulated. The same is true for meat processing, potato processing and wood pulp mills. But it appears that, when it comes to fish processing plants, there are few rules.

“There isn't a specific regulation under the Fisheries Act (on waste), which is somewhat surprising… So it does seem to be an oversight that needs to be addressed,” says Sean Jones, who specializes in Indigenous, environmental and regulatory law.

Most of the fish farms in the province are Norwegian-owned. Norway has in place several regulations to control the disposal of fish processing waste into waterways. But the same isn’t true for B.C., says Morton.

“In Norway, they know that blood is one of the leading vectors of disease. They know to be careful with it. Yet they come to B.C. where there is all this wild fish and they do not even bother to share that knowledge,” she said.

Morton said it shouldn’t be that hard to collect waste blood material and turn it into a fertilizer, instead of dumping it directly into the ocean.

The B.C. government says it is currently taking a closer look at the local fish farming industry. Last month it launched a review to see if best practices and ethical standards are being followed.

Archbishop of Canterbury on Trump-backing Christians: 'I really genuinely do not understand',http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/archbishop-canterbury-donald-trump-justin-welby-christians-us-evangelicals-a8077596.html,"The Archbishop of Canterbury has said that he doesn't understand why so many Christians in the US support President Donald Trump.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby told ITV's Peston on Sunday that he “really genuinely” can't comprehend why fundamentalists have provided such a strong base for Mr Trump.

“There's two things going through my mind: do I say what I think, or do I say what I should say? And I'm going to say what I think,” he said on the show, referring to the support Trump has garnered, especially from so-called Evangelical Christians.

“No, I don't understand it. I really genuinely do not understand where that is coming from.”

The Archhbishop did say he would be willing to attend a state dinner in Trump's honour if the president comes to Britain on an official visit.

He noted that he has met with worse people than the president of the United States.

“I spent years and years involved in conflict stuff around the world where I met people who had killed many, many people,” he said.

U.S. top court rejects challenge to Maryland assault weapons ban,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-guncontrol/u-s-top-court-rejects-challenge-to-maryland-assault-weapons-ban-idUSKBN1DR1SE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a setback on Monday to gun rights proponents including the National Rifle Association, refusing to hear a challenge to Maryland’s 2013 state ban on assault weapons enacted after a Connecticut school massacre.

U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington, U.S., November 27, 2017.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

The court turned away an appeal by several Maryland residents, firearms dealers and the state NRA association, who argued that the ban violated their right to keep and bear arms under the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment. The conservative-majority court on Monday also declined to hear a challenge to Florida’s ban on openly carrying firearms.

The justices, who have avoided major gun cases for seven years, sidestepped the roiling national debate over the availability of military-style guns to the public.

The case focused on weapons that have become a recurring feature in U.S. mass shootings including the Nov. 5 attack at a Texas church that killed 26 people, the Oct. 1 attack at a Las Vegas concert that killed 58 people, and the 2012 massacre of 20 schoolchildren and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which prompted Maryland’s law.

Assault weapons are popular among gun enthusiasts.

The challengers, who had sued Maryland’s governor and other officials in 2013, appealed a February ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia that upheld the state’s law. The 4th Circuit said it had no power to extend constitutional protections to “weapons of war,” and it found little evidence such guns were well-suited for self-defense.

Maryland’s ban outlaws “assault long guns,” mostly semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 and AK-47, as well as large-capacity magazines, which prevent the need for frequent reloading.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

Backed by the influential NRA gun lobby, the plaintiffs said in a court filing that semi-automatic rifles are in common use and that law-abiding citizens should not be deprived of them.

“The sands are always shifting with the Supreme Court,” Democratic Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said. “I hope that this means they have reached a conclusion that they are not going to fiddle with assault weapons bans across the country.”

The Supreme Court last year left in place assault weapons bans in New York and Connecticut.

“It’s inexplicable to me that people would allow the use of assault weapons when they see the carnage that has been inflicted on innocent victims around the country,” Frosh added.

‘CONTINUE FIGHTING’

The NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action took issue with the court’s refusal to hear the appeal, saying in a statement that a 2008 ruling by the justices “clearly stated that arms in common use for lawful purposes are protected by the Second Amendment and thus cannot be subject to an outright ban.”

“We will continue fighting to ensure that the Second Amendment freedoms of law-abiding Americans are respected in the courts,” the group added.

In recent years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to second guess lower court decisions upholding state and local restrictions on assault weapons, which filled a void after a federal ban on these firearms expired in 2004.

Its last major firearms rulings were in 2008, finding for the first time that the Second Amendment protected an individual’s right to gun ownership under federal law, specifically to keep a handgun at home for self-defense, and in 2010, when it found that right applied to state and local laws as well.

Since then, gun rights advocates have been probing how far those rights extend, including the types of guns and where they can be carried.

In the Florida case, defendant Dale Lee Norman, who had a permit to carry a concealed weapon, was convicted of openly carrying a handgun in 2012 near his home in Fort Pierce, Florida. The Florida Supreme Court in March rejected Norman’s challenge to the so-called open-carry ban, saying it did not violate his right to bear arms, and the U.S. high court refused to take up his appeal.",JustBadNews,0
"Sputnik, a Russian government owned news agency claims a British mine caused the sinking of the ARA San Juan",https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/russian-government-owned-news-agency-claims-british-mine-caused-sinking-ara-san-juan/,"Sputnik has claimed that the sinking of Argentine submarine ARA San Juan was caused by a British deep-sea mine deployed during the Falklands War. The problem? Britain didn’t lay any mines.

Sputnik News is a successor to Russian state-owned RIA Novosti’s international branch which became defunct in 2013. The agency is wholly owned and operated by the Russian Government.

The article, which can be found here, suggests that the explosive event registered in the area of ​​operations of the Argentine submarine ARA San Juan was caused by a deep-sea mine “installed at the time of the Falklands War in 1982.”

Quoting Russian naval captain Vasili Dandikin on the fate of the ARA San Juan:

“In 1982, the British submarines could have placed maritime mines near the Argentine coasts, the mine could remain in the bottom for 35 years, and once a storm disconnected it from the rope, it could have hit the San Juan.” The thing is, the UK didn’t use any naval mines during the Falklands War. A report in The New York Times addressed Sputnik and RT as “powerful information weapons”. Foreign Policy magazine has described Sputnik as a slick and internet-savvy outlet of Kremlin propaganda, which “remixes President Vladimir Putin’s brand of revanchist nationalism for an international audience… beating a predictable drum of anti-Western rhetoric”.

Rising sea levels threaten to contaminate the Pacific Ocean from a shoddily-constructed nuclear waste dump,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-27/the-dome-runit-island-nuclear-test-leaking-due-to-climate-change/9161442,"A poison in our island

Updated

Rising seas caused by climate change are seeping inside a United States nuclear waste dump on a remote and low-lying Pacific atoll, flushing out radioactive substances left behind from some of the world's largest atomic weapons tests.

""We call it the tomb,"" says Christina Aningi, the head teacher of Enewetak's only school.

""The children understand that we have a poison in our island.""

It's ""Manit Day"" on Enewetak Atoll, a celebration of Marshall Islands culture when the Pacific nation's troubled past seems a distant memory.

Schoolchildren sit cross-legged on the coral sands as they sing of the islands and atolls, the sunshine and the breeze; ""flowers and moonlight, swaying palm trees"".

They were born decades after the last nuclear explosion ripped through the warm Pacific air with a thunderous roar. But it's hard to escape the long echo of the bombs.

""Gone are the days when we live in fear, fear of the bombs, guns and nuclear,"" they sing.

""This is the time ... this is my country, this is my land.""

But those old fears, thought to be long buried, are threatening to reawaken in their island paradise.

On an atoll in the far-flung west of the Marshall Islands, halfway between Australia and Hawaii, sits ""the dome"".

Approaching from the water, it's hard to appreciate the true scale of the concrete vault, with its shallow profile obscured by palm trees and scrub.

But from the air it looks like a giant flying saucer has crashed on the tip of a deserted island.

Buried beneath this vast disc is 85,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste — a toxic legacy from the dawning of the thermonuclear age.

In the late 1970s, Runit Island, on the remote Enewetak Atoll, was the scene of the largest nuclear clean-up in United States history.

Highly contaminated debris left over from dozens of atomic weapons tests was dumped into a 100-metre wide bomb crater on the tip of the uninhabited island.

US Army engineers sealed it up with a half-metre thick concrete cap almost the size of an Australian football ground, then left the island.

Now with sea levels rising, water has begun to penetrate the dome.

A report commissioned by the US Department of Energy in 2013 found that radioactive materials were leeching out, threatening the already tenuous existence of Enewetak locals.

""That dome is the connection between the nuclear age and the climate change age,"" says Marshall Islands climate change activist Alson Kelen.

""It'll be a very devastating event if it really leaks. We're not just talking the Marshall Islands, we're talking the whole Pacific.""

The United States detonated 43 atomic bombs around the island chain in the 1940s and 50s.

Four of Enewetak's 40 islands were completely vaporised by the tests, with one thermonuclear blast leaving a two-kilometre-wide crater where an island had been just moments before.

Enewetak's population had been re-located to another island in the Marshalls ahead of the tests.

""That dome is the connection between the nuclear age and the climate change age.""

Residents would only be allowed to return home more than three decades later — some on the island today can still recall returning to Enewetak as children.

As part of the clean-up process, Washington set aside funds to build the dome as a temporary storage facility, and initial plans included lining the porous bottom of its crater with concrete.

But in the end, that was deemed too expensive.

""The bottom of the dome is just what was left behind by the nuclear weapons explosion,"" says Michael Gerrard, the chair of Columbia University's Earth Institute in New York.

""It's permeable soil. There was no effort to line it. And therefore, the seawater is inside the dome.""

Locals rarely set foot on Runit Island. They're fearful of the lingering radiation from the dome and because it's been ruled off-limits.

To this day, only three islands along Enewetak Atoll's slender rim are considered safe enough for human habitation.

""[The other islands were] too hot, too radioactive to worry about,"" says Giff Johnson, publisher of the Marshall Islands Journal, the country's only newspaper.

""There was no point [cleaning them up].""

After the fall-out from the atomic testing, life for the people of Enewetak went from a traditional existence of fishing and subsistence living to one where the waters that once supported their livelihoods were now polluted.

On the main island, where most of the atoll's few hundred people now live, concerns about the radioactive contamination of the food chain has seen a shift away from a traditional diet of fish and coconut.

The US Department of Energy has even banned exports of fish and copra from Enewetak because of the ongoing contamination.

The vast bulk of foodstuffs are now brought into the island by barge, and that means islanders are reliant on imported canned and processed goods like Spam that have triggered health problems such as diabetes.

The shelves of Enewetak's only store are largely filled with American brand chocolate bars, lollies and potato chips.

Locals sometimes visit Runit to scavenge from scrap copper left behind by the Americans, selling it for a few dollars to a Chinese merchant.

For 30 years, Jack Niedenthal has helped the people of neighbouring Bikini Atoll fight for compensation for the 23 atomic tests conducted there.

""To me, it's like this big monument to America's giant f--k up,"" says Niedenthal.

""This could cause some really big problems for the rest of mankind if all that goes underwater, because it's plutonium and cement.""

Some of the debris buried beneath the dome includes plutonium-239, a fissile isotope used in nuclear warheads which is one of the most toxic substances on earth.

It has a radioactive half-life of 24,100 years.

From the top of the dome, the view is dominated by ocean — the rolling waves of the Pacific to the east, the calm azure surface of the atoll lagoon to the west.

A deep bomb crater from another atomic test is carved into the coral just a few metres away.

Despite Runit Island being officially off-limits, the dome lies unmarked and unguarded.

Its position on the very edge of the shoreline reinforces just how vulnerable and exposed this nuclear waste dump is.

""We call it the tomb. The children understand that we have a poison in our island.""

Cracks are visible in the dome's surface and brackish liquid pools around its rim.

""Already the sea sometimes washes over [the dome] in a large storm,"" says Columbia University's Michael Gerrard.

""The United States Government has acknowledged that a major typhoon could break it apart and cause all of the radiation in it to disperse.""

While Professor Gerrard would like the US to reinforce the dome, a 2014 US Government report says a catastrophic failure of the structure would not necessarily lead to a change in the contamination levels in the waters surrounding it.

""I'm persuaded that the radiation outside the dome is as bad as the radiation inside the dome,"" says Professor Gerrard.

""And therefore, it is a tragic irony that the US Government may be right, that if this material were to be released that the already bad state of the environment around there wouldn't get that much worse.""

But that is cold comfort to the people of Enewetak, who fear they may have to be relocated once again if the dome collapses or crumbles.

""If it does [crack] open most of the people here will be no more,"" says Ms Aningi.

""This is like a graveyard for us, waiting for it to happen.""

French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday unveiled measures aimed at educating the public and schoolchildren about sexism and violence against women and improving police support for victims.,http://www.france24.com/en/20171125-macron-announces-new-initiative-combat-sexual-violence-harassment-france,"Ludovic Marin, Pool, AFP | French President Emmanuel Macron (R) stands next to French Junior Minister for Gender Equality Marlene Schiappa (C) and French humorist and patron of association 'Women Safe' Florence Foresti.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday unveiled measures aimed at educating the public and schoolchildren about sexism and violence against women and improving police support for victims.

During his campaign Macron, who won the presidential election in May, promised to rethink sexual politics and gender equality, which he made a national cause for his five-year mandate.

The Harvey Weinstein scandal in the United States has accelerated a rethink of attitudes towards sexual harassment in France, a country that cherishes its self-image as the land of seduction and romance.

Emmanuel Macron sets out plan to fight sexual violence: ""The streets should not be hell for the women of France""

""Let's seal a pact of equality between men and women,"" Macron said in a speech marking the International Day for Elimination of Violence Against Women.

About violence and sexual abuse, he said: ""It is essential that shame changes camp.""

""Gender-based insults will be punishable by law. Offenders will face a deterrent fine,"" he added.

During his speech, Macron observed a minute's silence for the 123 women killed by their partner or ex-partner in 2016.

Measures announced include educating secondary school children about pornography and simplifying the system for rape and assault victims to go to the police.

Proposals that could be included in a 2018 draft law include criminalising street harassment and extending the statute of limitation for the rape of minors to 30 years from 20 years. Macron also said he was personally in favour of setting the age of sexual consent at 15. Currently France has no minimum age for sexual consent.

Planned changes to the police system include allowing victims of rape and sexual assault to make their initial complaints online, before going to a police station to bring criminal charges. Other measures include ""on demand"" bus stops, where women can stop a bus anywhere at night so they can get home safely.

Violence against women: Macron sets out plan to combat sexual violence

French feminist group Osez le Féminisme said the measures were going in the right direction but must be accompanied by adequate funding.

""Without funding, any communication, training, awareness or help plan for the victims will be useless,"" the statement said.

France has often debated sexual harassment over the past decade following scandals involving French politicians.

Six years ago a sex scandal forced former finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund, provoking a round of soul-searching in France about sexual abuse that goes undetected in the upper echelons of power.

Pakistan Calls On Army to Help Restore Order After Violent Clashes in Islamabad - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/world/asia/pakistan-protests-khadim-hussain-rizvi.html,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Thousands of Pakistani police officers in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets on Saturday as they tried to clear out supporters of a firebrand cleric who have paralyzed the Pakistani capital for weeks with a protest on a main highway.

Authorities said at least six protesters were killed and 200 people — including dozens of police officers and paramilitary troops — were injured as stone-throwing crowds fought with police for control of a highway intersection. Clashes also broke out in other cities, including Lahore and Karachi, with officials saying at least 150 protesters have been arrested.

As plumes of smoke rose from the site of the highway clashes, officials in Islamabad requested the help of the Army to “control the law-and-order situation” in the capital, according the Ministry of Interior. The ministry said that the military authorities would determine the number of troops to be deployed.

The demonstrations began three weeks ago after the release of a proposed new version of an oath to be taken by lawmakers that omitted mention of the Prophet Muhammad. The protesters, many of them supporters of the cleric, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, an outspoken Islamist, have demanded that the law minister resign for the omission, which they called blasphemy.",JustBadNews,0

EU anti-propaganda unit gets ?1m a year to counter Russian fake news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/eu-anti-propaganda-unit-gets-1m-a-year-to-counter-russian-fake-news,"East Stratcom taskforce will be funded from EU budget for first time after summit highlights threat from ‘cyber-attacks and fake news’

The EU is stepping up its campaign to counter disinformation and fake news from Russia by spending more than €1m a year on its specialist anti-propaganda unit.

For the first time since the team was set up in 2015, the East Stratcom taskforce will have money from the EU budget, rather than relying on contributions from EU member states or squeezing other budget lines. The unit has been granted €1.1m (£980,000) a year from the EU budget for 2018-20, according to a source familiar with the team’s work.



The new funding emerged after the European council president, Donald Tusk, warned that one of Europe’s real problems was “cyber-attacks, fake news, hybrid war”, following a summit with EU leaders and their counterparts in eastern Europe and the Caucasus on Friday. “We have to keep very cautious, vigilant and also honest. If we want to protect ourselves, if we want to help our partners, we have to be very aware about the threat inside the EU,” Tusk said.



Tusk referred to Theresa May’s recent speech, where the prime minister accused Russia of meddling in elections and planting fake stories in the media in an attempt to “weaponise information” and sow discord in the west.



But Tusk appeared to go further than May by linking “hostile” Russian activities to the EU referendum, while May did not mention any UK elections or referendums in her Mansion House speech.



The decision to dedicate EU money to the counter-propaganda unit for the first time follows a rise in misinformation in Russian and Spanish about the Catalan independence referendum. As media attention shifts, EU sources have seen that flow of stories dry up, with the target shifting to misinformation about the latest summit with eastern countries. For instance, officials have picked up claims in Georgian media that the EU restricts Georgian products, although the country has been granted zero tariffs on all products, apart from garlic.



The UK has also become a focus for Russian state TV, following May’s speech. Dmitry Kiselyov, the anchor of Vesti Nedeli, Russia’s flagship news programme, recently made personal jibes about May’s appearance and told viewers she would soon join the ranks of Femen activists, the topless feminist protest group.

The East Stratcom unit was set up in 2015 to rebut false and misleading stories about the EU, following Russia’s hybrid war campaign in Ukraine. Based in Brussels, the unit has 14 staff. Politicians and civil society activists in eastern Europe have long argued that it lacks the resources to tackle the problem: last year, EU leaders rejected a proposal from the European parliament to increase the budget by €800,000.



The taskforce is drawing up plans on how to spend the unprecedented cash injection, with the aim of scaling up the EU monitoring of Russian media and undertaking data analysis to provide more detailed understanding of the scale of misinformation. Beyond its core staff in Brussels, the unit draws on volunteers and experts to monitor Russian media for the site the EU vs disinformation.



At the summit on Friday, May told leaders that the UK was unconditionally committed to Europe’s security: “This summit highlights the crucial importance of the European countries working together to protect our shared values and ideals.”",JustBadNews,0
INFOWARS Likely Just Violated Law by Posting Video of Rep. Barton Masturbating,https://lawandcrime.com/uncategorized/infowars-likely-just-violated-law-by-posting-rep-barton-masturbation-video/,"In a since-deleted post, Alex Jones’s INFOWARS recently published video purporting to show embattled Texas Rep. Joe Barton masturbating. The original post, according to archives of the page, occurred November 22nd and carried Alex Jones’s name as the author of the post.

Barton is in hot water for reportedly sending sexually-charged videos, messages, and photos to a woman whom he later threatened to report to Capitol Police if she exposed him, the Washington Post reports.

What is interesting, though, is the INFOWARS decision to publish the material, which seems at first blush to be a violation of a Texas “Revenge Porn” law. The law would cover INFOWARS, which is a publication of Free Speech Systems, LLC, registered to an Austin, Texas address according to the Texas Secretary of State.

Under section 26.16 of the Texas Penal Code, it is a crime to unlawfully disclose or promote “intimate visual material.” An offense occurs if someone:

Intentionally discloses sexual recordings without consent; The person depicted had a reasonable expectation that the recordings would remain private; The leaking of the recordings caused harm; and The identity of the depicted person is disclosed, including through accompanying information.

Another subsection of the statute makes it a crime to promote an offending recording “on an Internet website . . . that is owned or operated by the person.”

As with many laws, the Texas “Revenge Porn” law contains affirmative defenses which function as a legal “get out of jail free” card. Doctors, police officers, and lawyers are specifically enumerated as having affirmative defenses to sharing otherwise offending recordings if the recordings are shared for legitimate purposes pursuant to their jobs.

One affirmative defense under the law is “reporting unlawful activity,” though it doesn’t appear that would apply to INFOWARS because the “report” was not to law enforcement.

Another affirmative defense applies if the person who shares the recording “is an interactive computer service . . . and the disclosure or promotion consists of visual material provided by another person.” Texas law draws its definition of “interactive computer service” from federal law, where it generally means that the operator of a passive message board is not liable for messages posted by others. A “content provider,” which is what INFOWARS is, is separate.

Interestingly, the original INFOWARS post notes that screen shots of the footage appeared on TMZ, that “Rep. Barton has claimed he is a victim of revenge porn,” and that “Journalist Laura Loomer is credited with obtaining the footage.”

In a series of tweets, Loomer admits giving the video to Jones at INFOWARS.

People are asking me why I gave exclusive video footage of @RepJoeBarton, a Republican, to @infowars. I’d be a hypocrite to report on Democrats who get caught up in sex scandals and not do the same for Republicans. You may not like what I do, but I will always keep it 100! — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) November 22, 2017

Violating the Texas law is a Class A misdemeanor. That means someone convicted of breaking it could face up to a year in jail, up to a $4,000 fine, or both.

Of course, the civil consequences of publishing the video could also be dire.

The Barton video raises memories of a lawsuit filed by Hulk Hogan against the former Web site Gawker. Hogan sued Gawker in Florida on six claims: (1) publication of private facts, (2) invasion of privacy by intrusion upon seclusion, (3) right of publicity, (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress, and (6) surveillance of communications. The resulting jury award of $115 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages led ultimately to a $31 million settlement and the shutdown of Gawker.com.

No word on any any Texas prosecutors will try to pursue the case. If charged or sued, INFOWARS would surely raise first amendment defenses.

While bragging about the United States military capabilities, Donald Trump made one of his most bizarre claims to date.

Speaking to members of the US Coast Guard on Thanksgiving Day, he told the audience the air force was ordering a plane which was ""like an invisible fighter"".

Trump said he asked ""the air force guys"" about the abilities of the F-35 plane, according to a report in The Independent.

""They said, well, sir, you can't see it. I said but in a fight. You know, in a fight, like I watch on the movies. The fight, they're fighting. How good is this?"" he reportedly said.

""They say, well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it. Even if it's right next to them, it can't see it. I said: That helps. That's a good thing.""

The outlandish claim sent Twitter into meltdown.

Although, it is not invisible, the F-35 is incredibly small and designed to be less visible to radar than conventional aircraft.

However, Billy Flynn, a F-35 Lightning II pilot, told The Telegraph, none of the component parts of the aircraft reflect radar energy, it is impossible to see the F-35 while it is in flight.

""When we want to fire a missile or drop a bomb, the doors open, the bomb falls out, the doors close and the aeroplane is back to being invisible again,"" Flynn told the newspaper.

""This aeroplane, when it flies, is infinitesimally small. It's not Harry Potter and the cloak of invisibility, but it's pretty darn close.""

In the transcript of his latest speech, Trump also boasted about how much he was spending on defence.

He claimed his previous administrations had cut back on military spending for a number of years, to the extent that it became ""depleted"".

""Nobody has the equipment that we have. And it's sad when we're selling our equipment to other countries but we're not buying it ourselves,"" Trump said.

""But now that's all changed. And I said, the stuff that we have is always a little bit better too. ""When we sell to other countries, even if they're allies, you never know about an ally.

An ally can turn. You're going to find that out.

""But I always say make lives a little bit better. Give it that extra speed, a little bit — keep a little bit — keep about 10 per cent in the bag …. Nobody has what we have.

""We're ordering tremendous amounts of new equipment — we're at $700bn for the military. And, you know, they were cutting back for years.

""They just kept cutting, cutting, cutting the military. And you got lean, to put it nicely. It was depleted, was the word. And now it's changing.""

Trump then reportedly served up sandwiches to the audience.

""Let's go, fellas. Come on,"" he said. ""Let's get up here. Let's get up here. Yeah. This is good stuff.""",JustBadNews,0
"Seattle Porn Scammer Matt Hickey, Accused of Rape, Pleads Guilty to Three Felonies",http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/11/21/25577001/seattle-porn-scammer-matt-hickey-accused-of-rape-pleads-guilty-to-three-non-rape-felonies,"Seattle Porn Scammer Matt Hickey, Accused of Rape, Pleads Guilty to Three Felonies

Hickey will face sentencing in late December or January. JASON REDMOND

This post has been updated with additional comments from Hickey's victims.

Matt Hickey, the former tech journalist who masqueraded as a porn scout to trick women into having sex with him during fake ""auditions,"" on Tuesday pleaded guilty to three felonies and fourth degree assault after six women came forward to accuse him of rape.

He faces up to 34 months in prison for his most serious conviction of indecent liberties, far fewer than he would face for his original rape charges. Still, his guilty plea means that he will have to register as a sex offender.

Hickey has been in jail since October of 2016, after he was extradited from Las Vegas while on the run from accusations that dogged him here in Seattle. Hickey had developed an online female alter-ego to lure young women into fake auditions where they were told they needed to have sex with him in order to find work. Hickey was busted when several women recognized their own experiences in posts that circulated online, and when one woman undertook a sting operation of her own to uncover Hickey's fake identity. Subsequently, an article published by The Stranger outed Hickey as a porn scout scammer.

The Washington State Attorney General sued Hickey over the porn scam, and a judge fined Hickey more than $300,000 in violations of state consumer protection laws.

After these women spoke to The Stranger, most of them going on the record with their full names, several more women came forward to accuse Hickey of raping them after getting them too drunk to consent. Two of the allegations did come from women who were lured to Hickey through his porn scam, but four other rape allegations came from women who met Hickey on dates or considered him a friend. One allegation that stretched back more than a decade had expired under the state's statute of limitations.

Prosecutors filed four rape charges against Hickey.

Hickey initially said he was innocent of the rape charges, and the counts Hickey has now admitted to are not the rape offenses with which he was originally charged.

Hickey took a plea deal instead: one count of indecent liberties and two counts of assault with intent to commit indecent liberties, and fourth-degree assault with sexual motivation. The indecent liberties charge, the most serious Hickey faces, is a sex offense that requires adding his name to the sex offender registry. The same count carries a standard sentencing range of 26 to 34 months, according to the prosecutors who charged Hickey.

This outcome means that the women who brought the charges against Hickey will not have to undergo a trial with cross-examination, a re-traumatizing experience for many rape survivors who often have their characters and sexual histories questioned on the stand. Instead, Hickey's victims will read victim impact statements at his sentencing, currently scheduled for late December, to help the judge determine Hickey's punishment.

One of the women who filed a rape charge against Hickey, and who asked to remain anonymous, told The Stranger she was glad the case was wrapping up, and hoped it would give her a sense of closure. ""The one thing that was really important to me was that he be on the sex offenders registry, so I'm pleased that's happening,"" she said.

Jasie Jackson, another of Hickey's victims who was able to file a rape charge, said she was happy with the outcome.

""It seemed like a better situation than if a judge were to decide to split the cases up, making each individual count less strong, and creating the possibility of him getting off completely,"" she said. ""I wouldn't necessarily have any problem being cross-examined, but if we can get some sort of punishment without putting everybody through that, that seems preferable to me.""

Jackson added that she had been surprised by her experience in the criminal justice system, particularly in working with women detectives, prosecutors, and victim advocates.

""It's all very empowering to be able to talk openly with women who also are like, 'This is screwed up, and things need to change, and this is what we're trying to do for you guys and for the world,'"" she said. ""I felt supported and heard. Just hearing that he's pleaded guilty and has taken the plea, that's a lot more than a lot of victims get to see.""

But not everyone who had accused Hickey of rape felt the plea deal would deliver justice. Haley Byrd, the woman who first contacted The Stranger about a rape allegation separate from the porn scam, couldn't file a charge because her allegation extended beyond the statute of limitations. When asked about Hickey's guilty plea, she said she was stunned, furious, and depressed.

""How they went from charging a sexual predator who had proven premeditated sexual intent with four felony counts of rape, each carrying a maximum/potential life sentence, to allowing him only consequences for what is basically the equivalent of getting into a bar fight and sending some unwanted dick pics is beyond me,"" Byrd said in a written message.

""I feel totally let down by our justice system and all of the people who claimed they were trying to help me,"" Byrd continued.

Byrd said she thought Hickey registering as a sex offender ""seems more than appropriate,"" but expressed concern that Hickey would continue to prey on women in the future as he had done in the porn scam.

""My only remaining hope is that he receives the maximum possible prison time for all charges, is required to register as a sex offender for at least 10 years (less than the span of his sexual crimes), and has his location monitored via parole so that he can't just disappear (he already fled once), start a new life, and prey on women again,"" Byrd said. ""This will be up to the judge now to give us the only justice possible at this point. I hope the judge will at least give us that.""

Allysia Bishop, one of the first women who came forward with allegations against Hickey regarding both the scam and rape, said she had mixed feelings.

""I am somewhat disappointed that none of the rape charges stuck, but I am relieved he is experiencing more consequences than most rapists ever do,"" she said. ""It's cathartic in a way that it's reaching its conclusion, but I'm still having trouble processing everything.""

'Art of the Deal' ghostwriter: Trump 'frightened by black people',http://thehill.com/homenews/media/361650-art-of-the-deal-ghostwriter-trump-frightened-by-black-people,"Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter behind President Trump's bestselling 1987 book ""The Art of the Deal"", says the president's recent attacks of LaVar Ball stem from Trump being ""half awed and half frightened by black people.""

Trump and Ball have gone back and forth through the media since Ball's son, LiAngelo Ball, and two other UCLA players were released from China after being detained for shoplifting earlier this month.

Asked Wednesday by CNN’s John Berman whether Trump’s attack was down to “what LaVar Ball said or, as some are alleging, how he looks,” Schwartz responded: ""Both.""

"No subsidies for green power projects before 2025, says UK Treasury: Government accused of 'turning their back on renewables' after saying there will be no more money for new low-carbon levies.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/no-subsidies-for-green-power-projects-before-2025-says-uk-treasury,"Government accused of ‘turning their back on renewables’ after saying there will be no more money for new low-carbon levies

Companies hoping to build new windfarms, solar plants and tidal lagoons, have been dealt a blow after the government said there would be no new subsidies for clean power projects until 2025 at the earliest.

The Treasury said it had taken the decision to “protect” consumers, because households and businesses were facing an annual cost of about £9bn on their energy bills to pay for wind, solar and nuclear subsidies to which it had already committed.

The revelation that there will be no more money for projects before 2025 could dash hopes for pioneering projects such as the proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea, which has a mooted launch date of 2022.

In a Treasury document on carbon levies published on Wednesday, officials said: “On the basis of the current forecast, there will be no new low-carbon electricity levies until 2025.”

Renewable power critic is chosen to head energy price review Read more

Environmental groups criticised the Treasury move. The WWF said it was a huge disappointment, while Greenpeace claimed Wednesday’s budget was one of the least green ever.

Business groups also reacted with dismay. The pro-environment Aldersgate Group, whose members include BT, Ikea and Marks & Spencer, said the lack of clarity on low-carbon power investments was disappointing.

James Court, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, said: “The UK government seem to be turning their back on renewables by announcing no new support for projects post-2020 and a freeze on carbon taxes.”

It is understood the policy will only affect projects generating electricity before 2025, so would not stop firms signing contracts for power stations coming online after 2025. That means the backers of new nuclear power stations are unlikely to be affected by the decision, because none was expected to be built by then. But it could be a blow for the companies wanting to build solar farms, onshore windfarms and other clean power plants at an earlier date.

Some industry figures took comfort from Treasury language suggesting that some contracts might be allowed for renewables if the price were so low as to be effectively subsidy-free.

The government confirmed that it would honour an existing pledge to auction £557m of renewable energy subsidies, beginning next year. But most of that pot is expected to be taken by giant offshore windfarms, likely crowding out other technologies such as tidal.

John Sauven, chief executive of Greenpeace, said: “Despite the chancellor’s pride in the UK’s climate leadership, hidden away in the unannounced text of the budget, he quietly revealed this was one of the least green budgets ever because there will be no new money for renewables until at least 2025.”

Gareth Redmond-King, head of energy and climate at WWF, said: “It is a huge disappointment that there will be no new investment in UK renewables.”

The government also announced that until 2025 it was freezing a carbon tax on dirty energy generators. Big energy firms, including SSE, have been calling for the tax, the carbon price floor, to be strengthened to encourage new investment in greener energy.

Recent research by energy analysts suggested that without an increase in the tax, coal power plant owners would enjoy a last hurrah in the early 2020s before they hit a government deadline for the closure of all coal-fired stations by 2025.

One expert said the decision to freeze rather than increase the tax meant the UK’s climate change target for 2030 was being put at risk.

“It is disappointing that the Treasury is continuing its indefinite freeze of the carbon price support rate, a move that could endanger the achievement of the UK’s emissions target for 2030,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.

He added that the current price of around £24.50 a tonne of CO2 was likely to be too weak to drive the energy market to shift from gas power stations to renewables and nuclear.",JustBadNews,0
Russia warns Google of retaliatory measures if government-backed news sites are downranked,https://static.techspot.com/news/71998-russia-warns-google-retaliatory-measures-if-government-backed.html,"Earlier this week, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said Google would lower the visibility of articles from government-funded Russian outlets RT and Sputnik in its search results. The move has prompted Alexander Zharov, head of Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor, to send a letter to Google asking for clarification on its position.

“We will receive an answer and understand what to do next,” Zhorov said, according to Interfax. “We hope our opinion will be heard, and we won’t have to resort to more serious” retaliatory measures.

While speaking at the Halifax Security Forum on Saturday, Schmidt answered a question about Sputnik’s prominent appearance in Google’s news alerts. American intelligence agencies claim both RT and Sputnik played a role in influencing US voter opinion during the 2016 election through the spread of misinformation.

“It's basically RT and Sputnik are the two, and there's a whole bunch of coverage about what we're doing there. But we're well aware of it, we're trying to engineer the systems to prevent it,” said Schmidt.

Although Google is lowering the organizations’ positions in the search rankings, Schmidt emphasized that “we don’t want to ban the sites; that’s not how we operate.”

Zharov said he would wait to “see how discriminating this measure will be in its practical embodiment” before taking further action.

Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters that Schmidt’s comments referred to ongoing efforts announced in April to demote search results that link to low quality, false and deliberately misleading content, while also promoting “authoritative” pages.",JustBadNews,0

The following year, the California Republican became even more valuable, assuming the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee that oversees Russia policy. He sailed to re-election again and again, even as he developed ties to Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia.

Then came President Trump.

As revelations of Russia’s campaign to influence American politics consume Washington, Mr. Rohrabacher, 70, who had no known role in the Trump election campaign, has come under political and investigative scrutiny. The F.B.I. and the Senate Intelligence Committee are each seeking to interview him about an August meeting with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Rohrabacher said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is said to be interested in a meeting he had last year with Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s short-lived national security adviser.

At the same time, fellow Republicans — questioning his judgment and intentions — have moved to curtail his power as chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats.

"Woman, 18, accused of raping man at knifepoint gets probation",http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2017/11/woman_18_accused_of_raping_man_1.html,"SAGINAW, MI -- The 18-year-old woman accused of raping a man at knifepoint earlier this year will spend the next five years on probation and 25 years on the sex offender registry.

Lestina Marie Smith was sentenced Monday afternoon, Nov. 20, by Circuit Judge Andre R. Borrello on one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct, a 15-year felony.

In addition to probation and registry, Borrello ordered Smith to complete sex offender treatment, have no contact with the 20-year-old victim and pay the victim $1,000 for damages done to his vehicle and its contents.

Borrello also ordered 313 days in jail with credit for 313 days served. Smith will spend the next year on GPS tether.

Smith initially faced life in prison on two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. She pleaded no contest Sept. 13 to one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct.

Smith was 17 years old when she raped a 19-year-old man in his car, videotaped part of the incident and threatened him with a steak knife Jan. 11, the man previously testified.

The pair had dated for about two months in late 2016, according to the man's testimony.

Smith's attorney, James F. Gust, said the sentence fits the situation.

The biggest factor, he said, is the man wrote a letter to Borrello asking the judge to not send Smith to prison.

Mental health issues, lack of criminal record and other circumstances were additional mitigating factors, Gust said.

""Never in dealing with her, never did she appear to be someone who is a threat to society,"" he said.

Gust said if the offender were a male and the situation was the same, the sentence would still fit the crime.

The incident

The Jan. 11 incident in the driveway of Smith's step-sister's Saginaw Township home evolved from a dispute over a sex tape, Gust said.

""He allegedly had a sex tape that he was going to put out on social media,"" Gust said. ""She wanted to make one with him so that she would have one to keep him from putting his out there.""

Attorneys previously asked the man if Smith wanted to meet him that night because she wanted to delete the video of them having sex stored on his phone.

The victim testified he didn't know, but that she did delete it, either that night or in the days before.

Once the man arrived in the driveway, Smith hopped in his car, berated him, called him names and recorded with her cellphone, he previously testified.

She began punching him and, eventually, pulled a steak knife from her sleeve and stabbed him in the arm and poked him under the eye with it, he testified.

The stab to the arm did not pierce skin but did put a hole in his leather jacket, he stated.

The man said he was locked in the car and couldn't call for help, as his phone and keys were taken by Smith, he testified.

At some point, Smith told him to get into the back seat, he said.

The man described Smith holding him at knifepoint and forcing him to perform oral sex on her as she took a cell phone video.

Saginaw Township Police Officer David West testified he responded to the incident that night and saw the video.

Smith told him she used the knife to scare the man, West testified.

The man testified that Smith forced him to perform sexual intercourse at knifepoint.

After that, she began to stab his car seats and dashboard and cut up his high school graduation tassel, he testified.

Smith returned his keys and he drove to a nearby gas station, where he called police, he testified.",JustBadNews,0
U.S. Muslims call for restrictions against 'non-Muslims' in America,https://www.rabwah.net/american-islamists-hold-fundraiser-virginia/,"Pakistan born Islamic cleric Rafiq Khan defined America as “The land of Infidels” at a fundraiser for his Islamic charity this Saturday. The event which was held at a Holiday Inn in Springfield, Virginia attracted over 100 participants. Speakers included an Islamist from Pakistan as well as radical Imams from the states of Maryland, Virginia, and Texas. The conference revolved around the topics of Jihad, Infidels and what can the American Muslim community do to counter conspiracies against Islam.

We went undercover to report on the day-long event which was organized by two U.S. registered charities, Idara Dawat-O-Irshad and Khatme Nubuwwat Center, both of which enjoy IRS tax-exempt status.

The registration desk which was manned by teenagers displayed flyers and posters denouncing the founder of the moderate Ahmadiyya Islamic sect. An exhibition stall lined with posters urged Muslim voters to not vote for “non-Muslim candidates”. The event particularly targeted the Ahmadis who are considered heretic by the majority of mainstream Muslims as they believe in another Prophet after Prophet Muhammad and have a different understanding of Jihad. Many of the conference speakers accused the Ahmadis of being ‘Infidels’ and criticized them for having ‘abolished Jihad’.

The event’s keynote speaker was Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi, a visiting Islamic cleric from Pakistan. In a 2016 piece, Ludhianvi who serves as the editor of monthly Millia magazine claimed that America was behind the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

Ludhianavi, who is also the principal of the Islamic seminary Dar-ul-Uloom located in the Pakistani city of Faisalabad claimed that ‘ignorant Infidels’ need to be dealt with force, He said:

“They are ignorant and there is no need for dialogue with them, God has given them two options, one is the holy book and one is the stick [Force] and if one does not accept the holy book they have to be forced”

He also urged American Muslim Lawyers to use the American Justice system to restrict the religious freedom of Ahmadis:

“Have all Muslim lawyers died, why cant they learn and understand U.S. laws and then go present their case in front of the judge and explain that Qadianis [Ahmadis] are disrespecting Islam……..Islam is our faith and they [Ahmadis] are portraying their religious beliefs as Islamic beliefs ……. it should be made criminal for them to do so”

Commenting on the dangers faced by Islam, Ludhianvi said:

“The biggest threat that Islam is facing today is the disruption of the family system, for which they [west] are urging women to go out of their homes”

Last year in his magazine, Ludhainvi issued a Fatwa (decree) stating that “The use of cellphone by women in public places was against Islam” and so was wearing “High heel shoes”

Another Islamic cleric, Usman Ahsan, a graduate of Dar-ul-Uloom, a Canadian Islamic seminary declared that claiming to be a Prophet after Muhammad was “enough to wage war” against them.

Pakistani cleric Ludhanvi repeated Ahsan’s comments and said that:

“those who claimed prophethood after Prophet Muhammad were not only given death sentences by were actually killed”

Similar comments were made by Mufti Qareeb ur Rehman, an American Imam who graduated from Pakistan’s Jamia Binoria Karachi, an Islamic seminary with ties to extremist groups. Rehman currently serves as an Imam at the Manassas Muslim Association.

Another Jamia Binoria graduate, Imam Shazad Hussain of Springfield’s ‘Noor Mosque’ claimed that the minority Ahmadis conspired with the British to stop Muslims from ‘fighting Jihad and committing bloodshed’.

Imam Shazad Hussain further added that:

We are not going to support any [peace] initiatives of people who have fallen out of the fold of Islam

The Jamia Binoria seminary is the source of many extreme Islamic teachings which include support for Suicide attacks and the death penalty for apostates. Other Fatwas issued by Jamia Binoria include:

Support for Jihad [against Americans] in Afghanistan & Iraq

Wishing Merry Christmas to Christians is prohibited

Yoga is Haram [forbidden]

Event moderator Omar F. Khan, who is a teacher at the ‘Idara Dawat-O-Irshad’ charity went to great lengths to explain why Shiites Muslims were also “Infidels”.

During a Question and Answer session, Pakistani speaker Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi warned the U.S. Government to “stop giving refuge to the adherents of the Qadiani faith [Ahmadis]” who he claimed were worse than Jews & Christians.

The conference ended with organizers urging the attendees to donate $100 each to pay for the expenses of the “cause”. The organizers also thanked the “Karahi Kabob” restaurant owner for providing free food to the conference attendees.",JustBadNews,0
"No, you're not being paranoid. Sites really are watching your every move",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/an-alarming-number-of-sites-employ-privacy-invading-session-replay-scripts/,"If you have the uncomfortable sense someone is looking over your shoulder as you surf the Web, you're not being paranoid. A new study finds hundreds of sites—including microsoft.com, adobe.com, and godaddy.com—employ scripts that record visitors' keystrokes, mouse movements, and scrolling behavior in real time, even before the input is submitted or is later deleted.

Session replay scripts are provided by third-party analytics services that are designed to help site operators better understand how visitors interact with their Web properties and identify specific pages that are confusing or broken. As their name implies, the scripts allow the operators to re-enact individual browsing sessions. Each click, input, and scroll can be recorded and later played back.

A study published last week reported that 482 of the 50,000 most trafficked websites employ such scripts, usually with no clear disclosure. It's not always easy to detect sites that employ such scripts. The actual number is almost certainly much higher, particularly among sites outside the top 50,000 that were studied.

""Collection of page content by third-party replay scripts may cause sensitive information, such as medical conditions, credit card details, and other personal information displayed on a page, to leak to the third-party as part of the recording,"" Steven Englehardt, a PhD candidate at Princeton University, wrote. ""This may expose users to identity theft, online scams, and other unwanted behavior. The same is true for the collection of user inputs during checkout and registration processes.""

Englehardt installed replay scripts from six of the most widely used services and found they all exposed visitors' private moments to varying degrees. During the process of creating an account, for instance, the scripts logged at least partial input typed into various fields. Scripts from FullStory, Hotjar, Yandex, and Smartlook were the most intrusive because, by default, they recorded all input typed into fields for names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, addresses, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth.

The following video captured data as it was transmitted in real time to FullStory:

Even when services took steps to mask some of the data, they often did so in ways that continued to jeopardize visitor privacy. Smartlook and UserReplay, for instance, collected the number of characters typed into password fields. UserReplay also logged the last four digits of visitors' credit card numbers.

Englehardt said the services provide manual and automatic tools website operators can use to redact information that is collected on their properties. But the tools in many cases require large amounts of developer time and skill. And even then, sites with strong legal incentives not to leak sensitive data were found doing just that. Walgreens.com, for instance, sent medical conditions and prescriptions alongside user names to FullStory despite the extensive use of manual redactions on the pharmacy site.

Another example: the account page for clothing store Bonobos leaked full credit card details—character by character as they were typed—to FullStory. Adding insult to injury, Yandex, Hotjar, and Smartlook all offer dashboards that use unencrypted HTTP when subscribing publishers replay visitor sessions, even when the original sessions were protected by HTTPS.

Representatives for both Walgreens and Bonobos have said the sites have stopped sharing information with FullStory, according to reports from Motherboard and Wired.

It's not clear what meaningful recourses Internet users have for preventing the data collection. The researcher said that ad-blockers can filter out some, but not all, of the replay scripts. Checking the ""do not track"" option built into some browsers also failed to stop the logging. That means every keystroke typed into a Web field may be logged, character by character, even if the visitor later deletes the field and never presses a submit button.

KEHRORE PAKKA, Pakistan (AP) — Kausar Parveen struggles through tears as she remembers the blood-soaked pants of her 9-year-old son, raped by a religious cleric. Each time she begins to speak, she stops, swallows hard, wipes her tears and begins again.

The boy had studied for a year at a nearby Islamic school in the town of Kehrore Pakka. In the blistering heat of late April, in the grimy two-room Islamic madrassa, he awoke one night to find his teacher lying beside him.

“I didn’t move. I was afraid,” he says.

The cleric lifted the boy’s long tunic-style shirt over his head, and then pulled down his baggy pants.

“I was crying. He was hurting me. He shoved my shirt in my mouth,” the boy says, using his scarf to show how the cleric tried to stifle his cries. He looks over at his mother.

“Did he touch you?’” He nods. “Did he hurt you when he touched you?” ″Yes,” he whispers.

“Did he rape you?” He buries his face in his scarf and nods yes.

Parveen reaches over and grabs her son, pulling him toward her, cradling his head in her lap.

“INFESTED” WITH SEXUAL ABUSE

Sexual abuse is a pervasive and longstanding problem at madrassas in Pakistan, an AP investigation has found, from the sunbaked mud villages deep in its rural areas to the heart of its teeming cities. But in a culture where clerics are powerful and sexual abuse is a taboo subject, it is seldom discussed or even acknowledged in public.

It is even more seldom prosecuted. Police are often paid off not to pursue justice against clerics, victims’ families say. And cases rarely make it past the courts, because Pakistan’s legal system allows the victim’s family to “forgive” the offender and accept what is often referred to as “blood money.”

The AP found hundreds of cases of sexual abuse by clerics reported in the past decade, and officials suspect there are many more within a far-reaching system that teaches at least 2 million children in Pakistan. The investigation was based on police documents and dozens of interviews with victims, relatives, former and current ministers, aid groups and religious officials.

The fear of clerics and the militant religious organizations that sometimes support them came through clearly. One senior official in a ministry tasked with registering these cases says many madrassas are “infested” with sexual abuse. The official asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution; he has been a target of suicide attacks because of his hard position against militant groups.

He compares the situation to the abuse of children by priests in the Catholic Church.

“There are thousands of incidences of sexual abuse in the madrassas,” he says. “This thing is very common, that this is happening.”

Pakistan’s clerics close ranks when the madrassa system is too closely scrutinized, he says. Among the weapons they use to frighten their critics is a controversial blasphemy law that carries a death penalty in the case of a conviction.

“This is not a small thing here in Pakistan — I am scared of them and what they can do,” the official says. “I am not sure what it will take to expose the extent of it. It’s very dangerous to even try.”

His assessment was echoed by another senior official, a former minister who says sexual abuse in madrassas happens all the time. He also doesn’t want his name used because he too has survived suicide bombings due to his stance on militants.

“That’s a very dangerous topic,” he says.

A tally of cases reported in newspapers over the past 10 years of sexual abuse by maulvis or clerics and other religious officials came to 359. That represents “barely the tip of the iceberg,” says Munizae Bano, executive director of Sahil, the organization that scours the newspapers and works against sexual abuse of minors.

In 2004, a Pakistani official disclosed more than 500 complaints of sexual assaults against young boys in madrassas. He has since refused to talk, and there have been no significant arrests or prosecutions.

Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousaf dismisses the suggestion that sexual abuse is widespread, saying such talk is an attempt to malign the religion, seminaries and clerics. He says he was not aware of even the cases reported in the newspapers, but that it could occur occasionally ’because there are criminals everywhere.” Yousaf says the reform and control of madrassas is the job of the interior ministry.

The Interior Ministry, which oversees madrassas, refused repeated written and telephone requests for an interview.

The case of Parveen’s son was one of at least three within a month in the towns of Kehrore Pakka and Rajanpur in Punjab province’s deep south, according to police reports. Another incident involved the drugging and gang rape of a 12-year-old boy asleep on his madrassa rooftop by former students. And the third was of a 10-year-old boy sodomized by the madrassa principal when he brought him his meal. The cleric threatened to kill the boy if he told.

The AP is not naming the children because they are victims of sexual abuse.

The fear of clerics was evident at the courthouse in Kehrore Pakka, where the former teacher of Parveen’s son waited his turn to go before a judge. A half dozen members of the radical Sunni militant organization Sipah-e-Sahabah were there to support the teacher.

They scowled and moved closer when an AP reporter sat next to the teacher, who was shackled to a half dozen other prisoners. The whispers grew louder and more insistent.

“It’s too dangerous here,” said one person, looking over at the militants nearby. “Leave. Leave the courthouse, they can do anything here.”

The teacher had already confessed, according to police, and the police report said he was found with the boy. Yet he swore his innocence in court.

“I am married,” he said. “My wife is pretty, why would I do this to a kid?”

HOW MADRASSAS WORK

There are more than 22,000 registered madrassas or Islamic schools in Pakistan. The students they teach are often among the country’s poorest, who receive food and an education for free.

Many more madrassas — small two- or three-room seminaries in villages throughout Pakistan — are unregistered, opened by a graduate of another madrassa, often without any education other than a proficiency in the Quran. They operate without scrutiny, ignored by the authorities, say residents living nearby. Parveen’s son, for example, went to an unregistered madrassa.

Madrassas are funded by wealthy business people, religious political parties and even donors from other countries, such as Saudi Arabia. The teachings of the madrassas are guided by schools of Islamic thought, such as Shiite and Sunni.

However, unlike the Catholic Church, which has a clear hierarchy topped by the Vatican, there is no central religious authority that governs madrassas. There is also no central body that investigates or responds to allegations in religious schools.

“Basic responsibility, when something happens, is with the head of the madrassa,” says Mufti Mohammed Naeem, the head of the sprawling Jamia Binoria madrassa in the city of Karachi.

There are between 2,000 and 3,000 unregistered madrassas, Naeem says, which makes central oversight even harder. The government has launched a nationwide effort to register madrassas.

The “keepers” of madrassas are also notoriously reluctant to accept government oversight or embrace reforms, according to I.A. Rehman of the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, which makes sexual abuse harder to prevent.

“This is one of those things, you know, which everybody knows is going on and happening, but evidence is very scarce,” he says. He adds that the power of the people who run the madrassas has increased over the years.

As the religious right has grown stronger in Pakistan, clerics who were once dependent on village leaders for handouts, even food, have risen in stature. With this rise, reporting of sexual abuse in madrassas has trickled off, said human rights lawyer Saif-ul Mulk. Mulk has police protection because of death threats from militants outraged by his defense of a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting Islam.

“Everyone is so afraid of the mullahs today,” he says.

POLICE HELP THE MULLAH

The fear that surrounds sexual abuse by clerics means that justice is rare. The payoff from offending mullahs to police means that they often refuse to even register a case, says Azam Hussain, a union councilor in Kehrore Pakka. And the families involved are often poor and powerless.

“Poor people are afraid, so they don’t say anything,” Hussain says. “Police help the mullah. Police don’t help the poor. ... Poor people know this, so they don’t even go to the police.”

This is particularly true in Punjab, Pakistan’s largest province, where more than 60 percent of its 200 million people live. Even Pakistan’s own Punjab provincial anti-corruption department in a 2014 report listed the Punjab police as the province’s most corrupt department. Police say they investigate when a complaint is made, but they have no authority to take a case forward when the family accepts money, which often happens.

The family of a boy who says he was repeatedly assaulted sexually by a cleric in a Punjab madrassa talks about their tussle with police.

The boy isn’t sure of his age. Maybe 10 or 11, he says. His voice is barely a whisper, his head bent low as he talked. He is surrounded by two dozen villagers and relatives, all men, all angry.

He says the cleric threatened him with death if he told anyone.

“I was ashamed and I was scared,” he says. “He told me if I told anyone, my brother, my family, he would kill all my family and he would kill me.”

He says he begged the cleric to leave him alone. Once, the cleric even swore on the Quran that he would stop, but still returned.

In August, when the boy was home, the thought of returning to his madrassa became too much. He pleaded with his older brother not to send him back. But his brother beat him and told him to go back.

The brother, who would only give his first name as Maqsood, looks anguished. “I didn’t know,” he says. Their elderly uncle, who looks near tears, covers his face and tries not to look in the boy’s direction.

The boy says another student at his seminary was assaulted by the same cleric. But police released the cleric after senior Punjab government officials intervened on his behalf, according to Maqsood.

Demonstrations by villagers forced the cleric’s re-arrest. Still, Maqsood says, when he went to the police, his honesty was questioned.

“The maulvi was sitting in the chair like he was the boss, and I was told to stay standing,” he says. “We are being pressured to compromise. ... We are poor people.”

Local police deny charges that they favored the cleric or intimidated the family. They say they have consulted a local Islamic scholar about the rape allegations, and that the madrassa has not come to their attention previously for any wrongdoing.

“We need witnesses, evidence,” says Sajjad Mohammed Khan, Vehari’s deputy superintendent of police for organized crime.

The top police officer in the district center of Multan, Deputy Inspector General Police Sultan Azam Temuri, also denies that pressure from clerics or powerful politicians prompts police to go easy in such cases. He says cases are investigated when allegations are made. Temuri says his department is trying to tackle child abuse in general with the introduction of gender and child protection services.

The madrassa where Maqsood’s brother went, with more than 250 students, has a reputation in the neighborhood for abuse. Two women with their heads covered hurry past, stopping briefly to warn a young Pakistani woman, “Don’t bring your children to that madrassa. It is very bad what they do to the children there.”

A sign for the madrassa is emblazoned with the flag of a Taliban-affiliated group. After persistent knocking, a blind maulvi, Mohammed Nadeem, led by a young student, agrees to speak. He denies that any abuse takes place inside the madrassa.

“BLOOD MONEY”

Victims and their families can choose to “forgive” an assailant because Pakistan’s legal system is a mix of British Common Law and Islamic Shariah law.

A similar legal provision was changed last year to prevent forgiveness of “honor” killings, where victims are murdered because they are thought to have brought shame on their families. Honor killings now carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison, but clerics in sexual abuse cases can still be forgiven.

Sahil, the organization that scours newspapers for cases of sexual assault, offers families legal aid to pursue such cases. Last year, Sahil found 56 cases of sexual assault involving religious clerics. None of the families accepted Sahil’s offer of legal assistance.

In cases that are pursued, convictions do occasionally happen.

In south Punjab, a cleric was convicted of sexually assaulting a minor girl in 2016 and sentenced to 12 years in prison and the equivalent of a $1,500 fine. The same cleric had in the past managed to get several families to settle over sexual abuse cases because of his close links to religious extremist groups, said local officials. This time, a local activist group known as Roshan Pakistan, or Bright Pakistan, persuaded the family of the young girl to resist.

Far more often, the family gives in, as in the case of a 9-year-old girl who was raped by the maulvi of the unregistered madrassa she attended, according to a police report.

Her uncle, Mohammed Azam, points across a field to the madrassa, surrounded by a high wall. The girl started working two years ago, at 7, and her only schooling was in the Quran. She spent the rest of the day sitting cross-legged on a mud floor inside a swelteringly hot room sewing the traditional shalwar kameez.

Last July, a cleric “forcibly took her shalwar off and started molesting her,” according to the police report obtained by the AP. She screamed. Two men heard her screams and stormed into the room, and found the cleric attacking her. Seeing them, the cleric fled, and the men took the bleeding girl home, the report said.

“We would hear that these kinds of things happen, children raped in the madrassas, but you never know until it happens to your family,” says Azam, her uncle.

Yet the family settled the case out of court. He refused to say how much money they got, but neighbors say it was around $800.

“The family took money to not speak about it,” says Rana Mohammed Jamal, an elderly neighbor. He says he believes abuses occurred predominantly in the small madrassas that spring up in poor neighborhoods, “where it is just the mullah and no one can say who he is, and he can do anything.”

Parveen, the mother of the 9-year-old boy who says he was raped by his teacher in Kehrore Pakka, vowed that she would never give in to intimidation. But relatives and neighbors say the family was hounded by religious militants to drop the charges and take money.

In the end, the mother “forgave” the cleric and accepted $300, according to police.

"China has decided to extend its so-called ""toilet revolution"" for three more years with an eye on attracting both domestic and foreign tourists. The government announced on Sunday, 19 November, that it plans to refurbish or set up more than 64,000 public toilets between 2018 and 2020.",http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-extends-its-toilet-revolution-3-more-years-lure-tourists-1647980,"China has decided to extend its so-called ""toilet revolution"" for three more years with an eye on attracting both domestic and foreign tourists. The government announced on Sunday, 19 November, that it plans to refurbish or set up more than 64,000 public toilets between 2018 and 2020.

In 2015, the government launched a three-year plan to improve the conditions of public toilets across the country. Under the scheme, which has been touted as hugely successful, the Beijing administration was able to either install or renovate 68,000 toilets at tourist destinations surpassing the target of 57,000.

""Compared with the rapid growth of the tourism industry and people's increasing demand for better lives, the development [of toilets] is unbalanced and inadequate. Another three-year programme is urgently needed,"" said Li Jinzao, chief of the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA).

Li added that clean public toilets are indispensable to improve the tourism sector. According to the CNTA's action plan, the project aims to ""provide good, clean toilets that are reasonably distributed and effectively managed"", the official Xinhua news agency reports.

Around 47,000 new toilets will be built while more than 17,000 facilities have been earmarked for renovation. The 2015-18 programme amounted to about $3bn, but the cost of the new project is still unclear.

Public toilets are a major source of dissatisfaction in China especially for tourists, who often complain about unsanitary conditions. The Chinese government has been pushing to revitalise the services industries, particularly the tourism sector, as part of its efforts to compensate for the weakening demand for exports.",JustBadNews,0
