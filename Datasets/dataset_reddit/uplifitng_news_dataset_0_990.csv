"Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned. Becomes a lawyer and is now helping overturn other false convictions.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/defendant-defender-one-wrongfully-convicted-man-frees-another-n788886,"Attorney Jarrett Adams recently helped overturn an innocent man's conviction — in the same state that, years ago, had sentenced him to prison for a crime he did not commit.

The case was Adams' first professional win. But it was also deeply personal for the 36-year-old, who spent nearly 10 years behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of sexual assault in a case that Adams, who is black, believes was tainted by racism.

""This is a storybook,"" Adams told NBC News' Lester Holt. ""It's a storybook tale that you wouldn't believe until you saw it ... to have a conviction overturned and in a court, in a state, that I was wrongfully convicted.""

Adams was only 17 when an encounter at a party, an accusation, and a court-appointed attorney put his life on hold.

He had just finished high school on Chicago's South Side and decided to go to the University of Wisconsin for a party, where he and his friends met a young woman and had what he describes as a ""completely consensual encounter from beginning to end.""

Three weeks later, as Adams was getting ready to start junior college in the fall of 1998, he was arrested. An officer informed him that the woman said she was raped, and that he was being charged with a group sexual assault along with two other teenagers.

Adams had never been arrested before. He denied the crime from the start, and thought the misunderstanding would get resolved quickly.

Instead, he was extradited to Wisconsin, where he couldn't afford legal assistance. A court-appointed attorney chose not to put on a defense, even though there was a witness who could have helped clear Adams: a student living in the dorm who could corroborate Adams' timeline of events.

""This guy is telling us, 'We know you didn't do it. They haven't proven their case. The best defense is a no-defense strategy,'"" Adams said. ""We're like, 'Yeah, sounds good,' because we didn't know any better, right? But in reality, it was a horrible idea to not call any witnesses, not to investigate, and to put this in front of an all-white, racially charged jury. We didn't stand a chance.""

The result was a conviction with a stunning 28-year prison sentence for Adams; 20 years for another teen who couldn't pay for representation; and an acquittal for the third, who had hired a private lawyer, and called the alibi witness.

""My only encounter with the criminal court system was 'Law & Order.' And at the end of those commercials, and that theme music comes on, you don't see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to 28 years,"" Adams said.

Inside prison, Adams met a cellmate who worked for the prison law library and encouraged him to try to get his conviction overturned.

""My only encounter with the criminal court system was 'Law & Order.' And at the end of those commercials, and that theme music comes on, you don't see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to 28 years.""

""He said, 'Listen. I go over hundreds of inmates' cases, and all of them say the same thing: I'm innocent.' He said, 'I've never seen a case like yours before. You're in here for some racist bull crap, and you've essentially waved the white flag,'"" Adams said.

The cellmate urged him not to give up: ""It's only going to take a second before you have tattoos on your face and have given up and completely don't care at all. You need to go down swinging,"" he told Adams.

So, Adams started reading law books and found a Supreme Court case that stated that the Constitution required defendants be provided effective assistance of counsel. He got in touch with attorney Keith Findley with the Wisconsin Innocence Project, a state chapter of the nonprofit devoted to justice for wrongfully convicted people.

Findley knew the case was an uphill battle, but he took it on.

""He had done his homework. He knew the case, factually, better than anybody, and he knew the law, so that he was engaging with us, discussing legal issues, strategy,"" Findley said.

Adams' sentence was eventually overturned and the charges dropped, for the exact reason that he had found in the prison law library books: ineffective assistance of counsel.

A month after he was freed in 2007, Adams enrolled in community college, went on to earn his Bachelor's degree and attended law school, graduating in 2015.

Last summer, he became the first Innocence Project exonoree to be hired as an attorney by the organization.

""What I wanted more than anything was this: I wanted my mother, when she went to church and people asked about her son, for her not to duck her head in her Bible and cry. And I wanted her to be proud,"" he said.

Recently, Adams found himself back in a Wisconsin courtroom, this time working side-by-side with his former attorney Findley, to free another man they believed was wrongfully convicted.

Richard Beranek was convicted of rape in 1990. Although he had alibi witnesses that put him in another state at the time of the rape, the jury found the testimony of an FBI expert tying him to the scene through a microscopic hair analysis convincing enough to deliver a guilty verdict.

Adams — who served time in the same correctional facility as his client — was dedicated to freeing him, Findley said.

""I can talk to Richard about what I've seen other exonerees go through, what the experience looks like from the outside, but I couldn't do what Jarrett can do. I couldn't speak with the authenticity of knowing what it feels like, that Jarrett can speak to,"" Findley said.

In June, a Dane County circuit judge overturned Beranek's conviction, citing DNA evidence that proves the FBI hair analysis was wrong. Beranek is now a free man, in large part thanks to Adams' tireless work.

""Nothing pays me back more, or my family, than me walking in the same court, in the same state, where they didn't even look at me when they gave me 28 years,"" Adams said. ""But now they have to acknowledge me as 'Attorney Adams.'"""
First paralyzed human treated with stem cells has now regained his upper body movement.,https://educateinspirechange.org/science-technology/first-paralyzed-human-treated-stem-cells-now-regained-upper-body-movement/,"Imagine losing control of your car and waking up in the hospital paralyzed from the neck down. This is the story of Kristopher Boesen, who experienced a life-changing moment where his car spiraled out of control on a slippy road surface, slamming into a tree and lamp post. Doctors warned Kris’s parents that he might never be able to function from the neck down again.

The Procedure

Kris was offered the opportunity to go through a potentially life-changing procedure involving stem cells, which ‘have the capability to repair injured nervous tissue through replacement of damaged cells‘ (1). The experimental procedure did not guarantee any restoration to Kris’s paralysis, but to him, the risk was worth taking.

The process began in April where Dr. Liu injected 10 million AST-OPC1 cells directly into Kris’ cervical spinal cord. Dr. Liu explains that; “Typically, spinal cord injury patients undergo surgery that stabilizes the spine but does very little to restore motor or sensory function. With this study, we are testing procedure that may improve neurological function, which could mean the difference between being permanently paralyzed and being able to use one’s arms and hands. Restoring that level of function could significantly improve the daily lives of patients with severe spinal injuries.” (2)

The Results

After a mere 3 weeks of therapy, Kris started showing signs of improvement, and within 2 months he could answer the phone, write his name and operate a wheelchair. He had regained significant improvement in his motor functions; which are the transmissions of messages from the brain to muscle groups to create movement (3).

Kris recovered two spinal chord levels which made a huge difference in his movement abilities. It was the difference between minimal movement or none at all and being able to function on his own. Kris regained the incredibly important aspect of independence.

After seeing the results of stem cell therapy, Kris was bowled over, saying; “All I’ve wanted from the beginning was a fighting chance…But if there’s an opportunity for me to walk again, then heck yeah! I want to do anything possible to do that.”

The Future

Although doctors are not able to make any promises that Kris’s condition will further improve, they can keep experimenting with stem cell research to try and improve the likelihood of it working fully on paralysis.

So far, they have made huge steps forward and will hopefully continue to do so in their quest to solve paralysis, by teaming up with ‘associate faculty based in departments across KSOM and the University to study stem cell-driven new medicine‘, Dr. Liu and his team at USC are determined to keep researching stem cells and much more!

Stem cell research is ongoing and can be used in many ways other than paralysis; from Parkinson’s and diabetes to cancer (4). To find the latest news regarding stem cell research check this website out.

Amazon tribe wins legal battle against oil companies. Preventing drilling in Amazon Rainforest,https://www.disclose.tv/amazon-tribe-wins-lawsuit-against-big-oil-saving-millions-of-acres-of-rainforest-367412,"The Amazon Rainforest is well known across the world for being the largest and most dense area of woodland in the world. Spanning across nine countries, the Amazon is home to millions of different animal and plant species, as well as harboring some for the world’s last remaining indigenous groups. The Waorani people of Pastaza are an indigenous tribe from the Ecuadorian Amazon and have lived in the Rainforest for many generations. However, there Home came under threat from a large oil company - they didn’t take it lightly.

Legal Win

After a long legal battle with a number of organizations, the Waorani people successfully protected half a million acres of their ancestral territory in the Amazon rainforest from being mined for oil drilling by huge oil corporations. The auctioning off of Waorani lands to the oil companies was suspended indefinitely by a three-judge panel of the Pastaza Provincial Court. The panel simply trashed the consultation process the Ecuadorian government had undertaken with the tribe in 2012, which rendered the attempt at land purchase null and void.

This win for the indigenous tribe has now set an invaluable legal precedent for other indigenous nations across the Ecuadorian Amazon. After accepting a Waorani bid for court protection to stop an oil bidding process, the court also halted the potential auctioning off of 16 oil blocks that cover over 7 million acres of indigenous territory.

Government Corruption

While there is no evidence, some people believe that the Ecuadorian government may be accepting bribes in some roundabout way. The land in question is meant to be protected under Ecuador’s constitution that establishes the inalienable, unseizable and indivisible rights of indigenous people to maintain possession of their ancestral lands and obtain their free adjudication.

Furthermore, the constitution also states that there is a need for prior consultation on any plans to exploit the underground resources, given the probable environmental and cultural impacts on tribal communities. The government claim they did do this in 2012, however, the tribe alleges that the agreement they came to was based upon fraudulent practices in favor of the oil companies and the government was favoring their bottom line over the people the actually still live on this valuable land. Due to this, the judges ordered the Ecuadorian government to conduct a new consultation, applying standards set by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights before anything else is agreed regarding the exploitation of the natural resources below the ground.

Nemonte Nenquimo, president of the Waorani Pastaza Organization and plaintiff in the lawsuit, remarked:

“The government tried to sell our lands to the oil companies without our permission. Our rainforest is our life. We decide what happens in our lands. We will never sell our rainforest to the oil companies. Today, the courts recognized that the Waorani people, and all indigenous peoples have rights over our territories that must be respected. The government’s interests in oil is not more valuable than our rights, our forests, our lives.”

This is a major win for indigenous tribes all over the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, and even perhaps the Amazon as a whole! This has definitely set a new precedent regarding indigenous peoples’ rights over the land they live in and offers them a glimmer of hope in protecting their cultural heritage. They’ll definitely need plenty of support in the coming years as economical advances, such as this one will keep coming more and more as the world becomes ever growingly desperate for the natural resources that the beautiful land holds."

No children died in traffic accidents in Norway in 2019,https://www.nrk.no/trondelag/ingen-barn-dode-i-trafikken-i-2019-1.14843386,"I 1970 døde det 560 mennesker i den norske trafikken, og direktør Ingrid Dahl Hovland i Statens vegvesen mener det siden den gang har vært en gledelig utvikling.

– Vi er flinke til å sikre våre barn i bil, men jeg skulle ønske vi var like flinke å sikre de voksne. Våre analyser av dødsulykkene viser at 33 prosent av alle som omkom i en bil, ikke har brukt sikkerhetsbelter. Mange av disse ville ha reddet livet om de hadde brukt sikkerhetsbelte, mener Hovland.

Dyster desember

I hele landet omkom 110 personer i trafikken i 2019, og det er to flere enn i 2018. I desember mistet 14 personer livet i trafikken, som er mer enn en dobling fra desember i fjor hvor seks personer omkom.

– Vi er ikke fornøyd med at vi ikke får dødstallene ytterligere ned. Bak hver eneste ulykke er det en tragedie som rammer familie, venner, kolleger og lokalsamfunn, sier Ingrid Dahl Hovland.

Antallet omkomne for de tre siste årene ligger omtrent på samme nivå, og ligger på mellom 106 og 110 omkomne.

– Før desember hadde vi et lite håp om at 2019 kunne bli et år med færrest omkomne i trafikken noensinne. Dessverre ble desember en langt dystrere måned i trafikken enn forventet, og vi er fortsatt langt unna nullvisjonen om at ingen skal omkomme eller bli hardt skadd i trafikken.

– Vi må derfor styrke innsatsen betydelig innen trafikksikkerhetsarbeid i årene som kommer. Det er langt igjen før vi er der vi skal være, mener direktør i Trygg Trafikk, Jan Johansen.

Mange ulykker med tunge kjøretøy

I nesten hver tredje dødsulykke i fjor var tunge kjøretøy involvert. Det betyr at tunge kjøretøy har vært involvert i 36 av dødsulykkene i fjor. Dette er det høyeste antallet de siste fem årene.

Direktør Jan Johansen i Trygg Trafikk er bekymret over alle dødsulykkene hvor tunge kjøretøy er involvert. Foto: Trygg Trafikk

– Det er mange tunge kjøretøy på veiene og dette kommer bare til å øke i tiden framover. Ulykkesanalysene viser at det ofte ikke er sjåføren i det tunge kjøretøyet som har skyld i ulykken, og derfor må vi bilister være ekstra oppmerksomme, sier Johansen.

Flest ulykker i Nordland

16 personer mistet livet i trafikken i Nordland i 2019, og det var verst i hele landet.

– Tallene for Nordland er bekymringsfulle. Nordland har mange smale og svingete veier av dårlig standard og det er det nødvendig med tiltak både når det gjelder infrastruktur for å heve veistandarden, sier Jan Johansen i Trygg Trafikk.

Trafikktall for 2019 Ekspandér faktaboks I hele landet omkom 110 personer i trafikken i 2019, og det er to flere enn i 2018. 16 personer mistet livet i trafikken i Nordland, og det er en kraftig økning fra 2018, da fem personer omkom. Bak følger Akershus (14), Trøndelag (11) og Møre og Romsdal (10). Finnmark, Oslo og Aust-Agder hadde færrest dødsulykker med en drept i hvert av disse fylkene. I 2019 omkom 79 menn og 31 kvinner i den norske trafikken. Det betyr at over 71 prosent av de omkomne var menn. Dødsfall i trafikken øker mest i aldersgruppen 25-44, mens det er størst nedgang i gruppen 45-64 år.



I 2019 var det dobbelt så mange bilpassasjerer som omkom enn året før. Det er likevel fortsatt flest bilførere som dør i trafikken. I fjor var det ingen dødsulykker med moped, og det har ikke skjedd siden 2010.

Statens vegvesen lover fortsatt storsatsing mot trafikkdøden og alvorlig skadde i trafikken.

– Vårt viktigste våpen er kunnskap. Vi analyserer alle dødsulykkene, og denne kunnskapen gjør at vi kan sette inn tiltak som vi vet virker og som har stor effekt. Arbeidet vil fortsette systematisk og langsiktig på bred front med uforminsket styrke, sier vegdirektør Ingrid Dahl Hovland."
"President Trump signs animal cruelty bill into law, making it a federal felony",https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/president-trump-sign-animal-cruelty-bill-law-making/story?id=67295654&__twitter_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR348e_8IT2zp9Ulgl3VTOTA3Zm_AoiuCMI__LssfjfL0B4DloWuTBNsDRo,"President Trump signs animal cruelty bill into law, making it a federal felony The bill passed unanimously in the Senate earlier this month.

Animal cruelty has officially become a federal felony after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law on Monday afternoon.

The bipartisan bill, Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, criminalizes certain acts of animal cruelty. The bill was passed in the Senate by unanimous decision on Nov. 5 after being approved in the House in late October.

""Passing this legislation is a major victory in the effort to stop animal cruelty and make our communities safer,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said earlier this month when the bill, which Toomey sponsored along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., passed in the Senate. ""Evidence shows that the deranged individuals who harm animals often move on to committing acts of violence against people. It is appropriate that the federal government have strong animal cruelty laws and penalties.""

The bill, introduced in the House by Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., is an expansion on the 2010 Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, which made the creation and distribution of ""animal crushing"" videos illegal.

The underlying acts, which were not included in the 2010 bill, are part of the PACT Act.

It will make it a federal crime for ""any person to intentionally engage in animal crushing if the animals or animal crushing is in, substantially affects, or uses a means or facility of, interstate or foreign commerce,"" according to a fact sheet of the bill.

After Senate approval, the bill was sent to the president's desk for signature.

""I’m deeply thankful for all of the advocates who helped us pass this bill, and I look forward to the Senate’s swift passage and the president’s signature,"" Deutch said in a statement when the House first passed the bill on Oct. 22.

The historic law was also praised by the president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, Kitty Block, and the head of the Humane Society Legislative Fund, Sara Amundson.

""PACT makes a statement about American values. Animals are deserving of protection at the highest level,"" Block said in a statement. ""The approval of this measure by the Congress and the president marks a new era in the codification of kindness to animals within federal law. For decades, a national anti-cruelty law was a dream for animal protectionists. Today, it is a reality.""

""After decades of work to protect animals and bearing witness to some of the worst cruelty, it’s so gratifying the Congress and president unanimously agreed that it was time to close the gap in the law and make malicious animal cruelty within federal jurisdiction a felony,"" Amundson said. ""We cannot change the horrors of what animals have endured in the past, but we can crack down on these crimes moving forward. This is a day to celebrate.""

At the age of just 13, Nadia Sparkes, otherwise known as “Trash Girl”, already has enough achievements under her belt to make the average adult envious.

Over the past few years, Nadia’s commitment to litter picking on her cycle to school has made headlines.

Last January we ran a story about her achievements and how children at her local school had bullied her, naming her “Trash Girl”, a title she has since proudly owned.

After the article went viral, the bullying eased off for a few months but then escalated again.

Unfortunately, she felt her school did not support her and she says she was disappointed when the headteacher suggested she give up litter picking to ease off the bullies.

Despite this, Nadia continued to litter pick and has now gained a large following on Instagram and Facebook, with supporters worldwide.

Last year Nadia was honoured as part of our Stars of Norfolk and Waveney Awards, withher prize being that she spent time in the newsroom showing us the importance of recycling and what things to look out for on a litter pick.

During a short trip around Norwich city centre we collected a full tote bag worth of cans, sandwich boxes and bottles.

Alcohol cans seemed to be a main offender in the city centre, with many bottles next to a bin.

Most people do not realise that what is dropped will go down a drain, end up in the river and then wind up on the beaches.

The closer you look the worse it gets.

Nadia, from Hellesdon, has now left her old school and is about to start at Reepham High School, which is renowned for being very eco conscious.

Nadia said she was ‘very excited about the move’ and looked forward to being part of the school and spreading her message.

Her next adventure takes her to London on Friday where she will collect the Points of Light award granted by Prime Minster, Theresa May."
JetBlue caps direct flight ticket prices out of Florida at $99 ahead of Hurricane Irma,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jetblue-caps-ticket-prices-florida-99-ahead-hurricane-irma-173232462.html,"REUTERS/Mike Blake

JetBlue (JBLU) is capping its ticket prices in every city in Florida where the airline operates so people can evacuate as Hurricane Irma barrels through the Caribbean.

JetBlue will charge a maximum of $99 up to the last available seat for direct flights and a maximum of $159 up to the last available seat for connecting flights, a JetBlue representative told Yahoo Finance. That includes government taxes.

The airline has also added flights to its schedule out of select cities where they have aircraft available.

For existing reservations, JetBlue is waiving cancellation fees as well as waiving change fees and differences in air fare for rebooking.

“Given that many Floridians are struggling to get out of harm’s way, this is welcome news,” Florida Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) said in an emailed statement sent by a spokesman. “I hope more airlines do the right thing and follow suit.”

Other airlines followed JetBlue’s lead.

On Wednesday afternoon, American Airlines (AAL) said it would also cap its airfares.

“While there are limited seats remaining before the storm hits, we will cap our pre-tax fares at $99 for MainCabin seats on direct, single leg flights out of Florida for tickets sold through Sunday Sept. 10 for travel until Sept. 13,” a spokeswoman said in a statement to Yahoo Finance.

A spokesman for Delta (DAL) told Yahoo Finance that the airline reduced the price level of its highest fares, which are “typically seen when customers are booking last-minute travel and inventory is limited.”

“In addition, we are waiving change fees for customers who want to change their flight plans due to the forecast. We have full details on the waiver at delta.com,” the Delta spokesman said. “We also are adding flights and increasing the size of the aircraft we’re using on flights to and from San Juan and south Florida, providing more opportunities for customers to leave. New flights are being added to and from San Juan, Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Key West, all to Atlanta (where people can connect to destinations across the U.S.).”

Story continues

Delta is capping fares at $399 on flights out of Florida and the impacted islands. New flights are being added from Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Key West to Atlanta, the spokesman confirmed to Yahoo Finance.

United Airlines (UAL) added six additional flights in Florida with airfare capped at $399. Those additional flights have already sold out, according to a spokesperson.

A number of travelers had complained of steep airfares as they scrambled to book tickets to flee the storm. Some had even noticed prices above $1,000.

Here’s what the fares look like on JetBlue’s website at the time of this article’s publication.

A hacker is breaking into people's routers and patching them so they can't be abused by other hackers.,https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-mysterious-grey-hat-is-patching-peoples-outdated-mikrotik-routers/,"Botnet beast: How to slay the DDoS dragon Watch Now

A Russian-speaking grey-hat hacker is breaking into people's MikroTik routers and patching devices so they can't be abused by cryptojackers, botnet herders, or other cyber-criminals, ZDNet has learned.

The hacker, who goes by the name of Alexey and says he works as a server administrator, claims to have disinfected over 100,000 MikroTik routers already.

Alexey has not been trying to hide his actions and has boasted about his hobby on a Russian blogging platform. He says he accesses routers and makes changes to their settings to prevent further abuse.

""I added firewall rules that blocked access to the router from outside the local network,"" Alexey said. ""In the comments, I wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the @router_os Telegram channel, where it was possible for them to ask questions.""

But despite adjusting firewall settings for over 100,000 users, Alexey says that only 50 users reached out via Telegram. A few said ""thanks,"" but most were outraged.

The vigilante server administrator says he's been only fixing routers that have not been patched by their owners against a MikroTik vulnerability that came to light in late April.

At the time, the vulnerability (known as CVE-2018-14847) was a zero-day, but MikroTik rolled out a fix in record time. Nonetheless, cyber-criminals quickly jumped on board to exploit the flaw.

CVE-2018-14847 is a very convenient vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and download the user database file. Attackers decrypt this file and then use one of the username & password combos to log into a remote device and make OS settings and run various scripts.

For the past five and a half months, the vulnerability has been mainly used to plant cryptojacking scripts on outdated MikroTik routers [1, 2] and to hijack DNS servers and later redirect user traffic towards malicious sites [1, 2].

This wouldn't be an issue, but MikroTik is one of today's most popular router brand. There are over two million MikroTik routers around the globe.

Security researcher Troy Mursch told ZDNet today that of the millions of MikroTik routers currently connected to the Internet, over 420,000 show signs they've been infected with cryptocurrency-mining scripts.

Speaking to ZDNet today, Ankit Anubhav, a security researcher for NewSky Security, has also indicated that DDoS botnet authors have also been trying to infect and corral these devices under their control, but failing.

""The usual IoT blackhat botnet factory is basically clueless about the exploit, and how it can be deployed for a proper functioning botnet,"" Anubhav said.

Instead, he says the people placing cryptocurrency-mining scripts on the devices are far more adept at hijacking the vulnerable routers. Anubhav speculated that this looks to be the ""work of a knowledgeable lone actor.""

Things became even worse for the MikroTik community this past week after Tenable researchers released a new exploit named ""By The Way"" for the original CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability. This spurred new interest from the botnet community.

But the reason why Alexey was able to ""clean"" over 100,000 routers is because none of the hacker groups currently abusing MikroTik routers appear to perform basic hygiene.

""The attackers are not closing [device ports] or patching the devices, so anyone who wants to further mess with these routers, can,"" Anubhav told ZDNet.

Fortunately, Alexey has been doing this clean-up on some users's behalf. But technically speaking, Alexey is on the wrong side of the law. Despite his good intentions, it is illegal to access another person or organization's equipment without consent.

Alexey's vigilante spree may be illegal, but he is definitely not the first.

In 2014, a hacker accessed thousands of ASUS routers and planted text warnings inside computers with shared folders and hard drives that were located behind those routers, warning users to patch their ASUS device.

In late 2015, a team of vigilante hackers going by the name of the White Team launched the Linux.Wifatch malware that closed security holes on a variety of Linux-based routers. At one point, the White Team's botnet became so big it battled with the botnet of the infamous Lizard Squad team for the title of the Internet's largest botnet.

In 2017, a more devious vigilante hacker named The Janit0r deployed the BrickerBot malware that erased firmware or bricked IoT devices that had not been updated.

Also in 2017, a hacker made over 150,000 printers spew out a message to their owners to raise everyone's awareness about the danger of leaving printers exposed online.

In 2018, another vigilante renamed tens of thousands of MikroTik and Ubiquiti routers to ""HACKED"" and other messages to get owners' attention to update their devices.

Mursch told ZDNet that he doesn't believe the MikroTik situation will get better any time soon.

""Rebooting grandma's router won't fix this,"" he said. ""Remediation efforts must be done by the service providers.""

The reason is that many of these devices are not routers placed inside users' homes, but are so-called ""edge"" devices, often part of an ISP's internal infrastructure, such as routers placed in ISP boxes left inside apartment complexes or on street poles.

Another source in the infosec community who spoke to ZDNet but did not want his name shared for this story confirmed that Alexey's vigilante efforts have also touched edge routers, not only those found in people's homes.

""Ironically, by cleaning some ISP routers he might get the ISPs to act and fix everyone's routers as well,"" the unnamed researcher told us.

As for MikroTik, the Latvian company has been one of the most responsive vendors in terms of security flaws, fixing issues within hours or days, compared to the months that some other router vendors tend to take. It would be unfair to blame this situation on them. Patches have been available for months, but, yet again, it is ISPs and home users who are failing to take advantage of them.

High School Student Nicknamed ‘Trash Girl’ by Bullies Refuses to Stop Collecting Litter,http://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/trash-girl-refuses-stop-collecting-litter/,"Many people may not want to think about our plastic pollution problem, but it’s imperative that we do. Every year, we produce 300 million tons of plastic and around 8.8 million tons of it get dumped in the oceans, threatening countless animals, many of which are on the verge of extinction as a result. If that wasn’t bad enough, it’s now estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

As one of the greatest threats to our oceans and the animals that we share the planet with, we need to rethink every single aspect of how much waste we produce and how we deal with it. That’s why 12-year-old Nadia Sparkes decided to take matters into her own hands. The high schooler has been picking up trash along the two-mile route from her school to her home for months now, using the basket of her bike to bring the trash home. In just the short amount of time that she has been picking up trash, Nadia has already accumulated more than two recycling bins worth of plastic.

Despite her green intentions, some of the kids at Nadia’s school have dubbed her “Trash Girl” and have bullied her for her noble efforts to help the planet. It would be easy to succumb to mean comments and stop picking up trash, but on the contrary, Nadia is more determined than ever to clean up her community.

“I’m doing something to protect the world they also live in. It’s everyone’s job. We are all responsible for keeping this world safe, instead of believing that it’s always someone else’s job,” Nadia said about the bullies.

“I told her she had two choices, she could either stop collecting rubbish, stop drawing their attention and hopefully they would leave her alone. Or she could own “trash girl,” Paula Sparkes, Nadia’s mom, said about the bullies.

As a result of the media attention Nadia has received, she now has created a Facebook group aptly named “Team Trash Girl” where she shares updates on her efforts. Positive comments have poured in, all in support of Nadia, advocating for her to ignore the negative. “Nadia, I think you’re truly awesome! Own that nickname and don’t give up. The bullies are ignorant and should be ashamed. I wish more people were just like you,” Emma Whitmore said.

Local artists have also shown their support by creating original artwork that boldly says “Team Trash Girl.”

If you’d like to stay up to date on Nadia’s work to rid her community of trash, you can join the “Team Trash Girl” Facebook group. At a time when our plastic pollution has become a full-blown environmental crisis, Nadia’s efforts are important now more than ever. We need more people like Nadia to proudly stand up for what they believe in!

What You Can Do!

A staggering 1 trillion plastic bags are used each year worldwide, according to the Earth Policy Institute. Plastic bags are made out of non-renewable resources like petroleum and natural gas, and because they take hundreds of years to decompose, when plastics do eventually degrade, they don’t biodegrade. Instead, they photodegrade, which means they break down into smaller fragments and easily soak up toxins, which then contaminate waterways, soil, and animals upon digestion of the plastic materials.

If we all make an effort to identify where we use plastic and actively look for alternatives, we can drastically cut down on the amount of plastic pollution that finds its way into the oceans. Achieving a 100 percent waste-free lifestyle is challenging, but it is certainly not impossible. Just take a look at Lauren Singer, the 25-year-old who can store all the waste she’s produced in the past few years in just a single mason jar!

As the leading organization at the forefront of the conscious consumerism movement, One Green Planet believes that reducing everyday plastics from our lives is not about giving up anything or sacrificing convenience, but rather learning to reap the maximum benefits from the items you use every day while having minimal impact.

"Colorado governor to mass-pardon 2,700-plus marijuana convictions",https://www.denverpost.com/2020/10/01/colorado-marijuana-convictions-pardons-governor-polis/,"Colorado Gov. Jared Polis plans to mass-pardon 2,732 convictions of low-level marijuana possession through an executive order Thursday after signing a bill earlier this year that gave him that authority.

“This really catches Coloradans up with where the law is today,” he told The Denver Post.

House Bill 1424, passed by the General Assembly earlier this year, included a provision that allows the governor to pardon those who have convictions on their criminal records for possessing up to 2 ounces of marijuana — the current legal limit for medical marijuana users.

Polis’ pardon, however, will only apply to convictions in state courts through 2012 of up to 1 ounce for recreational use, consistent with Colorado Amendment 64, passed by voters in 2012.

It will not apply to convictions in municipal courts or in other states.

The governor said his office worked with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to sort through criminal histories and determine the exact number of eligible convictions. The total number of individuals who will benefit from the pardon was not immediately available because a single person could have been convicted on more than one charge.

Unlike programs in Denver and Boulder to expunge marijuana convictions, those eligible for the pardon will not have to apply. In the first six months of Denver’s program, fewer than 1% of the 13,000 people eligible successfully got their convictions erased.

Other states have taken action to address previous low-level convictions after marijuana legalization. Nevada, for instance, automatically pardoned more than 15,000, and California has adopted an automatic expungement process for certain marijuana convictions.

Minor marijuana offenses could stand in the way of people obtaining jobs, student loans or concealed-carry permits, Polis said.

“In addition to being symbolic, (the pardon) has real-life ramifications for people,” he said.

Anyone who wants to check if Polis’ pardon will apply to them can go to comarijuanapardons.com.

The pardon won’t expunge or seal records related to the convictions, according to the governor’s office. But the convictions will be removed from individuals’ public records, so if a member of the public runs a background check, a conviction won’t show up. It would still appear in law enforcement background checks but with a note about the governor’s pardon.

That’s the next goal for Rep. James Coleman, a Denver Democrat and one of the sponsors of House Bill 1424.

“Whether it’s one or a thousand (people), my focus is to figure out by the time I’m done in the legislature how we not only pardon these individuals but figure out how to expunge it off their records,” Coleman said.

He plans to look at more policies in the 2021 legislative session to address equity and opportunities for people to work in the cannabis industry."
Finland to offer new fathers as much paid leave as mothers,https://in.reuters.com/article/finland-politics/finland-to-offer-new-fathers-as-much-paid-leave-as-mothers-idINKBN1ZZ1NK,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland’s woman-led centre-left government plans to give new fathers the same amount of paid time off work as new mothers, nearly doubling paternity leave, it announced on Wednesday.

Finland's Minister of Social Affairs and Health Aino-Kaisa Pekonen holds a news conference on the family leave reform in Helsinki, Finland February 5, 2020. Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen via REUTERS

Paid paternity leave will be extended to nearly seven months, in line with maternity leave. Around half can be given to the other parent. Pregnant women are also entitled to a month of pregnancy leave before the expected date of birth.

Minister of Health and Social Affairs Aino-Kaisa Pekonen said the aim of the “radical reform” was both to improve gender equality and to boost a declining birth rate.

“This enables better equality between parents and diversity among families,” she said.

The number of newborns in Finland fell by around a fifth between 2010 and 2018, to just 47,577 babies in a country of around 5.5 million people. Pekonen said other countries such as Sweden and Iceland had seen increases in their birth rates after offering more leave for fathers.

Finland’s coalition of five parties, all led by women of whom four are under 35 years old, took office in December and has made gender equality a priority.

Speaking at the 50th annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos last month, Prime Minister Sanna Marin called for states and companies to do more to ensure women were treated fairly, saying gender equality “doesn’t happen by itself”.

A previous centre-right Finnish government attempted to reform parental leave in 2018 but eventually rejected the idea as too costly.

Pekonen said a more equal distribution of domestic workload between parents has been proven to diminish the risk of divorce.

“Over a longer term, it also improves equality in working life and in wages by directing fathers to use a larger proportion of parental leaves than before,” she said."
Aldi introduces wages higher than the ‘real living wage’ after supermarket has record year,https://inews.co.uk/news/consumer/aldi-wages-higher-living-wage-profit-increase-results/,"Aldi introduces wages higher than the ‘real living wage’ after supermarket has record year The German discounter said it hopes to create 2,500 more jobs in 2019

Aldi has increased its hourly rates of pay for staff after breaking the £12bn sales barrier for the first time.

Last year Aldi reported record earnings in the UK and Ireland against a increasingly fragile retail sector. It also enjoyed a strong Christmas.

The German discounter has again touted itself as the UK’s best-paying supermarket after it increased wages for all employees.

The company said all store assistants will from February earn £9.10 per hour outside the M25, and £10.55 in London. Interestingly, Aldi said all workers are paid the same flat rate, however old they are.

Employees previously earned £8.85 per hour and £10.20 per hour respectively.

Real living wage

Regionally, Aldi’s pay exceeds the UK’s “real living wage”, which is encouraged by the Living Wage Foundation and is more than the Government’s statutory boundaries. Many feel the Government’s rates are too low.

In London, the supermarket’s new £10.55 wage matches the charity’s voluntary minimum. Aldi also told i that store managers start on £44,890, which is almost £20,000 more than a junior doctor’s starting salary, and more than double that of a police officer beginning their career.

While Aldi’s rates of pay are notable, it’s worth pointing out that the company employs fewer members of staff per store than traditional supermarkets like Sainsbury’s and Waitrose. Aldi has around 40 members of staff in each shop, while rivals require far more – usually more than double.

The budget chain is able to make do with fewer workers thanks to its more efficient operating system – shelves don’t need stacking because food products are put up still in boxes, for example, and checkouts run quicker as customers bag their own groceries. There are numerous other cost-saving mechanisms.

Tesco launched its discount spin-off Jack’s based on a similar model touting speed and simplicity. Jack’s also functions with fewer team members than classic Tesco branches. Staff pay at Jack’s is £9 per hour – 10p less than Aldi.

New store plans

Aldi’s pay rise comes as high street stores continue to struggle. At Waitrose, staff – or “partners” as they are known – are given a yearly bonus in addition to their wages, but this year they may not get one for the first time since 1953.



Giles Hurley, CEO for Aldi UK, said: “Our store colleagues do a fantastic job every day and the excellent service they provide to customers is a key reason why we are the UK’s fastest-growing supermarket.

“We’re committed to being the best supermarket employer in Britain and this means rewarding our colleagues for the excellent job they do with market-leading rates of pay and opportunities to progress their career at Aldi.”

Aldi now has more than 800 stores across the UK and plans to open a further 65 in 2019. The company said it will be creating around 2,500 new jobs in the process.

The German chain wants to have 1,200 branches in the UK by the end of 2025. Morrisons and co. must be worried."
Farmer spends 16 years studying law by himself so he could sue a powerful chemical firm for 'polluting his land' - and he wins the first round,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-4189350/Farmer-spends-16-years-studying-law-sue-firm.html,"Wang Enlin, who has just three years of education, has won the first instance of a high-profile case in China

A Chinese farmer has spent 16 years studying law by himself so he could sue a chemical company for allegedly polluting his land.

Wang Enlin, who had just three years of education, has won the first instance in a high-profile case against state-owned Qihua Group, reported the People's Daily Online.

Although Qihua Group, whose assets exceed two billion yuan (£233 million), has appealed against the decision, the elderly man said he is determined to seek justice for himself and his neighbours who could no longer grow healthy crops on their contaminated land.

Mr Wang, who is in his 60s, lives in the Yushutun village on the outskirts of Qiqihar in the Heilongjiang Province, according to People's Daily Online, which cited China Youth Daily.

The man said he would forever remember the year of 2001 when his land was flooded by the toxic waste discharged by Qihua Group.

It was the eve of the Lunar New Year, and Mr Wang was playing cards and making dumplings with his neighbours. All of sudden, they realised that the house they were in was flooded by the wastewater from the nearby Qihua factory.

The wastewater also flooded part of the farmland in the village.

According to the report, a government document from 2001 claimed that the affected farmland 'can not be used for a long time' due to the pollution.

Between 2001 to 2016, it has been suggested that Qihua continued to dump hazardous waste into the village, whose residents rely upon agriculture for a living.

The company produced polyvinyl chloride and released 15,000 to 20,000 tons of chemical waste every year, the report said.

Qihua has also reportedly created a 71-acre wasteland with calcium carbide residue and a 478-acre pond with its liquid waste.

A picture released by People's Daily Online shows that the Qihua Group has dumped 71 acres of calcium carbide residue in the village of Yushutun, where Mr Wang lives

In 2001, Mr Wang wrote a letter to the Land Resources Bureau of Qiqihar to complain about the pollution Qihua had brought to his village.

He said while dealing with the local officials, he was repeatedly asked to produce evidence to prove that the village's land had been polluted.

Mr Wang told a reporter: 'I knew I was in the right, but I did not know what law the other party had broken or whether or not there was evidence.' He received the interview in his small home which he spent 50 yuan (£5.8) per month renting from the village's authority.

As a result, Mr Wang decided to study law by himself, an endeavour he would carry on pursuing for the next 16 years.

The farmer, who had dropped out of primary school at the third grade, started reading through a dozen law books with the help of a dictionary.

At the time, he did not have money to buy the books, so he spent day after day reading the books at the local book store and copying the relevant information by hand, according to the man. In return, he would give bags of free corn to the shopkeeper for letting him stay there.

Not only that, he also used the legal knowledge he had learnt to help his neighbours gather evidence. Their farms had also been polluted by Qihua Group, said Mr Wang.

Mr Wang, who is in his 60s, lives in the Yushutun village on the outskirts of Qiqihar (pictured)

In 2007, a Chinese law firm specialised in handling pollution-related cases started providing free legal advice to Mr Wang and his neighbours. They also agreed to help the villagers file petition to the court.

However due to unspecified complications, the court only began processing Mr Wang and his neighbours' case in 2015 - eight years after the original petition had been made, People's Daily Online reported.

Thanks to the evidence Mr Wang had gathered in the 16 years, Mr Wang and his neighbours apparently won the first instance.

The Angangxi District Court of Qiqihar ruled that the families in Yushutun village would receive financial compensation from Qihua Group amounting 820,000 yuan (£96,000). The date of the first instance was not revealed in the report.

Qihua Group has appealed against the court's decision. The case is being processed at the Angangxi District Court as of writing.

A determined Mr Wang told the reporter: 'We will certainly win. Even if we lose, we will continue to battle.'"
Ghanaian teacher who Taught his Students How to use mS word on a blackboard gets computers donated to his school,https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/03/15/africa/ghanaian-ict-teacher-donations-intl/index.html,"(CNN) With just a blackboard and a talent for drawing, a Ghanaian teacher has explained in detail to his students the secrets of Microsoft Word, earning numerous headlines and worldwide admiration.

Now Richard Appiah Akoto, who gained fame last month for teaching computer technology without computers at Betenase M/A Junior High School in the southern Ghana town of Sekyedumase, is starting to appreciate the fruits of his unexpected media attention.

People and organizations are donating desktop computers and laptops to his school. And, as part of Microsoft's promise to offer him free training, Akoto was flown to Singapore to attend the annual Microsoft Educators Exchange.

Anthony Salcito, vice president of worldwide education for Microsoft, meets with Richard Appiah Akoto.

The tech giant had pledged to equip Akoto with a device from a business partner as well as access to the Microsoft Certified Educator Program (MCE) for professional development.

'Knowledge is crucial'

After reading the Facebook post that made Akoto famous, a Saudi benefactor at University of Leeds in the UK sent him a laptop ""as a small gift to his students.""

""I always understand from the teachings of Islam that useful knowledge is crucial for the benefit of the self and humanity,"" Amirah Alharthi, a PhD student in Leeds' department of statistics, told CNN.

""Also, I am thinking of how much genius people the world has already lost because these people did not have the fair opportunities comparing to others and that makes me very sad.""

Betenase M/A Junior High School hasn't had a computer since 2011, and Akoto's students need to pass a national exam that includes questions on information and communication technology (ICT).

The written exam is a requisite for 14- and 15-year-olds in Ghana to progress to high school.

Five desktops and a laptop

But Alharthi's gift wasn't the only one.

Inspired by the teacher's story, NIIT Ghana, a computer training school based in Accra, donated five desktop computers to the school, along with books and a laptop for Akoto.

NIIT's center manager, Ashish Kumar, told CNN he saw the teacher's photos going viral on Facebook and CNN as well as other media organizations.

""We were so touched by the teacher's dedication for his students that we decided to support the school with the best we can do,"" he said. ""We took (a) printout of the news, pasted on our notice board and shared it with our CEO, Kapil Gupta.""

The company's senior management, including business head Yaw Amoateng and senior manager Sanjeev Mishra, traveled to Sekyedumase to present the equipment to the class.

Akoto offered his thanks this week on Facebook. ""God bless you all,"" he said."
Pentagon issues de facto ban on Confederate flag at military bases,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-usa-pentagon/pentagon-issues-de-facto-ban-on-confederate-flag-at-military-bases-idUSKCN24I23K,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Mark Esper has issued a policy ushering in a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag at U.S. military installations around the world by authorizing only certain flags that promote unity, according to a copy of his memo, seen by Reuters on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley are seen during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on 'Department of Defense Authorities and Roles Related to Civilian Law Enforcement' in Washington, DC, U.S. July 9, 2020.

The decision could increase tension between Esper and Republican President Donald Trump, who has cited free speech rights in his defense of Americans who fly the Confederate flag.

“The flags we fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols,” Esper said in the memo.

The Confederate flag was flown by breakaway Southern states that advocated for the continuation of slavery and lost the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War. Flying the flag can be offensive to many Americans, who see it as a reminder of the enslavement of Black Americans and as a symbol of white supremacy.

Supporters say the flag represents the South’s heritage and culture and, along with U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals and statues honoring them, serve as memorials to Confederate casualties in the Civil War.

Trump, who has been accused of intentionally stoking racial tensions as part of his re-election campaign, has criticized the desecration and removal of statues of Confederate and other former U.S. leaders to energize his political base

Trump has also publicly opposed renaming U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals, such as Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Bragg in North Carolina, putting him at odds with his military, whose top general has said the matter should be re-examined.

A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the White House was aware of Esper’s memo.

Esper also clashed with Trump last month by publicly opposing the deployment of active-duty troops to address civil unrest across the country following the May 25 killing of George Floyd, an African American, by a white police officer in Minneapolis.

Beyond the American flag, Esper’s memorandum cites a series of flags that can be flown on military installations, including state flags and ones to honor prisoners of war and service members who went missing in action.

The reason it does not cite the Confederate flag explicitly was to ensure that it could withstand challenges, the defense official said.

“The decision to not name a specific prohibited flag was to ensure the department-wide policy would be apolitical and withstand potential free speech political challenges,” the official said.

Most U.S. military services, including the Marine Corps, have already banned the display of Confederate flags, but Esper’s memorandum is department-wide and will affect military installations around the world."
Mom with 'gut feeling' stops school shooter before planned attack,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/mom-gut-feeling-stops-school-shooter-planned-attack-231253510.html,"A suspicious mom who followed her instincts helped prevent a mass school shooting.

On Wednesday, Koeberle Bull of Lumberton, N.J., woke up to a racist message on Facebook from a man in Kentucky. “It was really vulgar — he called my kids the N-word and hoped terrible things for them,” Bull tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The mom of three biracial children, ages 16, 11, and 8, was especially concerned about the man’s profile picture in which he showed off a gun, so, going on a “gut feeling,” she called her local police station and filed a report. “But I felt like it wouldn’t really go anywhere, so I posted a screenshot of the message on Facebook,” she says.

The man had blocked Bull. However, her friends dug around for details about his identity, and Bull soon had enough information to share with the police in Lawrenceburg, Ky. “I spoke to Officer Josh Satterly, who told me, ‘There’s no room for this kind of hate in my world,” she says. “He took me seriously.”

Local and state police followed the mom’s tip, and on Thursday, officers drove to the home of a 20-year-old man named Dylan Jarrell, just as he was leaving his house with more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, a firearm, a 100-round high-capacity magazine, and a “detailed plan of attack.” He was headed toward two school districts in Anderson County and Shelby County, the Kentucky State Police said in a press conference Friday.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that as a result of this investigation, we saved lives,” Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders said during the press conference. “This young man had it in his mind to go to schools and create havoc.

“He had the tools necessary, the intent necessary. And the only thing that stood between him and evil … is law enforcement,” he added.

When police searched Jarrell’s home, they found an internet search history on “How to conduct a school shooting” and a “credible and imminent threat to Shelby and Anderson County schools,” according to a press release. Police also revealed that in May, Jarrell had been questioned by the FBI regarding social media threats toward a Tennessee school.

Story continues

Jarrell was charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications and is being held in the Shelby County Detention Center.

Sheila Mitchell of Anderson County Public Schools tells Yahoo Lifestyle that classes were closed on Friday due to concern for student safety. “I commend [Bull] for her courage and willingness to follow through on the threat and the collaborative efforts of local and state law enforcement. We’re very blessed and grateful.”

Bull has received grateful invitations to visit families from all over the country and says the timing of the arrest was “divine intervention.”

She also encourages people to report social media messages of concern. “That one-in-a-million call could prevent a tragedy,” Bull tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “I’m thankful everyone is OK.”

"The Greek Neo-Nazi party, which was in the parliament from ~2012 to ~2019, is now declared a criminal organization",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/07/golden-dawn-leader-and-ex-mps-found-guilty-in-landmark-trial,"A court verdict in Athens with ramifications for the far right across Europe has been met with jubilation in Greece and internationally after judges ruled the neo-fascist Golden Dawn was a criminal organisation in disguise.

Tens of thousands of people who had converged near the heavily guarded court complex in Athens in anticipation of the judgment roared in excitement as the news emerged. Many broke into spontaneous applause and punched the air as it became clear that the three-member tribunal had found the far-right group guilty of operating a gang of hit squads bent on eliminating perceived enemies.

“It’s official. Golden Dawn is over. The conviction is overwhelming,” said Petros Constantinou, a leading anti-racism activist. “The mood here today is resonant of the celebrations we saw with the liberation of Athens from the Nazis. It’s a great day.”

Wrapping up a trial that began in April 2015, the presiding judge, Maria Lepenioti, said the court had concluded that seven of Golden Dawn’s 18 former MPs, including the party founder, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, had led the deadly organisation. The rest were found culpable of participating in the gang.

Play Video 0:40 Greek court's ruling on Golden Dawn party met with jubilation – video

The verdict was met with widespread relief. Magda Fyssa, whose son Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, was stabbed to death by a senior party operative, and who attended almost every court session over the past five and half years, screamed with emotion. “Pavlos did it! My son,” she wailed outside the courtroom.

The Greek president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, said the judgment was an important day for democracy and evidence that Greek institutions were able to “fend off any attempt to undermine them.”

Before the verdict, the public prosecutor overseeing the case recommended the acquittal of many key party members in relation to the criminal organisation charge, citing lack of evidence – a recommendation that was roundly denounced by critics, who accused the magistrate of typifying the toxic influence wielded by conservatives over the justice system.

The hearing was the biggest trial of fascists since the prosecution of the Nazis at Nuremberg after the second world war.

Two thousand police officers, many brought in as backup from the countryside amid fears of violent clashes between the protesters and far-right supporters, surrounded the area near the court as helicopters and drones flew overhead. Clashes did break out as rocks and molotov cocktails were hurled at police, who responded with teargas and water cannon. The violence was attributed to a minority of anti-establishment forces.

The leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who was in the crowd, said that after years of sowing hate, poisoning Greek society and orchestrating murderous attacks, Golden Dawn fanatics would finally face justice.

“They are not innocent. We all know that,” he wrote on social media before the three-member tribunal’s decision. “On Wednesday we ought to be there to shout it loud and clear. We owe it to the history of this country, we owe it to democracy, we owe it to our children.”

Those charged with directing the criminal organisation face sentences of up to 15 years in prison. If found guilty of additional crimes, the sentences handed down by the criminal court are likely to be longer, although justice officials said it may take several days of legal proceedings before they are formally announced.

The accused vigorously denied the charges, claiming they were victims of political persecution. Michaloliakos, 62, a Holocaust denier and ardent admirer of Hitler whose neofascist beliefs began to take form during Greece’s 1967-74 military dictatorship, has described Golden Dawn as a patriotic party of ultra-nationalists. Diehards lower down the chain who have been linked to violent attacks have been disavowed by the leader.

Golden Dawn stood broadly accused of targeting immigrants, communist trade unionists, anti-fascists, leftists and gay people, culminating in the fatal stabbing of Fyssas, whose murder in September 2013 forced Greek authorities to act. A senior operative in the party, Giorgos Roupakios, confessed to killing the rapper.

Judges sitting in the court of appeals focused on specific cases including whether the group was culpable of the attempted murder of Abouzid Embarak and three other Egyptian fishermen in June 2012.

Golden Dawn members have already been found guilty of the killing of a Pakistani fruit worker, Ssazad Lukman, in Athens in January 2013.

The court examined evidence that ranged from the testimonies of victims and five former Golden Dawn members now in witness protection programmes to incriminating videos snatched from the homes of party leaders, and heard that the attacks increased in frequency after the party’s entry into the Greek parliament in 2012.

At the height of Greece’s debilitating debt crisis, Golden Dawn, riding a tidal wave of popular anger with EU-mandated austerity measures, won 21 seats in the 300-member house to become the country’s third biggest political force.

In the last general election, in July last year, the neo-Nazis narrowly failed to win enough votes to win any seats in parliament, and the party has all but collapsed amid infighting and defections since then.

“The accusations against the leaders and members of Golden Dawn, including the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, expose a fissure that exists not just within Greece but across Europe and beyond,” said Nils Muižnieks, the Europe director of Amnesty. “The impact of this verdict, in what is an emblematic trial of an extreme far-right party with an aggressive anti-migrant and anti-human rights stance, will be felt far beyond Greece’s borders.”

The central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (Kise) said the “historic verdict ... delegitimises the neo-Nazi organisations and at the same time fortifies democracy in the country”.

But it said this was no time “to let our guard down”. A Jewish cemetery in Athens was vandalised in an attack attributed to the extremists on Monday and its walls daubed with slogans used by the Third Reich.

Greece suffered appallingly under Nazi occupation, with almost all of its Jewish community sent to the gas chambers."

"Pakistan begins colossal tree planting campaign - a staggering 10 billion trees will be planted starting now in order to combat climate change using 60,000 workers who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/pakistan-virus-idled-workers-hired-plant-trees-200429070109237.html,"Officials say move will create more than 60,000 jobs as gov’t aims to help those who lost jobs due to COVID-19 lockdown.

When construction worker Abdul Rahman lost his job to Pakistan’s coronavirus lockdown, his choices looked stark – resort to begging on the streets or let his family go hungry.

But the government has now given him a better option: Join tens of thousands of other out-of-work labourers in planting billions of trees across the country to deal with climate change threats.

Since Pakistan locked down on March 23 to try to stem the spread of COVID-19, unemployed day labourers have been given new jobs as “jungle workers”, planting saplings as part of the country’s 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.

Such “green stimulus” efforts are an example of how funds that aim to help families and keep the economy running during pandemic shutdowns could also help nations prepare for the next big threat: climate change.

“Due to coronavirus, all the cities have shut down and there is no work. Most of us daily wagers couldn’t earn a living,” Rahman, a resident of Rawalpindi district in Punjab province, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

He now makes 500 rupees ($3) a day planting trees – about half of what he might have made on a good day, but enough to get by.

“All of us now have a way of earning daily wages again to feed our families,” he said.

The ambitious five-year tree-planting programme, which Prime Minister Imran Khan launched in 2018, aims to counter rising temperatures, flooding, droughts and other extreme weather conditions in the country that scientists link to climate change.

Big risks

The Global Climate Risk Index 2020, issued by think-tank Germanwatch, ranked Pakistan fifth on a list of countries most affected by planetary heating over the last 20 years – even though the South Asian nation contributes only a fraction of global greenhouse gases.

As the coronavirus pandemic struck Pakistan, the 10 Billion Trees campaign was initially halted as part of social distancing orders put in place to slow the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 14,880 people in Pakistan, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

But earlier this month, the prime minister granted an exemption to allow the forestry agency to restart the programme and create more than 63,600 jobs, according to government officials.

A recent assessment by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics found that, due to the lockdown, up to 19 million people could be laid off, almost 70 perfect of them in the Punjab province.

Abdul Muqeet Khan, chief conservator of forests for Rawalpindi district, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the planting project is in “full swing”.

Much of the work is happening on 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) of land near the capital Islamabad, he said, as well as on other tracts of state-owned forest land around the country.

This year, the programme is employing triple the number of workers it did in its first year, said Malik Amin Aslam, climate change adviser to the prime minister.

Many of the new jobs are being created in rural areas, he said, with a focus on hiring women and unemployed daily workers – mainly young people – who were migrating home from locked-down cities.

The work, which pays between 500-800 rupees ($3-5) a day, includes setting up nurseries, planting saplings, and serving as forest protection guards or forest firefighters, he said.

All the workers have been told to wear masks and maintain the mandated two metres (six feet) of social distance between them, he added.

“This tragic crisis provided an opportunity and we grabbed it,” Aslam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.

“Nurturing nature has come to the economic rescue of thousands of people.”

Extended help

According to Germanwatch, Pakistan reported more than 150 extreme weather events between 1999 and 2018 – from floods to heatwaves – with total losses of $3.8bn.

Environmentalists have long pushed reforestation as a way to help, saying forests help prevent flooding, stabilise rainfall, provide cool spaces, absorb heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions and protect biodiversity.

According to green group WWF, Pakistan is a “forest poor” country where trees cover less than 6 percent of the total area.

With 7.5 billion rupees ($46m) in funding, the 10 Billion Trees project aims to scale up the success of an earlier Billion Tree Tsunami in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the government has been planting trees since 2014.

200414082202927

About 30 million Indigenous saplings have been planted in Punjab since the start of the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami – including mulberry, acacia and moringa – said Shahid Rashid Awan, project director for Punjab province.

This year, the project hopes to hit 50 million trees, he said.

Planting season usually ends in May, Awan noted, but programme organisers plan to extend the initiative to the end of June, to keep workers employed for longer.

“We can absorb all the unemployed labourers and workers who have fled the cities and returned to their villages in the past few weeks. This is unskilled work,” he said.

Recovering with dignity

Rab Nawaz, of WWF-Pakistan, said the government’s move is “a very good idea to create green jobs and get people employed”.

But he cautioned that planting trees is just one tool in the fight against climate change, saying there also needed to be an investment in improving the ability of farmers and city dwellers to adapt to the effects of a hotter planet.

“The government should be very selective on how it spends money, and focus on resilience,” he urged.

For Aslam, the green jobs initiative is a way to help Pakistan’s workers recover from the coronavirus crisis “with dignity and avoiding handouts”.

“This has taught us the valuable lesson that when you invest in nature it not only pays you back, but also rescues you in a stressed economic situation,” he said."

Trader Joe's is planning to pay bonuses to store employees amid an ""unprecedented increase"" in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to an internal company memo.

The memo, which was reviewed by Business Insider, said the grocer is planning to set up a ""special bonus pool"" for each store based on the recent sales increases.

Each store's bonus pool will be divided equally among store employees based on their hours worked during the sales period, according to the memo.

""We want to acknowledge the incredible hard work and dedication of our Crew Members in supporting each other and our communities by sharing the financial benefit of this sales increase with our store crew who have worked so hard during the past several weeks, and for as long as this challenge remains,"" the memo said.

The memo was sent Monday, one day after a petition started circulating online demanding that Trader Joe's give workers hazard pay and guaranteed wages in case of store closures. Hazard pay is extra compensation for employees exposed to dangerous conditions. The petition asks for a hazard-pay rate of time-and-a-half.

""Trader Joe's workers — from the distribution warehouses to the stores — need hazard pay now,"" says the petition, which had more than 10,000 signatures as of Tuesday. ""We are exposing ourselves (and our loved ones) to COVID-19. We aren't being paid for the extra work we're doing or the risk we're undertaking. We're being told we can't wear gloves.

Blood types are differentiated by the kinds of sugar found on the surface of red blood cells. Type O has no sugars. Scientists had realized that some enzymes can remove the sugars from A, B and AB blood cells, turning them into Type O, but they hadn’t found an enzyme that was safe, efficient and economical, until they considered the gut.

The human digestive tract has the same sugars found on blood cells, and bacterial enzymes found in feces strip the sugars from the lining to aid digestion. The scientists were able to isolate the enzyme and use it to strip blood of its sugars in a more efficient way than any other enzyme.

The scientists made the exciting discovery last August, but have just published the results of their research in the journal Nature Microbiology.

"The Bishop of Paris, in tears, has told the French press that After fear of their destruction, all 3 irreplaceable Rose Windows, considered the greatest medieval artwork still in existence, have survived. They took years to build in the 13th century.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6926807/Devastating-aftermath-Notre-Dame-inferno-leaves-world-mourning.html,"Advertisement

The treasures that survived the devastating Notre Dame inferno have been revealed - with the great organ and several priceless paintings rumoured been destroyed.

Franck Riester, France's culture minister, said on Tuesday that the cathedral's main organ 'seems to be quite affected' by the blaze while the fate of several other artefacts remains unknown.

Firefighters reported that some of the large paintings inside the cathedral were too heavy to take down from the walls and save.

Mr Riester said the paintings were mostly undamaged but many may have suffered some effects from the smoke.

'The large paintings, at first glance, have not been affected by the fire. But, often in these situations, there is water damage,' Mr. Riester added.

It comes as it was reported officials attending the Notre Dame blaze initially couldn't find any sign of fire despite the alarm being raised 23 minutes before the structure went up in flames.

Paris public prosecutor Rémy Heitz announced on Tuesday that firefighters were called to the world-famous cathedral at 6.20pm CET, almost half an hour before the roof caught fire after a fire alarm was triggered.

But after an initial inspection they said they were unable to find any evidence of fire.

Firefighters remained inside Notre Dame until a second alarm went off at 6.43pm and eventually discovered a fire in the network of wooden beams under the cathedral's roof - but were unable to put it out.

Mr Heitz said this evening: 'What we know at this stage is that there was an initial alarm at 6:20 p.m., followed by a procedure to verify this but no fire as found.

'Then, there was a second alarm at 6:43 p.m. and at that point a fire was detected in the structure.

'The investigation is going to be long and complex,' he added. 'We are in the process of interviewing witnesses.'

After eventually responding to the blaze, French firefighters were filmed racing into the burning Notre Dame to save the 850-year-old cathedral from destruction.

The fearless rescue team charged into the inferno with huge flames leaping across the church and sparks tumbling from the ceiling after the roof of the Paris landmark caught fire.

Firefighters battled for eight hours to contain the blaze which destroyed the cathedral's roof and spire, but despite fears that the whole building could collapse the stone structure and iconic bell towers remain standing today.

The firefighters' actions - and their quick deployment of a robot to hose down the cathedral - meant that priceless treasures including reputed relics of the Crucifixion and 13th-century stained-glass windows were saved from the blaze.

Today haunting new photos of Notre Dame's interior showed debris strewn across the floor - as experts warned the damage could take decades to repair - while detectives probe the renovation work which may have led to the blaze.

The pictures revealed that a statue of Jesus descending from the cross, positioned on the altar, was preserved among the smouldering rubble after the roof was destroyed by Monday night's fire.

The three 'irreplaceable' Rose Windows, which date to the 13th century and were last night feared to have melted or exploded, were also intact.

Attention has now turned to what may have caused Notre Dame, part of which was being restored in a €150million refurbishment, to fall victim to such a disaster.

The focus of prosecutors is currently on contractors Le Bras Freres, whose owner Julien Le Bras last year boasted his firm's goal was 'to keep as many old items as possible and not to put the building at risk' after they were awarded a €5.7m (£5m, $6.5m) contract as part of the cathedral's restoration project.

Detectives investigating the catastrophic blaze are today interviewing specialist restorers who were carrying out works on the cathedral spire when the inferno broke out.

French police are understood to have launched a criminal inquiry after a 'stray flame' caused fire to engulf the landmark last night, with heroic firefighters battling for eight hours to bring the blaze under control.

The Paris prosecutor's office is probing 'involuntary destruction caused by fire', indicating authorities are treating the blaze as a tragic accident and not arson or terrorism.

'Nothing suggests that it was a voluntary act,' Remy Heitz told reporters outside the Gothic cathedral, adding that the workers employed at the site were being questioned over Monday's blaze.

Fears for the treasures of Notre Dame: Christ's 'crown of thorns' is saved, but fragment of the Cross and nails 'used to crucify Jesus' unaccounted for The fate of many of the Notre Dame's treasures is still unknown after the huge fire which ripped through the 850-year-old cathedral on Monday. Experts are today entering the wreckage of the Paris landmark to find which of the precious artworks and religious relics have been saved. The mayor of Paris said that one of the most irreplaceable items - the crown of thorns reputed to have been worn by Jesus at his crucifixion - was safe last night. But there are fears for the church's 13th-century stained glass windows and its magnificent organ, while the wooden roof and ornate spire have gone. Safe: Crown of thorns One of the cathedral's most precious objects, a relic purported to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ on the cross, was whisked away to a secure facility. Reports in France stated that the chaplain of the Paris fire brigade had gone inside with the firefighters to save the crown. Experts said the irreplaceable item had been kept in a 'very safe place'. Records of the Crown of Thorns existence begin in the sixth century AD, when it is believed to have been kept in Jerusalem by Christians. During the Crusades in 1238, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople gave it to King Louis IX to win his support and try and preserve his crumbling empire. Louis IX brought the crown back to France and was later made a saint. Although the crown itself was saved, a small fragment of the crown had been kept in the spire and is therefore believed to have burned to ashes. Unknown: True Cross and Holy Nails Another of the cathedral's relics is a purported piece of the True Cross - the very instrument on which Jesus was crucified in the first century AD. The collection also includes a nail which is said to be from the cross. It was unclear on Tuesday morning whether these had been saved along with the Crown of Thorns. Safe: Tunic of St Louis A 13th-century linen tunic which is thought to have belonged to King Louis IX - canonised as St Louis - was also made safe, the mayor of Paris said. In his 44-year reign Louis took part in the Crusades and established early principles of justice such as the presumption of innocence. He was proclaimed a saint in 1297 - the only French monarch to receive the honour - and was responsible for acquiring the Crown of Thorns. Safe: North, West and South Rose Windows The magnificent stained-glass artworks in the cathedral date back to the 13th century. There were fears last night that they would melt or explode but the Archbishop of Paris told BFM-TV today that they were safe. A French journalist at the scene last night said the north window appeared to be safe with no sign of broken glass although firefighters remained concerned. Architecture professor Julio Bermudez said the stained glass windows were 'really irreplaceable'. Advertisement

Some of the firm's 200 specialist employees were working at the site where the fire is thought to have originated, the cathedral's 300ft-tall wooden and lead spire, which collapsed in front of crowds of horrified Parisians at 8pm.

A source close to the inquiry said that many of the restorers had been interviewed overnight, with prosecutors focusing on the equipment used at the 850-year-old cathedral, where light and power sources were limited.

In such circumstances, hordes of cables and wires would have to be attached to dozens of generators, which would then be hoisted high up on to medieval building.

'The fear is that a small fire began in the rood where they were working,' the source added.

'The irony is that the restorers had just begun working on the spire which collapsed along with much of the roof.'

Le Bras Freres is one of the most respected companies of its kind in France, and last year finished a widespread restoration programme of Reims Cathedral in the east of the country.

The firm had won the €5.7million contract to restore the Notre Dame spire, which was designed by the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and erected in 1859.

They were due to be on site for up to four years along with Europe Scaffolding, another company which had just put 250 tons of scaffolding around Notre Dame, along with a lift that could move up and down the 300ft spire.

The blaze, which broke out as the last crowds of tourists ended visits at around 7pm, was finally declared to be 'fully extinguished' at about 9.45am this morning.

As the fire raged, brave rescue teams raced to recover what treasures they could from the Gothic masterpiece, which housed priceless artefacts and relics of huge religious and international significance.

Among them was the reputed Crown of Thorns, supposedly worn by Jesus during his crucifixion, which was carried to safety by a human chain of emergency service workers.

Today the Archbishop of Paris told BFM-TV that the three beautiful rose windows on the north, west and south sides of the church had all survived intact.

Fears had grown for the 'really irreplaceable' stained-glass windows, dating back to the 13th century, amid the heat of the fire last night.

The status of other relics, including a purported piece of the Cross on which Jesus was crucified, remained unclear today.

French priest Jean-Marc Fournier led the efforts to save the Crown of Thorns.

Etienne Loraillere, an editor for France's KTO Catholic television network, said Father Fournier 'went with the firefighters into Notre Dame Cathedral to save the Crown of Thorns and the Blessed Sacrament'.

This was confirmed by an emergency services source who said: 'Father Fournier is an absolute hero.

'He showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the Cathedral, and made sure they were saved. He deals with life and death every day, and shows no fear.'

More than 400 firemen were needed to tame the inferno that consumed the roof and collapsed the spire of the eight-centuries-old cathedral. They worked through the night to bring the fire under control some 14 hours after it began.

France's richest man Bernard Arnault pledges €200MILLION to repair Notre Dame - doubling the €100million donated by Salma Hayek's billionaire husband France's richest man has pledged €200m (£170m) towards the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, doubling the donation of Salma Hayek's husband. Multi-billionaire Bernard Arnault, head of the LVMH luxury goods group, instantly became the biggest benefactor of an appeal launched by President Emmanuel Macron. On Monday – the day of the blaze – French tycoon Francois-Henri Pinault, who is married to Hollywood actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100 million euros (£86.2 million) towards the rebuilding of the Cathedral. But, in a statement, the LVMH group said their donation would be double that. It said: 'The Arnault family and the LVMH group, in solidarity with this national tragedy, are associated with the reconstruction of this extraordinary cathedral, symbol of France, its heritage and its unity. A statement from Francois-Henri Pinault said: 'This tragedy impacts all French people' and 'everyone wants to restore life as quickly as possible to this jewel of our heritage.' Advertisement

One firefighter was injured; no one else was reported hurt in the blaze which began after the building was closed to the public for the evening.

Shortly after the the blaze broke out, French fashion mogul Francois-Henri Pinault, the husband of Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100million euros (£86 million) towards the restoration effort.

Hours later, French billionaire Bernard Arnault announced that his family and his LVMH luxury goods group would donate 200million euros to help with repairs.

French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild the cathedral, whatever the cost.

He said in a speech outside the church: 'We will appeal to the greatest talents and we will rebuild Notre-Dame because that's what the French are waiting for, because that's what our history deserves, because it's our deepest destiny.'

Pope Francis said Tuesday he hoped everyone would pull together to rebuild the devastated Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris following a massive fire.

'I hope the Notre-Dame cathedral may once again become, thanks to reconstruction work and the mobilization of all, a jewel in the heart of the city,' Francis said in a statement issued by the Vatican.

Leaders from around the world offered their condolences to France. Among them was Queen Elizabeth II, who said: 'Prince Philip and I have been deeply saddened to see the images of the fire which has engulfed Notre-Dame Cathedral.

'I extend my sincere admiration to the emergency services who have risked their lives to try to save this important national monument.

'My thoughts and prayers are with those who worship at the Cathedral and all of France at this difficult time.'

Notre Dame had previously the site of a terror scare in 2016 when a car carrying seven gas cylinders was found near the cathedral.

Three women were arrested over the alleged terror plot, although they were thought to have been targeting a Paris railway station rather than the cathedral itself.

Police have made clear today that they believe Monday night's fire was an accident.

'The fire is fully extinguished,' fire service spokesman Gabriel Plus told reporters. 'Our job today is to monitor the structure and its movements.'

The hero who saved the Crown of Thorns: Fire brigade chaplain entered flaming Notre Dame to recover holy relic - three years after he bravely helped Bataclan terror victims Father Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, saved the Blessed Sacrament and the Crown of Thorns from the blazing Notre Dame cathedral A French priest who helped comfort the wounded after the Bataclan terror attack today also emerged as a hero of the Notre Dame fire. Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, saved the Blessed Sacrament and the Crown of Thorns from the blazing cathedral on Monday night. It was feared that both religious artefacts would be lost as flames engulfed the medieval building, but Father Fournier made sure they were taken to safety. Etienne Loraillere, an editor for France's KTO Catholic television network, said Father Fournier 'went with the firefighters into Notre Dame Cathedral to save the Crown of Thorns and the Blessed Sacrament'.

Hundreds of stunned onlookers had lined the banks of the Seine river late into the night as the fire raged, reciting prayers and singing liturgical music in harmony as they stood in vigil.

'It's a symbol of our country that risked being destroyed,' Culture Minister Franck Riester said.

Notre-Dame is owned by the state and has been at the centre of a years-long row between the nation and the Paris archdiocese over who should bear the brunt of costs for badly needed restoration work.

Paolo Violini, a restoration specialist for Vatican museums, said the pace at which the fire spread through the cathedral had been stunning.

'We are used to thinking about them as eternal simply because they have been there for centuries, or a thousand years, but the reality is they are very fragile,' Violini said.

American tourist Susan Hargrove said she'd been left breathless by the scale of devastation.

'We are talking of world history, of our Western culture but also of something that is truly universal,' Hargrove said. 'Notre-Dame means something to everybody.'

Firefighters also struggled to take down many of the large paintings in the cathedral, administrative cleric Monsignor Patrick Chauvet said, meaning the scale of the devastation will not be known for some time.

A French cultural heritage expert this morning claimed that France no longer has trees big enough to replace ancient wooden beams that fell during the blaze.

But at the height of the inferno, many feared the entire building would be lost.

'If Paris is the Eiffel Tower then France is Notre Dame. It's the entire culture, entire history of France incarnated in this monument,' Bernard Lecomte, a writer and specialist in religious history told French TV.

In Washington, Donald Trump tweeted: 'So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.'

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby sent the best wishes of the Anglican church to people at the scene. 'Tonight we pray for the firefighters tackling the tragic Notre Dame fire - and for everyone in France and beyond who watches and weeps for this beautiful, sacred place where millions have met with Jesus Christ,' he said.

And British Prime Minister Theresa May added: 'My thoughts are with the people of France tonight and with the emergency services who are fighting the terrible blaze.'

There was an air of mourning in Paris as the sun rose on Tuesday with hundreds of people gathering on the banks of the Seine to view the devastation at Notre Dame.

An elderly woman wondered whether the fire was a sign from god, saying: 'Notre Dame is our soul. The soul of France.

'We are a Catholic country, a republic but a Catholic country nonetheless - nobody remembers that any more.'

She said she had heard the statue of the Virgin Mary had been saved, adding that it could be a miracle.

Another woman said: 'I think it can be rebuilt, but it could take years and years - I am 79 and today, I don't know if I will ever see Notre Dame whole again.'

As the sun rose over the building, ashes from the cathedral's spire blew across the banks of the river, along with the blossom from Notre Dame's gardens.

Miraculously, the trees and vines around the building on Ile de la Cite were barely singed, while the bell towers and the enormous circular window of the nave appeared to be intact.

Despite the fierce heat that consumed Notre Dame's spire, scaffolding previously erected for restoration work was also still standing.

One refuse working collecting litter on the banks of the Seine said: 'It's incredible (the scaffolding) didn't fall.'

Daniel Etieve, 70, said: 'It's a very sad picture. For over 800 years this cathedral has been passed from generation to generation.

Firefighters douse flames billowing from the roof as they try to stop the flames spreading. Nobody has been injured, junior interior minister Laurent Nunez said at the scene, adding: 'It's too early to determine the causes of the fire'

'Now I question what state we will pass it on to the generations after us.'

One man, who gave his name only as Fabrice, said he was grieving for the incredible timber beams and wooden carvings that characterised Notre Dame's vaulted ceiling.

The 55-year-old art historian said: 'The ceiling was known as 'the forest' because of all the thousands of trees that were cut to build it. I feel very sad but also I am happy that most of the building is still here.'

He added that Notre Dame has been built over many centuries and that he took comfort in the way the British had repaired Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992.

'But it's hard to believe that this is happening in Paris - part of ourselves has been destroyed,' he said.

'I always go for a walk in this area every day and come to see Notre Dame. It's like coming to visit an elderly parent.'

One commuter said: 'I come often to Notre Dame for mass and to pray and (the damage) is tearing at my heart.'

But he added: 'Luckily it was saved. It was not completely destroyed and, as the president said, we will have money to rebuild it and I hope it will be even more beautiful.'

Accountant Martin Cassan, 32, was hopeful for the future. He had come down to the scene with friends to watch the cathedral burn on Monday evening.

He said: 'There's nothing you can do but have a drink. You feel sad. You definitely feel sad.'

French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted shortly after the fire broke out that he was sad to see 'a part of us burn' and sent his sympathies to people across France

But he asked: 'Should it be (rebuilt) exactly the same as before? Will it be like the Louvre - will we have a pyramid in the middle of it?'

Another onlooker, who gave his name only as Clement, said: 'As sad as it is, it reminds us that buildings are just temporary, just as we are.'

During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the cathedral was vandalised in widespread anti-Catholic violence. Its spire was dismantled, its treasures plundered and its large statues at the grand entrance doors destroyed.

It would go on to feature as a central character in a Victor Hugo novel published in 1831, 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' and shortly afterwards a restoration project lasting two decades got under way, led by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.

The building survived the devastation of two global conflicts in the 20th century and famously rang its bells on August 24, 1944, the day of the Liberation of Paris from German occupation at the end of the World War II.

Before yesterday's blaze it was in the midst of renovations, with some sections under scaffolding, and bronze statues had been removed last week for works.

Its 330ft-long roof, of which a large section was consumed in the first hour of the blaze, was one of the oldest such structures in Paris.

Parisians took to the city's streets last night to pray, sing and reminisce about Notre Dame cathedral as it burned before them

The emotions became too much for some locals who gathered in the shadow of the cathedral to watch its slow destruction

I walked through the gutted cathedral… then the crucifix shone from what remained of the altar, a symbol of defiance in the gloom: ROBERT HARDMAN is among first witnesses inside ravaged Notre Dame

Sparks and bits of flaming woodwork are still cascading from the remnants of the 12th-century roof.

The smell instantly sears the back of your throat like a dose of smelling salts and my feet are soaked. The ancient black and white tiles leading up the aisle are under a gently-flowing river of hose water from the fire crews pumping what seems like much of the River Seine from their elevated platforms.

Yet I can faithfully report that the Cathedral of Notre Dame is not entirely destroyed. Because I am standing inside it – alongside the French prime minister.

In the early hours of this morning, I was among the first people to be allowed inside the ruins of one of the world's finest cathedrals following the fire which has shocked not just the entire French nation but much of the planet.

A blaze which begin in the cathedral's loft at 6.30pm had turned into an all-consuming catastrophe by nightfall. Officials reported that the wooden interior of the medieval cathedral had been almost completely destroyed.

Certainly, Notre Dame's spire is no more. Great chunks of its eastern end are no more. Its world-famous stained glass windows are in smithereens and the whole edifice is open to the skies.

Robert Hardman was given access to the charred remains of the Notre Dame cathedral in the early hours of Tuesday morning

Smoke is seen around the alter inside Notre Dame cathedral on Monday evening. Miracolously the cross and altar have managed to survive the inferno

But Paris will wake today to see that the cathedral that has defied world wars, enemy occupations, revolutions and mobs galore is still poking its head above the Paris skyline.

And at 1am today, at the far end of the cathedral, illuminated by lingering embers and firefighters' equipment, I could just make out a stunning symbol of defiance through the gloom: the unmistakeable sight of a crucifix on what remains of the altar.

Notre Dame is gravely damaged. Yet its most spectacular features – the 850-year-old twin towers – are still there. For centuries, these were the highest structures in Paris until the Eiffel Tower came along. To this day, they are instantly recognisable the world over. And last night, though looking very sorry for themselves, they were in one piece as I stood beneath them alongside a posse of fire crews and prime ministerial aides.

Within hours, speculation was rife as to the cause of the fire. For now, it seems that it was what one official called a 'stray flame' – linked to a £5 million restoration project – which sparked the inferno.

Experts have warned for years that the cathedral has been in a poor condition, with the French state reluctant to fund renovation work in recent decades.

Experts said that the building needed a £129.5million (€150million) restoration, but the state had only offered €40million.

Pictures taken outside the cathedral and from the entrance hall in the early hours of Tuesday show emergency service personnel still working to make the site safe

The cathedral was seeking private donations to make up the rest.

The flames were first spotted just minutes after the building had closed to the public for the day. Echoing the fears of his entire country, French president Emmanuel Macron instantly declared a national emergency. 'Our Lady of Paris in flames,' he declared on Twitter. 'Like all our countrymen, I'm sad tonight to see this part of us burn.'

He has pledged to rebuild Notre Dame, saying: 'Notre Dame is our history, our imagination, where we've lived all our great moments, and is the epicentre of our lives.

'It's the story of our books, our paintings. It's the cathedral for all French people, even if they have never been. But it is burning and I know this sadness will be felt by all of our citizens.

'Tomorrow a national subscription will be launched for people around the country to help rebuild this great Notre Dame. Because that's what the French people want. That is what their history requires. Because that is our destiny.'

Questions were immediately asked about the way in which a fire could take such a rapid hold of one of the world's most visited – and most beloved – landmarks.

The firefighting response was also questioned as few, if any, high-pressure water hoses were able to reach the roof in the first hour. Critically, the Paris prosecutor has already opened an enquiry.

I arrived last night to find a dumbstruck City of Light still bathed in a dismal afterglow. Here, on the banks of the Seine, tens of thousands of people – of all nationalities – stared incredulously at the slow death of a part of France's soul.

The fire spread rapidly across the roof-line of the cathedral leaving one of the spires and another section of the roof engulfed in flames

To describe the cathedral of Notre Dame as a national monument is a grave understatement. Imagine Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London all going up in smoke at the same time and you begin to appreciate the magnitude of this loss, except that Notre Dame attracts – or used to attract – twice as many annual visitors as those three London landmarks put together.

That is why, as news began to spread last night, Parisians flocked to the Seine. They came here not as voyeurs but as mourners. They came to pay their last respects. Some sang hymns. Many were in tears. Some brought flowers and cards to place they knew not where. Understandably, perhaps, no one saw fit to light a candle.

From medieval times, Notre Dame has marked the epochs in the story of this proud country and inspired one of the most famous literary masterpieces in the French language, The Hunchback of Notre Dame. This August marks the 75th anniversary of the day that General Charles De Gaulle marked the liberation of Paris within its walls, even as sporadic gunfire continued outside.

This is a city which was famously spared the destruction which history has wreaked on so many other European capitals. It really did feel blessed; almost eternal. Not any more. Those twin towers are now blackened and wide open to the elements. By midnight, however, the flames had died down as the first glimmers of firemen's torches could be seen here and there in the remains.

I joined what I can only describe as a requiem mass of Parisians chanting prayers on the Pont de Notre Dame. All approaches to the cathedral's island site had been sealed off to the public but crowds kept on coming from all directions for a glimpse.

'At least the two towers are still standing, and they must stay up so that Notre Dame can be reborn,' said civil servant Pascal Boichut, 52. There was a glimmer of hope when Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet told reporters: 'We consider that the main structure of Notre Dame has been preserved.'

In a statement the CEO of the Kering group, which owns Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion houses, said the money towards 'the effort necessary to completely rebuild Notre Dame' would be paid by the Pinault family's investment firm Artemis.

Macron had earlier cancelled a major televised policy speech he was due to give on Monday evening to respond to months of protests, and instead headed to the scene in person.

He said while the 'worst had been avoided' and the facade and two towers saved, 'the next hours will be difficult'.

Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet said 'we can consider that the main structure of Notre Dame has been saved and preserved' as well as the two towers.

A visibly emotional Macron, spoke outside the gothic cathedral and said a national fundraising campaign to restore Notre Dame would be launched Tuesday, as he called on the world's 'greatest talents' to help. He said: 'We will appeal to the greatest talents and we will rebuild Notre Dame because that's what the French are waiting for, because that's what our history deserves, because it's our deepest destiny.'

Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, also present at the scene on Monday evening, said that for the first time 'the fire had decreased in intensity' while still urging 'extreme caution'. The Vatican on Monday expressed its 'incredulity' and 'sadness', expressing 'our closeness with French Catholics and with the Parisian population.' The cause of the blaze was not immediately confirmed. The cathedral had been undergoing intense restoration work which the fire service said could be linked to the blaze. French prosecutors said it was being treated as an 'involuntary' fire, indicating that foul play was ruled out for now. Advertisement

Parisians applaud the firefighters who formed a human chain to save Notre Dame's priceless collection of art and relics – including the Crown Of Thorns from Jesus' crucifixion

Firefighters, police, and churchmen risked their lives last night to carry priceless historical artefacts and religious relics away from the flames which engulfed Notre Dame de Paris.

The Mayor of Paris tweeted her thanks to first responders for forming 'a formidable human chain' to save irreplaceable objects including the relic believed by Catholics to be the crown of thorns which was put on Jesus' head as he died on the cross.

Mayor Anne Hidalgo went on: 'The Crown of Thorns, the tunic of Saint Louis and several other major works are now in a safe place.'

Emergency responders worked with city staff to manhandle priceless relics away from the fire

Reliquaries, statues, and artefacts including the crown of thorns were saved from the fire by 'human chain'

And Father Fournier, Chaplain of the Paris Firefighters, told reporters he went into the burning cathedral to save the Blessed Sacrament and Crown of Thorns.

Parisians applauded and cheered fire crews as they drove through the streets in the early hours of the morning.

The church's treasure trove of priceless artworks and religious relics include the Crown of Thorns said to have been placed on the head of Jesus before he was crucified, a piece of the True Cross on which he is said to have died and a nail from the crucifixion.

The relics were obtained from the Byzantine Empire in 1238 and brought to Paris by King Louis IX.

Notre Dame is also home to priceless paintings dating back to the 1600s, including a series known as the Petits Mays, gifted to the cathedral once a year from 1630 to 1707.

Among the most celebrated artworks are three stained-glass rose windows high up on the west, north and south faces of the cathedral.

Shortly after midnight, Paris time, the artefacts had been safely transferred to a storage room

Notre Dame's Great Organ, which dates back to the 13th century and was restored in the early 1990s, is considered the most famous in the world, with five keyboards and nearly 8,000 pipes.

Last night firemen at the scene said all efforts were being directed at saving artwork in the cathedral and preventing the collapse of its northern tower.

'Everything is collapsing,' a police officer near the scene said as the cathedral continued to burn.

The ten bells of Notre Dame are renowned across Europe and the first nine are named Marie, Gabriel, Anne-Genevieve, Denis, Marcel, Etienne, Benoit-Joseph, Maurice, and Jean-Marie.

The final and largest, known as the bourdon bell Emmanuel, weighs more than 13 tonnes. It sits in the southern tower and has been a part of the building since 1681.

In 1944, Emmanuel was rung in celebration and triumph by French troops and allies to announce to the city that it was on its way to liberation.

The famous gargoyles and chimera that adorn Notre Dame were built in the 19th century by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. The original purpose of the gargoyles was to assist with the building's drainage, but they have become one of its most-loved features.

In the 1790s, Notre Dame was desecrated during the French Revolution when much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed and its treasures plundered.

The 28 statues of biblical kings located at the west facade, mistaken for statues of French kings, were beheaded.

All of the other large statues on the facade, with the exception of that of the Virgin Mary on the portal of the cloister, were destroyed.

The cathedral was restored over 25 years after the publication of the book The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo in 1831 brought it into the spotlight.

Sixteen statues that were part of the cathedral's destroyed spire were safe and unscathed after being removed as part of a renovation a few days ago, and that the relics had also been saved.

The green-grey statues, representing the 12 apostles and four evangelists, were apparently lowered by cranes from the site and taken away.

The cathedral also has a spectacular series of carved wooden stalls and statues representing the Passion of the Christ.

Our Lady of Paris: The 850-year-old cathedral that survived being sacked in the Revolution to become Europe's most-visited historical monument Intrigued by tales of Quasimodo, fascinated by the gargoyles, or on a pilgrimage to see the Crown of Thorns said to have rested on Jesus' head on the Cross, more than 13 million people each year flock to see Europe's most popular historic monument. The 12th century Catholic cathedral is a masterpiece of French Gothic design, with a cavernous vaulted ceiling and some of the largest rose windows on the continent. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Paris and its 69m-tall towers were the tallest structures in Paris until the completion of the Eiffel Tower in 1889. It survived a partial sacking by 16th century zealots and the destruction of many of its treasures during the atheist French Revolution but remains one of the greatest churches in the world and was the scene of Emperor Napoleon's coronation in 1804. A view of the middle-age stained glass rosace on the southern side of the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral The foundation stone was laid in front of Pope Alexander III in 1163, with building work on the initial structure completed in 1260. The roof of the nave was constructed with a new technology: the rib vault. The roof of the nave was supported by crossed ribs which divided each vault into compartments, and the use of four-part rather than six-part rib vaults meant the roofs were stronger and could be higher. After the original structure was completed in the mid 13th century - following the consecration of the High altar in 1182 - flying buttresses had been invented, and were added to spread the weight of the mighty vault. The original spire was constructed in the 13th century, probably between 1220 and 1230. It was battered, weakened and bent by the wind over five centuries, and finally was removed in 1786. During a 19th century restoration, following desecration during the Revolution, it was recreated with a new version of oak covered with lead. The entire spire weighed 750 tons. At the summit of the spire were held three relics; a tiny piece of the Crown of Thorns, located in the treasury of the Cathedral; and relics of Denis and Saint Genevieve, patron saints of Paris. They were placed there in 1935 by the Archibishop Verdier, to protect the congregation from lightning or other harm. The Crown of Thorns was one of the great relics of medieval Christianity. It was acquired by Louis IX, king of France, in Constantinople in AD 1239 for the price of 135,000 livres - nearly half the annual expenditure of France. The elaborate reliquary in which just one of the thorns is housed sits in the Cathedral having been moved from the Saint-Chappelle church in Paris. The thorn is mounted on a large sapphire in the centre. The crown itself is also held in the cathedral, and is usually on view to the public on Good Friday - which comes at the end of this week. Notre-Dame de Paris is home to the relic accepted by Catholics the world over cathedral. The holy crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ during the Passion During the 1790s with the country in the grip of atheist Revolution the cathedral was desecrated and much of its religious iconography destroyed. It was rededicated to the Cult of Reason and 28 statues of biblical kings - wrongly believed to by French monarchs - were beheaded. Even the great bells were nearly melted down. Napoleon returned the cathedral to the Catholic Church and was crowned Emperor there in 1804, but by the middle of the 19th century much of the iconic building. It wasn't until the publication of Victor Hugo's novel - The Hunchback of Notre Dame - in 1831 that public interest in the building resurfaced and repair works began. A major restoration project was launched in 1845 and took 25 years to be completed. Architects Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Lassus and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc won the commission. By 1944 the cathedral was to be damaged again and during the liberation of Paris, stray bullets caused minor damage to the medieval stained glass. This would be updated with modern designs. In 1963 France's Culture Minister, André Malraux, ordered the cleaning of the facade of the cathedral, where 800 years worth of soot and grime were removed. Notre Dame has a crypt, called the Crypte archéologique de l'île de la Cité, where old architectural ruins are stored. They span from the times of the earliest settlement in Paris to present day. The cathedral has 10 bells, the heaviest bell - known as the boudon and weighing 13 tonnes - is called Emmanuel and has been rung to mark many historical events throughout time. At the end of the First and Second World Wars the bell was rung to mark the end of the conflicts. It is also rung to signify poignant events such as French heads of state dying or following horrific events such as the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001. The three stained glass rose windows are the most famous features of the cathedral. They were created in the Gothic style between 1225 and 1270. While most of the original glass is long gone, some remains in the south rose which dates back to the last quarter of the 12th century. The rest of the windows were restored in the 18th century. The south rose is made up of 94 medallions which are arranged in four concentric circles. They portray scenes from the life of Christ and those who knew him - with the inner circle showing the 12 apostles in it 12 medallions. During the French Revolution rioters set fire to the residence of the archbishop, which was around the side of the cathedral, and the south rose was damaged. One of the cathedral's first organs was built in 1403 by Friedrich Schambantz but was replaced in the 18th century before being remade using the pipe work from former instruments. The Cathedral is also home to a Catholic relic said to be a single thorn from the crown of thorns worn by Jesus on the cross. Advertisement

'It's burning to the ground': Trump tweets about massive fire as Notre Dame goes up in flames and suggests use of airborne water tankers – then questions the renovation work at the iconic cathedral

President Donald Trump tweeted about the massive fire engulfing Notre Dame Monday, suggesting the use of flying water tankers to douse the flames – then appeared to criticize renovation work that may have caused it.

Trump tweeted from aboard Air Force One en route to Minnesota, while viewers around the world were watching the iconic cathedral's in flames.

'So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!' Trump wrote while en route to Minnesota for an event about taxes.

Later, at his Tax Day event, Trump told a crowd about the 'terrible, terrible fire.'

'The fire that they're having at the Notre Dame Cathedral is something like few people have witnessed,' the president said.

The president suggested the use of airborne tankers

'When we left the plane, it was burning at a level that you rarely see a fire burn. It's one of the great treasures of the world,' Trump continued.

'It's one of the great treasures in the world. The greatest artists in the world. Probably if you think about it … it might be greater almost than any museum in the world and it's burning very badly. Looks like It's burning to the ground,' the president added, as firefighters struggled to contain the blaze.

Trump said he had a 'communication' with France but did not specify if he spoke to French authorities.

'That puts a damper on what we're about to say to be honest,' Trump told his audience in Minnesota. 'Because that is beyond countries. That's beyond anything. That's a part of our growing up it's a part of our culture, it's a part of our lives. That's a truly great cathedral. And I've been there and I've seen it … There's probably no cathedral in the world like it,' Trump said.

'They think it was caused by renovation. And I hope that's the reason,' Trump continued. Renovation. What's that all about?' Trump said. Then he called it a 'terrible sight to behold.'

'With that being said, I want to tell you that a lot of progress has been made by our country in the last two and a half years, ' Trump said, segueing into his tax event. 'Hard to believe we're already starting to think about our next election.'

Great buildings ravaged by fire: From Windsor Castle to York Minster The Windsor Castle fire of November 1992 A fire broke out at Windsor Castle on November 20, 1992, which caused extensive damage to the royal residence. The Berkshire blaze started at 11am in Queen Victoria's Private Chapel after a faulty spotlight ignited a curtain next to the altar. Within minutes the blaze had spread to St George's Hall next door, and the fire would go on to destroy 115 rooms, including nine State Rooms. Three hours after the blaze was first spotted 225 firemen from seven counties were battling the fire, using 36 pumps to discharge 1.5million gallons of water at the inferno's peak. The fire break at the other end of St George's Hall remained unbreached, so the Royal Library was fortunately left undamaged. A fire broke out at Windsor Castle on November 20, 1992, which caused extensive damage to the royal residence Staff worked to remove works of art from the Royal Collection from the path of the fire. According to the Royal Collection Trust: 'The Castle's Quadrangle was full of some of the finest examples of French 18th-century furniture, paintings by Van Dyck, Rubens and Gainsborough, Sèvres porcelain and other treasures of the Collection. 'Amazingly, only two works of art were lost in the fire - a rosewood sideboard and a very large painting by Sir William Beechey that couldn't be taken down from the wall in time. Luckily works of art had already been removed from many rooms in advance of rewiring work.' The Duke of York had said he he heard the fire alarm and roughly two or three minutes later he saw the smoke after leaving the room he was in, according to contemporary reports. Prince Andrew had joined a group removing valuable works of art from the castle to save them from destruction. The York Minster fire of 1984 Pictured: Aftermath of the York Minster fire of July 9, 1984 Early in the morning of July 9, 1984, York Minster's south transept was set ablaze, destroying the roof and causing £2.25million worth of damage. More than 100 firefighters confronted the church fire, taking two hours to bring it to heel. The cause of the fire is believed to have been a lightning bolt that struck the cathedral shortly after midnight. The blaze seriously damaged the cathedral's stonework, along with its famous Rose Window, and firefighters were left tackling embers on the floor after the roof collapsed at 4am. Minster staff and clergy busied themselves saving as many artefacts as possible before the fire was finally brought under control at around 5.24am. An investigation ruled out an electrical or gas fault, and arson was discounted due to roof's inaccessibility. Tests had found that the blaze was 'almost certainly' caused by a lightning strike but much of the evidence was destroyed in the fire. The building was restored in 1988 after masonry teams re-carved stonework above the building's rose window and arches. It was reported that the rose window, designed to celebrate the marriage of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, reached a temperature of 842F during the incident, cracking the glass in several places before it was restored. It was not the first time the building had caught ablaze. In the early hours of February 1, 1829, Jonathan Martin set the building on fire, melting the lead from the roof and cracking the building's limestone pillars. Late that afternoon the fire started dying out after roughly 230 feet of choir roof had collapsed. Non-conformist Martin, a former sailor from Northumberland, did not believe in formal liturgy, had published pamphlets condemning the clergy as 'vipers of Hell'. He was charged with setting the building on fire, but was found not guilty due to insanity, and died in a London asylum in 1838. Pictured: The roof of the South Transept of York Minster ablaze at the height of the fire. Minster staff and clergy busied themselves saving as many artefacts as possible before the fire was finally brought under control at around 5.24am The Great Fire of London St Paul’s Cathedral (pictured now) caught fire, with the lead roof melting and pouring into the street 'like a river' as the building collapsed On September 2, 1666, a fire broke out Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane, close to London Bridge. The summer of 1666 had been unusually hot, and the city had not seen rain for several weeks, leaving wooden houses and buildings tinder dry. Once the fire had taken hold, 300 houses quickly collapsed and strong east winds fanned the flames from house to house, sweeping the blaze through London's winding narrow lanes, with houses positioned close together. In an attempt to flee the fire by boat, Londoners poured down to the River Thames and the city was overtaken by chaos. There was no fire brigade in London at the time, so residents themselves had to fight the fire with the help of local soldiers. They used buckets of water, water squirts and fire hooks, pulling down houses with hooks to make gaps or 'fire breaks', but the wind helped fan the fire across the created gaps. King Charles II had ordered that houses in the path of the fire should be pulled down - but the fire outstripped the hooked poles that were used to try and achieve this. By September 4 half of London had been overtaken by the blaze, and King Charles himself joined firefighters, handing them buckets of water in a desperate attempt to bring the blaze under control. Gunpowder was deployed to blow up houses that lay in the path's fire, but the sound of explosions triggered rumours of a French invasion, heightening the city's panic. St Paul’s Cathedral caught fire, with the lead roof melting and pouring into the street 'like a river' as the cathedral collapsed. The fire was eventually brought under control and extinguished by September 6, leaving just one fifth of London untouched. Almost every civic building had been destroyed, along with 13,000 private homes, 87 parish churches, The Royal Exchange, and Guildhall. Roughly 350,000 people lived in London just before the Great Fire, making the city one of the largest in Europe. A monument was erected in Pudding Lane, where the blaze broke out. By September 4 half of London had been overtaken by the blaze, and King Charles himself joined firefighters, handing them buckets of water in a desperate attempt to bring the blaze under control (pictured: An illustration from 1834) The Great Fire of Rome , 64AD The Great Fire of Rome, during the reign of Emperor Nero in 64AD, destroyed much of the city after the blaze began in the slums south of the aristocratic Palatine Hill. Strong winds fanned the fire north, scorching homes in its path, causing widespread panic during the inferno's three-day duration. Hundreds died in the conflagration, and thousands were left homeless. Three of the 14 districts were completely destroyed, and only four remained completely untouched. That Emperor Nero 'fiddled while the city burned' has become popular legend, but is not accurate. The Emperor was 35 miles away in Antium when the fire broke out and allowed his palace to be used as a shelter. And the fiddle had not yet been invented. Nero, who used the fire as an opportunity to rebuild the city in a more Greek style, blamed Christians for the fire, ordering the arrest, torture and execution of hundreds of the religion's faithful. Historian Tacitus said the fire was 'graver and more terrible than any other which had befallen this city.' Advertisement

'Art and history destroyed before our eyes': Witnesses share their horror as the Notre Dame Cathedral is engulfed in flames

Notre Dame Cathedral went up in flames on Monday in a roaring blaze that devastated the Parisian landmark, leaving the city, France, and the international community distraught.

Flames that began in the early evening burst through the roof of the centuries-old cathedral and engulfed the spire, which collapsed, quickly followed by the entire roof.

While a huge plume of smoke wafted across the city and ash fell over a large area, Parisians and tourists watched on, as others took to social media to express their sorrow.

'Centuries of art and history destroyed before our eyes. This building has stood since the Middle Ages. This is absolutely devastating,' one Twitter user wrote.

Later in the evening, those in the city gathered together to say prayers and sing hymns in front of the nearby Saint Julien Les Pauvres church as the massive blaze continued only a few hundred meters away.

Many were quietly singing an Ave Maria in Latin, including Stephane Seigneurie, 52, who said he has lived in Paris for the past 25 years.

'I come often, and go in even where there's no mass because it's an extraordinary place, entwined in the history of France,' he said. 'Politically, intellectually and spiritually, it's a symbol of France.'

Archbishop of Paris Michel Aupetit has invited priests across France to ring the bells of their churches in a call for prayers for Notre Dame.

'Paris is disfigured. The city will never be like it was before,' said Philippe, a communications worker in his mid-30s, who had biked over to the scene after being alerted of the fire by a friend.

'I'm a Parisian, my father was a Parisian, my grandfather as well - this was something we brought our sons to see,' he said. 'I won't be showing this to my son.'

'It's a tragedy,' he added. 'If you pray, now is the time to pray.'

'Basically the whole rooftop is gone. I see no hope for the building,' said witness Jacek Poltorak, watching the fire from a fifth-floor balcony two blocks from the southern facade of the cathedral, one of France's most visited places.

'Notre Dame is perhaps one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever set foot in, and watching it burn down is absolutely soul crushing,' read one Twitter post.

'Terrible seeing the Notre Dame in flames. Art and history turned to ashes. So glad no one has been hurt. Paris we are with you and will be there to see it restored. Shocking news,' another social media user said.

Others described the tragedy of never being able to see the Notre Dame as it was before the blaze.

'Sad I'll never get to see Notre Dame,' one Twitter user wrote. 'It's on my bucket list and now one of the historic landmarks is just gone! Thoughts go out to France'.

'It's finished, we'll never be able to see it again,' said Jerome Fautrey, a 37-year-old who had come to watch.

Buildings around were evacuated and nobody was injured, junior interior minister Laurent Nunez said at the scene, adding: 'It's too early to determine the causes of the fire.'

France 2 television reported that police were treating it as an accident.

'Everything is collapsing,' a police officer near the scene said as the entire roof of the cathedral continued to burn.

'Like all our compatriots, I am sad this evening to see this part of all of us burn,' President Emmanuel Macron tweeted.

'There are a lot of art works inside...it's a real tragedy,' Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said at the scene.

Questions for Paris fire brigade as Notre Dame inferno burns out of control for hours

Authorities have revealed they are unable to drop water on to Notre Dame to tame the blaze for fear it will ruin what is left of the 850-year-old cathedral as well as injuring people nearby.

The tactic was suggested by US President Donald Trump on Twitter but it hasn't been deployed because of the risks it could pose not only to the historic building but to any people nearby.

The French Interior Ministry tweeted to say that 400 firefighters have been mobilised to help tackle the blaze that is engulfing the cathedral.

In cases of intense fires, a water bomber jet - called a Canadair - can be deployed to drop large amounts of water.

Hundreds of comments have flooded in on the Pompiers du Paris Twitter page in support of the brave firefighters risking their lives to save Notre Dame.

French news site Le Monde, explains: 'A Canadair projects about six tonnes of water at high speed to the ground.

'The danger is significant of hurting one or more people around the building - which is why Canadair interventions are so infrequent in urban and peri-urban areas.

'Such an intervention could also significantly destroy the little remaining structure of the cathedral.'

If an accident happens while a Canadair is being used, the pilot may also face criminal charges.

Canadairs were used earlier this year in March when France experienced intense wildfires near Valdeblore in the Alpes-Maritimes.

They were also used in 2017 when France experienced intense wildfires that forced 10,000 people to evacuate their homes and campsites overnight.

Pope Francis to parents of L.G.B.T. children: ‘God loves your children as they are.’,https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/09/17/pope-francis-parents-lgbt-children-god-loves-your-children-they-are,"Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” He did so in a brief encounter with some 40 Italian parents (both mothers and fathers) of L.G.B.T. children after the public audience in the Renaissance courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican.

The parents are members of an Italian association, Tenda di Gionata (“Jonathan’s Tent”), which welcomes and provides information and formation to L.G.B.T. Christians, their families and pastoral workers. The association was founded in 2018 by people inspired by a Catholic priest, the late Rev. David Esposito from the Diocese of Fermo in the Marches region of Italy.

Mara Grassi, the vice president of the association, together with her husband Agostino Usai—both wearing masks—presented the pope with a booklet titled “Genitori Fortunati” (“Fortunate Parents”) that documented the experiences of these parents with the church, experiences that were at times far from easy, and their requests for acceptance despite all too often being considered “undesirable” by church communities. (An English-language version will soon be published)

Mara Grassi told Pope Francis, “We wish to create a bridge to the church so that the church too can change its way of looking at our children, no longer excluding them but fully welcoming them.”

Speaking afterward to Avvenire, the daily paper of the Italian Bishops’ Conference, Ms. Grassi said she told the pope that “our association aims to foster dialogue between the church and the families of L.G.B.T. [people].” Taking her cue from the booklet’s title, she confided to him, “We consider ourselves fortunate because we had to change the way that we had always looked at our children. We found a new way of looking that enabled us to see in them the beauty and love of God.”

According to her account of the conversation, she told Francis, “We wish to create a bridge to the church so that the church too can change its way of looking at our children, no longer excluding them but fully welcoming them.”

Having listened carefully to what she said, Pope Francis reassured her, “The church does not exclude them because she loves them deeply.”

As he bade them farewell, the association gave the pope a rainbow-colored T-shirt with the words “In love there is no fear” emblazoned on it.

Speaking to La Repubblica, the Italian daily, after the audience, Ms. Grassi, a Catholic mother of four children—the eldest of whom is a gay person, now aged 40—said she experienced “very strong emotions” in her encounter with Pope Francis.

She revealed that “for many years I was like a blind person. After I came to know that my son was homosexual, I suffered a lot because the rules of the church made me think that he was excluded from the love of God. Nobody helped me.”

Things changed, she said, when she attended a vigil against homophobia at the church of Regina Pacis in Reggio Emilia, a city in northern Italy. There she met other parents, believers like herself, who have children that are gay, and through these parents she met the Rev. Paolo Cugini, who helped her understand that “faith and homosexuality are not in opposition, and that God loves my son as he is.”

She told the pope that she is the mother of a son who is gay and “who left the church because he did not feel accepted in his diversity.” She explained how, thanks to her son, she changed her way of seeing things and like other persons in the same situation, after being “destabilized at first” on learning of her son’s homosexuality, she has come to see that “we are fortunate parents.”

She said the pope, in response, assured her and the other parents present that “God loves our children because they are all children of God.” And when she requested that the church, too, should change its ways so that no one feels excluded, Francis reassured them saying, “The church loves our children as they are.”"
"After Denver hired homeless people to shovel mulch and perform other day labor, more than 100 landed regular jobs",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/16/denver-day-works-program-homeless-jobs/,"Jeffrey Maes didn’t expect to live on the streets in his 50s. He had started several businesses, but he says the last one, a remodeling company, went south just as he was stretched thin on four properties.

He lost them all, he said, and ended up without a home — along with the realization that he was considered unemployable. But last year, he heard about a Denver-sponsored day-labor program that had helped friends get back on their feet.

After nearly four years of homelessness, Maes gave it a shot.

And on Tuesday, he spoke about how the Denver Day Works program has helped restore his pride — and helped him find a full-time job retrofitting lights at the city’s Central Library — as city officials announced the expansion of the program in the coming year. During a news conference at the library, Mayor Michael Hancock and others said the first-year numbers exceeded most of their goals.

In the first year after the program’s launch in November 2016, Denver Human Services says 284 people worked at least a day — with all but 10 sticking around longer — performing landscaping duties in parks, helping out at the Denver Elections Division, aiding public-works crews and other job assignments.

Of those participants, Maes was among 110 who found full-time work, with 15 landing permanent or project-based city jobs and the rest finding work with dozens of outside private and public employers.

“When you take a good person (who’s) down, broken, discouraged, and you give them an opportunity to be proud of their self — to stand up and do something for their self — that’s one of the greatest gifts anybody can give to anybody,” said Maes, 57. “And for that, I’d like to say thank you.”

Denver Day Works, run by contractor Bayaud Enterprises, has organized work crews three days a week. Next month, it will add a fourth day, with a fifth shift planned later in the year.

That will allow an increase in capacity that may reduce the waitlist that stretched to eight weeks at times in 2017. The city also plans to get more departments involved, offering varied work opportunities that might better attract women, minorities and the disabled as participants.

​The program, while robust, isn’t a panacea for Denver’s expansive homelessness problem, which has put pressure on city officials to address not only the need for job assistance but also housing and mental health services. But Hancock and others see the work program’s results as encouraging.

As part of Denver Day Works, Bayaud has helped connect participants with housing providers and, if eligible, public-assistance programs. It also supplies lunches for the workers, sometimes donated by restaurants.

At the end of each shift, they are paid wages of more than $12 an hour.

Hancock initiated Denver Day Works in late 2016 after reading a news report about a similar city day-labor program in Albuquerque. He budgeted $400,000 for the first year, about half of that for Bayaud’s administrative costs. That amount has increased to $696,300 for 2018.

The program’s success “shows what we’ve known all along — that people experiencing homelessness are no different” from other city residents, Hancock said. “They are hungry for the opportunity to work hard to achieve their personal dreams and to take their self-sufficiency in their own hands.”

Some of the figures and data from the program’s pilot year point to challenges, as highlighted in an outside evaluation by the University of Colorado Denver’s Center on Network Science.

A striking statistic: Just 57 of the 110 participants who were hired into regular jobs out of the program retained those jobs for more than 90 days. A researcher said this highlighted the need for the program to help participants adapt to those transitions.

“One of the things that we learned was how difficult it is for folks to transition from being homeless to … being expected to be at work five days a week, when you may not even have a place to put your stuff every day,” said Danielle Varda, an associate professor at CU Denver.

Maes was among three former Denver Day Works participants on hand Tuesday who for months have worked on a project crew that’s retrofitting all of the Central Library’s fluorescent lights with LEDs.

Another participant, Regina Pizarro, 46, teared up while talking about her experience in the day-labor program. She now has a job providing customer service at a call center, and she credits Denver Day Works for putting her on that path.

“It didn’t matter whether I was shoveling mulch, working at Denver Votes — it didn’t matter what I was doing, because I had a job,” she said, adding about her Bayaud supervisors: “They have a lot of compassion and understanding. They don’t look down on us because we’ve been on the streets.”"

John Cena Has Granted Over 600 Make a Wish Foundation Wishes—More Than Any Celebrity in History

From “scrawny” kid who was bullied to a record-breaking 16-time WWE World Champion to bonafide movie star — it seems there’s nothing John Cena can’t and won’t do.

Now, Cena can add prolific wish-granter to his flourishing list of accomplishments. The wrestler turned actor has helped make the dreams of more than 600 kids come true for Make-A-Wish, a non-profit organization that helps grant life-changing wishes for children fighting critical illnesses.

“My first Make-A-Wish, I was kind of shuffled — it wasn’t for me, I think the person wanted to meet another superstar,” Cena, 42, tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “But the WWE does a great job of like, ‘Hey, there’s a Make-A-Wish kid in this room. Can you come say hello?’ So, a bunch of people are shuttled in to say hello to a young fan of WWE.”

“So, we’re shuttled in and said my hellos and took my pictures and then left. And they’re like, ‘Thank you, Make-A-Wish thanks you.’ I was like, ‘What is Make-A-Wish?’” Cena continued.

Once the Trainwreck star was made aware of what the foundation stood for, he went out of his way to prioritize charity work above all else in the future.

“I said, ‘If you ever need me for this ever, I don’t care what I’m doing, I will drop what I’m doing and be involved because I think that’s the coolest thing,’” Cena explained. “We’ve all experienced that joy of giving a gift for the holidays where you just nail it — that’s the same gift I get in giving back to people’s lives, in being able to give them wonderful emotional moments.”

Last December, the wrestler and Hailee Steinfeld teamed up with Make-A-Wish to light up the Empire State Building yellow in honor of their movie Bumblebee, as well as to commemorate his dedication to brightening children’s lives.

In his upcoming movie Playing with Fire, Cena plays a smokejumper (specialized firefighter) named Jake Carson, who leads a small team of men in a fire depot based in Redding, California. Despite their everyday challenges at work, he and his colleagues are put to the ultimate test when they assume responsibility of three orphaned siblings during a heavy storm in the woods.

Amidst the tragic blazes that are causing millions of Californians to evacuate their homes, Cena pledged $500,000 to the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation and the California Fire Foundation, charities chosen by Paramount Pictures, the studio behind Playing with Fire.

“It’s really special that we were able to take a movie and tie it into a charity,” the WWE champion said. “We’ve had numerous instances where we can tie relevance and awareness around first responders to get possibly more funding for their departments around a movie that’s a family comedy kind of loosely based on firefighters.”

Not only does the actor hold the privilege of most wishes granted by a single individual, but he also happens to be the most requested celebrity for the foundation, according to Today. Not many others make it past 300 wishes.

“The fact that I essentially play dress up for a living and can still be a force in providing hope and happiness for children and families? That’s extra, extra special,” Cena tells PEOPLE. “You can learn from any and every situation. I learned from every single child I meet and their families as well. It’s incredibly rewarding.”

And with every wish, the Blockers star commits to it.

“If you were given one wish, what would you do with it? I don’t know if ‘Hang out with John Cena’ would be at the top of my list,” Cena says. “But the fact that that is on someone’s list is the coolest thing. So, I approach it with that attitude — like this is fantastic, let’s make this wonderful.”"
"10,872 New Yorkers to See Their Marijuana Convictions Disappear",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/nyregion/marijuana-records-new-york-city.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

Even as states across the country have legalized marijuana, potentially opening the door to a multibillion dollar industry, the impact of marijuana criminalization is still being felt by people — mostly black and Hispanic — whose records are marked by low-level convictions related to the drug.

But on Wednesday, New York began the process of expunging many of those records, as part of a new state law to reduce penalties associated with marijuana-related crimes, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo confirmed.

“For too long communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by laws governing marijuana and have suffered the lifelong consequences of an unfair marijuana conviction,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.

Under the new law, which was passed in June and took effect on Wednesday, about 160,000 people with marijuana convictions in the state will have those convictions cleared from their record, according to a spokeswoman for the State Division of Criminal Justice Services ."

They were being slaughtered in staggering numbers as ivory traffickers took advantage of a security vacuum in the region, with 163 killed since 2012, said Susan Canney, director of the Mali Elephant Project, an initiative of the Wild Foundation and the International Conservation Fund of Canada.

The situation was so dire that in January 2016, Dr. Canney predicted all Mali’s elephants would be killed within three years if poaching continued unabated."
Arkansas city paying homeless $9.25 an hour to collect trash,https://nypost.com/2019/09/10/arkansas-city-paying-homeless-9-25-an-hour-to-collect-trash/,"Arkansas has been paying homeless people $9.25 an hour — two bucks more than the federal minimum wage — to pick up trash around its state capital.

And the program in Little Rock, dubbed Bridge to Work, has been so successful since it began in April that the city’s mayor, Frank Scott Jr., is planning to extend it an additional year, according to 12 News Now.

“We’re super excited about what has gone on, and we hope to be able to keep the momentum going,” said associate pastor Paul Atkins of the Canvas Community Church, which runs the program, the news outlet reported.

“We want to work with them on their next step,” Atkins said during a board meeting last month. “There are a lot of barriers that our people experience to go from homelessness and panhandling to full-time work. There’s a lot of steps in between.”

The Bridge to Work program originally was planned to last just six months but will be extended to go through the end of September 2020, according to the site.

According to Atkins, 380 people joined the work crews, with some joining more than once.

A total of 130 sites have been cleaned, 2,056 bags filled with trash and 1,821 hours worked since the program started, the news outlet reported.

Arkansas increased the state’s minimum wage to $9.25 an hour this year."
An Indian couple has been buying land adjacent to a tiger reserve just to let the forest expand.,https://qz.com/india/1803565/land-near-ranthambore-tiger-reserve-reforested-by-indian-couple/,"Every industry can be part of the solution — or part of the ongoing problem.

It was his love for nature and wildlife that led Aditya Singh to quit his Indian civil services job, leave his well-appointed house in Delhi and settle in a remote corner of Rajasthan, abutting the famous Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, in 1998. Over the last 20 years, Singh has been buying tracts of land adjacent to Ranthambore and simply letting the forest grow back.

After shifting to Sawai Madhopur, a small city near Ranthambore tiger reserve (RTR), Singh took up photography. His wife Poonam Singh and he opened a tourist resort there to earn their living. Unlike many tourism establishments that want unrestricted access to the wild areas, they slowly started buying land parcels adjacent to each other just outside RTR’s boundary.

“The area is called Bhadlav. I had first gone to this area soon after settling in Ranthambore along with a BBC filmmaker. This area adjacent to the boundary of the Ranthambore reserve was visited by predators like tigers who used to come for prey. As a result, farmers were selling their land,” said Singh.

Poonam remembers how it was love at first sight for her when she visited Ranthambore with Aditya. “My first sighting was a tigress with three cubs on a hill. It was magical. At the end of the trip, I just asked him if we can move to Ranthambore. He wanted it, too, and within months we moved. As far as this land is concerned, it was a dream that we both saw and achieved together to have our own area of wilderness,” she says. Poonam, an artist by profession, managed the resort with Aditya for twenty years until they closed it down in 2019.

They now own about 35 acres of land in Bhadlav, another five acres a few hundred metres away and a strip of land connecting the two.

“I just bought this and did nothing to it except removing the invasive species. We allowed the land to recover and now after 20 years it has become a lush green patch of forest which is frequently visited by all kind of animals, including tigers, leopards and wild boars, throughout the year,” said Singh.

In an aerial shot he had captured, Singh points to their land parcel—a lush green expanse compared to the barren land of the Ranthambore tiger reserve with which his landholding shares the boundary. He has also created several water holes in the landholding to ensure that the wild animals get water even during summers.

Aditya Singh An aerial view of the land transformed by the Singhs.

As a result, the pressure of predators like tigers from RTR venturing into fields of farmers has gone down. “It is simply because the animals understand that in this patch of the forest they get prey, water and safe shelter without any disturbance,” chuckled Singh.

At present, India has 50 tiger reserves. Ranthambore is among the country’s biggest and most famous tiger reserves, with an estimated population of about 60 tigers.

Singh admitted that he is often subjected to questions for not carrying out any project on his land which is now well worth over Rs1 crore ($140,000) despite getting so many proposals.

“Money was never the consideration. It is just about my love for nature and wildlife. Instead, these days I am getting queries from people across India who want to replicate a similar model in their state,” he said.

MAYANK AGGARWAL Aditya Singh

The Singhs are not done with this dream. Singh says he wants to buy more land adjacent to his fields, especially the agriculture field next to his land and inspire others in the area to follow suit.

The couple’s side project, a new home and homestay that’s in progress, is going to run on solar and wind power where too they are creating two small water holes on the fence of the house so that thirsty animals can get water during summers.

Leonardo DiCaprio raises $100 million to fight climate change,https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/21/leonardo-dicaprio-proves-theres-nothing-he-cant-do-as-he-raises-100-million-to-fight-climate-change-8275407/,"The actor has always been passionate about fighting climate change (Picture: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)

Leonardo DiCaprio has proved there’s nothing he can’t do by raising a whopping $100 million (£79 million) to fight climate change.

He’s a good egg all round.

The Titanic actor, who founded the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to increase awareness about climate change, wrote in a statement: ‘When I founded LDF 20 years ago, I did so based on the simple idea that we could make a real difference by directly funding some of the most effective environmental projects.

‘Whether it be individuals, grassroots movements or major nonprofits, we wanted to focus on getting critical funding to those who could have the greatest impact.

‘We are extremely proud to celebrate 20 years of this model. Since 1998, we have supported over 200 projects on every continent and in every ocean from habitat and species conservation, renewable energy, climate change, indigenous rights, and more.

‘I am pleased to announce $11 million (£8.6 million) in new grants across our six program areas, bringing the total financial impact of LDF to over $100 million (£79 million).’

In 2016 he produced and starred in documentary Before The Flood, which focuses on the effects of climate change (Picture: Tibrina Hobson/WireImage)

Could we love him any more?

It’s safe to say Leo’s had his fair share of trouble with awards (we won’t mention the Oscar saga), and his track record for environmental awards isn’t much better, as he was slammed in 2016 for jetting off on a private jet to receive one.

Bit awks.

A rep for DiCaprio told US Weekly: ‘He was asked to speak at both Riverkeeper and amfAR events, but the only way to attend the two fundraisers was to hitch a ride with flights that were already planned.

‘Leo helped both events raise millions, donated his own funds, auctioned off his house and had speaking roles in both programs.’

Despite the criticism, Leo’s stood firm in his efforts to address climate change, with it being the focus of his speech at the Oscars.

He pointed out: ‘Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species. We need to work together to stop procrastinating…Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted.’

"School superintendent arrested for allegedly using own insurance to help sick student will only get small fine, keep job.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/school-superintendent-arrested-allegedly-using-own-insurance-help-sick-student-n962511,"The superintendent of an Indiana school district was arrested and faces fraud charges for allegedly using her son’s name to help a sick student receive medical treatment.

Casey Smitherman, the superintendent of Elwood Community School Corporation, was charged with insurance fraud, identity deception, insurance application fraud and official misconduct, court documents show.

Police in Elwood, Indiana, said they received a tip that Smitherman took a 15-year-old student to urgent care on Jan. 9 after the teenager missed school because he had a sore throat, according to a probable cause affidavit.

Casey Smitherman, the superintendent of Elwood Community Schools in Indiana, was booked on charges of insurance fraud, identity deception and official misconduct on Jan. 23, 2019. Madison County Sheriff's Department

Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings told NBC News that Smitherman took the student to one urgent care location but was denied because she is not his guardian. That’s when Smitherman took the student to St. Vincent Med in Elwood and used her insurance to have the student evaluated under her son’s name, Cummings said.

Smitherman told police that she was worried about the student when he did not show up for school and she went by his house and saw that he was ill, according to the affidavit. She said after leaving urgent care she went to a CVS Pharmacy to have a prescription filled for Amoxicillin, again using her insurance and son’s name.

Smitherman said that she did not contact child welfare authorities because she feared the student would be placed in a foster home. Smitherman also said that she has helped the student in the past by buying clothes for him and cleaning his home, the affidavit states.

Cummings said the student does not live at the home with his parents, and is under the care of a relative.

Authorities contacted the student who told them that he knew it was “bad” to be in possession of someone else’s prescription so he tore the label off the pill bottle.

Smitherman was arrested and released after posting a $500 cash bond, according to court records. A court date has not yet been set, but Smitherman will most likely end up paying a fine and possibly doing community service, Cummings said.

Elwood Community School Corporation said in a statement Thursday that Smitherman made an ""unfortunate mistake"" and she has their support.

""We understand that it was out of concern for this child’s welfare. We know she understands what she did was wrong, but she continues to have our support,"" the district said in a statement to The Herald Bulletin."
North Dakota quietly decriminalized marijuana,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/10/18563776/north-dakota-marijuana-decriminalization-legalization,"North Dakota quietly decriminalized marijuana earlier this month, making it the 25th state to do so.

As the news outlet Marijuana Moment and the advocacy group NORML reported, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill decriminalizing marijuana last week — but the issue got little to no attention from his office or news media. The law makes it so first-time possession of up to half an ounce of marijuana is no longer a criminal misdemeanor that carries the potential for jail time, but instead is an infraction that only carries a fine.

This is different from marijuana legalization. Under decriminalization, possession of small amounts of pot no longer carries jail or prison time but can continue to carry a fine, and possession of larger amounts, repeat offenses, and sales or trafficking can still result in harsher sentences. Under legalization, penalties for marijuana possession are completely removed, and sales are typically allowed.

Some opponents of legalization favor decriminalization as a step toward peeling back America’s harsh drug and criminal justice policies. They see “tough on crime” policies as too punitive and costly, but they don’t want to resort to full legalization, which they fear would make pot too accessible in the US and allow big corporations to sell and market the drug irresponsibly.

The concern for legalization advocates is that decriminalization keeps the ban on selling marijuana, which means users wouldn’t have a legal source for the drug, and criminal organizations would therefore still have a source of revenue that they can use for violent operations around the world. The fines, while less punitive than arrests or prison time, can also cause problems, since they’re often applied in a racially disparate manner.

Ten states and Washington, DC, have legalized marijuana, although DC and Vermont don’t allow sales. Fifteen additional states, now including North Dakota, have only decriminalized.

North Dakota voters rejected a marijuana legalization ballot initiative last year, but activists reportedly will try again in 2020.

Supporters of legalization argue that it eliminates the harms of marijuana prohibition: the hundreds of thousands of arrests around the US, the racial disparities behind those arrests, and the billions of dollars that flow from the black market for illicit marijuana to drug cartels that then use the money for violent operations around the world. All of this, legalization advocates say, will outweigh any of the potential downsides — such as increased cannabis use — that might come with legalization.

Opponents, meanwhile, claim that legalization will enable a huge marijuana industry that will market the drug irresponsibly. They point to America’s experiences with the alcohol and tobacco industries in particular, which have built their financial empires in large part on some of the heaviest consumers of their products. This could result in far more people using pot, even if it leads to negative health consequences.

For now, legalization is not reality in North Dakota. But decriminalization is.

"Heavy metal band Metallica donates $750,000 to firefighters in Australia",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7863345/Heavy-metal-band-Metallica-donates-750-000-firefighters-Australia.html,"They might look a little rough around the edges but American heavy metal band Metallica have hearts of pure gold.

The musicians are the latest in a whole slew of international celebrities to throw their support behind charities supporting Australian bushfire relief.

The band announced they are donating $750,000 to NSW Rural Fire Service and Country Fire Authority in Victoria through their charitable foundation All Within My Hands, via Instagram on Wednesday.

Donation: Heavy metal band Metallica has pledged to donate $750,000 to firefighting agencies in Australia

In a statement released by the band, they said they felt 'overwhelmed' by the wild fires which are sweeping through the country.

'The resulting destruction and devastating effects on all residents, animals, the environment and the incredible land in Australia is truly heartbreaking,' they said.

Then they urged others to 'join us' to 'do whatever' they could to assist while providing information and links to the respective firefighting organisations.

'Overwhelmed' Metallica released a statement to Instagram on Wednesday where they said they were 'overwhelmed' by the devastation in Australia and urged fans to 'join' them by donating to NSWRFS and CFAVic

Fans overwhelming took to social media to thank the band.

'You are truly the best! God bless you all' one woman commented.

'Absolutely amazing guys!! Thank you from Australia! Can’t wait for you guys to come back,' a man commented.

Another fan was quick to suggest further ways the band could could help raise funds for bushfire relief charities in Australia.

Cancelled: The donation comes three months after Metallica was 'devastated' to indefinitely postponed the Australian and New Zealand leg of their World Wired Tour after lead singer James Hetfield, 56, re-entered rehab to treat an 'addiction'

'Ya'll should do a fundraiser concert with a bunch of other rock bands like Live AID but you donate funds to Australians affected by the fires,' they wrote.

Other users quickly suggested U2, Pink and Guns N' Roses might be persuaded to join in, if Metallica did go ahead and plan a aid relief style concert.

The donation comes three months after the band was 'devastated' to indefinitely postpone the Australian and New Zealand leg of their World Wired Tour after lead singer James Hetfield, 56, re-entered rehab to treat an 'addiction'.

The catastrophic bushfire season in Australia has so far claimed at least 25 lives, destroyed 2,000 homes and killed close to a billion animals."
"NYC landlord waiving April rent for his 200-300 tenants because of Coronavirus. “I told them just to look out for your neighbor and make sure that everyone has food on their table,"" he said. [NYT]",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-landlord-mario-salerno.html#click=https://t.co/fUY1AG7Y8t,"It is too soon to get an accurate gauge of how many renters withheld their April rent and what the fallout would be for landlords.

But Mr. Salerno said in an interview on Thursday that he did not care about losing his rental income in April, nor did he care to calculate the amount that he would not be collecting from his 80 apartments. He said he had about 200 to 300 tenants in total.

He is likely forgoing hundreds of thousands of dollars in income by canceling April rent.

His only interest, he said, was in alleviating stress for his renters, even those who were still employed and now working from home.

“My concern is everyone’s health,” said Mr. Salerno, 59, whose rent gesture was first reported by the local news site Greenpointers.com. “I told them just to look out for your neighbor and make sure that everyone has food on their table.”

Mr. Salerno said a handful of his tenants messaged him last month saying that they could not afford rent. Three renters from Ireland packed up a few belongings and moved back home, he said.

When Mr. Gentile spotted the sign last week, he said he was surprised but not shocked. For the nearly four years Mr. Gentile has lived in the apartment, Mr. Salerno has been a model landlord.

Emergencies are fixed almost immediately, he said, such as a water leak in Mr. Gentile’s ceiling that was fixed, patched and painted within several hours."

The person actually overpaid.",https://www.kingstonist.com/grocery-store-inadvertently-open-on-family-day/,"Despite having scheduled to be closed on Family Day, one downtown grocery store had ‘customers’ anyway when the doors to the business were inadvertently open during the holiday.

On Monday, Feb. 18, 2019, the Food Basics location on Barrack Street was meant to be closed for the provincial holiday. However, with almost all of the grocery stores in the area closed for the day, those seeking a few staples or the fixings for dinner were happy enough to find the doors of the downtown grocer open – that is, until they went inside.

With no staff scheduled for the day, the open doors of the business meant members of the public were able to enter, but not actually purchase any items. Nonetheless, people walked around inside the store, some seemingly unaware of the situation, while others stood out front trying to figure out what was going on.

“I was standing there trying to decide what to do, and a guy comes out of the store with two packages of cherry tomatoes,” said one eyewitness who asked to remain anonymous.

“So I asked ‘Hey, buddy! You just taking some tomatoes?’ He said ‘I left $5 on the counter.’”

The witness then chose to contact Kingston Police to let them know what was going on.

According to Kingston Police, officers did attend the Food Basics location at approximately 4:25 p.m. on Family Day. Officers got in contact with a store manager, who found that nothing was damaged. The business indicated they would review store security footage and contact police if it appeared as though anything substantial was stolen.

“I looks as though there was no damage, and the situation wasn’t out of control or anything,” said Const. Ashley Gutheinz, media relations officer for Kingston Police.

“The doors were open, and we don’t know… what’s to blame for that, but it appears that the store manager indicated nothing was seriously damaged or stolen.”"
"Minnesota Will Pay Homeowners to Replace Lawns with Bee-Friendly Wildflowers, Clover and Native Grasses",https://returntonow.net/2020/01/29/minnesota-will-pay-homeowners-to-replace-lawns-with-bee-friendly-wildflowers-clover-and-native-grasses/,"January 29, 2020 at 5:09 am









Minnesota is asking homeowners to turn their lawns into prairie to help bring back the bees











Minnesota just allocated nearly a million dollars in incentives for people to transform their lawns into bee-friendly wildflowers, clover and native grasses.

The state is asking citizens to stop spraying herbicide, stop mowing so often, and let their lawns re-wild into a more natural state.

The goal is to provide “food sources for pollinators of all kinds, but will specifically aim at saving the rusty patched bumblebee, a fat and fuzzy species on the brink of extinction that seems to be making its final stand in the cities of the Upper Midwest,” the Star Tribune reports.

Research has shown bumblebees are particularly important to the region, as they vibrate at frequency that unlocks pollen other insects can’t reach.

The loss of native prairies and forests across the country has made pollinators more dependent on urban and suburban lawn flowers, says James Wolfin, a bee habitat researcher at University of Minnesota.

His research has focused on “bee lawns” – grassy yards interspersed with small flowers such as Dutch white clover, creeping thyme, self heal, ground plum and dandelions.



The flowers make excellent food source for bees, while being cheap to plant and easy maintain.

“A pound of Dutch white clover is about $7 and it grows low enough that people wouldn’t even have to change the way they mow their lawn,” Wolfin

told the Star Tribune.

Around 55 of Minnesota’s 350 bee species depend on white clover alone, he notes.

“So just by not treating white clover like a weed and letting it grow in a yard provides a really powerful resource for nearly 20% of the bee species in the state,” Wolfin said.

The program is set to begin in spring of 2020.

Citizens living in rusty patch bumblebee zones are eligible for grants up to $500, while people living in zones of secondary and tertiary importance to bees are eligible for $350 and $150 respectively.

Considering a 1-pound bag of clover seeds costs as little as $10, and spreads “like a weed,” that should be plenty to cover it.

In fact, letting your lawn go to the bees is so easy, those of us living outside Minnesota might want to consider joining in the effort!

NYS passes bill to decriminalize marijuana possession and expunge criminal records,https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-decriminalizes-marijuana-use-new-york-state?fbclid=IwAR3syzmONvBqlyz7y8Lhcz6qQ4FKAXUn-iZG9hAf6XNDL9rgFgAYKfLVqPE,"(Albany, NY) The Senate today passed legislation that will address the racial disparities that are present in New York’s antiquated marijuana drug laws. New York’s existing marijuana laws disproportionately affect the African American and Latinx communities. This monumental legislation will decriminalize small amounts of marijuana and establish procedures for record expungements for both past and future convictions.

“Communities of color have borne the brunt of New York State’s marijuana drug laws. Our justice system directly reflects who we are as a society and that is why the Senate Majority is taking action to fix this broken system,” Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said. “This legislation is marking a momentous first step in addressing the racial disparities caused by the war on drugs. The Senate Majority continues to move forward on full legalization and I thank Senator Jamaal Bailey for his leadership on this issue.”

Bill Sponsor, Senator Jamaal Bailey said, “In New York State, people of color are disproportionately arrested for marijuana possession. The misdemeanor charge for public view of marijuana possession gives those people convicted a criminal record that will follow them throughout their lives, potentially limiting their access to housing, access to education, affecting their ability to obtain employment, all leading to a potential inability to provide for their families. While this legislation falls short of the goal of legalization of adult-use cannabis, the ability to create a mechanism for expungement, both retroactively and forward-looking, is a step in the right direction in finally ending the heavy-handed war on drugs that has decimated communities of color.”

African-American and Latinx individuals are arrested at higher rates for misdemeanor marijuana possessions. In New York City, African-Americans are eight times more likely to be arrested on low-level marijuana charges and Latinx people are arrested at five times more. The racial disparities for arrests are wider for cities in Upstate, NY. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), African Americans living in Schenectady County are 74 times more likely to be arrested on a marijuana charge.

"In 1961, her calculations put the first American in space. Today, Katherine Johnson is celebrating her 100th birthday",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nasa-human-computer-katherine-johnson-100th-birthday-a8509031.html,"Nasa has joined the 100th birthday celebrations for Katherine Johnson, an African-American “human computer” who overcame racial and gender discrimination, to become a crucial part of the US’s space programme.

The contribution of Ms Johnson and two of her black colleagues, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan, who worked at Nasa’s Langley Research Centre located in Hampton, Virginia, was featured in the 2016 movie Hidden Figures, directed by Theodore Melfi. In the movie, Ms Johnson was portrayed by actress Taraji Henson.

“Wishing a #happybirthday to Katherine G Johnson on her 100th birthday today,” Nasa’s official history office wrote in a tweet. “She worked at @NASA_Langley as a human computer starting in 1953. Her calculations were critical to our early human spaceflight programme (you’ve probably seen that in the movies).”

Ms Johnson, who was born in 1918 in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, was the youngster of four children and showed a talent for mathematics and calculations at an early age. Because public education for black children was not available behind the 8th grade, her parents arranged for her to attend high school on the campus of what is now West Virginia State University.

After graduating high school at the age of 14, she entered the historically black college where she studied maths and science. Among her tutors was the pioneering mathematician Angie Turner King. Ms Johnson was eventually joined the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, which would became Nasa.

On Saturday, a day before her 100th birthday, Ms Johnson, who graduated with degrees in both Maths and French, attended a ceremony West Virginia State University, where a new statue of her was unveiled and a scholarship in her name announced.

“What makes Katherine so extraordinary is she not only prevailed while segregation failed, Dr Johnson has continued to persevere and thrive with the gracious poise and clarity that defies mere words of explanation, let alone definition,” said Yvonne Cagle, life sciences directorate at the Johnson Space Centre, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail.

“So what can you say after a century about someone like Dr Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson – our very own global, global genius? Let’s see – you say nothing. You don’t say anything. You listen.”

The ceremony for Ms Johnson, who was in 2015 awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the US’s highest civilian honour, was also attended by West Virginia Democratic senator Joe Manchin,

“It is my hope that the students who pass by [this statue] every day will be reminded of Katherine’s legacy and will be inspired to keep their passion for knowledge alive,” he said.

“Every one of our female leaders in West Virginia are an epitome of strength...and advancements in their fields. They serve as inspiring role models for the next generation, and that is due in great part to the women who broke ground in generations past.”"
"Florida 20-year-old wins $451 million Mega Millions jackpot: ""I'm only 20, but I hope to use it to pursue a variety of passions, help my family and do some good for humanity.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-20-year-old-wins-451-million-mega-millions-jackpot-n837386,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A 20-year-old Florida man claimed the $451 million Mega Millions jackpot on Friday, choosing to get $282 million at once instead of more in annual installments.

A Florida Lottery news release said Friday that 20-year-old Shane Missler, of Port Richey, had claimed the jackpot from the multistate game's Jan. 5 drawing. They say he chose to receive his winnings in a one-time, lump-sum payment of $281,874,999.

""I'm only 20, but I hope to use it to pursue a variety of passions, help my family and do some good for humanity,"" he said in a statement.

The winning numbers to claim the nation's 10th-largest jackpot were 28-30-39-59-70 with a Mega Ball of 10.

The winning ticket was bought at a 7-Eleven in Port Richey. The retailer will receive a $100,000 bonus.

The Tampa Bay Times reported that Missler was grinning widely and clutching a yellow envelope when he turned in his ticket Friday at Florida Lottery headquarters in Tallahassee. His father and his lawyer came with him. They released a statement on his behalf.

""If there is one thing I have learned thus far in my short time on this earth it is that those who maintain a positive mindset and stay true to themselves get rewarded,"" Missler said in the statement. ""I look forward to the future.""

Lottery officials said the money will be paid to a trust, set up with Missler as the managing member, called ""Secret 007, LLC.""

""Although I'm young, I've had a crash course this week in financial management and I feel so fortunate to have this incredible wealth and team behind me,"" said Missler, who also told the Times that he plans to move out of Port Richey. ""I intend to take care of my family, have some fun along the way and cement a path for financial success so that I can leave a legacy far into the future."""

"82 year old youtuber know as the ""skyrim Grandma"" will be added as an nPC in the upcoming game The elder scrolls 6",https://www.usgamer.net/articles/beloved-youtuber-shirley-curry-skyrim-grandma-will-be-an-npc-in-the-elder-scrolls-6,"Got a news tip? Is there something you think we should be reporting on? Email news@usgamer.net.

If you saw Shirley Curry on the street, you would not assume she is a YouTuber who has amassed nearly 500,000 subscribers. She's 82-years-old, has four sons and nine grandchildren (according to her YouTube bio, she is also sadly a widow), and in her free time loves to play and record video games. One of her favorites: The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, of course.

Lovingly called ""Skyrim Grandma,"" Curry has a massive following. In 2018, fans started a petition to render her as an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6, which was announced at E3 2018.

The great demand from fans did not go unheard by the team at Bethesda Softworks. During a The Elder Scrolls 25th anniversary stream today, Bethesda announced that it will indeed be making Curry as an NPC in the upcoming The Elder Scrolls 6. A video looking back on the series' fandom briefly shows her character model being made. (You can see the process at 8:40 in the video above.)

""That petition for Skyrim Grandma we did hear, and she will be immortalized in the game,"" Todd Howard said during today's livestreamed panel. ""This means a lot to me because I would be extremely happy to know that somebody else was playing with my character in a future Elder Scrolls game,"" Curry herself said during a special video celebrating the series.

Technically, the model of Curry is just the second glimpse we've seen of Elder Scrolls 6, aside from the simple pan of its landscape and the rough title back at E3 2018. It's a sweet sentiment to see footage of Bethesda inviting Curry to its studio to capture her likeness for the game. (It's unknown if she will be voicing her cameo too.) Unfortunately, we won't be seeing Skyrim Grandma in The Elder Scrolls 6 anytime soon, due to it being in early development.

Disney heir calls on company to give 50% of exec bonuses to lowest-paid employees,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/media/abigial-disney-executive-pay/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Abigail Disney is doubling down on her criticism of executive pay at her family's company .

Just days after calling the pay of Disney's top brass ""insane,"" the granddaughter of company co-founder Roy Disney wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post , in which she acknowledged she ""struck a nerve with a Twitter thread about wage inequality at the Walt Disney Co.""

""I believe that Disney could well lead the way, if its leaders so chose, to a more decent, humane way of doing business,"" she wrote in a piece published Tuesday.

She proposes the company put aside half of the bonuses its executives earn, distributing that to the bottom 10% of200,000 employees.

According to a regulatory filing, six of Disney's top executives, including CEO Bob Iger, received stock awards and options worth a combined $62 million last year. That doesn't include the additional bonuses — and potentially millions of dollars more — earned by lower-tier executives at the media and theme park conglomerate.

""Besides, at the pay levels we are talking about, an executive giving up half his bonus has zero effect on his quality of life,"" she writes. ""For the people at the bottom, it could mean a ticket out of poverty or debt. It could offer access to decent health care or an education for a child.""

about executive pay went viral. Last weekend, Abigail Disney's rant on Twitter about executive pay went viral.

""There's a point at which there's just too much going around the top of the system into this class of people who — I'm sorry this is radical — have too much money,"" she said.

In the Washington Post piece, Abigail Disney reiterated her criticism of the company's pay for its lowest-paid workers. The company says it pays above the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage: Workers at its Florida resorts will make $15 per hour by 2021 , while employees at Disneyland in California had their pay increased to $15 an hour at the start of this year. But Abigail Disney said that's not enough.

""This argument fails to acknowledge that the cost of living varies from place to place and few can make do on that, no matter where they live,"" she wrote.

She also took issue with the Republican-led tax reform, saying major corporations who benefited from the lower tax rate have put the extra money into executive pay and share buybacks -- and not in their workers.

""At a company that has never been more profitable, whose top executives drive home with seven- and eight-figure paychecks and whose primary resource is the good-spirited, public-facing people who greet guests day after day, why are we dancing around a minimum wage anyway?,"" she added.

Abigail Disney wrote that while she believes that executives deserve bonuses, the ""people who contribute to its success also deserve a share of the profits they have helped make happen.""

The Disney company reported a record profit in 2018.

""Here is my suggestion to the Walt Disney Co. leadership. Lead,"" she concluded. ""Reward all of your workers fairly. Don't turn away when they tell you they are unable to make ends meet. You do not exist merely for the benefit of shareholders and managers.""

Responding to the criticism, the Disney company said it has made ""historic investments"" in its workers' pay and benefits, including education initiatives that allow hourly employees the ability to earn a college or vocational degree ""completely free of charge."" The company said it has upped the starting hourly salary at Disneyland to $15 and pledged as much as $150 million to the education effort.

The company also defended Iger's pay, which it said is ""90% performance-based.""

""He has delivered exceptional value for shareholders: Disney's market capitalization has grown exponentially over the last decade, rising $75 billion in the last month alone, and the stock price has increased to $132 a share from $24 a share when Mr. Iger became CEO in 2005,"" a Disney spokesperson told CNN Business."
University of Wisconsin-Madison to offer free tuition for families making less than $56K,http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/373110-university-of-wisconsin-madison-to-offer-free-tuition-for,"The University of Wisconsin-Madison will now offer free tuition and fees for in-state students from households that make less than $56,000 a year, The Associated Press reported.

The program, called Bucky’s Tuition Promise, is the latest move by a major university to try and make higher education more accessible and affordable for students.

In-state students at UW-Madison currently pay $10,533 a year in tuition and fees.

""Many low- and middle-income families in Wisconsin simply don't know whether they can afford to come to UW-Madison,"" Chancellor Rebecca Blank said as she announced the program, according to the AP.

""Indeed, if they just read the popular press about student debt and sky-rocketing tuition their assumption will be that they can't. We want to make it very clear to low- and moderate-income families in Wisconsin that we're going to do everything we can to make this an affordable school,” she continued.

Similar programs are growing in popularity across higher education as advocates argue that high tuition costs are blocking students from pursuing degrees. Six other colleges in the Big Ten athletics conference, of which UW-Madison is a member, have similar offers.

The same day, the university regent’s finance committee signed off on increasing nonresident and graduate tuition for three schools at UW-Madison. The full board is expected to approve the proposed increases on Friday, the AP reported."
Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively Donate $1 Million to Feeding America and Food Banks Canada,https://variety.com/2020/film/news/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-1-million-coronavirus-feeding-america-food-banks-canada-1203536323/,"Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively have announced that they’ve donated $1 million to two hunger relief organizations on the frontlines helping some of the most vulnerable populations during the coronavirus pandemic.

“I think we can all agree, Covid-19 is an a–hole,” Reynolds wrote on his Twitter feed. “If you can help, visit, http://FeedingAmerica.org and/or http://FoodBanksCanada.ca.”

“Covid-19 has brutally impacted older adults and low income families,” the “Deadpool” star also wrote. “Blake & I are donating $1 million to be split between Feeding America and Food Banks Canada. If you can give, these orgs need our help.”

Lively wrote on Instagram, “Though we must be distancing ourselves to protect those who don’t have the opportunity to self quarantine, we can stay connected. Remember the lonely and isolated. Facetime, Skype, make a video. Remember the love that can travel through all this.”

Feed America operates a network of food banks throughout the U.S. while Food Banks Canada does the same in Reynold’s native Canada.

“We are so grateful for Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively’s extremely generous donation, and for all of the donations we’ve been receiving,” Dan Nisbet, vice president of Major Gifts at Feeding America, told Variety. “The Feeding America network of 200 food banks is working tirelessly to aid and provide meal assistance to our most vulnerable neighbors — children, the elderly, families struggling with food insecurity and individuals facing job disruptions — throughout our nation during this unprecedented time. Generosity like theirs will make all the difference.”

Reynolds also wrote in his tweet, “Take care of your bodies and hearts. Leave room for joy. Call someone who’s isolated and might need connection.”

The actor then jokingly prompted his 15.6 million followers to call Hugh Jackman but listing his phone number as “1-555-[sad face emoji]-Hugh.”

And Lively also quipped, “Now can someone please tell Ryan that ’emotional distancing’ from his mother in law is not a thing. Nothing can save him.”

Other stars who have urged support on their social media platforms for Feeding America in the wake of the pandemic include Justin Timberlake, Natalie Portman, Ben Affleck, Vanessa Hudgens, Alan Cumming, sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid, Josh Gad and Nick Lachey.

“During this time, I’m thinking about our most vulnerable – children losing access to meals they rely on, friends and family who are facing job disruptions, the elderly, and low-income families. Join me in supporting @FeedingAmerica,” Affleck wrote on his Twitter feed.

In September, Lively and Reynolds donated $2 million to NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights."
Senate Approves Proposal To Strip Confederate Names From Army Bases By Veto-Proof Majority,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/senate-approves-proposal-to-strip-confederate-names-from-army-bases-by-veto-proof-majority,"The Senate overwhelmingly approved a defense bill on Thursday that included Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) provision requiring the military to rename U.S. bases named after Confederate generals.

The bill passed by a vote of 86-14, a veto-proof majority that would override President Donald Trump’s effort to kill the measure, which he had threatened to do at the end of June after Warren announced her proposal.

“I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!” he tweeted at the time.

Warren slammed Trump’s hostile response on the Senate floor shortly afterward, declaring that the President had “chosen a well-worn path of hatred and division.”

“The Confederate soldiers who betrayed the United States to fight for the Confederacy were fighting for the institution of slavery. Plain. Simple. Ugly,” the Democratic senator said. “It is time to put the names of those leaders who fought and killed U.S. soldiers in defense of a perverted version of America where they belong, as footnotes in our history books, not plastered on our nation’s most significant military installations.”

There are currently ten Army bases named after Confederate generals."
"Burnout, stress lead more companies to try a four-day work week. It leads to higher productivity, more motivated staff.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-world-work-fourdayweek/burnout-stress-lead-more-companies-to-try-a-four-day-work-week-idUSKBN1OG0GY?utm_source=applenews,"(Corrects paragraph 4 to identify Perpetual Guardian as a trust company instead of an insurance company; corrects paragraph 13 to reflect that the study was conducted by Kronos and Future Workplace)

BERLIN (Reuters) - Work four days a week, but get paid for five?

It sounds too good to be true, but companies around the world that have cut their work week have found that it leads to higher productivity, more motivated staff and less burnout.

“It is much healthier and we do a better job if we’re not working crazy hours,” said Jan Schulz-Hofen, founder of Berlin-based project management software company Planio, who introduced a four-day week to the company’s 10-member staff earlier this year.

In New Zealand, trust company Perpetual Guardian reported a fall in stress and a jump in staff engagement after it tested a 32-hour week earlier this year.

Even in Japan, the government is encouraging companies to allow Monday mornings off, although other schemes in the workaholic country to persuade employees to take it easy have had little effect.

Britain’s Trades Union Congress (TUC) is pushing for the whole country to move to a four-day week by the end of the century, a drive supported by the opposition Labour party.

The TUC argues that a shorter week is a way for workers to share in the wealth generated by new technologies like machine learning and robotics, just as they won the right to the weekend off during the industrial revolution.

“It would reduce the stress of juggling working and family life and could improve gender equality. Companies that have already tried it say it’s better for productivity and staff wellbeing,” said TUC economic head Kate Bell.

OVERWORKED

Lucie Greene, trends expert at consultancy J. Walter Thompson, said there was a growing backlash against overwork, underlined by a wave of criticism after Tesla TSLA.O boss Elon Musk tweeted that ""nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.""

“People are starting to take a step back from the 24-hour digital life we have now and realize the mental health issues from being constantly connected to work,” Greene said.

A recent survey of 3,000 employees in eight countries including the United States, Britain and Germany found that nearly half thought they could easily finish their tasks in five hours a day if they did not have interruptions, but many are exceeding 40 hours a week anyway - with the United States leading the way, where 49 percent said they worked overtime.

“There has been work creep. Because you always have the technology, you are always working, so people are getting burned out,” said Dan Schawbel, director of executive development firm Future Workplace, which conducted the survey with Kronos.

Schulz-Hofen, a 36-year-old software engineer, tested the four-day week on himself after realizing he needed to slow down following a decade of intense work launching Planio, whose tools allowed him to track his time in detail.

“I didn’t get less work done in four days than in five because in five days, you think you have more time, you take longer, you allow yourself to have more interruptions, you have your coffee a bit longer or chat with colleagues,” Schulz-Hofen said.

“I realized with four days, I have to be quick, I have to be focused if I want to have my free Friday.”

Schulz-Hofen and his team discussed various options before settling on everybody working Monday to Thursday. They rejected the idea of flexible hours because it adds administrative complexity, and were against a five-day week with shorter hours as it is too easy for overwork to creep back in.

Clients who call on a Friday hear a recorded message explaining why nobody is at the office.

“We got an unexpected reaction from customers. Most of our clients did not complain. They were just jealous,” Schulz-Hofen said.

Grey New York, an ad agency owned by WPP WPP.L, launched a program in April to allow staff to work a four-day week for 85 percent of their full-time salary.

Schawbel expects the idea to catch on in more companies and countries, but probably not his own: “I think America will be the last country to give us Monday mornings off because we’re so used to this way of working.”"

"Kroger, America's largest supermarket chain to ban plastic checkout bags and transition to reusable ones and ultimately eliminate 123 million pounds of garbage annually sent to landfills",https://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2018/08/23/kroger-ban-plastic-checkout-bags-2025/1062241002/,"Kroger to ban plastic checkout bags by 2025. CEO Rodney McMullen says 'The plastic shopping bag's days are numbered.'

Kroger said it will ban all plastic checkout bags by 2025.

America's largest supermarket chain said it will transition from single-use to reusable bags and ultimately eliminate 123 million pounds of garbage annually sent to landfills. That would quadruple the amount of plastic the retailer currently recycles.

Kroger currently sells reusable bags starting at $1 each. Kroger will ramp up the availability of those bags. Shoppers for the foreseeable future will still have the option of asking for paper bags.

Kroger said it is also looking to cut back or phase out plastic bags for produce and meat, but it's focusing on eliminating checkout bags for now.

The ban will directly affect a wide swath of consumers: Kroger serves 9 million customers every day at its nearly 2,800 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia.

Kroger's Seattle-based QFC subsidiary, with 63 stores in the Pacific Northwest, will be the first division to eliminate the bags by 2019.

Besides hundreds of its namesake stores in the Midwest and the South, Kroger operates hundreds more under the Harris Teeter, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Fry's and other nameplates.

Kroger officials said they are responding to growing environmental concerns raised by shoppers, employees, communities and nonprofits.

""The plastic shopping bag’s days are numbered,"" Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen wrote in an editorial submitted to The Enquirer and USAToday. ""Our customers have told us it makes no sense to have so much plastic only to be used once before being discarded – And they’re exactly right.""

Kroger's decision will pressure other major competitors to follow suit. With nearly $123 billion in annual sales, Kroger is the second-largest grocer (behind Walmart, which is a mass discount retailer that gets half its $500 billion in sales from food).

""We're the first major retailer in the U.S. to do this,"" said Jessica Adelman, Kroger's vice president of corporate affairs, which oversees company environmental and sustainability efforts.

Kroger officials didn't spell out why it will take seven years to make the transition, saying completion will depend on how quickly consumers embrace the switch.

Kroger said it will order more reusable bags, market their availability, train checkout clerks to suggest them. Company officials said they'd like to get more customers using reusable bags to east the trasition before they remove plastic bags as an option.

Kroger uses 6 billion such bags annually, while the industry discards an estimated 100 billion bags each year.

Only 5 percent of supermarket bags are recycled by consumers. Last year, Kroger collected almost 38 million pounds of plastic for recycling in those in-store bins at the front of stores.

Additionally, Kroger recycled another 28 million pounds of plastic from other operations for a total of 66 million pounds.

The ban comes as individual cities concerned about environmental impact have moved to outlaw such waste.

Kroger officials said they decided to implement the transition at QFC because of the division's small size and half its stores already are under a ban enacted by Seattle in 2012.

The debate over plastic shopping bags has spread across the nation.

In 2016, a statewide referendum on California's 2016 ban of plastic bags fell short of repealing the law, so it remains in effect.

Kroger's Los Angeles-based subsidiary Ralphs operates under the California law. The legislation banned plastic single-use bags, but authorized a heavier plastic bag (different than standard reusable bags) designed for multiple uses that shoppers can buy for 10 cents apiece (the money goes to retailers for the expense of the bags).

Hawaii (where Kroger has no stores) has a de facto statewide as its largest counties have outlawed them.

Five things to know about Kroger Kroger is Cincinnati's largest employer. Here are five facts to know about the company.

Other cities that have enacted bans on plastic shopping bags are Austin, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Still, the Texas Supreme Court invalidated Austin's and other Lone Star municipalities' local bans this summer.

Other cities and counties that are beginning to crack down with fees are: Boulder, Colorado; Brownsville, Texas; Montgomery County, Maryland; New York City; Portland, Maine; and Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile, several states in the Midwest, South and the West have passed laws preventing local governments from enacting their own bans: Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri and Wisconsin.

""Though the majority of bills propose a ban or fee on bags, or improve recycling programs, most enacted legislation in recent years deals with preemption of local government action,"" said the National Conference of State Legislators in May.

LeBron James forms group to stop black voter suppression,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lebron-james-and-others-starting-voting-rights-group-amid-george-floyd-protests/,"LeBron James announced Wednesday that he and several other professional athletes plan to found a charitable organization to protect black Americans' voting rights, five months ahead of the presidential election, The New York Times reported.

The move comes as mammoth protests have swept the United States and the world calling for an end to hundreds of years of racial discrimination against black people.

""We feel like we're getting some ears and some attention, and this is the time for us to finally make a difference,"" James told the Times.

The organization, called More Than A Vote, aims to encourage African Americans to register to vote and to show up to the polls for the November 3 elections.

The group will also fight against any factors that could contribute to African Americans' disenfranchisement.

""Yes, we want you to go out and vote, but we're also going to give you the tutorial,"" James told the Times. ""We're going to give you the background of how to vote and what they're trying to do, the other side, to stop you from voting.""

James, who has more than 135 million followers across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, said he plans to use social media to denounce attempts to limit voting by racial minorities.

""King James"" himself will finance the project, joined by basketball players Trae Young and Jalen Rose, football player Alvin Kamara and comedian Kevin Hart.

The group plans to collaborate with other get-out-the-vote organizations, the newspaper reported, including When We All Vote and Fair Fight.

The initiative comes as the U.S. grapples with renewed anger over racism and police violence after the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who was killed last month when a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

James had expressed his own anger on Instagram, posting Floyd's last words ""I can't breathe.""

But James' voting rights move immediately drew pushback from leading Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, who tweeted about James' failure to back protesters there:

Defending democracy is vital, but @KingJames only talks loud in the US. On China, not only is he silent, he actively shuts others up. He called @dmorey ""misinformed"" and ""not really educated"" for supporting #HongKong. All he cares about is money, not human rights. Hypocritical. https://t.co/vxVMWIjsjY — Joshua Wong 黃之鋒 😷 (@joshuawongcf) June 11, 2020

The voting movement is not the Los Angeles Laker's first foray into politics. He appeared at a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Nor is it his first charitable endeavor: He has offered university scholarships through the LeBron James Family Foundation and even set up a school for third through eighth graders in his home state of Ohio.

James also heads a production studio producing a documentary about the massacre of approximately 300 African Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921."
Killing hatred with kindness: Black man has convinced 200 racists to abandon the KKK by making friends with them despite their prejudiced views,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4055162/Killing-hatred-kindness-Black-man-convinced-200-racists-abandon-KKK-making-friends-despite-prejudiced-views.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link&ICID=ref_fark,"He said he had to beat up two KKK followers after they

A black man has single-handedly caused more than 200 white racists to leave the Ku Klux Klan simply by confronting their prejudice with friendship.

Inspirational Daryl Davis, 58, a blues musician and author, has travelled all over the US since the early 1980s actively seeking out and befriending members of the openly racist organisation.

The KKK is a white supremacy cult founded in 1865 organizing members to persecute people for the color of their skin or their religious beliefs.

Daryl Davis stands at a burning of the cross ceremony with KKK members in the background. The burning is synonymous with the group who do it as a mark of their religion and for intimidation

But Daryl Davis has been battling the hatred and answering a call he has felt since he was a young man when he decided to confront the ideology of the KKK head-on one member at a time.

He has since documented his incredible mission in the book 'Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man's Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan' which is set to be re-released with an updated version next year.

Daryl, from Chicago, has also found time for a celebrated music career in R&B and blues, playing alongside the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and former President Bill Clinton, and he counted the legendary Muddy Waters among his friends.

Daryl said: 'Music absolutely played a massive role in bridging many gaps in the racial divides I would encounter. Once when I was performing in a predominantly white venue, a white man approached me on my break and put his arm around me and exclaimed, ""This is the first time I've ever heard a black man play piano like Jerry Lee Lewis.""

The musician has met many prominent members of the white supremacist group and has made friends along the way

'I quickly enlightened him as to the origin of Jerry Lee's music and told him that Jerry Lee had learned that style from black Boogie Woogie and blues piano players.

'The man did not believe me, despite the fact that I further told him that Jerry Lee was a good friend of mine and he had told me himself where he learned that style. But, the gentleman was fascinated with the idea that a black man could play like that.

'He was curious and wanted to learn more about me. It was then revealed to me by him that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Over time, he and I became good friends. He ended up leaving the KKK.'

Daryl said he is never unprepared for violence from those he meets, as any member he confronts can potentially be someone who would want to do him harm. In those rare cases, he said one of them ended up in hospital and the other in jail.

'Some of them are absolutely repulsed when they see a black person and want to hurt that person,' said Daryl

He said: 'There have been some incidents in which I was threatened and a couple of instances where I had to physically fight. Fortunately, I won in both instances.

'These things happen from time to time, but it is to be expected, because you are dealing with someone who hates you and wants to be violent just because of the colour of your skin.

'Some of them are absolutely repulsed when they see a black person and want to hurt that person. At the core of it, although they won't at first admit it, they express superiority, but truly feel inferiority and in order to elevate themselves, they have to push someone else down.'

A meeting that could have ended up in violence was when Daryl met a Grand Dragon, a rank in the KKK, in Maryland, a man called Roger Kelly.

Daryl said: 'I was very well prepared for the meeting in terms of knowledge of my topic. I have just about every book written on the Klan and I've read them all.

'In fact, I know more about the KKK than most Klan members know about their own organisation. Knowledge, information, wit, and the way you disseminate these attributes can often prove to be a more disarming weapon against an enemy or some with whom your ideology is in conflict, than violence or lethal weapons.

'I was heavily armed with those attributes. I had been told by someone who knew him very well, that Roger Kelly would kill me. I felt confident without any physical weapon that I would prevail. Fortunately, I proved it true.'

In fact Daryl said he was so successful in his prevailing that the KKK 'branch' in Maryland is now non-existent, with perhaps four people turning up for a meeting 'and two of them are drunk'.

The KKK calls for the white 'purification' of the US and have killed black people in its long history

He said: 'It's a wonderful thing when you see a light bulb pop on in their heads or they call you and tell you they are quitting.

'I never set out to convert anyone in the Klan. I just set out to get an answer to my question: ""How can you hate me when you don't even know me?""

'I simply gave them a chance to get to know me and treat them the way I want to be treated. They come to their own conclusion that this ideology is no longer for them. I am often the impetus for coming to that conclusion and I'm very happy that some positivity has come out of my meetings and friendships with them.

Daryl traveled a lot as a child as his parents served with the American Foreign Service, and he said it was that experience of different cultures that helped him see just how alien the idea of racism is..

Daryl at another KKK burning of the cross even. He also alluded to the US election saying that all racists he knows voted for Donald Trump but not all Trump supporters are racist

He said: 'When I would return home every two years, it baffled me as to why people judged others by their skin colour. This was a very strange concept to me.

'This is a quote from the American author Mark Twain, which I find to be most accurate: 'Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime'.'

Despite his incredible work Daryl does receive some mixed reactions to making friendships with people who have held such extremist views.

He said: 'There was surprise and shock on both sides (black and white), mostly from people who don't know me, or who haven't bothered to research me, read up on me, or hear my interviews or lectures.

'Not all, but most of the criticism has come from black people. I have been called a 'sellout', 'Uncle Tom', 'Oreo' and a number of other terrible names.

'Unfortunately, I must compare these particular black people with the KKK and other white supremacist groups, with no distinction, other than the colour of their skin.

Davis with a Klan member. He said that most racists he knows voted for Donald Trump in the November presidential election

'This is because they are engaging in the exact same hateful behaviour as they accuse the white racists. I can explain it like this, because I've seen it on both sides.

Daryl said America today was probably less racist than it had been in the past but that he continues his work every day.

'In Israel, it's Palestinian versus. Jew. In Lebanon, it's Christian versus. Muslim. In Iraq, it's Sunni Muslim versus Shiite Muslim. In certain African countries, the conflict is tribal. In India, we see a caste system based on the shade of skin color and classicism.

'There has always been a great deal of racism in the U.S. before and after Obama. However, racism in the US is down, post Obama.

'What you are seeing is those people who were dormant racists, being given a new lease on life by the sentiments of our new President-Elect."
Kelloggs is using rejected cornflakes to make beer in an effort to cut down on food waste,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/12/05/kelloggs-use-rejected-cornflakes-make-beer-bid-cut-food-waste/,"Consumers concerned about their carbon footprint will soon be able to drink beer and assuage their guilt over the environment at the same time as Kelloggs releases a beer made from leftover cornflakes.

As shoppers increasingly worry about the environmental impact of their purchases, companies have had to find creative ways to minimise food waste.

The cereal company is the latest to join this trend, making beer out of the cornflakes at their factories which would otherwise be waste product.

‘Throw Away IPA’, made by Seven Bro7thers Brewery in Manchester, uses ""upcycled"" cornflakes which are too big, small or overcooked to go in a box of breakfast cereal as a proportion of the wheat grain which goes into the beer.

A spokesperson for Kelloggs said that around 30 per cent of the grain content of the beer will be cornflakes, and 70 per cent wheat.

It is added during the ""mash"" process and reportedly sweetens the taste.

The IPA, which is ""cornflake golden"" in colour, is also helping food distribution charity FareShare, as 10p from each can purchased will be donated to the cause.

Corporate social responsibility manager for Kellogg’s UK, Kate Prince, said: “Kellogg’s is always exploring different and sustainable ways to reduce food waste in its factories. So it is great to be involved in such a fun initiative with a local supplier."
"To help his grandmother stay hydrated, man creates “water you can eat” Jelly Drops that look like candy and appeal to people with dementia.",https://blog.thealzheimerssite.com/jelly-drops/,"People with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia often suffer from dehydration issues for a variety of reasons. One of those reasons is that dementia patients may simply forget to drink water or forget where to find water, even if there’s a cup of it on the nightstand, inches away from them. Others may no longer find water palatable and forget that it is necessary, since they might not feel thirsty. Still others may even forget how to drink water or how to swallow. Dementia patients who suffer from dysphagia—a swallowing difficulty—often have a hard time swallowing thin liquids and require thickening agents to help them get the hydration they need.

When a patient reaches the last stages of dementia and is no longer getting the water they need due to one of the reasons listed above, they rely on the help of caretakers to provide water-laden foods and thickened or flavored beverages to combat dehydration.

None of the current methods will prevent people with dementia from dying of their disease, as there is currently no cure for the issue. But getting creative with hydration techniques can keep people with memory loss problems from experiencing the discomfort and pain of excessive thirst, developing other dehydration-related health issues, and even dying of dehydration.

A young man named Lewis Hornby noticed that his grandmother, who suffers from dementia, was not getting enough to drink and decided to invent something that would make it easier for her to get the fluids she needed. So he used sensory deprivation tools and VR tools to get a better understanding of the issue, spoke with a dementia psychologist, spent a week living in a dementia care home, consulted with doctors about how to create a hydrating product, and returned to the care home several times to test the prototypes of his project. All in an effort to do something to help.

“For people with dementia the symptoms of dehydration are often mistakenly attributed to their underlying condition, meaning it can easily go unnoticed until it becomes life-threatening,” Hornby writes on the James Dyson Award website. “About a year ago my grandma was unexpectedly rushed to hospital, she was found to be severely dehydrated. Thankfully, after 24 hours on IV fluids she was back to her normal happy self, and is still enjoying a good quality of life to this day.”

What Hornby came up with were Jelly Drops—brightly colored bite-sized balls of liquid that are easier to swallow than water but just as hydrating. The drops are made of 90 percent water with gelling agents and electrolytes to aid in hydration.

The drops don’t require any utensils, are firm and easy to grasp, and don’t leave any residue on the hands. The packaging doesn’t look like a medical device of any sort, so it’s not threatening; instead, it looks like an inviting box of candies.

Hornby says he’s found that people with dementia immediately recognize the colorful Jelly Drops as a treat and are eager to eat them, even if they would normally turn down other types of food or drinks.

“When first offered, grandma ate 7 Jelly Drops in 10 minutes,” says Hornby, “the equivalent to a cup full of water, something that would usually take hours and require much more assistance.”

Hornby carefully thought through the packaging of his Jelly Drops as well. The clear plastic box allows patients to see the goodies inside without lifting the lid, making the Jelly Drops easier to find if misplaced and easier to remember to eat. There’s also a special handle on one corner so that users can open the lid without putting down the box. Then a locking hinge holds the lid in its upright position, freeing a hand to eat with. This is particularly important since many dementia patients struggle to plan and execute sequences of actions.

Jelly Drops have won the Helen Hamlyn Design Award, Snowdon Award for Disability, and the Dyson School of Design Engineering DESIRE Award for Social Impact. They are being trialed in other care homes in the UK, and Hornby hopes to do more research and begin production of his drops soon. Hopefully this ingenious invention will help thousands of current and future dementia patients get the hydration they need to stay comfortable, healthy, and alive—and enjoy it at the same time!

Check out the video below to see how much Hornby’s Grandma Pat enjoys her Jelly Drops!

Thank you, Lewis Hornby, for harnessing your compassion for your grandmother into an innovative product that will help so many people get the fluids they need to survive. Your creativity and dedication are admirable, and the world needs more people like you!"

The BBC has confirmed that the first three episodes of Planet Earth II have attracted more viewers in the 16 to 34 age bracket than The X Factor on ITV.

Sir David Attenborough credited improvements in technology with the show’s increased success in its second season, which have brought animals closer to the viewer than ever through the use of remote cameras and made their environments look stunningly high-definition and real.

“I’m told that we are attracting a larger than normal number of younger viewers and apparently the music of Hans Zimmer in particular is striking a chord,” the naturalist added to the Radio Times. “That pleases me enormously.”

Aside from technology and sound editing changes, Attenborough said that he believes viewers are simply “reconnecting with a planet whose beauty is blemished and whose health is failing”, growing to understand that their futures and that of the planet are inextricably linked.

Planet Earth II’s best ratings so far were for the Mountains-centric second episode, which brought in 1.8 million young viewers compared to The X Factor’s 1.4 million that week. ITV confirmed similar figures to The Times, albeit with a smaller margin.

“Visually, where Planet Earth took an almost God-like perspective and said ‘Let’s look down on the Earth and see the scale of the planet’, what Planet Earth II is doing is saying ‘Let’s get ourselves into the lives of the animals, and see it from their perspective,’” series producer Mike Gunton said recently.

The global crackdown on parents who refuse vaccines for their kids has begun: Countries like Italy and Australia are tired of measles outbreaks — so they're moving to fine anti-vaccine parents.,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/3/16069204/vaccine-fines-measles-outbreaks-europe-australia,"There’s a school of thought that refusing vaccines on behalf of your children amounts to child abuse, and that parents should be punished for their decision. We know vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective at preventing the spread of disease, and failing to immunize children can put them (and vulnerable people around them) at tremendous risk of illness or even death when outbreaks occur.

Now it seems that Germany, Australia, and a number of other countries are fed up enough with vaccine-refusing parents that they’re experimenting with punitive measures. We haven’t quite reached the level of child abuse charges, but moms and dads in these countries may face fines if they fail to give their kids the recommended shots. In Australia, the directors of schools that let in the unvaccinated kids would be fined, too.

This marks a pretty aggressive shift in how we manage vaccine refusers and the costly, deadly outbreaks of diseases like measles and whooping cough they help spark.

Here’s a quick roundup of the global crackdown on vaccine-refusing parents:

In Germany on Thursday, lawmakers passed a law stating that parents need to prove they’ve vaccinated their kids against measles — or risk fines up to €2,500 (about $2,750). Unvaccinated children also risk losing their places in school.

on Thursday, lawmakers passed a law stating that parents need to prove they’ve vaccinated their kids against measles — or risk fines up to €2,500 (about $2,750). Unvaccinated children also risk losing their places in school. Italy’s parliament passed a law that makes 10 childhood vaccinations mandatory for kids up to age 16, and requires parents to prove their children are immunized before entering school or else face a €500 (about $560) noncompliance fine. And kids who aren’t vaccinated are being told not to come to school.

And kids who aren’t vaccinated are being told not to come to school. In France , the health ministry made 11 vaccines — up from the current three (diphtheria, tetanus, and polio) — mandatory for children, though there’s no talk of a fine yet.

Further afield, New South Wales , Australia , passed “no jab, no play” legislation in September 2017: The law bans unvaccinated kids from preschool and day care and fine the directors of schools that admit un-immunized children $5,500 Australian dollars ($4,400). The law in New South Wales is modeled on similarly stringent laws in other Australian states, and across the country, parents with children who aren’t immunized aren’t eligible for child care benefits.

The law in New South Wales is modeled on similarly stringent laws in other Australian states, and across the country, parents with children who aren’t immunized aren’t eligible for child care benefits. In the US, New York — where a large measles outbreak raged on for nearly a year — the government threatened parents who don’t vaccinate their children with a fine of up to $1,000.

These fines come amid a growing problem with measles globally. Over the past two years, measles cases have been edging up in countries around the world, with a 300 percent rise in cases over the same period in 2018, according to the World Health Organization.

Many countries where measles had been declared eliminated have recently lost that status, including Britain, Greece, Brazil, France, and Germany. With more than 1,200 measles cases this year — the largest number for any year since 1992 — the US also nearly lost its measles elimination status.

Before we consider punishing American parents, we might try this

Here, vaccine skeptics have also been persuading more parents in a number of states to refuse shots for their children. So is the US ready for a similar crackdown?

Punishing parents for doing things that could harm their kids is not without precedent in the US. For example, there are laws in various states requiring parents to use car seats or seat belts for their children or else pay a fine or be docked driver's license points. Same goes for firearm storage laws.

But before we start fining anti-vaxxers, there are some much more basic steps the US could take that would improve vaccination rates. And they involve simply making it harder for parents to opt out of routine shots on behalf of their kids.

Vaccines fall under the public health jurisdiction of the states. And there’s currently a lot of variation across the US when it comes to immunization requirements.

Even though all 50 states have legislation requiring vaccines for students entering school, 45 states allow exemptions for people with religious beliefs against immunizations, and 15 states currently grant philosophical exemptions for those opposed to vaccines because of personal or moral beliefs. (The exceptions are Mississippi, California, and West Virginia, and more recently, New York, and Maine, which now have the strictest vaccine laws in the nation, allowing only medical exemptions.)

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the parts of the country that make it easier for people to opt out of their shots tend to have higher rates of ... people opting out of vaccines. So a lax regulatory environment can create space for more parents to refuse vaccines.

That’s why some states have been moving to crack down on this trend — most notably California — which is already seeing success in terms of boosting vaccine coverage rates.

In 2015, another measles outbreak prompted California’s former governor, Jerry Brown, to sign a bill, SB277, that abolished all nonmedical exemptions. And the California experience is instructive for other states that might want to close some of their loopholes.

According to the state health department, the number of kindergarten students in the 2017-2018 school year with all their required vaccines was 95.1 percent — a 4.7 percentage point increase over 2014-2015 and the second highest reported vaccine rate since health authorities started tracking. A recent analysis, published in JAMA, put the opt-out rate at 4.8 percent by 2017.

Hidden within that increase is some conflicting data, said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. Since the law was enacted, medical exemptions have also increased, suggesting there may be an unintended effect of the crackdown on nonmedical exemptions.

That’s because something else was going on in California, and it offset that increase in medical exemptions: In parallel with abolishing nonmedical exemptions through SB277, California launched the “Conditional Entrant Intervention Project” in 2015. The idea was that public health professionals would work with local health departments to identify schools granting high rates of conditional entrants, and work with them to bring them down.

Between 2014 and 2015, Omer and his colleagues found a sharp 23 percent decline in the conditional admission rate. So even with the rise in medical exemptions, the overall vaccine exemption rate still went down thanks to the decline in conditional vaccine entry to schools.

Omer told Vox, “I’m not discounting eliminating nonmedical exemptions. It’s a reasonable option. But it may not resolve all issues.” That’s why California is now cracking down on bogus medical exemptions, too.

That means simply outlawing nonmedical exemptions may not be a panacea in states that have a high percentage of parents using their social capital to spread anti-vaccine views. And as we saw in California, a ban on nonmedical exemptions could even backfire if other vaccine loopholes are left open.

But lawmakers should look for ways that make it more inconvenient to opt out — by doing things like introducing exemptions with regular renewals. Fewer than a dozen states require annual — or more frequent — recertification for medical exemptions. So for example, if a child in a K-12 school gets an exemption in kindergarten, it will follow them through to college. She’ll never be asked to renew that exemption. Or, lawmakers could crack down on the conditional entry to school.

And they should move fast. The percentage of people seeking nonmedical exemptions — while still small — has also been creeping upward, from 1.1 percent in 2009-2010 to 2.2 percent by 2017-2018. Outbreaks in recent years have also been getting larger, Omer said. “That’s the canary in the coal mine for me.”"
New York City has banned styrofoam!,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/business/new-york-styrofoam-ban-trnd/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) New York City will begin officially enforcing its ban on styrofoam beginning Monday.

The ban largely affects food establishments that have used styrofoam for take-out or large beverages, and it alsoprohibits stores from selling ""packing peanuts."" Businesses are encouraged to switch to compostable materials, including paper.

The city banned styrofoam, also known as polystyrene, because the material can't be ""recycled in a manner that is economically feasible"" or ""environmentally effective"" in its recycling program. Violators will be fined $250 for the first offense, $500 for a second offense and $1,000 for third offenses and beyond.

""There's no reason to continue allowing this environmentally unfriendly substance to flood our streets, landfills and waterways.""

The styrofoam ban in New York makes it the largest US city to ban the material. Other cities that have banned it include San Diego, Miami Beach, Seattle and Washington, DC. The material is considered environmentally unfriendly because it breaks into smaller pieces and is hard to clean up. It also absorbs toxins faster than other plastics, and it is not biodegradable."

SANTA FE – About 250 people amassed at the state Capitol late Friday afternoon for a peaceful protest, joining hundreds of thousands of people across the country demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died at the hands of white police officers in Minneapolis on Monday.

The demonstration, organized through social media, came a day after protesters in Minneapolis set fire to a police station and other buildings, resulting in the National Guard being deployed. That same night in Albuquerque, police in riot gear used tear gas in a confrontation with protesters and several arrests were made.

A New Mexico State Police helicopter circled overhead at the Santa Fe demonstration.

Santa Fe police showed up briefly after protesters took to the streets and marched to the downtown plaza and back, but left soon thereafter. After most of the crowd dispersed, about 50 protesters lingered and continued the demonstration at the intersection of Paseo de Peralta and Old Santa Fe Trail, shouting at passing vehicles, some of which answered back by honking their horns.

“I think everyone has had enough. There needs to be change,” said 17-year-old Abby Bay, one of the people who spread the word about the protest on Facebook. “What happened in Minneapolis, it could happen anywhere, even here.”

Lacking an organizer, several people stepped up to lead the crowd in chants of “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe,” the latter words spoken by Floyd as a Minneapolis police officer pressed him to the ground with a knee to his neck.

“We’re standing up for the injustices against black people,” said Lonnica Montoya, who led most of the chants.

At one point, Montoya read the names of several dozen black citizens who have died at the hands of police.

Another woman, Amy Linquist, led the protesters in a song called “Somebody’s Hurting My Brother,” which she said grew out of the Poor People’s Campaign.

Protesters also carried signs, some reading “There’s power in Unity” and “Complacency = Complicity.”

Holding a sign that said “I can’t breathe,” Derrick Gomez was one of fewer than a dozen African Americans at the demonstration.

“What’s going on in Minneapolis with the riots and looting, and in Albuquerque with police and their guns, we’re here with just signs,” he said. “We have to stand up for what we believe in.”

Gomez, who grew up in Santa Fe, where fewer than 1% of people identify as black or African American, said he’s experienced racism all his life.

“It’s great to see the diversity here, especially here in New Mexico, where our culture is rich,” he said. “It’s moving that people here do care.”

Gomez said he hoped the protests being held across the country will make a difference and change attitudes about racism in America.

“As long as we continue, they have to listen to us at some point,” he said. “The moment we quit is the moment they win.”"
Afghan translator who saved US lives becomes a US citizen,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/us/july-4-afghan-translator-american-citizen-cnnheroes-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Janis Shinwari is celebrating his first Fourth of July as a US citizen.

His journey to the US started on the battlefield in his native Afghanistan. Shinwari, 42, served nine years as a translator for US forces, knowing he was risking his life and endangering his family.

During that span, Shinwari saved the lives of several US soldiers, including one who helped bring Shinwari and his family to the US.

""If I was in Afghanistan -- if I didn't come here, I wouldn't be alive now. I would be dead."" Shinwari told CNN Heroes in 2018.

At the time he recalled his decision to side with US soldiers after seeing the Taliban regime's terror firsthand. Shinwari knew the US needed translators, but he also understood the dangers.

""If the Taliban catch you, they will torture you in front of your kids and families and make a film of you and then send it to other translators as a warning message to stop working with the American forces,"" Shinwari said.

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli administered the oath of allegiance to Shinwari and his wife on Monday in Fairfax, Virginia. Cuccinelli honored Shinwari for his service and for saving the lives of five American soldiers.

ICYMI: Yesterday, @HomelandKen joined a naturalization ceremony welcoming 20 #NewUSCitizens at our Washington office. Included were Mr. Janis Shinwari & his wife. Shinwari was a translator alongside our troops in Afghanistan & saved the lives of 5 Americans. Congrats to all! pic.twitter.com/CJgrqIiMBb — USCIS (@USCIS) June 30, 2020

During one particularly fierce battle in April 2008 , Shinwari saved the life of Capt. Matt Zeller, an American soldier he had only met days earlier. Zeller's unit was on routine patrol near the village of Waghez in Ghazni province when the Taliban attacked. They lost a vehicle and found themselves outnumbered and outgunned.

In 2018, Zeller told CNN Heroes he was knocked out when a mortar round exploded, knocking him into a ditch. As he regained his senses, he believed he was about to die.

""I was going to make sort of peace with my fate and I was going to go out fighting,"" he said.

What Zeller didn't realize was two Taliban fighters were approaching him. That's when Shinwari, who had been crawling through bushes, shot and killed them. Zeller recalled Shinwari standing above him and saying, ""I'm Janis. And I'm one of your translators. You're not safe."" Shinwari recalled getting Zeller to safety and creating an unbreakable bond.

""Since that time, we become even closer than brothers,"" Shinwari said.

After that, the Taliban placed Shinwari on a hit list that targeted translators working with US troops. He reached out to Zeller to help him obtain a visa to come to the US. Shinwari said he expected the process to ""take a couple of months. But it took years.""

During that time, the 38-year-old Zeller worked tirelessly to help Shinwari. He launched a Change.org petition and reached out to his connections in Congress.

""I just basically asked anyone who would listen, 'Will you help me? I owe this person my life. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I will cash in and call in whatever favor. I will owe whatever it is that I need to owe. Tell me what it is that I need to do to get you to help me,'"" Zeller told CNN.

Janis Shinwari and Matt Zeller

Shinwari and his family finally obtained a visa in 2013. Once in the United States, Zeller helped the Shinwaris settle into their new home. He helped Shinwari find a job, obtain a car, and guided the Shinwaris through their first year in America. Zeller even set up a GoFundMe that raised $35,000 for the Shinwaris' expenses.

But Shinwari thought about the other translators who were still in danger in Afghanistan and Iraq.

""We are happy. But I'm not happy about my coworkers, about my brothers and sisters that served the US government in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they are still left behind,"" he said. ""I will fight for them, to get them here. And we will not stop fighting. It doesn't matter how long does it take. But I will fight for them.""

So Shinwari and Zeller used part of the money to create No One Left Behind , a non-profit that has helped thousands of combat translators resettle in the US.

The group has since helped more than 5,000 translators and their families come to the US, guiding them through the visa process. The organization provides resettlement and support services upon their arrival, such as finding permanent housing, home furnishings, job placement and language skills.

""I will not stop fighting until I get the last translator what's left behind,"" Shinwari said. ""I promise them that I will never forget about my brothers and sisters that they are still left behind in Iraq and Afghanistan."""
"Salt Lake mayor goes under cover, stays in homeless shelter to get information about growing homelessness issues.",http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865686230/I-didnt-feel-safe-Mayor-Ben-McAdams-describes-secret-nights-on-street-in-shelter.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — For four months, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams has kept a secret.

He's shared it with perhaps a handful of people in political circles — but kept it out of headlines, hoping to avoid the perception, he said, of a ""publicity stunt in the face of human suffering.""

Back in March, just days before he was due by state law to select a third site for a new homeless resource center — a decision he knew would anger thousands of his constituents, regardless of his choice — McAdams left work on a Friday with no money or ID and walked to Salt Lake City's most troubled neighborhood.

Dressed in jeans, sneakers and a hoodie, the county mayor spent three days and two nights walking and sleeping among the homeless and drug-addicted in Salt Lake City's Rio Grande neighborhood.

One night on the street. One night in the shelter.

His experience was ""shocking"" on multiple levels, he said. And while he by no means meant his experience to be an ""expose"" on the Road Home shelter, an important stakeholder in homeless services reform, his stay did shed light on some troubling realities within the 1,062-bed shelter, including:

• Blatant use of drugs inside the men's dorms, including his bunkmate injecting drugs into his arm — though he declined to discuss details about that encounter with the Deseret News.

• He smelled what he assumed was smoke from drugs ""all night long.""

• He witnessed violence — a fight between two men in the dorms, during which a man was dragged off of his bunk and hit his head on the concrete floor.

• He didn't feel safe — and could see why someone would take their chances on the streets in 40-degree rainy weather rather than spend a night in the downtown shelter.

The county mayor has kept his experience private for months. But after the Deseret News learned of the overnight stays from a source and requested an interview, McAdams eventually — reluctantly — agreed to discuss it this week with the Deseret News and Salt Lake Tribune.

His reasoning for keeping it quiet? He was worried it would appear as a ""cheap stunt"" to the press and public.

""I was concerned that it not look like a publicity stunt in the face of human suffering,"" the mayor said.

The purpose of the stay, McAdams said, was not to go undercover and expose the troubles homeless providers face while trying to serve Utah's most vulnerable. Rather, it was meant to help him ""deepen"" his understanding of the current homeless system before he decided which city would house a third homeless resource center.

At the time, McAdams had endured nearly a month of heated public meetings and fury from residents in West Valley City, South Salt Lake and Draper over the thought that their cities would house a homeless shelter — though he and other homeless leaders have promised the new resource centers will be drastically different than the downtown emergency shelter.

McAdams said he felt something was ""missing"" from the hours of public input and even the more than two years he and his team have spent drafting a plan to reform the county's homeless services.

""I needed to see firsthand, to understand the complexity of the recommendation I was being asked to make,"" he said.

The experience ""instilled in me a conviction that we had to move forward,"" McAdams said, during a time when many of his constituents were pushing back against years of effort to reform the homeless system.

""There were many people saying, 'Back away and do nothing,'"" McAdams said. ""Seeing what I saw … was shocking, and I came away from this experience knowing we had to go forward, we had to change the system, that we as a community had kicked the can down the road for decades and just looked the other way.""

Inside the shelter

After talking it over with his wife, who ""was, of course, hesitant,"" McAdams said he left his wallet behind at his county office at 5 p.m. on Friday, March 24. Wearing a change of clothes, he and a county employee — who declined to be named for this story — left on foot to the Rio Grande neighborhood.

He noted that he made an anonymous donation to a homeless providers account for the services he used on those two nights.

Not disclosing who he was, McAdams said he and his employee spent the first night on a street outside the Rio Grande area to ""understand why some people would choose not to go into shelter.""

""It was cold — below 40s,"" the mayor said. When he woke up, it was raining. ""You wonder why people would choose to do that, knowing that there were beds available in the shelter.""

But the next night, McAdams understood why.

The Deseret News learned from two other people that after McAdams had checked into the men's dorms, he saw his bunkmate injecting drugs into his arm. When asked about that incident, McAdams declined to discuss it.

""I don't want to focus on my brief firsthand experience because I know there are people who see the same and worse every single day,"" he explained. ""The things I saw in my very brief time were shocking and reaffirmed my commitment to take action now.""

But the mayor did say in general terms that he saw evidence of drug use, including the presence of what he assumed was the smell of smoke from drugs ""all night long"" while he tried to sleep.

About 20 feet away from his bunk, McAdams also said an ""altercation"" broke out between two men. One dragged the other off his bunk and his head hit the concrete.

People also warned him not to take off his shoes — that they would be stolen if he did. They also told him to use his bag as a pillow because if he didn't keep a close eye on his belongings, they would be taken.

""One person told me to be sure not to use the restroom at night because it wasn't safe,"" McAdams added. The man didn't elaborate, but McAdams said he assumed it was a reference to sexual violence.

""I didn't feel safe,"" he said. ""It was a fairly chaotic environment.""

He added: ""I certainly could understand why people would choose not to sleep there.""

He said if he were addicted to drugs, he would know ""the Rio Grande area is not the place to go"" to kick the habit, adding that ""drug dealing is at every corner.""

McAdams also said he was ""most troubled"" that children were exposed to such conditions.

He told about meeting a young family with a child diagnosed with mild autism. The child was 9 years old — the same age of one of McAdams' kids.

""What psychological trauma is probably inflicted on a child who doesn't know where he's going to sleep or where his next meal is going to come from?"" he asked. ""It deepened in me a commitment that we've got to do better for these kids.""

In the months since McAdams' visit, the Road Home met its July 15 deadline to have all families with children relocated out of the downtown shelter into housing or to the family shelter in Midvale.

Shelter challenges

The Road Home has a no-drugs policy inside its shelters.

Matt Minkevitch, the Road Home shelter's executive director, didn't know about McAdams' stay until the Deseret News informed him about it this week.

When told what the mayor had witnessed — including the drug use and violence — Minkevitch called the events ""unfortunate"" and ""concerning.""

He said the shelter has around-the-clock security that patrols the shelter and screens for drugs before clients are allowed in, and the shelter has ""zero tolerance"" for violence.

""We do our best to make sure that when we find somebody using drugs, we escort them off the property,"" Minkevitch said. ""And violent behavior is something we do not tolerate at all.""

Minkevitch, after pulling incident files of that night, March 25, did find a report of an altercation that security responded to, though it's not clear if it was the same fight that McAdams witnessed.

""It's not uncommon for us to deal with people who are in the throes of addiction,"" Minkevitch said, admitting that there have been incidents when drugs have been brought into the shelter.

""There will always be a margin of error,"" he said, adding that even in secure environments like prisons, people still find ways to sneak in drugs.

""It's unfortunate that it's happening — unfortunate that it's happening anywhere,"" Minkevitch said, noting that the national opioid crisis has created a ""particularly challenging problem"" for homeless shelters across the country.

That night there were likely about 600 men in the shelter — a large number of people for one shelter to manage. Minkevitch said the shelters in Utah are ""under so much stress right now,"" noting that the Road Home's capacity has grown over the years to accommodate demand.

Minkevitch said the correct combination of affordable housing, and substance abuse and mental health treatment would help lift the burden off emergency shelters and help prevent the mixture of drugs and violence with people experiencing homelessness.

Not an 'expose'

McAdams emphasized he didn't ""do this as an expose"" or to start a debate about the Road Home.

""I get that there are a lot of providers who are trying really hard to do good work, and I don't want my comments in any way to be an expose on them,"" he said. ""I think we have a lot of great service providers trying really hard under impossible circumstances to do what they think is right.""

Most of all, McAdams said his experience ""reaffirms the conclusion"" leaders have reached that the current homeless model needs to change and that immediate actions need to be taken to improve public safety in and around the shelter.

Minkevitch said he understands why McAdams would ""be compelled"" to spend a night in the shelter — though it's not something he would encourage for the ""average person"" because it might mean the sacrifice of a bed for a person in need.

""I respect (the mayor) for undertaking this in order to gain perspective to make an informed decision,"" Minkevitch said. ""He faced a daunting task, a very short window in order to make a very important decision.""

McAdams said he walked away from the experience knowing that ""doing nothing is not an option, even if it's the end of me politically.""

He recalled a reporter asking him during a press conference the day he selected the South Salt Lake site whether he felt the situation has damaged his political career.

""I almost broke down in tears,"" McAdams said.

At the time, he had paused before he answered with a smile: ""Yes.""

""I knew when I accepted this task that it would come with consequences for me personally,"" he said. ""But this work isn't about me personally. It's about doing the right thing for people who are in crisis. … If I have to pay a personal price for moving this work forward, it's a price I'm willing to pay.

""I ran for office to make a difference,"" McAdams continued, ""not to have a job.""

This week, McAdams stood by that answer, saying, ""I had a decision to protect myself or to take action to address this problem, and it was one or the other.""

'Woken up'

In the months since, state leaders including Gov. Gary Herbert and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox have joined House Speaker Greg Hughes in addressing the ""lawlessness"" in the area — a plan Cox, the state's ""point person,"" has coined ""Operation Rio Grande.""

Though the details of that plan have not been unveiled, McAdams sat in on an hourslong meeting last week with state and city leaders to start coordinating an effort that McAdams said he's ""delighted"" to see coming to fruition.

""One of my frustrations at the time was that I felt that I was alone,"" he said. ""Political leaders for decades have kicked the can down the road, and I knew that we had to do something.""

""Speaker Hughes, to his credit, was with me,"" McAdams added, but ""nobody else seemed to care.""

Hughes said he knew McAdams had stayed at the Road Home but agreed to keep it a secret at McAdams' request.

Hughes said McAdams' experience ""opened my eyes"" and was ""absolutely"" an influencing factor in his motivation to step in over the past several months and push harder for better control of the lawlessness in the area.

""It without a doubt informed my approach and my sence of urgency,"" the speaker said. ""It has provided invaluable information for me and has really informed my decision-making process.""

McAdams said he's ""ecstatic"" that the governor has ""finally woken up and realized they cannot sit on the sidelines any longer.""

He just wishes it hadn't taken this long.

Revamping the system, he said, ""can't happen fast enough.""

The Road Home's downtown shelter is under a state-mandated deadline to close in June 2019, when the three new homeless resource centers come online.

"Belize, home of the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere, has permanently suspended oil operations in its ocean waters.",https://www.ecowatch.com/belize-offshore-drilling-wwf-2522728566.amp.html,"Belize, home of the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere, has permanently suspended oil operations in its ocean waters. The legislation marks the first time that a developing country has taken such a major step to protect its oceans—and all the life within—from oil exploration and extraction.

The new suspension of oil activity marks an enormous win for the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System World Heritage site, the wildlife that live there, and the hundreds of thousands of Belizeans who rely on the reef for survival.

""Today is a great day for Belize,"" said Nadia Bood, Mesoamerican reef scientist at World Wildlife Fund (WWF). ""Not only has its government listened to calls to protect the Belize Barrier Reef, which only last year was under threat from seismic oil exploration, it has stepped up to become a world leader in ocean protection by ending all oil activity in its waters.""

Ecosystems in the reef have already been damaged by coastal construction, and potential oil drilling posed a major threat. Harmful industrial activities would impact Belize's economy, natural resources and the 1,400 species found in the reef system.

More than 450,000 people from around the world joined WWF's campaign to end oil exploration and other harmful activities in the reef.

Antonio Busiello / WWF-US

A National Treasure



The Belize barrier reef teems with life that will benefit from the new protections. The endangered hawksbill turtle, manatees and six threatened species of shark live in these waters. Vibrant corals abound, and aquatic animals shelter their young in mangrove forests along the coast.

And people will benefit from a healthy reef, too. Belize's economy is built on tourism, so the health of the reef directly impacts the country's future. Tourism alone is estimated to bring in between $182 million to $237 million per year, with reef-related tourism and fisheries supporting about 190,000 people.

""By acting to remove a major threat to the reef, Belize is safeguarding its future prosperity,"" Bood said. We hope today's announcement will encourage other countries to follow suit and take urgent actions needed to protect our planet's oceans."""

"Hole in the ozone is now the SMALLEST it has been on record since it was discovered in 1982, NASA confirms",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7599369/Hole-ozone-smallest-discovery-1982-NASA-confirms.html,"The hole in the ozone layer has shrunk to its smallest size since scientists began monitoring it in 1982 because of unusual weather patterns in the upper atmosphere over Antarctica, according to NASA.

The hole fluctuates in size annually and is usually largest during the coldest months in the southern hemisphere, from late September to early October.

The latest observations from space have shown the hole now covers less than 3.9million square miles – a record low and almost half as small as it was during its peak at 6.3million on September 8 only six weeks ago. Experts say the hole is usually around 8 million square miles during this time of year.

Paul Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said it is 'great news for ozone in the Southern Hemisphere'.

But he warned: 'It's important to recognize that what we're seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures. It's not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.'

Between September and October, the hole shrunk to around 3.9 million square miles (10 million square kilometres) — the lowest size at which it has ever been recorded

Observations by NASA and NOAA found that the hole reached its peak dimensions for the year at 6.3 million square miles on September 8

By early October the ozone hole can be seen to have shrunk to around 3.9 million square miles. The Dobson Unit can be seen on the left, measuring the amount of a trace gas in a vertical column through the Earth's atmosphere

The hole in the ozone was at its largest in September 2006, when it covered a massive 10.6million square miles

WHAT IS THE OZONE LAYER? Ozone is a molecule comprised of three oxygen atoms that occurs naturally in small amounts. In the stratosphere, roughly seven to 25 miles above Earth's surface, the ozone layer acts like sunscreen, shielding the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation. It is produced in tropical latitudes and distributed around the globe. Closer to the ground, ozone can also be created by photochemical reactions between the sun and pollution from vehicle emissions and other sources, forming harmful smog. In the 1970s, it was recognised that chemicals called CFCs, used for example in refrigeration and aerosols, were destroying ozone in the stratosphere. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was agreed, which led to the phase-out of CFCs and, recently, the first signs of recovery of the Antarctic ozone layer. At lower latitudes, the upper stratosphere is also showing clear signs of recovery, suggesting the Montreal Protocol is working well. Advertisement

According to NASA, the 'main ingredient' in the ozone-destroying process is are so-called polar stratospheric clouds.

These relatively rare bodies occur high in the stratosphere at altitudes between 49,000–82,000 feet (15,000–25,000 metres) above the surface.

These clouds provide a surface on which chemical reactions can occur — releasing waste products called 'free radicals' which go on to destroy ozone particles around them.

Fewer polar stratospheric clouds form in warmer weather, however, and they also last for shorter periods of time in such conditions.

This year's warmer global temperatures — aided by unusual weather patterns — have therefore helped to limit the development of these clouds and also given those did form less time to damage the ozone layer.

In turn, this has led to a much smaller ozone hole this year than we have previously seen.

On the surface, the strengthening of the ozone layer would seem to be a promising development — as such serves to better protect the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

However, the news that the hole is shrinking is not necessarily a good sign — as the process that is closing the hole is a clear product of rising global temperatures.

In years with more typical weather, the hole usually reaches a maximum size of about 8million square miles by late September or early October — before shrinking back down again.

Gases released from man-made processes on Earth are eroding away the layer of ozone gas which surrounds the globe. Holes in the layer mean more heat from the Sun makes it through and down to Earth level, which is warming the surface and oceans

The highly reactive ozone molecule — also known as trioxygen — comprises three oxygen atoms and is a pale blue gas with a pungent smell.

It can be found 25 miles above the Earth's surface, in the stratosphere.

By reacting with high-energy, ultraviolet rays the ozone acts like a layer of sun screen — absorbing the harmful rays in the stratosphere before they reach Earth's surface.

Ozone is created primarily by ultraviolet radiation, when high-energy ultraviolet rays strike ordinary oxygen molecules (O2).

This splits the molecule into two single oxygen atoms — dubbed 'atomic oxygen' — with the freed oxygen atoms going on to combine with regular oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3).

This reaction helps shield the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer, cataracts, suppress immune systems and also damage plants.

The Antarctic ozone 'hole', which is technically not a hole but an area of depletion, forms during the Southern Hemisphere's late winter as the returning Sun's rays start ozone-depleting reactions.

These runaway reactions involve chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from man-made compounds and take place on the surfaces of cloud particles in cold stratospheric layers — breaking up ozone molecules.

Warmer temperatures mean fewer polar stratospheric clouds form, limiting the ozone-depletion that can take place on their surface.

NASA and NOAA monitor the ozone hole using satellites including NASA's Aura satellite, the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite and NOAA's Joint Polar Satellite System NOAA-20 satellite.

At the South Pole, NOAA staff launch weather balloons carrying ozone-measuring 'sondes' which directly sample ozone levels vertically through the atmosphere.

Most years, at least some levels of the stratosphere —the region of the upper atmosphere where the largest amounts of ozone are normally found — are completely devoid of ozone.

Bryan Johnson at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado said: 'This year, ozonesonde measurements at the South Pole did not show any portions of the atmosphere where ozone was completely depleted.'

While this is uncommon, it is not unprecedented. This is the third time in the last 40 years that weather systems have caused warm temperatures that limit ozone depletion, said Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with Universities Space Research Association, who works at NASA Goddard.

Similar weather patterns in the Antarctic stratosphere in September 1988 and 2002 also produced atypically small ozone holes, she said.

Dr Strahan said: 'It's a rare event that we're still trying to understand. If the warming hadn't happened, we'd likely be looking at a much more typical ozone hole.'

There is no identified connection between the occurrence of these unique patterns and changes in climate.

The weather systems that disrupted the 2019 ozone hole are typically modest in September, but this year they were unusually strong, dramatically warming the Antarctic's stratosphere during the pivotal time for ozone destruction.

At an altitude of about 12 miles (20 kilometers), temperatures during September were 29F (16˚C) warmer than average, the warmest in the 40-year historical record for September by a wide margin.

In addition, these weather systems also weakened the Antarctic polar vortex, knocking it off its normal center over the South Pole and reducing the strong September jet stream around Antarctica from a mean speed of 161 miles per hour to a speed of 67 miles per hour.

This slowing vortex rotation allowed air to sink in the lower stratosphere where ozone depletion occurs, meaning the Antarctic lower stratosphere was warmed - limiting polar stratospheric clouds where the ozone destroying reactions take place.

The strong weather systems also brought ozone-rich air from higher latitudes elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere to the area above the Antarctic ozone hole.

A combination of these two effects led to much higher than normal ozone levels over Antarctica compared to ozone hole conditions usually present since the mid 1980s.

As of October 16, the ozone hole above Antarctica remained small but stable and is expected to gradually dissipate in the coming weeks."

Pope abolishes rule that kept church sex abuse cases top secret,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-sex-abuse-church-testimony-secret-child-pornography-a9250061.html,"Pope Francis has issued an order removing the highest level of secrecy covering child sex abuse cases involving the clergy, a move demanded by campaigners as part of sweeping changes to the way the Catholic church deals with such allegations.

Critics said the claim of “pontifical secrecy” was used by accused Church officials to avoid cooperating with authorities.

The measures brought by the Pope on Tuesday change universal church law, requiring the reporting of suspicions of sex abuse to civil authorities and forbidding attempts to silence those who report abuse or allege they have been a victim.

The pontiff decreed that information in abuse cases must still be protected by church leaders to ensure its “security, integrity and confidentiality”.

But the Vatican’s leading sex crimes investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, called the reform an “epochal decision” that will allow for better coordination with police forces across the world and open up lines of communication with victims.

Francis also raised from 14 to 18 the cutoff age below which the Vatican considers “pornographic” media to be images of child sexual abuse.

The new norms are the latest amendment to the Catholic church’s in-house canon law – a parallel legal code that metes out ecclesial justice for crimes against the faith – in this case relating to the sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable people by priests, bishops or cardinals. In this legal system, the worst punishment a priest can incur is being defrocked, or dismissed from the clerical state.

Pope Benedict XVI had decreed in 2001 that these cases must be dealt with under “pontifical secret”, the highest form of secrecy in the church. The Vatican had long insisted that such confidentiality was necessary to protect the privacy of the victim, the reputation of the accused and the integrity of the canonical process.

However, such secrecy also served to keep the scandal hidden, prevent law enforcement from accessing documents and silence victims, many of whom often believed that “pontifical secret” prevented them from going to the police to report their priestly abusers.

While the Vatican has long tried to insist this was not the case, it also never mandated that bishops and religious superiors report sex crimes to police, and in the past has encouraged bishops not to do so."

Jimmy Carter Put Solar Panels on His Farmland and They're Now Powering Half of His Georgia Hometown,https://people.com/politics/jimmy-carter-solar-panel-farm-powers-plains-georgia/,"Where the former president used to grow crops, 3,852 solar panels were put up to capture the Georgia sunlight, providing more than 50 percent of Plains' energy

Jimmy Carter Put Solar Panels on His Farmland and They're Now Powering Half of His Georgia Hometown

While Jimmy Carter was in the White House, he championed new energy and became the first president to use solar panels to power portions of the building. That legacy has continued decades later and in a place much closer to Carter’s home — literally: Since 2017, the nation’s 39th president has used 10 acres of his farmland to power most of his hometown in Plains, Georgia.

Where the famed peanut-farming president used to grow crops like nuts and soybeans, 3,852 solar panels now stand to capture the Georgia sunlight, providing more than 50 percent of the small town’s energy.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

The former president told the Sierra Club in 2017, soon after the panels were installed, that on a good day they could provide 1.3 megawatts — or 1.3 million watts. According to the U.S. government, one megawatt will provide enough energy to power 400-900 homes (though watts harnessed by solar panels provides a little less).

According to SolAmerica, the company that first reached out to Carter about the idea and worked alongside him to install the panels on his farmland, the nearly 4,000 solar panels are able to provide more than 50 percent of power to the 727 residents in the small Georgia town.

SolAmerica Energy President George Mori told PEOPLE this week that the solar panel farm remains operational “in its original size” and still provides more than half the power in the small Georgia town.

SolAmerica’s partnership agreement with Georgia Power, the state’s largest electricity company, will last until 2042 and it’s expected that the panels will provide more than 55 million kilowatt hours of clean energy for Plains.

“Distributed, clean energy generation is critical to meeting growing energy needs around the world while fighting the effects of climate change,” Carter said in 2017. “I am encouraged by the tremendous progress that solar and other clean energy solutions have made in recent years and expect those trends to continue.”

But the Trump administration has moved in the other direction, loosening Obama-era restrictions on coal and publicly criticizing environmentally friendly energy projects.

In September, President Donald Trump claimed energy-efficient lightbulbs were too fragile and becoming “hazardous waste” after they break. In December, he called windmills “monsters” and eyesores that spit “tremendous fumes” out into the atmosphere.

But Carter isn’t new to being at odds with future presidents over clean energy.

Soon after he left office in 1981, President Ronald Reagan removed the solar panels he’d installed at the White House.

According to Scientific American, those same solar panels are now scattered around the world in museums as a display of the world’s development of more efficient energy. One is in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C., another is in the Carter Presidential Library in Atlanta and more are in China at the Solar Science and Technology Museum in Dezhou.

While unveiling the White House solar panels in June 1979, Carter left the future of energy to the public’s willingness to embrace it: “A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.”

Though Carter’s solar panels didn’t last long at the White House, a University of Oxford study shows clean energy use has risen since the 1960s."
"Legalising gay marriage is dramatically lowering suicides rates, study shows",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gay-marriage-same-sex-lgbt-suicide-rate-study-sweden-denmark-a9204176.html,"Being allowed to marry has led to a drop in the number of gay men and lesbians taking their own lives in two Scandinavian countries, according to a study.

A 46 per cent fall in suicides among people in same-sex marriages was recorded by comparing two time periods in Denmark and Sweden – from 1989 to 2002, and 2003 to 2016.

Researchers said that reduced stigma around homosexual relationships was likely to be among the reasons for the drop.

“Being married is protective against suicide,” said Annette Erlangsen of the Danish Research Institute for Suicide Prevention. “Legalising same-sex marriage and other supportive legislative measures – they might actually reduce stigma around sexual minorities.”

Same-sex marriage was made legal in 2009 in Sweden and 2012 in Denmark. The unions are now legal in 27 countries, 16 of them in Europe. Ecuador became the latest nation to permit them, in June this year.

However, people in same-sex marriages still took their own lives at more than twice the rate of those in heterosexual unions across both periods, reinforcing research from other countries that points to a higher incidence of suicide attempts among LGBT+ people.

Young LGBT+ people are at least three times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers, according to 35 studies from 10 countries collated by researchers in 2018.

Dr Erlangsen’s study, which followed more than 28,000 people in same-sex unions for an average of 11 years, found married lesbians were 2.8 times as likely to die by suicide as women in straight marriages, and slightly more likely than straight, married men. Men in gay partnerships were most likely to kill themselves.

“There still remains a considerable degree of homophobia, particularly against male homosexuals,” said Morten Frisch, of Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut, a research body. “Just under one in three men still consider it morally unacceptable that two men have sex with each other,” he said, citing a survey of more than 62,000 Danes released in October."
France to make vaccination mandatory from 2018 as it is 'unacceptable children are still dying of measles',http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-vaccination-mandatory-2018-next-year-children-health-measles-dying-anti-vaxxers-edouard-a7824246.html,"Parents in France will be legally obliged to vaccinate their children from 2018, the government has announced.

French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said it was “unacceptable” that children are ""still dying of measles” in the country where some of the earliest vaccines were pioneered.

Three childhood vaccines, for diphtheria, tetanus and polio, are currently mandatory in France. Others, including those against hepatitis and whooping cough, are simply recommended.

Announcing the policy, Mr Philippe evoked the name of Louis Pasteur, the French biologist who made breakthroughs in disease research and developed the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax in the 19th century.

He said all the vaccines which are universally recommended by health authorities – 11 in total – would be compulsory.

The move follows a similar initiative in Italy, which recently banned non-vaccinated children from attending state schools.

The World Health Organisation has warned of major measles outbreaks spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine.

Anti-vaccine movements, whose followers are known as anti-vaxxers, are believed to have contributed to low rates of immunisation against the highly contagious disease in a number of countries.

A recent survey found more than three out of 10 French people don’t trust vaccines, with just 52 per cent of participants saying the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.

Health officials urge vaccines as US faces measles outbreak

There were 79 cases of measles reported in France in the first two months of 2017, mostly due to an outbreak of 50 cases in the north-eastern Lorraine region, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Between the beginning of 2008 and the end of 2016, more than 24,000 cases of measles were declared in France, official figures show. Of these, around 1,500 had serious complications and there were 10 deaths.

Vaccination is not mandatory in Britain, and around 24,000 children a year in England are not immunised against measles, mumps and rubella.

Fear surrounding the combined inoculation for the three infectious diseases, known as the MMR vaccine, stems in part from a discredited study claiming to show a link between the jab and autism.

The paper, published in medical journal The Lancet nearly 20 years ago by disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield, led to a heavy fall in uptake among parents at the time, but exhaustive scientific research has now disproved the theory.

Two children in the UK have died of measles since 2006, and in 2013 a young man from Wales died of the disease – all a “waste of life,” Dr Farah Jameel told doctors at the British Medical Association (BMA) annual meeting last month.

The BMA is calling for evidence to be submitted to the UK Government on “the potential advantages and disadvantages of childhood immunisation made mandatory under the law”.

Beatrice Lorenzin, the Italian health minister, has said falling vaccination rates in the country was “an emergency generated by fake news” and 12 vaccines would be compulsory for schoolchildren aged up to 16.

Cases of measles rose more than fivefold across Italy in April compared to the same month last year, according to National Health Institute figures.

This alarming resurgence of the disease has been blamed on the anti-vaccination stance of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), which took a quarter of the vote in the country’s 2013 general election."
Norway Announces Total Ban on Fur Farming,https://www.livekindly.co/norway-announces-total-ban-on-fur-farming/,"Updated June 2019 | Norway has officially banned fur production across the country.

According to Phys.Org, as of June 2019, no new fur farms will be permitted. All existing farms are required to shut down by February 1, 2025.



News of the prospective ban initially surfaced in 2018. Camilla Björkbom — federal chairman of Animal Rights Sweden — explained the importance of this decision at the time.



“We welcome the Swedish Government’s proposal to investigate the welfare of minkers on Sweden’s fur farms, but today we see that Norway shows that a ban on fur farming is possible,” she said.



She continued, “this is great news, not least for all the animals that are now not born and killed for their fur in Norway, but also because it sets a good example for Sweden and the upcoming Swedish investigation.”

Norway was a large fur producer, with over 300 fur farms breeding and killing over 700,000 minks and 110,000 foxes every year.

“Norway is talking about today’s message to the growing number of countries in Europe who discontinue fur farming. By 2017, the Czech Republic and Germany have also decided to shut down fur farms,” said Björkbom. Both of the aforementioned countries banned fur farming at the beginning of 2017.

What Happens Next for the Fur Farms?

Not everyone is happy about the ban; many fur farmers have stated that they will now lose a large portion of their income.

The Norweigan government, however, has pledged 500 million kroner to dismantle the farms, and 100 million to help farmers move into different fields.

Guri Wormdahl of the Norwegian fur farmers association is still cynical. “Five hundred million kroner, that may seem like a lot but this is not about compensating the simple loss of a job,” they said. “This is about the farmers’ entire livelihood that is disappearing.”

One Liberal MP believes they have the answer. According to Phys.Org, it was suggested that the fur farms could be turned into medicinal cannabis farms instead. Cannabis is legal in Norway if it is used for medicinal purposes; some studies have linked the use of the plant to easing chronic pain and depression."

He advised boys to be compassionate, look for a mentor and find ways to help guide others The My Brother's Keeper initiative was launched after the 2012 shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin

Appearing onstage this week with NBA Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry, Mr Obama cracked up an audience of mainly young boys when responding to a question about being a man.

He said it meant being a good person, someone who is responsible, reliable, hard-working and compassionate — and not about life as portrayed in a hip-hop music video.

""If you are very confident about your sexuality, you don't have to have eight women around you twerking,"" he said to applause, with a video of his full response going viral in recent days.

Mr Obama, who left office in 2017, was in Oakland, California, to mark the fifth anniversary of My Brother's Keeper (MBK), an initiative he launched after the 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old African-American Trayvon Martin.

About 100 boys attended the first national gathering of the MBK alliance, an initiative to close opportunity gaps for African-American, Latino and Native American children, sponsored by the Obama Foundation.

Mr Obama and basketball star Curry spoke together for about an hour, answering questions from the audience and joking around. They talked about lacking confidence or being aimless as teens.

Mr Obama praised single mothers, including his own. He advised the boys to look for a mentor, and to find opportunities to guide others.

Curry joined the former president in praising the value of teamwork.

""What we do on the court and the joy that comes out of that is second to none,"" he said, ""because nothing great is done by yourself.""

"Legal marijuana cuts violence says US study, as medical-use laws see crime fall",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/legal-marijuana-medical-use-crime-rate-plummets-us-study,"The introduction of medical marijuana laws has led to a sharp reduction in violent crime in US states that border Mexico, according to new research.

According to the study, Is Legal Pot Crippling Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations? The Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on US Crime, when a state on the Mexican border legalised medical use of the drug, violent crime fell by 13% on average. Most of the marijuana consumed in the US originates in Mexico, where seven major cartels control the illicit drug trade.

“These laws allow local farmers to grow marijuana that can then be sold to dispensaries where it is sold legally,” said the economist Evelina Gavrilova, one of the study’s authors. “These growers are in direct competition with Mexican drug cartels that are smuggling the marijuana into the US. As a result, the cartels get much less business.”

The knock-on effect is a reduction in levels of drug-related violence. “The cartels are in competition with one another,” Gavrilova explained. “They compete for territory, but it’s also easy to steal product from the other cartels and sell it themselves, so they fight for the product. They also have to defend their territory and ensure there are no bystanders, no witnesses to the activities of the cartel.

“Whenever there is a medical marijuana law we observe that crime at the border decreases because suddenly there is a lot less smuggling and a lot less violence associated with that.”

While the Mexican cartels smuggle other drugs such as cocaine, heroine and metamphetamine across the border, the market for marijuana is the largest drug market in the US and the one from which the cartels can make the fattest profit. It costs around $75 to produce a pound of marijuana in Mexico, which can then be sold on for $6,000 depending on the quality.

Gavrilova, along with fellow researchers Takuma Kamada and Floris Zoutman, studied data from the FBI’s uniform crime reports and supplementary homicide records covering 1994 to 2012. They found that among the border states the effect of the change in law was largest in California, where there was a reduction of 15% in violent crime, and weakest in Arizona, where there was a fall of 7%. The crimes most strongly affected were robbery, which fell by 19%, and murder, which dropped by 10%. Homicides specifically related to the drug trade fell by an astonishing 41%.

The authors claim their study provides new insights into methods to reduce violent crime related to drug trafficking. But its publication comes as the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is rescinding the Obama-era policy that ushered in the medical marijuana laws.

“When the effect on crime is so significant, it’s obviously better to regulate marijuana and allow people to pay taxes on it rather than make it illegal,” Gavrilova said. “For me it’s a no brainer that it should be legal and should be regulated, and the proceeds go to the Treasury.”

More than 20 states across the US have implemented medical marijuana laws so far. In those that have, there is now one marijuana dispensary for every six regular pharmacies.

The study suggests that the full legalisation of marijuana in Colorado and Washington will have an even stronger impact on the drug trade as large-scale marijuana production facilities are erected in these states, further threatening the position of drug cartels.

Anecdotal evidence suggests the cartels are now trying to get into the legal marijuana business in California by opening their own farms. Others are turning to human trafficking and kidnapping to shore up their falling profits. There are also reports that some cartels are switching to new forms of drug cultivation by growing poppies in Mexico to produce their own heroin rather than importing it from Afghanistan."

Mall of America takes bold stand by closing on Thanksgiving this year For the first Time,http://www.startribune.com/mall-of-america-takes-bold-stand-by-closing-on-thanksgiving-this-year/396016881/,"The nation’s biggest mall has drawn a line in the sand when it comes to opening on Thanksgiving Day.

In the past few years, the Mall of America was among the growing crop of retailers and malls that swung open their doors on Thanksgiving night to stretch Black Friday amid a fierce battle for consumers’ holiday spending.

But no more.

The Bloomington megamall notified employees and tenants Wednesday morning that it is reversing course this year and will close down as many of its operations as possible on the holiday. Nickelodeon Universe and the movie theaters will be closed for Thanksgiving for the first time in its 24-year history.

The mall’s 520-plus stores will have the option to open on Thanksgiving, but mall officials expect few will choose to do so.

“We’ve been talking about this for months, looking at the numbers, looking at the pros and the cons,” said Jill Renslow, the mall’s senior vice president of marketing and business development. “We’re excited to give this day back to our employees so they can celebrate with their families.”

The Mall of America is bucking the trend to open ever earlier on Thanksgiving to get a jump on Black Friday sales.

The decision will affect many of the 15,000 people who work at the mall. A limited number of the mall’s security and maintenance personnel will work since some stores are likely to open and the annual Walk to End Hunger fundraiser will still go on.

By making this move, Renslow said the mall officials hope to “bring that special magic back to Black Friday.”

The mall will officially open at 5 a.m. the day after Thanksgiving, instead of staying open all night as it has in recent years. Executives plan a special “door opening ceremony” and other festivities and giveaways.

It’s too soon to know whether other retailers or malls will follow suit since most have not yet announced their Thanksgiving and Black Friday hours.

Marshal Cohen, a retail analyst with NPD Group, doubts there will be a huge pendulum swing away from opening on Thanksgiving this year since many of big-box store operators are nervous about losing out to competitors that open that night.

“Do I see the rest of the country doing it? No,” he said. “Do I see it going back in that direction? A little bit. I think some stores may realize that it may be an expense they may not want to have, but they’re also afraid to not do it.”

He noted that opening on Thanksgiving Day does not lift overall sales during the Black Friday weekend. It just spreads out the spending over more days. Many stores have begun rolling out “Black Friday deals” earlier in November, which has taken some of the bang out of what typically is one of the biggest shopping days of the year. Plus, the rising popularity of online shopping has diluted some of the frenzy in stores.

Pros, cons of holiday sales

Still, crowds of shoppers have continued to show up for Thanksgiving night doorbuster sales. Retailers said they added the hours because some shoppers don’t like being cooped up inside all day. They would prefer to go shopping with their family after they finish their turkey instead of waking up in the middle of the night to hit the sales the next day, retailers said.

But the phenomenon has also been met with complaints from people objecting to the encroachment into the holiday. Several retailers such as Nord­strom, Costco and Home Depot, which aren’t huge Black Friday shopping destinations to begin with, have received positive buzz in recent years for not giving in to the craze and staying closed on Thanksgiving.

For the past two years, after inching back its opening time each year, the Mall of America encouraged its stores to open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving when the mall officially opened.

Last year, more than 150 of its stores opened at 6 p.m., most of them staying open through the night. But for many of the mall’s smaller specialty stores, it was a hardship to staff those hours, which was also a factor in the mall’s decision.

It remains to be seen whether the change will affect sales over the Black Friday weekend. About 400,000 people typically visit the mall during the Thursday-to-Sunday period. But officials expect the traffic to be fairly similar this year over the course of the three days instead of four.

“By closing on Thanksgiving, we’re confident we’ll still get those strong numbers throughout the Black Friday weekend,” Renslow said.

Last year, several Twin Cities shopping malls, including Ridgedale Center, Rosedale Center and Burnsville Center, put an end to the all-night shopping hours after seeing crowds dwindle in the middle of the night. They opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, closed at midnight, then reopened at 6 a.m. Friday. Richfield-based Best Buy also has closed its stores for a few hours between the holiday and Black Friday in the past two years.

But few have gone as far as outdoors retailer REI, which made headlines last year when it decided to close on Black Friday itself."
Meet the woman who rented hotel rooms for homeless in Chicago during dangerous polar vortex,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candice-payne-homeless-in-chicago-candice-payne-hotel-rooms-polar-vortex-cold/,"A Chicago woman's act of kindness helped homeless people stay warm during this week's dangerous polar vortex. Candice Payne impulsively charged 20 hotel rooms on her credit card before it snowballed into a lifesaving effort by a group of strangers, CBS Chicago reports.

Payne booked the hotel rooms after realizing how life-threatening the sub-zero temperatures would be for the Chicagoans without homes. She posted about it on social media and soon the donations and offers to help bring food came flooding in.

""Maybe they didn't know how to or where to start to help, so I'm glad that I was able to be that vehicle,"" she told CBS Chicago.

Candice Payne CBS Chicago

On Wednesday, when temperatures plummeted to 22 degrees below zero, a group of homeless people had to abandon their tents near a highway after a propane tank they used as a source of heat exploded. But Payne and other volunteers dug deep into their pockets and picked up the tab for 60 rooms at a hotel on Chicago's South Side.

Volunteers worked together like a family, turning a hotel bathroom into a makeshift kitchen and collecting donations to help replace the items that were lost. And they built lasting friendships even though most of them just met.

Jermaine and Robert, two men who stayed in a hotel room, call Payne their ""angel.""

When they got the offer for a warm bed, they were getting ready to sleep on the street or to be charged with trespassing in their attempts to escape from the cold.

""We don't get that type of help,"" Jermaine said. ""I really needed them at that point, so they came right in time.""

They hugged Payne and thanked her, touched by the unexpected kindness.

""We hear about that on the news and other places but I seen it up close and personal today, and I really want to thank y'all for looking out for our people,"" Robert said.

So far, this volunteer group has been able to cover three nights at the hotel for approximately 80 people. They're hoping to continue working together to help provide a more long-term solution.

Their generosity made sure dozens of people in need had a warm place to sleep when conditions outside were life-threatening. Across the Midwest and Northeast, at least 22 deaths have been connected to the dangerous polar vortex, and winter still has a long way to got."

Missing 3 y/o found safe next morning with faithful old dog keeping her safe,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-21/max-blue-heeler-leads-rescuers-to-missing-girl-night-in-bush/9683494?pfmredir=sm,"An old blue heeler named Max remained by the side of a three-year-old girl and led searchers to her after she spent more than 15 hours lost in rugged bushland on Queensland's Southern Downs overnight.

Aurora was reported missing about 3:00pm on Friday after she wandered off on her own, but a search of woodlands and hills on the rural property in wet weather on Friday night found no trace of her.

On Saturday morning, more than 100 State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers, police and members of the public resumed the search and found the girl safe and well with Max the dog at 8:00am.

For his good work in keeping the little girl safe, Max has now been declared an honorary police dog.

Kelly Benston, the partner of Leisa Bennett, who is Aurora's grandmother, said Ms Bennett and other searchers heard the little girl faintly from the top of a mountain on Saturday morning.

""She found the dog first. Max led her to Aurora,"" Mr Benston said.

""Max is 17 years old, deaf and partially blind.""

SES area controller Ian Phipps confirmed a family member spotted Aurora and Max about two kilometres from the house, still on the family property at Cherry Gulley, 30 kilometres south of Warwick.

""The area around the house is quite mountainous and is very inhospitable terrain to go walking in, so she'd travelled quite a distance with her dog that was quite loyal to her,"" he said.

Max the blue heeler led rescuers to the little girl. ( Facebook: Kelly Benston )

""The search was actually quite hard where the volunteers and the police were, amongst the very steep slopes full of lantana and other vegetation.""

Ms Bennett said she tracked her down after the three-year-old responded to her shouting.

""When I heard her yell 'Grammy' I knew it was her,"" she said.

""I shot up the mountain ... and when I got to the top, the dog came to me and led me straight to her.

""He never left her sight. She smelled of dog, she slept with the dog.""

Ms Bennett said it was an emotional reunion with ""a lot of tears"".

""I think [Aurora] was a bit overwhelmed by the tears and the howling, but I explained to her how happy those tears were,"" she said.

""It could have gone any of 100 ways, but she's here, she's alive, she's well and it's a great outcome for our family.""

Mr Phipps said Aurora suffered minor cuts and abrasions but was otherwise well and it was a wonderful outcome for the family and searchers.

""With the weather last night it's quite lucky she is well because it was cold, it was cold and raining,"" he said.

""She's a very hardy young lass to survive that without any ill effects and everyone, all the volunteers are extremely happy.

""They had travelled from all over the region just to do the search and that's one of the things they join the SES for is to look after the community and do these activities ... and bring happiness to a family."""

Mexico jaguar population grows 20% in eight years,https://phys.org/news/2018-06-mexico-jaguar-population-years.html,"Two jaguar cubs are pictured at the ""Reino Animal"" zoo in Teotihuacan, Mexico state, on April 27, 2018; the country's wild jaguar population currently stands at 4,800, a 20 percent increase from 2010

Mexico's population of wild jaguars has grown 20 percent in the past eight years, according to a study released Thursday, a bit of good news for an iconic species whose numbers have been declining.

There are an estimated 4,800 jaguars in Mexico, found the study, carried out by a consortium of institutions and academics with remotely activated cameras triggered by sensors.

That was a 20-percent increase from the first edition of the study, carried out in 2010.

""The presence of jaguars ensures that these ecosystems function, by controlling the population of herbivores, and is also an indicator of the ecosystems' good health,"" said Heliot Zarza, vice president of the National Jaguar Conservation Alliance, in a statement released by the World Wildlife Fund.

The jaguar, the largest feline in the Americas, can weigh up to 100 kilos (220 pounds), though the ones found in Mexico rarely weigh more than 60 kilos.

The yellow, black-spotted cats are found in 18 countries across the Americas, 90 percent of them in the Amazon rainforest.

There are some 64,000 jaguars in the wild, a number that has been shrinking, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which has declared the animal a ""near threatened"" species.

In Mexico, however, a conservation program launched in 2005 and overseen by Mexico's national parks service has bolstered the jaguar's population growth, said the lead researcher on the study, Gerardo Ceballos of the Ecology Institute at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

The jaguar also got a boost on March 1 when 14 Latin American countries signed an agreement at the United Nations on implementing a regional conservation program for the big cats through 2030.

Researchers from 16 institutions and 25 academic groups carried out the study across 10 Mexican states, using a total of 396 cameras.

Senate just passed the Great American Outdoors Act allocating billions to National Parks and public lands.,https://www.outsideonline.com/2414708/great-american-outdoors-act,"Earlier today the Senate passed the Great American Outdoors Act, allocating billions to support outdoor recreation in two separate ways. The first is by providing $9.5 billion over the next five years to help the National Park Service and other federal land-management agencies address their maintenance backlogs. Federal public lands are suffering from $20 billion in deferred maintenance costs, with $12 billion of that accumulated by the National Park Service. The second is to mandate that the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), widely considered the nation’s single best funding tool for outdoor recreation, be permanently financed to its maximum allotment of $900 million annually. In March the president called for such a bill to land on his desk.

It’s a remarkable breakthrough at a time when the White House has been hostile to federal conservation and land-management agencies and to the LWCF; Trump’s proposed 2021 budget slashed the Park Service budget by $587 million and allocated just $15 million to the LWCF, a mere 1.6 percent of its allotment. The bill passed by a vote of 73 to 25. Proponents, including the bill’s sponsor, Republican Cory Gardner of Colorado, tout the Great American Outdoors Act as a way to get people back to work after millions have been laid off in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Years of bipartisan work have led to this moment and this historic opportunity for conservation,” says Gardner. “Today the Senate passed not only the single greatest conservation achievement in generations but also a lifeline to mountain towns and recreation communities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced their version of the legislation in the House of Representatives on June 4, and passage of that version is expected in the coming weeks, clearing the way for the president to sign the bill into law.

“We are going to have to rebuild the economy, and this can be a really big part of that,” says Democratic senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, noting that nationally, outdoor recreation contributes $778 billion in consumer spending and supports 5.2 million jobs, yet “our trails and campgrounds aren’t in the shape that they should be, which directly impacts economic activity on public lands and in gateway communities.”

In May, more than 850 signatories representing conservation organizations, local governments, and state and regional tourism boards urged congressional leaders to support the bill. “The Great American Outdoors Act will ensure a future for nature to thrive, kids to play, and hunters and anglers to enjoy,” they wrote.

Established in 1965, the LWCF has funded some $18.4 billion in land acquisitions and facilities constructions over time, ranging from expanding national parks to building bike paths, baseball diamonds, and boat ramps. Every single county in the nation has had a project aided by the LWCF. Yet it has been funded to its maximum $900 million annual allotment only twice in its history and generally averages about $450 million a year. Conservationists have been working for decades to guarantee that the LWCF, which is paid for out of offshore oil- and gas-drilling royalties, be fully and permanently funded rather than have the remainder siphoned off to other government programs.

The portion of the bill that funds maintenance backlogs on federal public lands was originally floated by Trump administration officials. The idea was to help pay down the National Park Service’s $12 billion maintenance backlog with oil and gas royalties from public lands and was written into the Restore Our Parks Act. When that bill was bundled with LWCF funding efforts to create the Great American Outdoors Act, maintenance backlog funding was expanded to include the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management, in addition to the Bureau of Indian Education. Seventy percent of the $9.5 billion would go to the Park Service, 15 percent to the Forest Service, and 5 percent to each of the other agencies.

Conservationists welcome the expanded bill. The Forest Service alone has a $5 billion maintenance backlog on trails, campgrounds, and other facilities, notes Adam Cramer, executive director of the Outdoor Alliance, a coalition of outdoor-recreation advocacy groups. “Our national parks are our country’s crown jewels,” Cramer says, “but the rest of our national public lands are what make up the actual crown. The amount and diversity of outdoor-recreation opportunities, including hunting and fishing on our national forests, BLM lands, and wildlife refuges, is staggeringly huge.”

For many conservationists, the Great American Outdoors Act has been a lightning bolt out of the blue, sparked by a tweet from President Trump. “I’m calling on Congress to send me a Bill that fully and permanently funds the LWCF and restores our National Parks,” he tweeted on March 3. He went on to give credit to two Republican senators, Colorado’s Gardner and Montana’s Steve Daines, both of whom had visited the president in the Oval Office on February 27 to urge support for the bill. Many have commented on the fact that both Gardner and Daines are facing tough reelection campaigns in states where constituents prize outdoor recreation. (Daines is tied with his Democratic opponent, and Gardner trails his opponent, in the most recent polls.)

At the time, Democratic senator Maria Cantwell of Washington State, a longtime LWCF supporter, wryly called the bill’s emergence “a miracle.”

Lately, there has been bipartisan support for conservation measures. Last year the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, which created six new National Park Service units and 1.3 million acres of wilderness, passed the Senate by a vote of 92 to 8. “Public lands and waters are one of the things that are capable of bringing all Americans together,” New Mexico’s Heinrich says. “I see the economic benefits of public lands being talked about vigorously in smaller communities in this cycle.”

Heinrich lauds Republican senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rob Portman of Ohio, in addition to Gardner and Daines, with being tireless champions of the Great American Outdoors Act, which he says was named “to appeal to the White House.”

Heinrich, who most observers credit with driving the effort to expand maintenance funding beyond the Park Service, explains that while the Bureau of Indian Education doesn’t have a recreation mission, it was included in the bill because, by “historical accident,” the agency was placed in the Department of the Interior, and therefore, he says, “time and again their funding levels get left out. Sometimes you have to deal with the history that puts us where we are.”

Politics aside, the bill stands to benefit every American, especially now. “We are seeing during the pandemic how important walking outside is to people’s well-being,” says Heinrich. “Right now more than 100,000 kids in this country don’t have a park within a ten-minute walk of their house,” he says, noting that the LWCF can remedy that. “The rebuilding can be as equitable as we want it to be.”"
"Missouri hunters donated nearly 350,000 pounds of deer meat to food banks this season",https://us.cnn.com/2020/02/26/us/missouri-hunters-donate-meat-food-bank-deer-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Missouri deer hunters donated nearly 350,000 pounds of venison to food banks and pantries across the state this season, the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) said in a news release.

The hunters donated the meat to Missouri's Share the Harvest program, which provides ""lean, healthy"" venison to help feed hungry Missourians.

""Hunters started Share the Harvest because they saw a need in their communities and hunters remain the driving force behind this popular program that helps feed our fellow Missourians who are in need,"" MDC director Sara Parker Pauley said in a statement

""We sincerely thank the thousands of deer hunters who support Share the Harvest, along with the many participating meat processors and sponsors who help make it possible.""

The program, coordinated by MDC and the Conservation Federation of Missouri (CFM), was launched in 1992. Since then, more than 4.3 million pounds of meat has been ground, packaged and donated to people in need. The fees to process and package the meat are covered by local sponsors throughout the state.

Alabama college student walked 20 miles to 1st day of work so his boss gave him his car,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/07/former_marine_walked_20_miles.html,"When a young Birmingham college student's car broke down the night before he was supposed to start a new job, he didn't panic. At least not for long.

Instead, Walter Carr walked. From Homewood to Pelham. All night. In the dark. 20 miles or more.

A Carver High School graduate and U.S. Marine hopeful, Carr walked throughout the early morning hours Friday because he needed, and wanted, the job with Bellhops moving company. He made it to Hoover by 2 a.m. and then to Pelham at 4 a.m.

It was in Pelham that the trek took a surprising turn. Kindness and concern from four Pelham police officers coupled with publicly-posted words of amazement and admiration from the moving company's clients about Carr's work ethic and dedication, led to a massive pat on the back Monday from Bellhops CEO Luke Marklin.

Marklin drove in from Tennessee under the guise of meeting Carr for coffee to personally thank him. That meeting ended with Marklin surprising Carr by giving Carr his own barely-driven 2014 Ford Escape.

""I am honestly blown away by him,'' Marklin said of Carr. ""Everything he did that day is exactly who we are - heart and grit. So far, he's batting 1,000.""

An emotional Carr had just one word when Marklin handed him the keys. ""Seriously?""

All the accolades over the weekend started with a post from Jenny Lamey on Facebook. She wrote that she and her husband, Chris, got up about 5:45 a.m. Friday to get everything staged and ready for the movers. About 6:30 a.m. their doorbell rang and the Lameys found Pelham police officers at their door.

""He proceeded to tell us that he had picked up 'this nice kid' in Pelham early this morning. The nice kid, Walter, said that he was supposed to help us with our move today. It was his first day on the job with this moving company (Bellhops) and he was 'training' today,"" Jenny Lamey wrote Saturday night.

The officer then told the Lameys about Carr's perseverance in getting to work.

""He WALKED ALL NIGHT to get from Homewood to Pelham. Because he needed to get to work. For those reading this that are not local, that's over 20 miles. You could tell how the officer told us this story that he had complete admiration for Walter and by my reaction he could tell I did too,'' she wrote. ""The police officer said they picked him up earlier that morning, took him to get some breakfast and once they checked his story out, brought Walter to our house.""

Jenny Lamey said Carr was welcome to stay until the rest of the Bellhops crew arrived, and even offered him the chance to go upstairs and take a nap until then. He declined and said he could go ahead and get started. So, he began alongside the Lameys until the crews got there.

""We chatted while we were working together early yesterday morning. He loved my kitchen and said that it was exactly the kind of kitchen he would want. He was from New Orleans. He and his mother lost their home in Hurricane Katrina and they came and made their home in Birmingham,'' she wrote. ""I asked him if he was tired from all that walking, and he said replied that he wasn't and that he had a 4-hour nap before he left at midnight. He said he made it (to) Hoover around 2 a.m. and then to Pelham around 4am, that's about when the officer picked him up and took him to get breakfast. He wore black Nike joggers which he commented that he intentionally wore because he knew he had to walk thru (sic) some pretty high grass on his middle-of-the-night trek,'' she wrote. ""He looked at me in the eye and smiled and I felt like I had known him much longer.""

Jenny Lamey also praised the rest of the moving crew, but it was clear Carr left an impression on her. She has set up a GoFundMe account to help him out.

""I just can't tell you how touched I was by Walter and his journey. He is humble and kind and cheerful and he had big dreams! He is hardworking and tough. I can't imagine how many times on that lonely walk down 280 in the middle of the night did he want to turn back,'' she wrote. ""How many times did he wonder if this was the best idea. How many times did he want to find a place to sit or lie down and wait til morning when he could maybe get someone to come pick him up and bring him back home. But he walked until he got here! I am in total awe of this young man!""

She said she made Carr tell his co-workers of his ordeal. ""Walter said, 'I walked.' That was it. Humble. I asked him to share a little more and when he did, the crew was in awe of him too,'' she wrote. ""I don't know that Walter would have shared if I hadn't asked him to.""

She ended her post with this: ""So yes, yesterday we moved. Yesterday was crazy. Yesterday was long and hard and hot. But...Walter.""

Pelham police officer Mark Knighten was the first to encounter Walter that morning. Because it was 3 a.m., and he was walking on the side of the roadway, Knighten stopped to ask Carr if everything was OK. Carr explained to him that he was walking to work, and why, and Knighten took action.

""He was very polite. It was 'yes sir' and 'no sir,''' Knighten said.

Knighten, along with officers Klint Rhodes and Carl Perkinson then took Carr to Whataburger, where they not only bought him breakfast but told him to get lunch to go as well.

Because it was still so early, Knighten said they took Carr to a church because that was the safest place to leave him until it was time for him to be at work.

Officer Scott Duffey was just coming on the clock and his fellow officers told them about their morning. Duffey then went in search of Carr who had already left the church to walk to his job assignment, which was almost in Chelsea.

Duffey picked him and drove him to the Lamey's house, where he knocked on the door and explained the situation.

Carr plans to graduate from Lawson State in December with an associate's degree in health sciences. He wants to join the U.S. Marines and then come back to Birmingham to get his bachelor's degree in physical therapy.

Carr said he is so thankful for all who stepped in. ""This was the first job in a long time to give me an opportunity to get hired,'' he said. ""I wanted to show them I got the dedication. I said I'm going to get to this job one way or another.''

""I want people to know this - no matter what the challenge is, you can break through the challenge. Nothing is impossible unless you make it impossible,'' he said. ""You can do anything you set your mind to. I've got God by my side. I'm really emotional right now trying to hold back the tears.""

Carr said his mother and father raised him to help others, and he plans to use his new car to do just that. ""To my parents, thank you for being there for me, for the hard work and dedication they put in to keep me on the right path,'' he said. ""And I want to thank God because without Him I wouldn't be here.""

""God blessed me to be a blessing,'' he said. ""Whatever challenges God puts in front of me I know its for a reason.""

Jenny Lamey also was emotional on Monday. She hugged Carr tightly and told him this: ""You've changed all of our lives Walter. You have no idea how many lives you've changed and inspired. You're a very special young man and you're going to do great things. You already are."""

Confederate Statues and Other Symbols of Racism All Over the Country Were Destroyed by Protesters This Weekend,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wbxk/confederate-statues-and-other-symbols-of-racism-all-over-the-country-were-destroyed-by-protesters-this-weekend,"Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox?

Confederate statues in Birmingham and Richmond. A former slave market in North Carolina. The national headquarters for a Civil War revisionist group.

These were just some of the monuments and buildings symbolizing centuries of systemic racism in America that were hit during the weekend’s protests, following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.

Windows were also broken, but the fire was eventually extinguished, according to local reports. Two hundred miles up I-95 North, in Richmond, Virginia, the national headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was also set on fire.

The UDC and its brother group, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, were responsible for the lion’s share of Confederate monuments built across the country in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The UDC has built over 400 Confederate monuments on public land alone,

according to a 2016 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center

.

Protesters in Richmond also tagged a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, while people in Birmingham, Alabama, succeeded in pulling down a statue of Charles Linn, one of the city’s founders and a captain in the Confederate Navy.

In Philadelphia, a statue honoring former police commissioner and Mayor Frank Rizzo has been at the center of controversy for years. Over the weekend it was defaced, and protesters set fire to it and attempted to pull it down. As commissioner Rizzo ordered raids and strip searches of Black Panther Party members, and as mayor he once urged his supporters to “vote white” for a change to the Philadelphia city charter that would allow him to run for a third term.

Though the Rizzo statue didn’t come down yesterday, Philadelphia officials promised it would within the next month. “It's time,” city council member Helen Gym tweeted. “Almost three years after Charlottesville, the Rizzo statue will come down - and the fight for greater justice must continue.”"
"In tribute of Stephen Hawking, EVE Online pilots are lighting beacons all across its galaxy",https://www.pcgamer.com/in-tribute-of-stephen-hawking-eve-online-pilots-are-lighting-beacons-all-across-its-galaxy/,"Science fiction owes a great deal to Stephen Hawking. His groundbreaking theories in astrophysics and cosmology helped cement our understanding of everything from black holes to relativity. And when he passed away yesterday at the age of 76, players in the EVE Online community decided to recognize his contributions to science in their own way by covering the night sky in beacons.

Called cynosural beacons, these modules emit a bright, radiant light and are used to open jump bridges that ships can use as a warp destination. On a normal day, seeing a cynosural beacon flare up is reason to panic—it often signals the cavalry has arrived to obliterate you. But yesterday and today, the beacons are appearing all across space as tribute to Hawking and his achievements.

The passing of Hawking has even inspired one pilot to travel to the system of Molea, the location of EVE's own player-run graveyard , where they plan on leaving a memorial for him.

Thanks to a Reddit thread by 'kairiola,' pilots all across New Eden began lighting beacons at 22:00 UTC, with many staying lit for hours. Due to in-game rules, cynosural beacons can only be lit in null-sec and low-sec areas of space, where there's no real NPC police force to protect you. The image below is a heat map of New Eden showing the density of cynosural beacons, with massive colorations representing hundreds of lit beacons.

Here are some actual in-space shots of beacons lit all around New Eden. If you're having trouble identifying them, they look like distant galaxies."
Seth MacFarlane Donates $1M to Irwin Family Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital,https://tvweb.com/seth-macfarlane-irwin-family-australia-zoo-wildlife-hospital/?fbclid=IwAR0eO-std3wRSCquh5ipNRwoKVXvzF9yvU7pip-xSJ75WU1PD0FVUR760eA,"Seth MacFarlane has donated one million dollars to the Crocodile Hunter Family Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, and the money will be directly used to build a new Koala Intensive Care Ward to bring aid to more injured koalas in need of care. After the devastating bushfires in Australia reportedly killed upwards of a billion animals of all types and injured countless more, celebrities like Chris Hemsworth, Pink, and Elton John have been donating time and money to assist with the relief efforts. Now, with MacFarlane's donation, another million dollars will go directly towards helping many displaced and injured koalas.

On Kangaroo Island alone, tens of thousands of koalas are feared dead or homeless. Because of their slow moving nature and the destruction of their food source, koalas are among the animals who've been affected the most by the Australian bushfires. Thanks to MacFarlane's donation to the Irwin Family, many more of them will be able to receive proper care from professionals as well, and the zoo hospital expansion has even been named in part after the Family Guy creator to thank him for the contribution.

""A huge thanks to Seth MacFarlane for donating a million dollars to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital to help with the influx of patients affected by drought and bushfire!"" the zoo's Wildlife Warriors account posted on Twitter, along with a photograph of the new ward's exterior design. The statement goes on to add: ""We're so pleased to announce that we will be naming our new Koala Intensive Care Ward in recognition of Seth's generosity. Plans for the Perry MacFarlane Intensive Care Ward are well underway and we'll soon begin construction on this crucial expansion to the hospital.""

Bindi Irwin, Steve ""The Crocodile Hunter"" Irwin's daughter, has also thanked MacFarlane for the donation with a post on Twitter of her own. ""On behalf of all wildlife, thank you so much for your support Seth MacFarlane. You are an extraordinary Wildlife Warrior,"" Irwin says in the post. The term Wildlife Warrior comes from the Irwin family's conservationist organization, which was originally established by Steve and his wife, Terri, in 2002. Following Steve's untimely passing in 2006, Bindi became the new public face of the organization at the age of nine.

Since the establishment of the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, over 90,000 injured animals have been treated in the building. The bushfires obviously brought in a massive increase of affected animals needing care, and the Irwins and the other staff at the Australia Zoo and in other Australian facilities have been doing their best to save as many as they can. With limited space and resources, these kinds of charitable donations are crucial as they can literally make the difference between life or death for these koalas and other suffering animals.

There's been no shortage of terrible news in the press lately, and stories like this can feel like a ray of sunshine poking through the darkness. Credit goes to MacFarlane and everyone else who's contributed anything at all to the relief efforts of the horrible Australian bushfires. You can take a look at the tweets from Wildlife Warriors and Bindi Irwin below. This news comes to us from Wildlife Warriors on Twitter.

Snow leopards sighted for first time ever in eastern Tibet,https://www.dailysabah.com/environment/2017/12/18/snow-leopards-sighted-for-first-time-ever-in-eastern-tibet-report-says,"Snow leopards were captured on film for the first time ever in eastern Tibet with the help of remote infrared cameras, Chinese media reported Monday.

""We have captured images of baby leopards with their mother, which indicates a certain quantity of the rare species live in the region,"" Zhao Xiang, head of the Shan Shui Conservation Center, told the Xinhua news agency.

The cameras were set up in the Nujiang River Valley, also known as the Nu River. It is home to one of Asia's last ""wild rivers"" unencumbered by dams or other projects, according to the U.S.-based non-profit environmental group International Rivers.

The presence of the leopards may be a sign that local conservation efforts are working, Xinhua said.

Snow leopards are classified as a ""vulnerable"" species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which estimates there are between 2,500 and 10,000 left in the world.

Because snow leopards are extremely shy, scientists rely on non-invasive infrared cameras, which automatically snap images whenever they detect a warm-blooded creature passing by. Scientists then analyze the film to identify species captured by the cameras, using spot patterns on snow leopards' coats to track individual animals.

Tibet is a special autonomous region of China and has been ruled by Beijing since 1951."
Aldi to give away all its unsold fresh food to 'less fortunate individuals' on Christmas Eve,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/aldi-food-christmas-eve-give-away-less-fortunate-food-banks-tesco-sainsbury-lidl-a8088511.html,"Aldi has offered to give all its unsold fresh food away to charities and good causes when its stores close on Christmas Eve.

The supermarket chain issued an appeal on social media urging organisations across the country to collect items left over after its branches have shut up shop for the festive period.

A statement issued by the firm says it wants to share products out with groups such as food banks in support of “less fortunate individuals” in order to “prevent food going to waste”.

The supermarket said: “Aldi is offering local organisations the opportunity to receive surplus food from their stores on the afternoon of Christmas Eve.

“As Aldi stores will shut at 4pm on Christmas Eve until December 27, they will have a variety of good quality surplus food products that they will wish to redistribute in support of less fortunate individuals and to prevent food going to waste.

“Aldi is unable to deliver products so it would be essential that your organisation is able to collect.

“They will expect the level of food available to vary, however, estimations of around 20 to 30 crates will be expected from each store.”

The move has earned the store praise from social media users, who urged other big chains to match the gesture.

Chipotle will pay 100% tuition for you to go to college if you are employed by them,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/18/chipotle-employees-can-go-to-college-debt-free.html,"On Oct. 15, fast-food chain Chipotle announced it would expand its education benefits program. It will now provide employees with the opportunity to earn a degree in 75 different business and technology fields, debt-free.

The initiative covers 100% of tuition costs up front, for eligible employees to earn associate's and bachelor's degrees in fields ranging from cybersecurity to supply chain logistics at the University of Arizona, Bellevue University, Brandman University, Southern New Hampshire University and Wilmington University.

To qualify, Chipotle employees must have worked at the company for at least 120 days and work at least 15 hours — approximately two or three shifts — per week.

The program is run in partnership with Guild Education, a tuition reimbursement and education platform with a list of clients that includes massive employers like Walmart, Disney, Lowe's and Taco Bell.

In 2018, Walmart announced a partnership with Guild Education that would give Walmart's roughly 1.4 million employees the opportunity to earn an associate's or bachelor's degree in business or supply chain management from the University of Florida, Brandman University and Bellevue University. Since then, Walmart has dramatically expanded its educational benefits to include more than 50 programs.

When Guild works with other large companies, they typically ""highly curate"" the types of programs employees can choose from, Marissa Andrada, chief people officer at Chipotle, tells CNBC Make It.

""What's different with us is we've decided to pivot and focus, for now, on business and technology degrees,"" she says.

It makes sense for Chipotle to select those types of programs, she says. ""If you think about those two spaces, it really plays into our growth plan for not only the company but our growth plan for our employees."""

"The Koreans Who Cheer For Other Countries : 'It’s just sports. It’s okay to support other countries and other athletes,' says founder of 100,000-strong group dedicated to cheering non-local teams.",https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2018/02/07/the-koreans-who-cheer-for-canada-and-china-and-russia-and-japan.html,"PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA—It wasn’t long after the Air Canada flight containing Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir touched down at South Korea’s largest airport that the Canadian figure skating duo was greeted by a loud and happy throng.

Who were those people waving Canadian flags and cheering with a patriotic fervour that suggested they carried passports bearing the national maple leaf? Most of them were not Canadians. Some were members of the Korean Supporters, a group of Korean volunteers who plan to devote their Olympics to an unusual mission: Cheering for countries other than their own.

“Everyone else in Korea is going to support Korea. We’re trying to focus on other countries,” said Ki Yang Cho, head of communications for the Korean Supporters, speaking through a translator.

Ki said the group, which has about 100,000 registered members, has been bringing about 200 volunteers to Seoul’s Incheon Airport most days this week to happily fete Olympic athletes and tourists as they take their first steps on Korean soil. They’ve created an assembly line of all-nations goodwill; shortly after Virtue and Moir had their moment earlier this week, members of Russia’s men’s hockey team emerged to a similarly boisterous welcome.

Once the Games begin, there are plans to assign squads of about 100 to 120 Korean Supporters to each Olympic event. The Supporters buy their own tickets and are encouraged to cheer in the native tongue of the athletes they’re tasked with supporting.

“We’re cheering in Russian, English, Chinese, Japanese,” said Ki. “We’re going to have chants. We’re going to call out phrases. We’re going to wave flags.”

Possibly even the flag of North Korea — which is normally illegal to display here given the nuclear-standoff-induced tensions between the neighbours. With North Korea having arrived at the Games with a small contingent of athletes — not to mention a 229-strong cheer squad meant to root for athletes from both Koreas — the Korean Supporters do not plan to let old grudges ruin the spirit of their cause.

“We’re not going to treat the North Koreans as special. We’re going to support them like we do other nations,” said Ki.

The organization was founded by businessman Moon Sang Ju in the lead-up to the 2002 World Cup of soccer, co-hosted by South Korea and Japan. Moon’s idea at the time, he said, was to help improve his country’s global image and to promote world peace.

“The entire world is one family, even if we’re from different countries,” said Moon, 72, also speaking through a translator. “It’s just sports. It’s okay to support other countries and other athletes.”

That view hasn’t always been received with universal agreement in Korea, which harbours a sports culture which encourages boisterous and elaborate cheering for the home team, albeit without the violent hooliganism that sometimes mars the endeavour elsewhere. During a World Cup soccer game in 2002 between Korea and Poland in Busan, Korea’s second-most populous city, the Korean Supporters enlisted a squad of about 500 volunteers to cheer for Poland. The story goes that many of the volunteers were swept up in the moment and ended up cheering for their homeland instead. When Korea won, igniting a memorable run to the World Cup semifinal, nationalistic sentiment soared.

“There definitely were times when people actually said we should only cheer for Korea,” said Moon. “When that happened I tried to explain to people our mission. Some of those people became part of this organization, and now they’re cheering for other nations with us.”

The official tagline of the 2018 Olympics goes: “Passion. Connected.” For the Korean Supporters, it’s more like: “Passion. Practised.” The group has its own song and its own dance. It has its own uniform — an eye-catching yellow vest. And Ki acknowledged that it even has its imitators — other groups also plan to cheer for visiting nations at these Olympics, although he said he didn’t know much about them.

The Supporters’ pursuit also comes with its challenges. Ki said it isn’t difficult to find volunteers to cheer for athletes from other countries at popular marquee events like, say, figure skating — where Virtue and Moir, Canada’s flag-bearers at Friday’s opening ceremony, will look to expand an Olympic medal collection that already includes a gold and two silvers. That’s why the Korean Supporters have been focusing their efforts on encouraging members to attend less glamorous events held outdoors — say, cross-country skiing and biathlon. With temperatures expected to plummet well below freezing during the Games, it’s been a tall order.

“Because of the cold weather it’s very hard to make volunteers go to some of those events. But my plan is to have 100 to 120 volunteers at each event,” said Ki.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

Moon, the group’s founder, said the sub-zero temperatures at what’s expected to be one of the coldest Olympics in history only make his group’s noble mission more necessary. In a geopolitical hot spot, the idea is to warm hearts.

“In the cold weather, being cheered is a very good thing. It makes you happy,” said Moon. “There are a lot of people in the world worrying about nuclear war in this Korean Peninsula. So we’re thankful to the athletes and tourists for coming to Korea. That’s what motivates us to support Canadians and athletes from all over the world. We’re trying to promote a world where there is no war.”"

Placek said that forgoing more than $50,000 in rent payments from tenants was an easy decision to make.

“It was more a question of why not do this for our tenants. We ask them to pay it forward so if they can go out and buy take out from the restaurants or gift cards from the other small businesses or pay it forward to the local food bank we had in Montclair, N.J. called Tony’s Kitchen.”

Placek said that it benefits all their “stakeholders.”

House votes to end jail time for being too poor to pay fines,https://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/23/texas-house-clears-bill-eliminating-jail-time-being-too-poor-pay-traff/,"Legislation that would make it easier for poor people to satisfy traffic tickets with alternatives to payment cleared the Texas House on Tuesday on a vote of 75-70. The bill needs to be approved by the Senate again before moving to Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.

Senate Bill 1913, by state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, would allow courts to ask defendants if they are too poor to pay for traffic tickets; fines for other low-level and fine-only offenses; or court costs. After making that determination, courts would be allowed to reduce or waive fines and costs and offer community service as an alternative.

""They're not getting off scot-free. We're getting something for something,"" the bill's House sponsor, Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, told members Monday. ""We are filling our jails up with people who should not be there.""

For fine-only offenses, jail time only comes into the picture when someone doesn't pay their fine — a risk borne by thousands of Texans, according to a recently released report by Texas Appleseed and the Texas Fair Defense Project. Those who can't afford to pay often find themselves hit with additional fines or other restrictions, such as being blocked from renewing their driver's licenses and vehicle registrations. Critics call it debtors' prison.

More than 200,000 Texans can't renew their licenses, and approximately 400,000 have holds on vehicle registrations due to unpaid fines, according to the report. In 2015, almost 3 million warrants were issued in cases where the punishment was originally just a fine.

Courts generally don't offer alternatives to jailing or ask about a defendant's ability to pay, the study found. In 2015, judges rarely used community service to resolve ""fine-only"" cases – just 1.3 percent of the time. In fewer than 1 percent of cases, they waived fines or reduced payments owed because the defendant couldn't afford to pay, according to the study.

Legislation tackling this issue has a high-profile supporter in Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Nathan Hecht.

Jailing a person who can't pay fines and court costs ""keeps them from jobs, hurts their families, makes them dependent on society and costs the taxpayers money,"" he said during his State of the Judiciary speech in February.

"Airline safety: 2017 was safest year in history for passengers around world, research shows",http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/air-safety-2017-best-year-safest-airline-passengers-worldwide-to70-civil-aviation-review-a8130796.html,"In a year when more people flew to more places than ever, 2017 was the safest on record for airline passengers.

The Dutch-based aviation consultancy, To70, has released its Civil Aviation Safety Review for 2017. It reports only two fatal accidents, both involving small turbo-prop aircraft, with a total of 13 lives lost.

No jets crashed in passenger service anywhere in the world.

The two crashes which occurred on New Year’s Eve – a seaplane in Sydney which killed six, and a Cessna Caravan which crashed in Costa Rica, killing all 12 on board – are not included in the tally, since both aircraft weighed under 5,700kg - the threshold for the report.

The first fatal accident included in the report was in October: an Embraer Brasilia operating as an air ambulance in Angola. The pilots lost control after reportedly suffering an engine failure, Seven people died, including the patient.

In November, a Czech-built Let 410 belonging to Khabarovsk Avia crashed on landing at Nelkan in the Russian Far East with the loss of six lives. A four-year-old girl was the only survivor.

Video supposedly shows seaplane flying moments before Hawkesbury River crash in Australia

A much higher death toll occurred in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, when a Turkish Boeing 747 freighter belonging to ACT AIrlines overshot the runway and ended up in a village close to the airport, killing 35 on the ground as well as four crew.

In addition, jet blast killed a tourist standing close to the runway on the Caribbean island of St Maarten.

The chances of a plane being involved in a fatal accident is now one in 16 million, according to the lead researcher, Adrian Young.

But Mr Young, senior aviation consultant for To70, told The Independent: “It is unlikely that this historic low will be maintained; in part, these very positive figures rest on good fortune. Nevertheless, the safety level that civil aviation has achieved is remarkable”.

He cautioned: “The risks to civil aviation remain high as shown by the seriousness of some of the non-fatal accidents.” They included, he said, “the spectacular loss of the inlet fan and cowling of an engine on an Air France A380” over Greenland in September.

“That the aeroplane continued to operate safely to a diversion airport and was then flown home for repair on three engines says a lot about the robustness of the aeroplane.”

The report warns that electronic devices in checked-in bags pose a growing potential danger: “The increasing use of lithium-ion batteries in electronics creates a fire risk on board aeroplanes as such batteries are difficult to extinguish if they catch fire.

“Airlines worldwide are training their crews to fight any fires in the cabin; the challenge is keeping such batteries out of passenger luggage.”

In 2016, 271 people lost their lives in seven fatal events. They included the crash of an Egyptair flight from Paris to Cairo which killed 66, and a LaMia jet carrying the Brazilian football team Chapecoense which ran out of fuel in Colombia and crashed with the loss of 71 lives.

The death toll in the two previous years was significantly higher. In 2015, 471 people died in four crashes; they included a Metrojet flight from Sharm el Sheikh to St Petersburg, Russia, which killed 224, and a Germanwings Airbus A320 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf whose first officer, Andreas Lubitz, killed 150 on board by deliberately crashing into the French Alps,

In 2014, 864 people died in five crashes, including the losses of two Malaysia Airlines 777s: MH370, whose fate is still unknown, and MH17, downed by a missile over eastern Ukraine.

The UK has the best air-safety record of any major country. No fatal accidents involving a British airline have happened since the 1980s. The last was on 10 January 1989; 47 people died when a British Midland Boeing 737 crashed at Kegworth in Leicestershire."

“Everybody’s out,” said spokesman James Wellsted, adding that there were “cases of dehydration and high blood pressure but nothing serious”.

The miners were stuck in the Beatrix gold mine, in the small town of Theunissen near the city of Welkom, for around 30 hours after a massive power outage caused by a storm prevented lifts from bringing workers on the night shift to the surface.

After several hours engineers were able to restore power, allowing the hoist to bring up the miners who had been trapped since Wednesday evening in batches.

Asked if there had been any casualties, Wellsted said there was “no indication so far that anyone has been in distress” although it had been a “traumatic experience”.

Several ambulances arrived on-site overnight, the AFP reporter said.

Nervous family members had earlier patiently gathered along the road to the shaft, kept at a distance by security guards.

"British Columbia has banned all grizzly bear hunting effective immediately, closing a loophole that existed for meat hunting",https://bc.ctvnews.ca/b-c-bans-grizzly-hunting-effective-immediately-1.3726358,"Less than a month after a ban on grizzly bear trophy hunting came into effect, the province has decided to expand the ban to include hunting the species for meat.

B.C.'s minister of forests, lands and natural resources made the announcement Monday, stating that the decision was made after consultations conducted earlier this fall.

""We have listened to what British Columbians have to say on this issue and it is abundantly clear that the grizzly hunt is not in line with their values,"" Doug Donaldson said in a statement.

The government consulted with Aboriginal groups, stakeholders and the public, and said that 78 per cent of respondents supported an outright ban.

Grizzly hunting season will no longer open April 1, the government said. The ban applies to both resident and non-resident hunters, but First Nations members will still be permitted to hunt bears for food, social and ceremonial purposes and treaty rights.

Coastal First Nations celebrated the expanded prohibition as an ""important step toward reconciliation.""

Environment Minister George Heyman said the ban, as well as a focused grizzly bear management plan, were the first steps in protecting the species.

He said the province also hopes to promote grizzly bear viewing programs, giving residents and visitors the opportunity to view the bears in their natural habitat.

Speaking on behalf of the B.C. Greens, MLA Adam Olsen said his party was ""absolutely overjoyed"" with the decision.

The ban came less than a month after the province's ban on trophy hunting of grizzlies came into effect. Grizzly hunting in the Great Bear Rainforest was also no longer permitted as of Nov. 30.

The province said staff will also be implementing recommendations made in a report released in October on grizzly bear management.

The report found that the greatest risk to B.C.'s 15,000 grizzlies is the degradation of their habitat, not hunting.

B.C.'s auditor general cited increased infrastructure, expansion of gas and oil development and human settlement as the bears' biggest threat.

Carol Bellringer also criticized ministry management in her review of conservation programs operating over the last 20 years. She found that the ministries of environment and natural resources had launched initiatives meant to help the species thrive, but never actually evaluated whether the programs were effective.

B.C.'s grizzly populations are increasing in some areas, but Bellringer said the growth is likely independent from the government's actions.

The government said Monday it would soon begin a consultation process on a renewed wildlife management strategy.

In addition to the auditor general's report, B.C.'s grizzly hunt also made headlines in September when singer Miley Cyrus added her name to a list of those lobbying the government to close the ""loophole"" of hunting for food.

Cyrus and others were critical of the previous policy that came into effect at the end of November that allowed the killing of grizzlies as long as they removed some of the animals' meat.

The trophy hunting loophole has been eliminated with the updated policy, the Humane Society International's Canadian executive director said.

In a statement to CTV News, Rebecca Aldworth said that the government showed strong leadership with the move: ""Grizzly hunting has no place in the 21st century, and today's announcement is a crucial step forward in protecting these majestic animals from senseless cruelty.""

The Coast to Cascades Grizzly Bear Initiative also said the ban was welcome, but that the group is hopeful the province will now set its sights on recovering at-risk populations that were already off-limits to hunters.

The group cited a recommendation from the auditor general to have certain grizzly subpopulations added to the federal Species At Risk Act (SARA), a move that would bring ""much-needed attention and resources"" to recovering the species in areas where the bears have dwindled.

""What these particular grizzlies really need right now are quick actions that prioritize recovery and deliver on the commitment made by the province to improve their approach to managing the species,"" field director Johnny Mikes said in a statement.

And others were critical of the way the NDP updated its hunting policy weeks after the trophy ban began. The B.C. Wildlife Federation, a conservation organization that supports sustainable hunting and fishing, was critical of the change of heart, saying it was ""deceived"" during the consultation process.

The BCWF said it was told that the NDP was only looking at what to do with parts of bears used as trophies, and that there would be no discussion about hunting in general. The organization previously spoke out about the ban on trophy hunting, saying the rule requiring hunters to throw out parts typically kept as trophies was wasteful.

On Monday, the organization called the process undemocratic and a red flag in terms of government transparency.

""The government set the goal posts, and chose not to consult on grizzly bear hunting, and then changed its mind after consultation,"" the BCWF said in a statement.

The group also alleged that the polls conducted during the consultation process were funded by anti-hunting organizations and did not accurately represent public interest.

""This is the most disingenuous approach to forming public policy I have ever seen during my career inside and outside government,"" president Harvey Andrusak said.

The BCWF said it expects closing the hunt outright will result in increased human-bear confrontations and attacks and that taxpayers will be on the hook for managing the bear population. Referencing the auditor general's report, the BCWF said habitat loss is a more important issue to address, and that many of its members feel betrayed.

""While those opposed to grizzly bear hunting may rejoice it is a sad day when emotions trump science,"" the statement said."
South Korea reports more recoveries than coronavirus cases for the first time,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea/south-korea-reports-more-recoveries-than-coronavirus-cases-for-the-first-time-idUKKBN210051,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since its outbreak emerged in January, as a downward trend in daily cases raised hopes that Asia’s biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) recorded 110 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with 114 a day earlier, taking the national tally to 7,979. The death toll rose by five to 72 as of late Friday.

In contrast, 177 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment, the KCDC said.

This marks the first time that the daily number of recovered people exceeded that of new infections since South Korea’s first patient was confirmed on Jan. 20.

The latest figures are in line with a downward trend in new cases which has raised hopes that the outbreak may be easing in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.

The trend is expected to persist, with more self-quarantined patients being discharged in the coming days, KCDC chief Jeong Eun-kyeong said.

But officials urged vigilance after new clusters of infections emerged at a call center in a crowded part of capital Seoul, and the fisheries ministry based in the administrative city of Sejong.

“We’ve managed to turn the corner, but there are concerns about overseas inflows, as well as possible infections at home around such facilities as call centers, computer cafes and karaoke rooms,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said at a meeting in Daegu.

Of the latest 110 cases, 61 were from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu where a fringe Christian church at the center of the epidemic is located, while 17 and 13 were in Sejong and Seoul, respectively.

At least 109 cases so far have been linked to the call center, operated by an insurance company whose 800-strong workforce is being tested or in quarantine for monitoring. But the rate of increase in new infections has been slowing over the past couple of days.

Seoul city said it plans to carry out extensive checks on some 10,500 computer cafes and karaoke bars as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in crowded workplaces.

“We assess that we’ve put out a big fire, but cannot lower our guard yet”, Mayor Park Won-soon told a briefing.

Global alarm over the coronavirus intensified, with governments from Europe to the United States unveiling new measures aimed at slowing the spread of a disease that has infected almost 135,000 people worldwide.

South Korea said it will subject visitors from France, Germany, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands to reinforced border checks starting Sunday, after imposing similar rules for China, Italy and Iran suffering a major outbreak."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine cast supports Terry Crews,https://uproxx.com/tv/andy-samberg-brooklyn-nine-nine-terry-crews-sexual-assault/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post,"



Speaking with the Associated Press, comedy actor Andy Samberg expressed his support for fellow Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Terry Crews, who testified about sexual assault and toxic masculinity before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. “We have a cast text chain and we were all texting him how incredible it was,” he said. “He’s a miracle. Terry’s the best guy. I am proud to know him.”

During his testimony, Crews described “how toxic masculinity permeates culture” via his own example. In November, the actor revealed Hollywood executive Adam Venit had groped him at a party in the presence of his wife and others. Not only was Venit’s punishment minor, but many in the industry turned on Crews. “As I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay,” he explained. “One man’s horseplay is another man’s humiliation. And I chose to tell my story and share my experience to stand in solidarity with millions of other survivors around the world.”

Crews also revealed that sharing his story had cost him a role in the latest Expendables franchise sequel. Even so, his Brooklyn Nine-Nine colleagues and others were quick to come to his defense. Joe Lo Truglio, who plays Charles Boyle on the series, declared, “So shines a good deed in a weary world.”

National Suicide Prevention Hotline is Getting Its Own 3-Digit Number in the US (988) - A quick & easy Number to remember for help like 911.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/17/politics/fcc-suicide-prevention-hotline-number/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Federal Communications Commission has proposed a three-digit number for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 988.

The federal agency's staff made the recommendation this week in a report to Congress, finding that using a shorter and easier to remember number ""would likely make it easier for Americans in crisis to access potentially life-saving resources.""

The push for change comes as America's suicide rates are at the highest level since World War II, with an increase of 33% from 1999 to 2017 alone, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Annual research published in June by the agency's National Center for Health Statistics found suicide rates among people 15 to 64 climbed significantly during that period, rising from 10.5 per 100,000 people in 1999 to 14 per 100,000 in 2017, the most recent year with available data.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement Thursday that he intends to move forward on the recommendation.

""In the meantime, my heart goes out to anyone facing a crisis,"" Pai said. ""I hope they will contact 1-800-273-TALK for support today.""

Under the rule-making process, the FCC notifies the public and allows for a period of at least 30 days for public comment.

According to the report, the FCC had considered other three-digit options for the hotline, but determined that the 988 number ""could be implemented more easily and quickly than repurposing an existing 3-digit"" number.

Last year, counselors answered over 2.2 million calls and over 100,000 online chats, according to the FCC.

Republican Utah Rep. Chris Stewart, who helped pass a bipartisan law that led to the FCC report, praised the announcement. The law, signed by President Donald Trump in 2018, called for a study to determine the hotline's effectiveness and the best three-digit dialing code for the hotline.

Asking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.



The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.

""Today's announcement by the FCC is another important step to provide critical resources to address mental health and suicide in our state and country. This will save lives,"" Stewart said in a statement Thursday.

The National Suicide Prevention Hotline was launched in 2005 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Vibrant Emotional Health, a mental health nonprofit.

Calls to the current 10-digit number, 1-800-273-8255 (TALK), are routed from anywhere in the United States to the closest certified crisis center. It provides free and confidential support 24 hours a day, seven days a week for people in suicidal crisis or distress.

More than 47,000 Americans died by suicide and more than 1.4 million adults attempted to take their own lives in 2017, according to the Health and Human Services' substance abuse and mental health services agency.

Suicide is the10th leading cause of death in the US, according to the CDC

To get help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454."
Gay couple adopts baby living with HIV after she was rejected by 10 other families,https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/10/16/gay-couple-adopts-baby-living-with-hiv-after-rejected-by-10-families/,"Damian Pighin and Ariel Vijarra with their daughter Olivia (Twitter)

A gay couple in Argentina have adopted a baby that was rejected by 10 other families because she is HIV positive.

Damian Pighin and Ariel Vijarra decided to adopt as far back as 2011, and in 2014 they received a call to say that a newborn baby was ready to join their family, UNILAD reports.

The girl had been born with HIV and had tragically been rejected by 10 other families.

But her HIV-status did not matter to Pighin and Vijarra. Speaking to local media, Ariel said that he knew she was meant to be part of his life as soon as he saw her.

“The connection was immediate. We held her in our arms, gave her the bottle and she looked at us with her eyes wide open without crying,” he said.

Their daughter is on treatment and the virus is now undetectable.

The girl – who is called Olivia – is now on treatment for HIV and the virus is now undetectable as a result.

A year later, a woman approached them and said she had heard about their story and wanted them to adopt her daughter too. They agreed and shortly afterwards welcomed their second daughter Victoria into the world.

The connection was immediate. We held her in our arms, gave her the bottle and she looked at us with her eyes wide open without crying.

The couple works for a non-governmental agency called Acunar Familias which translates as Cradle Families where they help couples adopt children.

The heartwarming story comes just months after a new study, called PARTNER2, proved that there is zero risk of transmitting HIV while on antiretroviral treatment.

HIV is untransmittable when on effective treatment

The study was published in The Lancet in May and investigated almost 1,000 gay male couples who did not use condoms across Europe over more than eight years where one partner had the virus.

Over the course of eight years, just 15 of the HIV-negative men involved contracted the virus – however researchers were able to confirm through genetic testing that none of those men contracted the virus from their partner.

Meanwhile, researchers at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine revealed in September that they had “functionally cured” mice carrying the HIV virus.

The mice were given a “long-acting slow-effective release” form of antiretroviral therapy as a part of the treatment. The researchers also used a gene editing tool to extract the remnants of the virus."
"Taiwan and Australia have reached an agreement in which the two countries will exchange raw materials desperately needed to battle the coronavirus. Australia will provide 1 million liters of alcohol for disinfectant, Taiwan to send 3 metric tons of mask fabric",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3907578,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan and Australia have reached an agreement in which the two countries will exchange raw materials desperately needed to battle the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), announced the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Monday (March 30).

On its Facebook page on Monday, the MOEA announced that Taiwan and Australia have agreed to cooperate on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Australia has pledged to provide Taiwan with 1 million liters of alcohol which can be used to produce 4.2 million 300 milliliter bottles containing 75 percent alcohol to be used as a disinfectant.

In exchange, Taiwan will offer Australia 3 metric tons of non-woven fabric to produce surgical masks once Taiwan has reached sufficient domestic production capacity. That same day, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) said that Australia has been purchasing the raw materials to make masks for many years, while about 90 percent of Taiwan's alcohol supply comes from Australia, reported Liberty Times.

Ou said that in this time of desperate shortages of epidemic prevention and medical supplies, Taiwan and Australia can join forces to combat the disease. She said that the two countries would provide each other with the raw materials at preferential prices.

Ou called Australia an important regional partner of Taiwan, as the two countries share universal values such as freedom and democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Ou said that since the coronavirus outbreak began, the two countries have maintained close cooperation, adding that they look forward to an early end to the epidemic and will continue to deepen their bilateral partnership and trade.

The latest agreement comes less than two weeks after Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) announced a Taiwan-U.S. joint statement in which the two sides agreed to step up their cooperation on the development of drugs and vaccines to battle the coronavirus. As part of the agreement, Taiwan pledged to donate 100,000 face masks per week to the U.S., while the U.S. is reserving materials for 300,000 hazmat suits for Taiwan."
Shadow of War developer who died of cancer immortalised as an in-game orc slayer. Money from selling that DLC will be sent to his family.,http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-01-shadow-of-war-developer-who-died-of-cancer-immortalised-as-an-in-game-orc-slayer,"UPDATE 5th September 2017: Warner Bros. has issued a statement on the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC, insisting the company is not profiting from sales of it.

""Neither Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment nor Monolith Productions will profit from any sales of the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC regardless of the territory in which that DLC is sold,"" Warner Bros. said.

While this statement is frustrating in its lack of clarity, it does suggest that no matter which territory you buy the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC from, Warner Bros. will make its $3.50 donation.

UPDATE 4th September 2017: Unfortunately, WB Games will only donate money to the Forgey family from purchases of the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC made from most of the states in the US. It excludes AL, HI, IL, MA, MS and SC - and of course outside the US. So if you're in Europe and you buy the DLC, none of the money goes to the Forgey family.

Those who wish to directly donate money to the Forgey family can do via YouCaring.com.

ORIGINAL STORY 1st September 2017: A Shadow of War developer who died of cancer has been immortalised as an orc slayer in the game.

Monolith executive producer Michael Forgey, who died from a brain tumour last year aged just 43-years-old, appears in Shadow of War as DLC character Forthog Orc-Slayer.

If you have the £3.99 DLC, Forthog will on occasion appear to one-hit kill whichever enemy the player character is up against. Think the Mysterious Stranger from the Fallout series.

Forgey, who was married with three children, was a music enthusiast who played in a band made up of Monolith staff called Orc Slayer. Accordingly, Forthog Orc-Slayer wields a devastating guitar axe, which you can see in the video below. (The song was written and performed by Forgey himself.)

WB Games will donate $3.50 of every Forthog Orc-Slayer purchase to the Forgey family through 31st December 2019, Monolith said.

In the video below, Monolith studio head Kevin Stephens and director of art Phil Straub remember Forgey, celebrate his life and explain how Forthog came to life.

""Mike was larger than life,"" Stephens said. ""Mike was an incredible inspiration to our team. He was our front man in many respects. Everybody loved Mike.""

""Mike was a fantastic guy,"" Straub added. ""He was a guy who always wanted to help people. He was a great manager of people.""

The cinematic trailer created by Monolith staff for the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC was designed to represent Forgey's personality, Straub explained. At the end we see Forthog smirk before running towards a number of enemies, the image eventually concealed by a blizzard.

""He's going to the Undying Lands,"" Straub said. ""He's embracing that.""

You can pre-purchase the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC on Steam and Xbox One now. He'll be available to buy on PS4 when the game launches in October."
Pornhub launches sexual education subsite,http://mashable.com/2017/02/01/porn-hub-sex-ed/?utm_cid=mash-com-fb-main-link#P3eTJM3Y25q6,"For a growing number of American kids, porn is their sex ed. Now Pornhub is hoping to offer their audience some more formal lessons in how to be a healthy and happy sexual being.

On Wednesday, the massive adult entertainment destination took the somewhat surprising step of launching the “Pornhub Sexual Health Center.” They're hoping the free sub-site will become a go-to resource for some of their 70 million daily users on all manner of topics, including STIs, sexual safety and how to manage relationships.

They’ve chosen Dr. Laurie Betito, a renowned sex therapist, to direct the site and they’ll also be working with a number of doctors, therapists and other experts to offer advice and answer questions. Corey Price, Pornhub’s Vice President, told Mashable, “Our goal is to provide our visitors with a site that has credible and insightful information, rather than have them scouring the internet.”

While it’s a database they’ll build up over time, a first look reveals they’ve started with the fundamentals — with answers to things like “Babies. Where do they come from?” and “Are there really three holes?” These might seems almost laughably basic to adult consumers of hardcore porn, but there are a lot of young people for whom these are very real questions.

Price told Mashable they weren’t aiming the content specifically at beginners. He said they simply want to appeal to “those who are looking for trustworthy sex tips and health advice provided by experts.” But it seems like they realize this could prove to be an especially valuable resource for their younger audience, who most likely isn’t getting comprehensive (much less sex-positive) sex ed in schools.

SEE ALSO: VR porn now comes with smells

There are, of course, plenty of online sexual health and education resources, but for many kids, landing on sites like Pornhub is already their way into learning about sex. Porn can obviously teach you plenty about the basics and mechanics of intercourse, but there’s a whole range of other things — biology, health, consent, relating to intimate partners, just to name a few — that you won’t pick up from watching videos like “Big tits round asses” or “Sloppy throat games.”

So if they can slide their curious audience over to the PSHC while they're already on the site, it could function as pretty useful one-stop shop for filling in the blanks left by spotty sex ed classes and the birds and bees talks given by often bewildered parents."
NJ teacher leaves $1 million to school district in her will. it will be used on scholarships for special-Education students,https://njersy.co/2JlFsl1,"This special ed teacher promised to one day donate $1M to her students. She wasn't kidding

Stephanie Noda | NorthJersey

Show Caption Hide Caption Video: Teacher remembered for donating $1 million to special needs students A special education teacher from the Dumont School District left a parting gift for her beloved students after she passed away: $1 million.

DUMONT — About 10 years ago, Superintendent Emanuele Triggiano remembers laughing when a retired teacher told him that she was going to donate a million dollars.

“I thought it was a joke,” Triggiano said. “But then we got the paperwork.”

Genevieve Via Cava, a special educator teacher in the Dumont school district, had amassed a small fortune throughout her life. When she died in 2011, she left her savings to help some of the people who meant the most to her: her special education students.

“She was very kindhearted, sometimes with a rough exterior, but very compassionate deep down,” said Richard Jablonski, a close friend and executor of her will. “She was very loving and won people over with her beautiful smile.”

Starting with the 2019-20 school year, one special education student seeking post-high-school education, such as college or a trade school, will be eligible for a $25,000 scholarship thanks to Via Cava’s million-dollar gift. The district also plans to give a scholarship out the 2018-2019 school year, although it may not be the full $25,000 amount depending on the investment, said Triggiano.

The money will stay in a fund that will generate interest, allowing the district to continue giving out the scholarships for years to come, said Business Administrator Kevin Cartotto.

Via Cava, who had no children, had spent most her of professional career in the school district, teaching both regular and special education.

D'awww: Woman helps kittens found in Dumont dumpster get homes

Her desire to pay it forward to help the future generation comes as no surprise to those who knew her best. Jablonski first met Via Cava over 35 years ago, when he operated an Annie Sez store in Closter. Via Cava would come in all the time with her husband, eventually becoming a regular customer. After her husband died around 1998, Via Cava, who lived in Oradell, would continue to frequent the store, making friends with whomever she came across that day.

“She was an amazing woman who could light up a room just by walking in,” Jablonski said. “She had a smile that was unbelievable. She could talk to anybody just to start conversation with them, and by the time they walked away, they would be hugging.”

It wasn’t just strangers that she had a knack for connecting with, but former students, too. No matter how many years had passed, she would still recognize and chat with them.

In some cases, she would help former students — who were then in their 20s or 30s — find jobs, thanks to the connections she had made in the area, said James Kennedy, another friend.

“She had an uncanny memory when it came to her students and could remember things that happened a long time ago,” he said.

Kennedy, who would eventually become principal at the district's Selzer School, knows firsthand how well Via Cava connected with students: He was one of her students himself. Kennedy had Via Cava for seventh-grade English when she taught regular education courses.

“She had a very good sense of humor,” Kennedy said. “She made kids feel relaxed and was very approachable as a person.”

Kennedy would eventually leave Dumont to go to college and teach in the Bronx, but later came back to his home district to work as a director of special services. There he reunited with Via Cava, who was then working as a learning consultant for the Child Study Team.

In addition to being a caring teacher in the classroom, Via Cava tried to help students outside the classroom, Kennedy said. She would befriend their parents and refer them to after-school groups that help special education students transition into daily life.

During all the time she was teaching and selflessly caring for students, Via Cava scrimped and saved, denying herself many things.

Jablonski thought it was probably a habit she picked up from having endured the Great Depression. When she started to lose her hearing later in life, she even refused to get hearing aids, Jablonski said.

“The Great Depression really left a mark on her,” he said. “I asked her what she was saving for, since she could afford it, and it would change her life for the better.”

What she was saving for, it turns out, was to help Dumont students, just as she had done throughout her life.

“She’s leaving behind a lasting legacy,” Jablonski said."

JOHANNESBURG -- One of Africa's largest wildlife preserves is marking a year without a single elephant found killed by poachers, which experts call an extraordinary development in an area larger than Switzerland where thousands of the animals have been slaughtered in recent years.

The apparent turnaround in Niassa reserve in a remote region of northern Mozambique comes after the introduction of a rapid intervention police force and more assertive patrolling and response by air, according to the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the reserve with Mozambique's government and several other partners.

Monitoring of the vast reserve with aerial surveys and foot patrols remains incomplete and relies on sampling, however. And despite the sign of progress, it could take many years for Niassa's elephant population to rebuild to its former levels even if poaching is kept under control.

Aggressive poaching over the years had cut the number of Niassa's elephants from about 12,000 to little over 3,600 in 2016, according to an aerial survey. Anti-poaching strategies from 2015 to 2017 reduced the number killed but the conservation group called the rate still far too high.

The new interventions, with Mozambican President Felipe Nyusi personally authorizing the rapid intervention force, have led partners to hope that Niassa's elephants ""stand a genuine chance for recovery,"" the conservation group said.

""It is a remarkable achievement,"" James Bampton, country director with the Wildlife Conservation Society, told The Associated Press. He said he discovered the year free of poaching deaths while going through data.

The last time an elephant in the Niassa reserve was recorded killed by a poacher was May 17, 2018, he said.

Political will is a key reason for the success, Bampton said, with Mozambique's president keen to see poaching reduced.

Bampton acknowledged that the low number of remaining elephants is also a factor in the decline in poaching. A year ago, he estimated that fewer than 2,000 elephants remained in Niassa, though he now says preliminary analysis of data from a survey conducted in October and not yet published indicated that about 4,000 elephants are in the reserve.

Still, a year that appears to be free of elephant poaching in the sprawling reserve drew exclamations from some wildlife experts.

""It is a major and very important development that poaching has ceased. This represents a major success,"" George Wittemyer, who chairs the scientific board for the Kenya-based organization Save the Elephants, told the AP.

The new rapid intervention police force is an elite unit that is better-armed than the reserve's normal rangers and has ""a bit of a reputation of being quite hard,"" Bampton said, adding that no ""bad incidents"" have been reported in Niassa.

Members of the force are empowered to arrest suspected poachers, put together a case within 72 hours and submit it to the local prosecutor, Bampton said. ""Just being caught with a firearm is considered intent to illegal hunting,"" with a maximum prison sentence of 16 years.

Wildlife experts have seen gains elsewhere in Africa against elephant poaching. Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, widely acknowledged as ""Ground Zero"" for poaching and linked to the Niassa reserve by a wildlife corridor, also has seen a recent decline in the killings.

African elephant poaching has declined to pre-2008 levels after reaching a peak in 2011, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

But experts say the rate of annual elephant losses still exceeds the birth rate, and the encroachment of human settlements is reducing the animals' range. Africa's elephant population has plummeted from an estimated several million around 1900 to at least 415,000, according to surveys in recent years.

Collaboration and ""huge effort"" among the Niassa reserve's partners has been crucial but data show that issues remain with other iconic species such as lions, said Rob Harris, country manager for Fauna & Flora International, which supports one of the operators in the reserve. ""So the combination of national-level support and on-the-ground effort must be maintained to improve the situation for all wildlife.""

BangBros has emerged as the folk hero of the porn industry with its most recent acquisition: PornWikiLeaks. The adult-themed production company bought out the doxxing site, which housed over 15,000 porn stars’ personal information, according to Mashable. What did they do with all that information? Well, these producers of NSFW content made it clear with a very SFW video of them setting fire to the servers holding all that explicit info. That’s both figuratively and literally, because they actually took gasoline and a lighter and scorched that shit out of existence.



BangBros now owns the domain for the site, which exists solely now to host a statement from the company. “We simply didn’t want it out there for the world to see anymore,” they write about the personal info of the adult film performers. “While shutting this site down doesn’t purge the internet of all possible ties to real names and what not, it does make it one less place to harbor and find these things easily. A forum that had 300,000 posts on it, most of them negative and hate-filled, has now disappeared.”

According to Mashable, The Wayback Machine’s archive on the site has also been completely deleted, so the cached data can’t be so easily reached again. Many applauded BangBros for actually confronting doxxing in a real, impactful way. Sex workers are also people with rights, so good on BangBros for coming to the rescue."

You never realise how the small world is until you find out that your new colleague is actually the baby you treated 28 years ago.

While most of us haven’t experienced that, that’s exactly what happened to intensive care nurse Vilma Wong.

The 54-year-old was shocked to learn that the new doctor on the block, Brandon Seminatore, was in fact a baby she nursed when he was born.

Vilma took care of Brandon when he was delivered prematurely at 26 weeks.

Vilma has been working in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto, California for 32 years.

When she saw the young doctor’s name, she instantly recognised it but could not place where she’d seen it before.

When Brandon revealed that they both worked at the hospital he was born in, she knew who he was.

Brandon, who is specialising in child neurology, even had a picture of the two taken during his early days.

They were reunited 28 years later (Picture: SWNS)

‘I got very suspicious because I remember being the primary nurse to a baby with the same last name,’ Vilma explained about seeing his name for the first time.

‘I asked him if his dad was a police officer and there was a big silence and then he asked me if I was Vilma.

‘I said yes.

‘Apparently, his mother asked him to look for nurse Vilma in the NICU, but he told his mom that I had probably retired by now.

‘I was in shock initially but overjoyed to know that I took care of him almost 30 years ago and now he’s as a pediatric resident to the same population he was part of when he was born.’

Brandon said: ‘Meeting Vilma was a surreal experience.

‘I never expected to meet a provider who took care of me when I was a baby.

‘When Vilma recognised my name, I remembered the photos my parents had shown me and I truly sunk in that I was one of these babies.

‘I’ve come full circle and I’m taking care of babies with the nurse who took care of me.

‘Not all of us will get the chance to see our patients grow up, and I was so happy to be able to share that moment with her.’

Hallie Wells teacher receives $30,000 prize

Chance the Rapper, a popular Chicago musician, surprised a Hallie Wells Middle School teacher with a national award, including $30,000 in prize money, during a virtual awards ceremony Friday night.

Streaming live to his 11.7 million followers on Instagram, Chance gave the final of 10 awards to Michael Doggett, an English teacher at the Clarksburg school. The awards were presented over three days during National Teacher Appreciation Week.

Doggett talked with Chance the Rapper, whose songs include “No Problem” and “Hot Shower,” for about 15 minutes via webcam as thousands watched.

Sponsored by Box Tops for Education and General Mills, the inaugural Twilight Awards were presented to educators who show dedication, originality and creativity to engage students.

After recognizing a librarian from Lincoln, Nebraska, and a physical education teacher from St. Louis, Missouri, Chance summoned a drumroll and announced the final winner.

“The fact you’re in the field of teaching is a blessing to humanity, and it’s a big deal you’re hands on in developing the next generation,” Chance said to Doggett.

Obviously emotional, Doggett said he’s been engaged in teaching since his sister was born when he was 9 years old. Teaching, he said, makes him “feel like I have a mission and like I have a purpose.”

Doggett was nominated by his colleagues at Hallie Wells for his work to engage students by incorporating youth culture and hip-hop in his lessons. Doggett, who has worked at Hallie Wells for three years, organizes an annual hip-hop showcase at the school. He helps students write, produce and perform their own music, some of which is played in the hallways between classes, Chance said.

During remote learning due to the coronavirus pandemic, Doggett has posted videos of himself rapping.

The lyrics are generally words of encouragement for his students, which has helped keep them motivated, according to a message submitted to support Doggett’s nomination.

Chance praised Doggett for his “raw as hell” and “super dope” approach to teaching.

“I’m just trying to take in everything my students are giving me emotionally and be able to connect with them in any way that I can,” Doggett said during the live stream, “and this is the best way I can do it.”

In a message to Bethesda Beat on Saturday, Doggett said he doesn’t do his work alone.

“Although so many of them are true heroes, unfortunately, only very few teachers get to feel as appreciated as I have during this Teacher Appreciation Week,” Doggett wrote. “One of those heroes is my friend, Mr. Ritchie, whose selflessness and creativity inspired me to write Hey Students 8: Teachers’ Edition. In this unprecedented time in the history of education, we are all in this together for our kids.”

Chance said he began exploring the idea of hosting an awards ceremony equivalent to “the Grammys for teachers” in 2017, after donating $1 million to Chicago Public Schools for enrichment programming. After working with teachers in the city, Chance said he realized educators are “grossly and criminally underpaid, in overcrowded classrooms.”

“I started wondering, ‘Why do I have all these awards for my silly little singing, and I’m not raising the next generation?’ ” Chance said. “… We’re living in a crazy moment in American history and world history right now, and the people who are gonna fix the world are the ones raising the next generation.”

Doggett will receive $15,000 of the prize money from the award and Hallie Wells Middle School will receive $15,000."

The investigators are to publish their report on Tuesday in the journal Nature and to present some of the details at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle.

Publicly, the scientists are describing the case as a long-term remission. In interviews, most experts are calling it a cure, with the caveat that it is hard to know how to define the word when there are only two known instances."

"The world's largest furniture retailer IKEA has revealed that 70% of the materials used to make its products during 2018 were either renewable or recycled, as it strives to reach the 100% mark by 2030.",https://www.edie.net/news/12/People-and-Planet-Positive--Ikea-reveals-mixed-progress-towards--climate-positive--and-circular-economy-goals/,"Ikea reveals mixed progress towards 'climate-positive' and circular economy goals

The world's largest furniture retailer has revealed that 70% of the materials used to make its products during 2018 were either renewable or recycled, as it strives to reach the 100% mark by 2030.

The progress was posted in Ikea’s latest sustainability report, which also documents the actions the retail giant has taken to date to achieve its visions of becoming “climate-positive”, free from single-use plastic and sourcing 100% renewable energy. These overarching aims were set last June as part of Ikea’s refreshed ‘People and Planet Positive’ sustainability strategy.

Published late last week, the sustainability report reveals that 60% of all the raw materials Ikea sourced to produce products during 2018 were from “renewable” sources such as cotton and bamboo, with a further 10% accounted for by pre or post-consumer recycled material. It claims that Ikea is “on track” to achieve 100% by 2030 but will need to work with industry to spur the creation of larger supply chains for recycled materials such as wood, plastic and fabrics.

The 59-page report additionally notes that 100% of the cotton sourced by Ikea during 2018 was certified as sustainable for a second year running, while the proportion stood at 85% for wood – up from 77% in 2017.

With regards to renewable power, the report reveals that Ikea now uses renewable generation to meet 86.7% of the heating and 81.1% of the electricity needs across its manufacturing supply chain. Key renewable arrays installed during 2018 include an 18,240-panel rooftop solar solution on Ikea’s Industry production unit in Portugal and an innovative solar cooling system at its Alexandra store in Singapore. The system converts thermal heat into chilled water for air conditioning in the store and has reduced the site’s energy consumption by almost one-quarter (24%) to date.

“We always think long term, innovating to ensure that our actions to meet people’s needs today do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs,” the Inter Ikea Group’s head of sustainability Lena Pripp-Kovac wrote in the report foreword.

“This requires us to rethink and inspire changes in lifestyles and consumption and to transform our way of working – from linear to circular, from consuming to regenerating resources.”

Climate positive challenges

The progress update comes as Ikea is striving to become “climate-positive” by 2030 – an aim the firm has defined as fulfilling its contribution to the Paris Agreement through an emissions reduction across the value chain that is aligned to climate science.

The multinational is targeting an 80% climate footprint reduction from stores and operations in absolute terms by 2030 – against a 2016 baseline – which aligns to a 2C target and aims towards the 1.5C trajectory towards the end of the century. Ikea claims that reducing emissions by 15% from the value chain by 2030 translates to a 70% reduction in climate footprint on average per product, and is therefore working to decarbonise key materials, food ingredients and transport, while setting more ambitious reduction targets for direct suppliers.

According to the new sustainability report, the climate footprint of Ikea’s value chain during 2018 was 2.8% higher than in 2016, largely due to the expansion of the business. It lists the key contributors to the business’s overall climate footprint as raw materials (36.4%), product use at home (22.2%) and customer travel and home deliveries (15.5%).

“Decoupling our growth from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will take time, and we expect our emissions to increase for a few years before decreasing,” the report states.

“Becoming climate positive will be a huge challenge for Ikea. We will only achieve it by joining together with others and listening to feedback from our stakeholders on how to improve.”

Living Lagom

The report also lists a number of other key sustainability challenges which lay between Ikea and the achievement of its sustainability goals, including the improvement of working conditions throughout its supply chains, the need to bolster value chain reporting and the urgency of inspiring new sustainable consumption models among the general public.

The latter of these challenges has long been addressed by Ikea’s “Live Lagom” campaign, which urges consumers to adopt its Swedish cultural vision of creating a home in which they create a harmonious lifestyle by not wasting resources or energy. The scheme has included the launch of dozens of innovative products designed to make home living more sustainable, including meatless meatballs, a kitchen made using 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and PCR wood and energy-efficient lighting.

New products unveiled within this range last year include air-purifying curtains, a water-saving mister nozzle and vegetarian hotdogs, while Ikea is also in the process of transforming its offerings and store models to encourage more sustainable consumption and travel habits. The firm’s new Greenwich store, for example, includes an interactive upcycling hub and lab, a network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers and real-time displays of public transport information. It additionally offers customers the chance to have their items delivered by e-bike or electric van and to send their end-of-life products for recycling when they receive a delivery of new goods.

Turning Ambition into Action at edie Live 2019

In a similarly honest fashion to Ikea, a number of big businesses including Landsec, Sky and Waitrose will appear at edie Live (21-22 May 2019) to discuss the challenges and opportunities to achieving a sustainable future.

The two-day show – edie's biggest event of the year – has become a highlight of the calendar for sustainability, energy and environment professionals looking for new ideas and solutions that will help them achieve a low-carbon, resource efficient and profitable future for their business.

No problem - just work for 50 minutes.

That is the recipe to combat hunger for Ms Sekai Kobayashi, 33, a former engineer who will not turn away penniless customers at her restaurant Mirai Shokudo (translated as Future Eatery) in Tokyo.

""Instead, we offer meals in return for 50 minutes of labour at the restaurant. I use this system because I want to connect with hungry people who otherwise couldn't eat at restaurants because they don't have money.""

There is no staff other than her at the eatery, which seats 12 at a counter.

Customers have the option of paying for food or earning a free meal by serving dishes, clearing tables and performing other tasks.

So far, more than 500 people, including university students, have opted to work for their meals to save money, among other reasons.

Those who contribute their labour can either dine for free or receive a free-meal coupon that can be deposited at the restaurant's entrance for anyone to use.

Related Story Work 50 minutes for a meal: Other quirky restaurants with a good cause

Ms Kobayashi opened the restaurant two years ago in the city's Jinbocho district, aiming for ""a place where everyone is welcome and everyone fits in"".

""Through various methods, I've also kept the business profitable,"" she said of her business, where the daily lunch special is priced at 900 yen (S$10.50).

""I dabbled in shop management as a university student. Each year at the university's annual festival, I ran a dimly lit cafe stocked with books,"" said Ms Kobayashi of her initial foray into the food and beverage (F&B) trade.

""The cafe won first prize in the festival popularity contest in all four years when I was a student. I even opened cafes at other school festivals,"" she added.

After turning 20, she worked at a bar in Shinjuku's Golden Gai - a district in Tokyo known for its cosy bars and pubs - and other places.

After graduating from university, however, she found a non-F&B job because a bar master told her that ""it's not so bad to experience the outside world"".

She worked as an engineer at IBM Japan, then moved to Cookpad, which runs a cooking recipe site.

The company had an in-office kitchen where everyone could prepare and eat meals.

""My colleagues really liked the lunches I made for them. This led me to strongly consider opening my own restaurant,"" she recalled.

She enrolled for vocational training at a leading restaurant chain and other places before opening Mirai Shokudo.

But her engineering roots have not gone to waste.

""To manage my restaurant, I adopted an open-source model - a system through which software design is made available for free to the public so that everyone can improve upon it.

""I posted the restaurant's business plan and finances on its website so I can collect input from the public on how to make improvements. This information is also available for those who want to open their own restaurants.

""Sharing something with others means supporting those with ambition. That underpins my approach to work,"" she said.

A 56-year-old former teacher has regularly helped at the restaurant since the end of July.

""It's an exciting job because I work with a new person every time. It's interesting to develop a good rapport and work with others,"" said the woman, who hopes to carve out a new career in the food industry.

All 48 London Bridge attack victims who made it to hospital have survived,http://www.businessinsider.com/all-48-london-bridge-attack-victims-who-made-it-to-hospital-survive-2017-6?r=UK&IR=T,"Police officers speak with ambulance personnel after an incident near London Bridge in London, Britain June 4, 2017. REUTERS / Hannah Mckay Every victim of the London Bridge attack who made it to hospital has survived their injuries, the Standard can reveal today.

The astonishing achievement saw medics being praised for their skill in dealing with so many critically ill patients.

21 of the 48 who were admitted to five hospitals were initially classed as ""critical"" and the number of lives saved is being seen as a testament to the success of London’s major trauma centre network, which ensures the most seriously ill patients get immediate world-class care.

The fact trauma doctors in the capital see so many ""penetrating injuries"" due to the knife crime epidemic meant they were able to put previous learning into practice, the Standard was told.

Hospital doctors also praised the ""outstanding and brave"" emergency response from London Ambulance Service and the improved first-aid skills of police and public at the scene which helped keep victims alive.

King’s College Hospital in Denmark Hill and The Royal London in Whitechapel, which received the bulk of the casualties, said all their patients had survived. NHS England confirmed that apart from French national Xavier Thomas, 45, whose body was found in the Thames, all seven other fatalities were at the scene.

By midday yesterday 29 victims were in hospital, 10 in critical care. St Mary’s in Paddington, St Thomas’ in Lambeth and UCLH in Bloomsbury were others to receive casualties.

Duncan Bew, clinical director of the major trauma centre at King’s, operated throughout Saturday night and into Sunday and said: ""It was very challenging but what we have trained for.

""Getting there early to receive them [on admission to the emergency department] was the key, or it would have been different. The vital role of public and professional first responders in the chain of survival at the scene is a very significant factor, and they should be praised. No one died who got to hospital.

""We had 15. Some arrived in police cars or vans that ‘scooped and ran’ people from the scene. That decision saved lives. London Ambulance Service also did a fantastic job faced with significant personal risk.""

Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho treated in intensive care after being stabbed in the neck as he confronted the attackers. He tweeted from his hospital bed yesterday urging people to vote.

Football fan Roy Larner is also out of intensive care after being treated for wounds all over his body as he fought off all three attackers with his fists after declaring: ""F**k you, I’m Millwall.""

Brett Freeman, who was stabbed four times and described as a ""warrior"", is now home in Dagenham, according to the friend who photographed him in hospital. But doctors warned that some patients face weeks in critical care.

Dr Tom Hurst, a consultant in major trauma at King’s, said there was often a ""long tail"" in the need for treatment. He was on the scene as a London’s Air Ambulance medic but not called into action, and was back on shift at King’s on Sunday after a few hours’ sleep.

He said: ""We made eight to 10 intensive care unit beds available, most of which were needed. The incident has this really long tail. There are a handful of patients, maybe four or five, who [will need intensive treatment for] more than a week, perhaps many weeks.""

Police investigating the attack today arrested a 29-year-old man in Newham on suspicion of terrorism offences. Four men remained in custody. It has emerged that a gym in Ilford raided by officers yesterday had been reported to police two years ago over fears jihadists were being trained there.

Terrorists Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30 and Youssef Zaghba, 22, met outside Ummah Fitness Centre five days before the attack. Butt worked at the gym and Zaghba was known to exercise there.

Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the local Pakistani Christian Organisation, told the Times a man who ran gym classes there had boasted to him about ""training jihadists"".

Dr Hurst and fellow clinicians are doing the Three Peaks Challenge this weekend in aid of the critical care appeal at King’s. Visit here for details."
Jewish people give Muslims key to their synagogue after town's mosque burns down,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/victoria-islamic-centre-mosque-fire-texas-jews-give-key-synagogue-muslims-worship-gofundme-a7556331.html?cmpid=facebook-post,"Jewish people in a small Texas city handed Muslim worshippers the keys to their synagogue after the town's only mosque was destroyed in a fire.

The Victoria Islamic Centre burned down on Saturday and had previously been burgled—the cause is being investigated by federal officials.

But the town's Muslim population will not be without a place to worship while their building is reconstructed, thanks to their Jewish neighbours.

Robert Loeb, the president of Temple Bnai Israel, told Forward: ""Everyone knows everybody, I know several members of the mosque, and we felt for them. When a calamity like this happens, we have to stand together.

""We have probably 25 to 30 Jewish people in Victoria, and they probably have 100 Muslims. We got a lot of building for a small amount of Jews.""

One of the mosque's founders, Shahid Hashmi, said: ""Jewish community members walked into my home and gave me a key to the synagogue.""

The centre was built in 2000.

Donations and an online fundraising campaign have raised more than $900,000 (£717,000) for reconstruction.

The blaze was discovered at at about 2am on Saturday by a clerk at a convenience store, who called the fire department. It took around four hours to bring it under control and no injuries were reported.

Arizona man finds a little girl’s Christmas wish list attached to a balloon all the way from Mexico. Tracks her down and delivers her toys.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna951581,"It was a Christmas wish that crossed international borders. An Arizona man fulfilled the Christmas list of an 8-year-old girl in Mexico whose letter to Santa reached him by way of balloon.

Earlier this month, Randy Heiss was hiking in Patagonia, Arizona, when he saw the ragged remains of a balloon with a note attached.

One side of the note read: “Dayami.” On the other was a numbered list written in Spanish.

Heiss' wife translated the list and the pair identified its likely sender as a girl named Dayami. The note was intended for Santa and asked for art supplies, slime, a doll and a dollhouse, among other things. No contact information was left on the note.

“It really touched my heart to find it and I said, ‘Well, how in the heck am I going to be able to figure out how to make contact with this little girl and make her wishes come true?'” Heiss told NBC affiliate KVOA in Tucson.

Heiss believed the winds carried Dayami’s Christmas wish list about 20 miles away from Nogales, Mexico.

He shared the letter on his Facebook account. After a few days with no leads, he enlisted the help of Radio XENY, a station in Nogales. The station posted Heiss’ story to its Facebook page.

Within an hour, they were able to find Dayami, who lives in Nogales.

The radio station told NBC News on Monday that it helped to arrange for Heiss and his wife to meet Dayami and her family at its offices late last week.

Heiss and his wife delivered the toys to Dayami and her younger sister, Ximena, during the meeting. It brought him ""healing joy"" to see the children's happy faces, Heiss told the ""Today"" show.

The bad things that you fret about are true. But it’s also true that since modern humans emerged about 200,000 years ago, 2019 was probably the year in which children were least likely to die, adults were least likely to be illiterate and people were least likely to suffer excruciating and disfiguring diseases.

Every single day in recent years, another 325,000 people got their first access to electricity. Each day, more than 200,000 got piped water for the first time. And some 650,000 went online for the first time, every single day.

Perhaps the greatest calamity for anyone is to lose a child. That used to be common: Historically, almost half of all humans died in childhood. As recently as 1950, 27 percent of all children still died by age 15. Now that figure has dropped to about 4 percent."
Africa to be declared free of polio,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-53887947,"Africa declared free of wild polio in 'milestone' By Naomi Scherbel-Ball

BBC News Published duration 25 August

image copyright AFP image caption Polio can only be prevented through immunisation

Africa has been declared free from wild polio by the independent body, the Africa Regional Certification Commission.

Polio usually affects children under five, sometimes leading to irreversible paralysis. Death can occur when breathing muscles are affected.

Twenty-five years ago thousands of children in Africa were paralysed by the virus.

The disease is now only found in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

There is no cure but the polio vaccine protects children for life.

Nigeria is the last African country to be declared free from wild polio, having accounted for more than half of all global cases less than a decade ago.

The vaccination campaign in Nigeria involved a huge effort to reach remote and dangerous places under threat from militant violence and some health workers were killed in the process.

What is polio and has it now been eradicated in Africa?

Polio is a virus which spreads from person to person, usually through contaminated water. It can lead to paralysis by attacking the nervous system.

Two out of three strains of wild polio virus have been eradicated worldwide. On Tuesday, Africa has been declared free of the last remaining strain of wild poliovirus.

More than 95% of Africa's population has now been immunised. This was one of the conditions that the Africa Regional Certification Commission set before declaring the continent free from wild polio.

Now only the vaccine-derived polio virus remains in Africa with 177 cases being identified this year.

This is a rare form of the virus that mutates from the oral polio vaccine and can then spread to under-immunised communities.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a number of these cases in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Angola.

How did Africa eliminate wild polio?

image copyright Getty Images image caption A polio vaccine was developed in 1952

Without a cure a vaccine developed in 1952 by Dr Jonas Salk gave hope that children could be protected from the disease. In 1961, Albert Sabin pioneered the oral polio vaccine which has been used in most national immunisation programmes around the world.

In 1996 poliovirus paralysed more than 75,000 children across the continent - every country was affected.

That year Nelson Mandela launched the ""Kick Polio Out of Africa"" programme, mobilising millions of health workers who went village-to-village to hand-deliver vaccines.

It was backed by a coalition of groups including Rotary International which had spearheaded the polio vaccination drive from the 1980s.

Since 1996 billions of oral polio vaccines have been provided, averting an estimated 1.8 million cases of wild poliovirus.

What have the challenges been?

The last communities at risk of polio live in some of the most complicated places to deliver immunisation campaigns.

Nigeria is the last country in Africa to have reported a case of wild polio - in Borno state in Nigeria's remote north-east, and the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurrection, in 2016.

At the time it was a frustrating set-back as the country had made huge progress and had gone two years without any cases being identified.

Outside Nigeria, the last place to have seen a case of polio was in the Puntland region of Somalia in 2014.

Conflict with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has made parts of Nigeria particularly difficult to reach, Borno state in particular.

More than two million people have been displaced by the fighting. Frontline workers, 95% of whom were women, managed to navigate areas of conflict like Lake Chad by boat and deliver vaccines to remote communities.

Widespread rumours and misinformation about the vaccine have also slowed down immunisation efforts.

In 2003, Kano and a number of other northern states suspended immunisations following reports by Muslim religious leaders that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti-fertility agent as part of an American plot to make Muslim women infertile. Laboratory tests by Nigerian scientists dismissed the accusations.

Vaccine campaigns resumed the following year, but the rumours persisted. In 2013 nine female polio vaccinators were killed in two shootings thought to be carried out by Boko Haram at health centres in Kano.

It has taken decades to achieve eradication and overcome suspicion around the vaccine.

How polio survivors made a difference

Winning the trust of communities has been key.

Misbahu Lawan Didi, president of the Nigerian Polio Survivors Association, says that the role of survivors has been crucial in persuading people to accept the campaign.

image caption Misbahu Lawan Didi has worked hard to persuade sceptical parents to allow their children to have the vaccine

""Many rejected the polio vaccine, but they see how much we struggle to reach them, sometimes crawling large distances, to speak to them. We ask them: 'Don't you think it is important for you to protect your child not to be like us?'""

From polio survivors, to traditional and religious leaders, school teachers, parents, volunteers and health workers, a huge coalition developed to defeat polio. Working together they travelled to remote communities to immunise children.

How serious is polio?

Polio, or poliomyelitis, mainly affects children aged under five.

Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pains in the limbs. It also invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.

One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% of people die when their breathing muscles become immobilised.

Could wild polio return?

Polio can be easily imported into a country that is polio free and from there it can spread rapidly among under-immunised populations.

This happened in Angola, which despite decades of civil war, defeated polio in 2001.

The country remained free from polio for four years until 2005 when a number of cases were thought to have been brought in from outside the country.

The WHO says that it is important countries remain vigilant and avoid complacency until there is global eradication.

If they let down their defence by failing to vaccinate, then wild polio could once again begin to spread quickly.

For all types of polio to be eliminated, including vaccine-derived polio, vaccination efforts will need to continue alongside surveillance, to protect children from being paralysed by the disease in the future."
"USA: Sikhs prepare over 30,000 free meal packets for Americans in self-isolation",https://www.aninews.in/news/world/us/sikhs-prepare-over-30000-free-meal-packets-for-americans-in-self-isolation20200324020448/,"By Reena Bhardwaj

New York [USA], Mar 24 (ANI): The Sikh Center of New York prepared and packaged more than 30,000 home-cooked meals for Americans in coronavirus self-isolation.

The Sikh community was approached by New York's Mayor office for food packages that were handed out to several distributing federal agencies in the area. Monday morning onwards the agencies will further distribute and deliver free food to COVID-19 affected people in New York City, one of the worst affected cities in the US by coronavirus.

Strict food hygiene practices were observed while the food was prepared such as maintaining social distancing and using face masks and gloves.

Himat Singh, coordinator of American Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee (east coast) told ANI: ""The 'Sewa' or service provided by the Sikh volunteers is a vegetarian meal comprising of dry fruits, rice and lentils.""

""The meals were prepared on Sunday and was packaged and loaded for delivery. The distribution starts on Monday in the morning, by local authorities. Volunteers who prepared and packaged the meal had a medical check and have been approved by physicians and health authorities,"" Singh added.

The distributing agencies will provide the food packages to the elderly or people having trouble getting food at the supermarket, specially-abled, homeless and single parents who are looking after their kids and can't go out, he further added.



Food items that have been previously donated to the Gurudwara are being used for this initiative and even the Gurudwara funds are being used. United Sikhs, an NGO based across the United States, also made an appeal to people from all walks of life to donate generously.

99 per cent of the people using the meals are Americans, the only Indians are those coming from overseas or students who are isolating for 14 days.

Several Sikh volunteers from the East, West Coast and the Mid West of the United States are ready with an infrastructure to help agencies across the country. They are geared with free food, shelter at Gurudwara's and even delivering essentials and medicines for the homeless and needy.

""Once we heard people were having a problem with food when they go shopping, they can't find food in the shopping centre, then we started reaching out to people in our personal capacity in the Bay Area(San Francisco),"" Dr Pritpal Singh, coordinator of the American Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee (west coast) told ANI.

He also said that they have seen firsthand it was mostly the elderly who needed their service and it's mostly vulnerable people who are worried about the virus.

The Sikh volunteers applauded the efforts of the federal agencies who have been working round the clock to combat the crisis and also appealed to follow the advisories sent out by the city, state and federal agencies.

Jathedar Harpreet Singh, Sri Akal Takht Sahib and the spiritual leader of the Sikh community told ANI that he appeals to the Sikh community and there is a need to spring into action as the pandemic crisis deepened in the world in the past few weeks.

""We have requested gurudwaras across the country and the world to especially reach out to the stranded Indian students and provide them meals and shelter, which will give relief to many worried parents back in India,"" Jathedar Harpreet Singh said. (ANI)

Editor’s note: This article was originally published in Feb. 2019.

OTTAWA — The national statistics office says fewer children are living in poverty and it is connecting the drop to the Liberal government’s signature child benefit.

The Liberals introduced the income-tested Canada Child Benefit midway through 2016, replacing a previous system of tax credits and the Conservatives’ universal child care benefit.

New Statistics Canada figures show 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017 — the first full year of the benefit — compared to 2015 when the Liberals took office.

Statistics Canada says an increase in the value of child benefits, coupled with gains in market income, put more money into the pockets of families in 2017.

The statistics office says overall, 9.5 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2017, down from 10.6 per cent in 2016.

"Shaquem Griffin was born with amniotic band syndrome affecting his left hand. At age four, his mother found him in the kitchen, attempting to use a butcher's knife to self-amputate his fingers due to the pain. He is currently breaking records at the NFL combine.",http://www.latimes.com/sports/more/la-sp-ucf-griffin-hand-20171220-story.html,"Even to a mother, the scream from her 4-year-old was more urgent and scary than anything she had heard before.

Tangie Griffin jumped out of bed and went to the bedroom where her twin sons slept. Shaquill was there, but Shaquem wasn’t. She frantically searched the house and found him in the kitchen.



For the record: A previous version of this article spelled Shaquill Griffin’s first name as Shaquille.

He had climbed to the silverware drawer and was threatening to cut his fingers off with a knife he held in his right hand.

“All I could do was take the knife away,” Tangie said. “He kept screaming that his hand hurt. I picked him up and rocked him back to sleep. And then I called the doctor.”

The next day, Shaquem Griffin’s left hand was amputated.

Shaquem, 22, recalled that night on a recent afternoon on the campus of Central Florida. He had just finished a practice for the Knights’ Jan. 1 game against Auburn in the Peach Bowl.

He was proud yet not boastful of being chosen American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year in 2016. He was a finalist this year for UCF (12-0), the only undefeated team in major college football.

“My mom took me to a room [the next day] and all I remember is them putting a mask on me,” Shaquem said of the time he lost his hand. “When I woke up, I had a bandage on my hand and all I wanted was to get out of there.”

During Tangie’s pregnancy, doctors discovered a tiny amniotic membrane had wrapped around Shaquem’s hand.

“It’s a thin tissue you can barely see,” Tangie said. “The doctor answered the questions and explained the options. It could be taken off with a needle, but even the slightest move could have punctured [either of the twins] and it was possible one wouldn’t survive. I was not going to take that chance.”

Shaquem was born with fingers that were extremely painful to touch or pressure. On the night he went after a knife, he had banged his hand against the side of the bunk beds he shared with his twin brother, part of a family of four boys.

I didn’t care, I was going to play football regardless Central Florida linebacker Shaquem Griffin

The day after the surgery, Shaquem was taken to day care. He and he and his teacher were given explicit instructions for him not to do anything outside or take part in any activities.

“I go to pick him up and I find him outside with a football in his hand and his bandage just dripping blood,” Tangie said.

Shaquem has displayed this kind of determination his entire life.

“I didn’t care, I was going to play football regardless,” he said. “It was tough until I had my fingers removed, but after that I knew I was going to play again. The pain was gone. … It didn’t hurt when the ball hit.”

Shaquem and Shaquill, older by 60 seconds, formed an even deeper bond. Tangie says Shaquem insists you say 60 seconds instead of a minute because a minute sounds longer.

They made a pact, it was both of them or neither.

“Before we got to high school, before we got the first offer, we made the decision we were going to stick together no matter what,” Shaquem said. “We talked about going to the same college. We talked about living in the same house when we got older and even dating twins together.”

Shaquill, a rookie cornerback with the Seattle Seahawks, started to get offers. First Mississippi and then Florida State. South Florida, close to their home in St. Petersburg, offered a scholarship, but only to Shaquill.

“We were a package deal,” Shaquill said. “It started when we were young. That was type of bond we had. When scholarships came in, we kept it the same way.”

Amid the recruiting process, they visited Central Florida, viewed it as a perfect fit and committed before then-coach George O’Leary made a home visit.

Things went well for Shaquill but Shaquem struggled. In his second year, he was a second-string linebacker when the team went to play Penn State in Ireland. That’s when he learned he was demoted.

“I thought in my head, why did I get moved back just before the game?” Shaquem said. “I did everything they asked me to. I had a good camp. I worked my way up the depth chart. Then I got moved back to third string and then the scout team after the game.”

Shaquem redshirted that season and Shaquill moved a year ahead of him.

“It was tough on him,” Shaquill said. “He thought about stopping playing or transferring. It was as tough for me as it was for him. It’s like everything we believed in wasn’t going to come through.”

As a sophomore, Shaquem played on special teams and was a backup safety. A switch in coaching from O’Leary to Scott Frost changed everything.

In his junior year, as a linebacker, he started every game and finished 12th in the nation in sacks. He had 92 tackles, 57 of them unassisted, while playing in the same unit as his brother.

In Shaquem’s initial game, he ended the first play by vomiting.

“I think it was the nerves,” Shaquem said. “My brother grabbed my hand and said, ‘You play football. Stay calm, have fun and play football.’ After that I calmed down.”

Shaquem had another trong this season this year, and also developed as a team leader.

“He’s got great leadership and he plays hard,” outside linebacker Pat Jasinski said. “He’s everything you would want from a player at his position.”

The team views him just like any other player, with no restrictions.

“It’s funny, you don’t think about it at all until you’re watching film and see him reach for a ball with an arm without a hand,” Jasinski said. “Some of the stuff he does out there is out of this world, just crazy.”

Few people think UCF’s game against Auburn will be Shaquem’s last at a high level. He has his eyes on the NFL, and the league is looking back.

“I think he’s got a chance [to be drafted], absolutely,” said one NFL scout, who declined to be identified because they were disclosing internal information. “I think he could go later in the draft.

“I’ve never seen anything like it. The kid’s got more heart and passion and toughness. He’s a darn good football player.”

Shaquill wants teams to target his brother on the field because he has only one hand.

Advertisement

“Any coach would try and exploit him,” he said. “It will give him more times to prove them wrong. He loves that. The one hand makes him better.”

The twins talk at least three times a day, but usually not about football. On game days, it’s before warmups, after warmups and while they are strapping on pads.

Shaquem is a good talker — and a huge Seahawks fan. His chance of playing with his brother are about 1 in 32. So, judging from Shaquem’s path to this point, a pretty good chance.

"California limits pet store sales of cats, dogs and rabbits to rescue or shelter animals only",https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/30/us/california-dog-cat-rabbit-sales/index.html,"(CNN) California pet stores soon will be allowed to sell dogs, cats and rabbits only if they come from shelters or non-profit rescue organizations.

Under legislation going into effect on January 1, store operators also will have to be able to provide records of origin for the animals or face a $500 penalty per animal.



Under the law, individuals are still allowed to buy from private breeders, but stores are prohibited from doing so. The Pet Rescue and Adoption Act was introduced by assembly member Patrick O'Donnell and signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown in October 2017 Under the law, individuals are still allowed to buy from private breeders, but stores are prohibited from doing so.

In a press release issued at the time, O'Donnell touted the law as an end to ""puppy mills"" and ""kitten factories."" California is the first state in the country to introduce such legislation.

O'Donnell called the law a ""big win for our four-legged friends"" and also for taxpayers, who he said spent more than $250 million a year to house and euthanize shelter animals.

"Arnold Schwarzenegger personally delivered a cargo of 50,000 masks to doctors on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic",https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/03/31/schwarzenegger-shortsighted-for-california-to-defund-pandemic-stockpile-he-built-1269954,"Former CA governor Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a cargo of 50,000 N-95 masks in Los Angeles | Daniel Ketchell Schwarzenegger: 'Shortsighted' for California to defund pandemic stockpile he built

OAKLAND — Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger told POLITICO on Tuesday it was ""shortsighted"" for California leaders to abandon a $200 million emergency preparedness effort he initiated in 2006 to deal with a future pandemic, as the state now scrambles to prepare for a surge in coronavirus cases.

When the state budget swelled 14 years ago, Schwarzenegger launched a surge capacity stockpile that included mobile hospitals and medical gear intended to prepare California for a situation like it is facing today. With the state facing a $26 billion deficit in 2011, Gov. Jerry Brown and state lawmakers withdrew funding to maintain the supplies, according to an investigative report last week by Reveal and the Los Angeles Times.

As public servants, “our ultimate responsibility is not just to make a budget balance, but to save lives,’’ Schwarzenegger responded for the first time Tuesday in a phone interview. He said that when the bird flu emerged in 2006, he was deeply concerned about having sufficient supplies in California to handle potential disasters like infectious disease outbreaks and major earthquakes that could kill hundreds of thousands.

""I thought we have to be prepared — because we are the fifth largest economy in the world,'' he said.

The former governor on Tuesday never specifically mentioned or criticized Brown, his successor.

""Yes, there was a budget crunch ... it’s easy for them to just look at the numbers, but not really to visualize disaster,"" Schwarzenegger said of the 2011 cuts, which eviscerated the emergency medical program. ""They obviously made their judgments to take those expenditures out ... and to worry about a few million dollars.”

""Would I have done it? No,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""But I understand that every governor and every administration looks at those things differently.""

Schwarzenegger spoke to POLITICO after a trip to Los Angeles hospitals Tuesday, where he personally delivered a cargo of 50,000 masks to doctors on the front lines of the pandemic — a move to underscore his support of the Frontline Responders Fund. The former governor has donated $1 million to the GoFundMe effort to raise money for desperately needed equipment during the Covid-19 crisis. The cause, which has raised $5 million to date, has also been backed by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, angel investor Ron Conway and Hollywood luminaries like Edward Norton.

The equipment was procured by the Bay Area-based logistics firm Flexport, which last week delivered 60,000 surgical masks, 34,000 gloves, 2,000 surgical gowns and 50 thermometers to San Francisco’s Department of Public Health, TechCrunch reported.

Schwarzenegger, asked about President Donald Trump’s performance during the pandemic, declined to criticize him, saying the first goal is to to tackle the pandemic. But he allowed that “the federal government has not been as quick in their response as they could have been.""

""The thing is, did you learn from your mistakes?"" he said. ""And did you admit your weaknesses? ... Because the way you improve is by just acknowledging, 'OK, you know, this is a screw-up, or I made a mistake there.' And [to say], 'This would never happen again.'""

Schwarzenegger said he has also been in regular touch with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whom he gave high marks for the pandemic response — especially, he said, Newsom's early order to shelter in place, which may have saved lives.

“I think that he did a terrific job to be on top of it — and to stay on top of it,’’ he said. “Whatever he needs me to do, I’ll do ... I want to support him.""

But Schwarzenegger, who has been posting daily messages on Twitter about staying healthy and engaged during the pandemic, warned that now it’s critical that Californians must act on their own, volunteer or give to causes that will help give doctors what they need at this critical time.

California residents must recognize that ""government can only do so much,"" he said. ""At the end of the day ... it goes back to people power. And 'we the people' have the power to do our share — and just stay home."""

"Young People Are Registering to Vote in Huge Numbers, New Study Finds",https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/07/young-people-are-registering-to-vote-in-huge-numbers-new-study-finds/,"For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis, the election, and more, subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter.

The March for Our Lives teens said they’d #VoteThemOut, and a new study suggests they could be poised to do just that. According to the political data firm TargetSmart, the percentage of newly registered voters who are under the age of 30 has grown significantly in a number of key battleground states since the February school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The surge could have big implications in this fall’s fight for control of Congress.

The study evaluated all new voter registrations in the 39 states with available data since February 14, 2018—the day of the Parkland shooting—and calculated the change in the share of new registrants who are 18 to 29 years old. Across the country, the share of youth registrants increased by a modest 2.16 percentage points. But in Indiana, Virginia, and New York—home to some of this year’s marquee House and Senate contests—the share of youth registrants increased by 9.87, 10.49, and 10.7 percentage points, respectively. In Pennsylvania—where voters will decide as many as nine competitive congressional races—the share of new registrants who are younger than 30 jumped by a whopping 16.14 percentage points. The study doesn’t evaluate how many of the new registrants may have been motivated by the #NeverAgain movement.

The findings offer an early, measurable indication that youth turnout could be higher than in previous midterm elections, though there’s no guarantee that many of the new registrants will actually vote. Just under half of all 18-to-29-year-olds were registered to vote in 2014, but less than 20 percent of that population group ended up casting ballots that year. It was the lowest rate of of youth registration and turnout recorded in four decades, according to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University."

"Researchers have created an ""EpiPen"" for spinal cord injuries that can potentially prevent paralysis. Injecting specially designed nanoparticles immediately after the injury can stop the body's immune system from forming a scar that blocks the regeneration of the spinal cord’s nerve cells.",https://news.umich.edu/an-epipen-for-spinal-cord-injuries/,"ANN ARBOR—An injection of nanoparticles can prevent the body’s immune system from overreacting to trauma, potentially preventing some spinal cord injuries from resulting in paralysis.

The approach was demonstrated in mice at the University of Michigan, with the nanoparticles enhancing healing by reprogramming the aggressive immune cells—call it an “EpiPen” for trauma to the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord.

“In this work, we demonstrate that instead of overcoming an immune response, we can co-opt the immune response to work for us to promote the therapeutic response,” said Lonnie Shea, the Steven A. Goldstein Collegiate Professor of Biomedical Engineering.

Trauma of any kind kicks the body’s immune response into gear. In a normal injury, immune cells infiltrate the damaged area and clear debris to initiate the regenerative process.

The central nervous system, however, is usually walled off from the rough-and-tumble of immune activity by the blood-brain barrier. A spinal cord injury breaks that barrier, letting in overzealous immune cells that create too much inflammation for the delicate neural tissues. That leads to the rapid death of neurons, damage to the insulating sheaths around nerve fibers that allow them to send signals, and the formation of a scar that blocks the regeneration of the spinal cord’s nerve cells.

All of this contributes to the loss of function below the level of the injury. That spectrum includes everything from paralysis to a loss of sensation for many of the 12,000 new spinal injury patients each year in the United States.

Previous attempts to offset complications from this immune response included injecting steroids like methylprednisolone. That practice has largely been discarded since it comes with side effects that include sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding and blood clots. The risks outweigh the benefits.

But now, U-M researchers have designed nanoparticles that intercept immune cells on their way to the spinal cord, redirecting them away from the injury. Those that reach the spinal cord have been altered to be more pro-regenerative.

Hopefully, this technology could lead to new therapeutic strategies not only for patients with spinal cord injury but for those with various inflammatory diseases.

With no drugs attached, the nanoparticles reprogram the immune cells with their physical characteristics: a size similar to cell debris and a negative charge that facilitates binding to immune cells. In theory, their nonpharmaceutical nature avoids unwanted side effects.

With fewer immune cells at the trauma location, there is less inflammation and tissue deterioration. Second, immune cells that do make it to the injury are less inflammatory and more suited to supporting tissues that are trying to grow back together.

“Hopefully, this technology could lead to new therapeutic strategies not only for patients with spinal cord injury but for those with various inflammatory diseases,” said Jonghyuck Park, a U-M research fellow working with Shea.

Previous research has shown success for nanoparticles mitigating trauma caused by the West Nile virus and multiple sclerosis, for example.

“The immune system underlies autoimmune disease, cancer, trauma, regeneration—nearly every major disease,” Shea said. “Tools that can target immune cells and reprogram them to a desired response have numerous opportunities for treating or managing disease.”

The research, published in the current issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was supported by The National Institutes of Health. Shea is also the William and Valerie Hall Chair of Biomedical Engineering and a professor of chemical engineering.

Nestle creates wrapper that degrades in the sea within six months,https://news.sky.com/story/nestle-creates-wrapper-that-degrades-in-the-sea-within-six-months-11755547,"Nestle has launched a new recyclable wrapper for a snack bar that it claims will degrade in a marine environment within six months.

The YES! range will also be used on a high-speed packaging line in a ""world-first"" technological breakthrough.

Last year, the brand pledged to make all of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025.

Speaking about the wrapper, Michael Carroll, lead on innovation and sustainability for Nestle, said:

""We know it will degrade in a marine environment within six months, which, compared to the flow wrap that it's currently in, it's about 450 years.""

The confectionery company said it had to overcome 90 challenges to develop the material and adapt current machinery and processes to handle the product more gently.

Experts at its research and development centre in York said the 300 bars-per-minute ""flow wrap cold seal"" packing process, has previously only been suitable for use with more durable plastic films and laminates.

But it took the team just 10 months to come up with the design and adapt production lines to ensure the bars are kept in perfect condition during packaging, transport and storage.

Bruce Funnell, head of packaging at Nestle, said: ""This has been a real first for us.

""Really this is the first confectionery product bar that's wrapped at high speed and is ensuring we have a good shelf life without compromise to the consumer.""

Mr Funnell added that the wrappers contained around 60% recyclable fibres.

The new wrapper will rolled out on the YES! fruit and nut-based bars from July and will carry the message ""carefully wrapped in paper"".

"Car is auctioned to pay for the care of two orphans. Car sells three times, car is donated back three times, totally $80,000 raised.",https://www.google.ca/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/4438758/red-deer-car-auction-brent-nicole-keryluke-motorcycle/amp/,"Send this page to someone via email

An incredibly moving moment happened at a Red Deer auction this weekend. About $100,000 was raised for two young Red Deer children whose parents died in a motorcycle crash four months ago.

Brent and Nicole Keryluke were killed on May 5 after the motorcycle they were driving collided with a truck near Innisfail. They were 35 and 34 years old.

Their two young children, three-year-old Liam and six-year-old Arielle, are being cared for by grandparents with help from other members of the family.

“They get up in the morning and both of them are smiling and laughing,” Brent’s father Ben told Global News on Monday. Tweet This

“When you start out happy in the morning, it helps out a lot.”

On the weekend, Ben and his wife Marilyn took a 1973 Pontiac Parisienne their son had been working on to Electric Garage Auctions to sell. The family didn’t want to part with the vehicle but as Ben explained, didn’t really have a choice. Both Liam and Arielle have hearing impairments, which means some additional medical costs now and in the future.

The family has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. Friends, family, even strangers have donated money through a GoFundMe page for the kids’ futures and then, what happened at EG Auctions on Saturday afternoon, floored them.

“They basically stopped the auction, let everybody know what was happening, where the money was going to go, and then we were shocked what happened after that,” Ben Keryluke told Global News on Monday.

“The car was sold for $29,000 and then was donated back. Then it was sold for $30,000 and donated back. Then it went for $20,000 and donated back again.” Tweet This

The special auction for Brent’s classic car lasted about 10 minutes and was captured on video. The crowd can be heard whistling and clapping throughout. Other people pledged individual donations to add to the total.

“People were overwhelmed with just the generosity of people of central Alberta and the support that this family has,” explained Lyndsay Payne, co-owner of EG Auctions.

“It was incredible. People were cheering, I was crying. Our auctioneer Rod had a hard time getting through it because he was crying. He was emotional.

“It was unreal. I’ve never been a part of anything like that before in my life,” Payne said. Tweet This

The first winning bid was Rod McWilliams from Red Deer Motors, then Danny Fayad from Edmonton won the second round and Bob Bevins from Bulldog Metals won the third round, before giving the car back to the Keryluke family.

“He didn’t want to be recognized for it,” Payne recalled. “He just went up to Ben personally after the auction and said, ‘You know what? I want your family to have that car so I’m giving it back to you.’

“When our auctioneer Rod announced that, the place just went wild. There was a standing ovation, people were cheering, whistling. It was wonderful.” Tweet This

Brent bought the car hoping to pass it on to his children when they were older. For Bevins, that made the decision a simple one.

“It had way more sentimental value to that family than me owning another classic car, so I thought maybe someday, that young man will be able to drive his father’s car.”

There wasn’t a dry eye in the place, Payne said.

It was incredibly moving for the Keryluke family as well.

“It’s been just incredible to see the generosity of people to help a family to be able to raise the children,” Ben said.

"Yuki Kawauchi just became the first amateur runner to win the boston marathon in decades. a high School Administrator, He's Known As the ""Citizen Runner"" in Japan, and he has to go back to work tomorrow.",https://deadspin.com/yuki-kawauchi-can-teach-you-how-to-run-1821725233,"Photo credit: Alexander Hassenstein/ Getty

At just 30 years old, Yuki Kawauchi is in a distance running category of his own. As of January 1, he has run the most sub-2:20 marathons of anyone, ever—76. He’s also run the most sub-2:12 marathons of anyone, ever—25. Kawauchi—one guy—has run more sub-2:10 marathons since 2011 than the whole United States put together. Kawauchi’s best time for 2017—2:09:18—was two seconds faster than the fastest marathon of the year by any U.S. man, which would be Galen Rupp, who ran a career best of 2:09:20 in Chicago. Rupp, like most athletes at that level, ran two marathons in 2017. Kawauchi ran 12.



Advertisement

His singularity continues. Distance running at the top levels is dominated by East Africans; he’s Japanese. Most elite marathoners train with a group and a coach, with corporate sponsorship that allows them to train full-time. They run twice a day, spend time at altitude, and have access to the latest equipment, nutrition, and sport science. Kawauchi has neither coach nor training group nor corporate sponsorship. He fits once-a-day workouts around his full-time government job. He made his own home gym, and is more likely to look at the methods of great runners of the past than the training philosophy du jour. He’s wildly popular in Japan, and is one of the few distance runners anywhere with a truly global fan base.

Critics point to his relatively poor performances in big races—World Championships and World Marathon Majors—and the fact that his personal best of 2:08:14 is more than five minutes off the world record, not even close to the top 200 performances all-time.



Advertisement

But, the fact that this one guy has run consistently faster times than all U.S. marathoners combined, without all their resources, and seems to be having a grand time doing it, makes him worth listening to.



In March 2017, Ayano Onodera, an editor with Japanese media company SportsNavi, published Kawauchi’s extensive views on training and racing, and the future of Japanese running. The three-part essay was translated by editor of the English language blog Japan Running News, Brett Larner. Though it was not meant to be didactic, U.S. distance runners might at least be inspired to think differently about their pursuit. As Kawauchi said, “That’s why I want to show all the athletes at the powerful running schools [in Japan] who, like me in those days, are frustrated and injured, ‘There’s another world out there. Another way.’ By doing that I hope to give them the chance to feel again the love of the run.”

With that in mind, here are the most actionable takeaways from Kawauchi’s interview.



1. Incorporating jogging. Most top American runners would never on God’s earth use the term “jogging” to describe any part of their training, but Kawauchi loves it:



There are those who look at that kind of ultra long-distance jogging and say, “Running slowly is meaningless no matter how much you do,” but I think the people who make that kind of criticism have probably never done it themselves. If you actually experience the feeling you get after about three hours, the “I can endure this fatigue in my legs, but if I lose it mentally I’ll immediately want to quit” one that’s similar to the light-headed sensation at the end of the marathon, the numbness of hands and feet and loss of concentration that come after that, the feeling that your stamina is evaporating from the core of your body, and the overpowering sense of euphoria you get after going over the wall, I don’t think you can call it “meaningless.” The confidence that is built by doing ultra long-distance jogging, the knowledge in the second half when things are getting tough that I’ve run 50 km and 100 km so I know for sure that my stamina isn’t going to break in the second half. The internationals running next to me haven’t done 100 km so I know that my legs are the ones that are still going to keep moving when things get down and dirty, has really helped a person like me who tends to get discouraged easily.

2. Once-a-day training. Kawauchi trains once a day, mostly out of necessity since he works a full-time job. Most pro runners, on all continents, run twice a day, racking up mega miles which increase chances of injury.



For someone who only trains once a day like I have ever since I was at Gakushuin University, I feel that adding ultra long-distance jogging trail runs on my days off has been effective in improving my physical and mental ability to hold it together in the second half of the marathon. However, since the runners on many teams are obligated to do group morning runs in addition to their regular training sessions, in terms of both the time and physical demands, I think it would be hard for them to add the same kind of ultra long-distance jogging that I have. By doing morning runs every day they usually exceed 1000 km a month, but in my case I’m typically averaging about 600 km a month. When you consider that runners belonging to teams are doing 12 km a day on average in their morning runs, my monthly mileage is going to be at least 360 km less since I don’t do them. That means a physical margin of over 4320 km a year compared to other athletes, and I think that’s why ultra long-distance jogging has had such a major impact on me.



Conversely, if someone who is already doing over 1000 km a month kept doing their morning runs and tried to add ultra long-distance jogging to that, I think they would destroy their legs with stress fractures and whatnot. Old-school marathoners might get mad and say it’s a “soft way of thinking,” but I’m pretty sure the human body has a mileage limit. Working within that limit I think all you can do is choose between doing multiple short runs or longer single runs.

3. Being globally competitive. U.S. and Japanese distance runners are both struggling to be competitive in a sport dominated by East Africans. The goals and thought processes of runners in both countries are quite similar. Kawauchi offers the idea that marathoners can be competitive without running a 2:03 marathon.



The number of them [Japanese runners] who say, “My goal is to win a medal at the Olympics,” is very large, the number who say, “My goal is to set a world record,” is vanishingly small, and I’ve pretty much never met anyone who says, “My goal is to compete in international marathons all around the world.”

...the sole reason most frequently cited for why Japanese athletes can’t compete with “the world” is concept #2. In other words, the point of view that “Even though the world is running 2:02 and 2:03, Japan still can’t even break the 2:06 national record.” I have to wonder whether the people who voice that opinion are aware that only one person has ever run 2:02, once, and that in terms of sub-2:04, even including the record-ineligible Boston, you are talking about ten people on just five courses, Berlin, Chicago, London, Frankfurt and Boston.



There’s nothing better than being fast for being competitive, but there’s an element of being competitive that you can’t learn just from being fast. For example, Abel Kirui [Kenya, gold medalist in 2009 Berlin and 2011 Daegu World Championships] has a 2:05 PB, but that’s not something he has done multiple times. Even though he has run a lot of marathons, his second-best time is over 30 seconds slower than the Japanese national record. Both Uganda’s Stephen Kiprotich [2012 London Olympics and 2013 Moscow World Championships gold medalist] and Eritrea’s Ghirmay Ghebreslassie [2015 Beijing World Championships gold medalist] also have PBs slower than the Japanese national record. Following that line of thinking, I think it‘s impossible to say that Japan’s inability for many years to win medals at “The Olympics and World Championships” is exclusively due to a “time gap.”

4. Medaling or getting on the podium is not about running world-record pace for 26.2 miles, but running world-record pace for two or three miles late in the race. Championship style races, i.e. those without pacemakers in which runners are competing for a place rather than a time, are often won in 2:08 or 2:09 though the field is loaded with 2:04 speedsters. The podium spots are taken by runners who best weathered a couple fast miles between 20 and 22, and slowed the least after that. While he admits he hasn’t mastered it, Kawauchi says the key to medaling is late race surges.

... I’ve always thought that in order to win medals the element that Japanese people must foster is the more intangible (although evident if you look at mid-race split times) ability to handle small pace changes mid-race and surge battles late in the race.... In the last few years a considerable number of Japanese athletes have run times of 2:07 or 2:08. However, the only one who has been able to respond to a surge after 30 km and run a 5 km split of 14:39 at that point in the race was [Kazuhiro] Maeda.



At the Rio Olympics the American Galen Rupp won the bronze medal, and since he was also a speed runner with track achievements including a silver in the London Olympics 10,000 m there are now more people saying, “That just goes to show that Japanese people also need 26 minute-level speed in order to be competitive in the marathon.” However, the reality is that although Rupp ran 14:26 from 25 to 30 km, for the next 5 km after that he slowed down to 15:31, losing a lot of ground to eventual winner Eliud Kipchoge [Kenya]. In other words, if you could cover the 5 km after 30 km in 14:39 like Maeda, then at 35 km you would only be 13 seconds behind Rupp in the Rio Olympics. If you could then run within 15:18 [instead of the 15:31 Rupp ran] for the next 5 km after 35 km, you’d be in the race for a medal.

5. Running marathons is okay for young guns, if they approach it with a veteran’s sense of humility and patience. The conventional wisdom is that speed has an expiration date, so young, talented distance runners are counseled to stick with the short stuff, 5K and 10K. It’s thought marathon training will kill your speed so most top runners are around 30 years old when they run their first marathon. Kawauchi thinks it’s fine to apply the strength and speed of youth to the marathon, but cautions to check the youthful ego and impatience. You don’t want to “die and taste the torments of hell, to suffer injury and trauma that will destroy your self-confidence.”

I think it’s a good trend that young athletes are gaining awareness of the marathon while they have physical strength and speed. In my own experience, I learned many things from the two marathons I ran while attending Gakushuin University. If you don’t actually run the marathon there’s a lot you can’t understand just by armchair theorizing. But as the number of young athletes taking on the marathon increases in this way [in the buildup to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics], there are two things to be concerned about.



The first is that too many athletes have goals that are too high for their first marathons. If the goal is ultimately to run 2:05 or 2:06, I think that instead of saying, “Let’s rock the marathon right from the first time,” and jumping in only to die and taste the torments of hell, to suffer injury and trauma that will destroy your self-confidence, saying “Who cares what time you run in your debut? I want to be able to achieve my goal in the end,” and holding back to run at a pace that suits you will let you finish thinking, “Marathons are fun!” and let you run later marathons in a positive state of mind."
The Vatican urged Catholics on Thursday to disinvest from the armaments and fossil fuel industries and to closely monitor companies in sectors such as mining to check if they are damaging the environment.,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-vatican-environment/vatican-urges-catholics-to-drop-investments-in-fossil-fuels-arms-idUKKBN23P1HI,"Slideshow ( 4 images )

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican urged Catholics on Thursday to disinvest from the armaments and fossil fuel industries and to closely monitor companies in sectors such as mining to check if they are damaging the environment.

The calls were contained in a 225-page manual for church leaders and workers to mark the fifth anniversary of Pope Francis’ landmark encyclical “Laudato Si” (Praised Be) on the need to protect nature, life and defenseless people.

The compendium suggests practical steps to achieve the goals of the encyclical, which strongly supported agreements to contain global warming and warned against the dangers of climate change.

The manual’s section on finance said people “could favor positive changes ... by excluding from their investments companies that do not satisfy certain parameters.” It listed these as respect for human rights, bans on child labor and protection of the environment.

Called ‘Journeying Towards Care For Our Common Home’, one action point called on Catholics to shun “shun companies that are harmful to human or social ecology, such as abortion and armaments, and to the environment, such as fossil fuels”.

Another section called for the “stringent monitoring” of extraction industries in areas with fragile ecosystems to prevent air, soil and water contamination.

Last month, more that 40 faith organizations from around the world, more than half of them Catholic, pledged to divest from fossil fuel companies.

The Vatican bank has said it does not invest in fossil fuels and many Catholic dioceses and educational institutions around the world have taken similar positions.

The document urges Catholics to defend the rights of local populations to have a say in whether their lands can be used for oil or mineral extraction and the right to take strong stands against companies that cause environmental disasters or over-exploit natural resources such as forests."
"A 10-year-old girl has sent more than 1,500 art kits to kids in foster care and homeless shelters during the coronavirus pandemic",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/20/us/10-year-old-girl-art-kits-foster-care-homeless-shelter-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A young girl with a big heart has found just the way to cheer up other kids stuck at home during the pandemic.

Chelsea Phaire, a 10-year-old from Danbury, Connecticut, has sent more than 1,500 children in homeless shelters and foster care homes art kits to give them something uplifting to do when they're feeling down.

The kits -- which include markers, crayons, paper, coloring books, colored pencils, and gel pens -- are sent to schools and shelters across the country as part of Chelsea's Charity , an organization founded by Chelsea and her parents.

""Since she was seven, she was begging me and her dad to start a charity,"" Candace Phaire, Chelsea's mom, told CNN.

""She was so persistent, every couple of months she would ask, 'Are we starting Chelsea's Charity yet?' When she was turning 10, she asked us again, and we decided it was time to go for it.""

The rising 6th grader launched Chelsea's Charity on her birthday in August 2019, when she asked party guests to donate art supplies instead of getting her birthday gifts.

Chelsea getting ready

After her birthday party, Chelsea used the donations to send out her first 40 art kits to a homeless shelter in New York. The family then set up an Amazon wishlist full of art supplies. Every time they get enough donations, they pack up the kits and deliver them to kids in person.

In just the first five months, Chelsea and her mom sent out nearly 1,000 kits to children in homeless shelters, foster care homes, women's shelters, and schools impacted by gun violence.

Before the pandemic, Chelsea was able to travel with her mom across the country to meet the kids in-person, and even teaches them some of her favorite drawing tips.

Now, schools are closed, and social distancing precautions will not allow Chelsea to physically interact with the kids as much. Instead, she and her mom are mailing the kits.

Since March, when schools began to close, the family has sent over 1,500 kits to schools, shelters, and foster homes in 12 states across the US.

""I feel good inside knowing how happy they are when they get their art kits,"" Chelsea told CNN. ""I have definitely grown as a person because of this. Now my dream is to meet every kid in the entire world and give them art. Who knows, maybe if we do that and then our kids do that, we'll have world peace!""

Helping traumatized children through art

When Chelsea was 8, she lost someone very close to her heart. Her swim instructor, who she said she considered family, was killed from gun violence in the middle of their swim season.

That was the moment art went from being Chelsea's hobby to her therapy.

Knowing that other children have also gone through trauma inspired Chelsea to help make art more accessible to help others cope with their feelings.

""Art therapy is being prescribed a lot more to support the mental health of young kids, especially those with social and emotional deficiencies,"" Phaire, who is an early childhood education professor and former teacher, told CNN.

""Now with Covid-19, a lot of kids in shelters and also children in foster homes might not have access to art supplies they usually find in school. It's also mental health awareness month, so that's definitely motivating us to ramp it up send even more kits.""

With this year's added stress of a global pandemic and nationwide shutdown, it's more important than ever to make sure kids have ways to cope with the emotions that come with adjusting to today's new reality.

For kids in already stressful situations such as homelessness, this can be even more difficult.

One of the organizations that received art kits from Chelsea is James Storehouse , a non-profit that serves children in foster care ""from cribs to college.""

""When a child or youth enters foster care, they usually have no belongings of their own,"" Stacy DeWitt, James Storehouse executive director, told CNN. ""It's been a great addition to be able to offer the art kits, so the children and youth have a creative outlet to process their emotions during this traumatic time in their lives.""

She said the kits have also ""been fantastic for foster parents who have children at home during the stay-at-home orders.""

""It gives the children and teens a fun creative outlet to channel their energy because they can't be in the classroom right now. Chelsea's kits have been a blessing to many children in hard places and have brought them joy.""

While it may take her a little bit longer to reach every kid in the world, thanks to Chelsea's kindness, thousands of kids all over the country have at least one reason to smile."

Gucci is going fur-free in 2018 and will auction its remaining animal fur items to benefit animal rights organizations,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/12/italian-fashion-house-gucci-to-go-fur-free-in-2018-says-ceo,"Gucci will go fur-free next year and auction off all its remaining animal fur items, the Italian fashion house’s president and CEO Marco Bizzarri has announced.

The changes will come into force with the brand’s spring-summer 2018 collection, Bizzarri said during a talk at the London College of Fashion.

Gucci’s president said on Wednesday the move demonstrated “our absolute commitment to making sustainability an intrinsic part of our business”.

Bizzarri said the new approach was made possible thanks to Gucci’s creative director, Alessandro Michele, who was appointed in 2015.

“In selecting a new creative director I wanted to find someone who shared a belief in the importance of the same values,” Bizzarri said. “I sensed that immediately on meeting Alessandro for the first time.”

As part of the change a charity auction of the fashion house’s remaining animal fur items will be held, with the proceeds going to the animal rights organisations Humane Society International and LAV.

Kitty Block, president of Humane Society International, celebrated the luxury brand’s move as a “compassionate decision”.

“Gucci going fur-free is a huge game-changer,” she said in a statement. “For this Italian powerhouse to end the use of fur because of the cruelty involved will have a huge ripple effect throughout the world of fashion.”

Gucci will become part of the Fur Free Alliance, an international group of more than 40 organisations which campaigns on animal welfare and promotes alternatives to fur in the fashion industry.

The fashion house is owned by luxury holding group Kering, which also has designer Stella McCartney as another fur-free brand under its umbrella.

The new decision by Gucci comes after fellow Italian brand Armani announced in 2016 that it would no longer feature fur in its collections."
People Are Buying Stamps And Praising Mail Carriers After The US Postal Service Said It Needs A Coronavirus Bailout,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lamvo/save-us-postal-service-coronavirus-twitter,"A US Postal Service worker wears a mask and gloves while delivering mail as the coronavirus pandemic continues in California, April 9.

But so far, the USPS hasn't received cash in the stimulus plans aimed at propping up other types of US businesses — prompting some people on Sunday to show support by buying stamps, sharing tributes to mail carriers, and starting discussions about why the mail is such an important part of American life.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, the US Postal Service said that it's seen a ""devastating"" drop in revenue and needs funding from Congress to ensure it can keep delivering letters and packages to the millions of Americans currently sheltering at home.

#USPostalService and #saveUSPS were tweeted thousands of times after the Washington Post reported Saturday that President Donald Trump was personally blocking potential emergency funding. According to the Post, Trump threatened to veto a version of the recently passed stimulus package that included a $13 billion bailout for the US Postal Service and instead extended the agency a $10 billion loan. The USPS has been financially troubled for decades, but a drop in its main funding source — first-class and marketing mail — due to the coronavirus pandemic has only worsened its economic outlook.

""We now estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the Postal Service’s net operating loss by more than $22 billion dollars over the next eighteen months, and by over $54 billion dollars over the longer term, threatening our ability to operate,"" Postmaster General Megan Brennan said in a statement on Friday.

Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat who has led the push to provide USPS with aid, has also said Trump personally blocked potential funding plans.

""Every single one of us will feel the impact if the #USPostalService disappears, @realDonaldTrump,"" Connolly tweeted on Sunday. ""The American people want to #SaveTheUSPS. Whether we can is up to you.""

Some people praised the mail delivery personnel in their lives.

An ingenious drone delivery service known as “Uber for blood” has slashed the delivery time of life-saving medicine to remote regions of Rwanda from four hours to an average of half an hour.,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/02/rwanda-scheme-saving-blood-drone,"A Silicon Valley robotics company has teamed up with the Rwandan health ministry to hasten the delivery of vital medicines to hospitals in remote areas

An ingenious drone delivery service known as “Uber for blood” has slashed the delivery time of life-saving medicine to remote regions of Rwanda from four hours to an average of half an hour.

A partnership between Zipline, a Silicon Valley robotics company, and the country’s health ministry has delivered more than 5,500 units of blood over the past year, often in life-saving situations. Never before have patients in the country received blood so quickly and efficiently.



While commercial drone delivery in wealthier countries is still at the testing stage, hampered by busy skies and strict regulations on airspace, Zipline is delivering blood to 12 regional hospitals from a base in the east of Rwanda. Each hospital serves about half a million people.

The use of drones is helping to reduce maternal deaths – a quarter of which are the result of blood loss during childbirth – and high incidences of malaria-induced anaemia, which is common in children.



Drone delivery also means hospitals can store less blood, which means less waste as blood spoils quickly.

Now Zipline plans to work with the government of Tanzania, a country of 56 million people, to launch what it claims is the world’s largest drone delivery network.

Keller Rinaudo, Zipline’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said the move will make east Africa a world leader in drone logistics.

“Some of the biggest, most powerful technology companies in the world are still trying to figure out how to do this. But east Africa is showing them all the way,” he said. “The work in Rwanda has shown the world what’s possible when you make a national commitment to expand healthcare access with drones and help save lives.”

The idea for the drones came during a visit Rinaudo made to the Ifakara health institute in Tanzania, in 2014. He met a graduate student who had built a mobile alert system for health workers to text emergency requests for medicine and vaccines. A network of community health workers used the mobile alert system to make thousands of requests.

But there was a problem – there was no way for the government to fulfil these requests. “It became clear that this was a database of death filled with thousands of names, addresses, ages and phone numbers,” said Rinaudo.

“We’ve designed Zipline to solve the second half of this problem. We know who needs medicine, when and where. And now, we can get them that medicine as quickly as possible.”

This year, the firm aims to deliver a range of medical products – including blood transfusion supplies, HIV medication, antimalarials, sutures and UV tubes – to four bases in Tanzania, supporting more than 1,000 clinics.

In Rwanda, when a doctor or medical staffer at one of the 12 clinics needs blood, they send a WhatsApp message or log on to Zipline’s order site. They are then sent a confirmation message saying a Zip drone is on its way.

The drone flies to the clinic at up to 60mph. When it is within a minute of the destination, the doctor receives a text. The drone then drops the package, attached to a parachute, into a special zone near the clinic before returning to base.

Critics of the scheme in Rwanda have questioned why the authorities have invested in hi-tech schemes when demand for basic infrastructure, roads and health centres still exceeds supply. Zipline and the government have not revealed the cost of the project.

But a spokesman for the Rwandan health ministry said: “The ministry of health and Rwanda Biomedical Center are happy to use such innovative technology to reduce the average delivery time from four hours to less than 45 minutes, with quick and reliable delivery [of] blood products.”"
New Zealand Discharges Its Last COVID Patient From The Hospital | HW English,https://hwnews.in/international/new-zealand-discharges-last-covid-patient-hospital/138063,"New Zealand has no COVID patients in hospital, the last one is discharged as the nation goes 6 days without any new case. There only 21 active cases.

Auckland| New Zealand has zero COVID-19 patients in the hospital and has not registered a new case for 6 days, the health ministry said today.

The last hospital patient was discharged in Auckland overnight in the latest mark of victory for New Zealand’s internationally-praised response to the pandemic.

New Zealand only confirmed its first case on February 26, but had shut its borders by March 19 and started implementing a complete lockdown on March 26.

The nation’s success means the lockdown could be practically lifted within weeks, with gatherings of up to 100 already allowed and plans being made to resume travel to Australia.

The official tally of 1,504 infections has not moved since last Friday, while the death toll of 21 has not grown since May 6.

The Oceania country has conducted a total of 267,435 COVID tests and contact tracers are operating to monitor the remaining cases through the NZ COVID Tracer app.

New Zealand has managed the outbreak much better than most nations. However, officials are taking their time to drop the alert level from two to one – the least severe level.

In late April, PM Jacinda Ardern said that New Zealand had “won” the fight against widespread community transmission of the virus.

Ardern said that to completely “succeed” in the battle against the COVID-19, the nation must “hunt down” the remaining cases of the virus. “There is no widespread, undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,” said Ardern. “But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.”"
More than 200 nations promise to stop ocean plastic waste,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-un-pollution/more-than-200-nations-promise-to-stop-ocean-plastic-waste-idUSKBN1E02F7,"(This December 6th story corrects to say 193 countries signed, not more than 200)

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Nearly 200 countries signed a U.N. resolution in Nairobi on Wednesday to eliminate plastic pollution in the sea, a move some delegates hoped would pave the way to a legally binding treaty.

If current pollution rates continue, there will be more plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, said the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which organized the meeting.

Eight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, UNEP added.

“There is very strong language in this resolution,” Norway’s environment minister, Vidar Helgesen, told Reuters.

“We now have an agreement to explore a legally binding instrument and other measures and that will be done at the international level over the next 18 months.”

Norway, which initiated the resolution, has seen the evidence of the damage the pollution causes first hand, he said.

“We found micro plastics inside mussels, which is something we like to eat,” Helgesen added. “In January this year, a fairly rare species of whale was stranded on a beach because of exhaustion and they simply had to kill it. In its tummy they found 30 plastic bags.”

China is the biggest producer of plastic waste but has started making efforts to cut down, UNEP head Erik Solheim said.

For graphic click:

“If there is one nation changing at the moment more than anyone else, it’s China ... the speed and determination of the government to change is enormous,” said Solheim.

Solheim eventually wants to see governments ban and redesign some packaging.

“Let’s abolish products that we do not need ... if you go to tourist places like Bali, a huge amount of the plastic picked from the oceans are actually straws.”

Under the resolution, countries agreed to start monitoring the amount of plastic they put into the ocean. The resolution was signed by all l93 countries that are members of the U.N.

“While this is not a treaty, significant progress is being made ... 39 governments announced new commitments to reduce the amount of plastic going into the sea,” said the chief of public advocacy at UNEP, Sam Barrat.

“Chile, Oman, Sri Lanka and South Africa today ... announced measures including plastic bag bans, new marine reserves and drives to increase recycling.”"

Australian comedian Celeste Barber has raised over $17 million to date for firefighters battling to save properties and people across New South Wales.

Barber – who is best known for her parodies of American celebrities – started the fundraiser online when her mother-in-law's house in Eden, on the New South Wales south coast, was engulfed in an orange glow.

""This is my mother in laws house,"" Barber captioned several photos on her social media platforms.

""It's terrifying. They are scared. They need your help.""

Homeless Nigerian Boy who beat kids from elite schools to win NY state chess championship is no longer homeless.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/opinion/sunday/homeless-chess-champion-tani.html,"Tanitoluwa Adewumi, age 8, skidded around the empty apartment, laughing excitedly, then leapt onto his dad’s back. “I have a home!” he said in wonderment. “I have a home!”

A week ago, the boy was homeless, studying chess moves while lying on the floor of a shelter in Manhattan. Now Tani, as he is known, has a home, a six-figure bank account, scholarship offers from three elite private schools and an invitation to meet President Bill Clinton.

“I think I am still dreaming,” said Tani’s dad, Kayode Adewumi. “I hope I don’t wake up.”

I wrote in my column last weekend about Tani as a reminder of the principle that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not. A Nigerian refugee who had learned chess only a bit more than a year earlier, he had just defeated kids from elite private schools to win the New York state chess championship for his age group. He lugged a trophy nearly as big as he is back to the homeless shelter.

Now the story gets even better.

After my column about this hard-working family, a GoFundMe drive raised more than $200,000 for Tani, his parents and his brother. A half-dozen readers offered housing — in a couple of cases, palatial quarters. Immigration lawyers offered pro bono assistance to the Adewumis, who are in the country legally and seeking asylum. Three film companies are vying to make movies about Tani."
"More than a million people in the UK have quit smoking since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, new study shows",https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-smokers-quit-record-numbers-study-2020-8,"More than one million people in the UK have given up smoking since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new study by the nonprofit Action on Smoking and Health.

Almost half (41%) said it was a direct response to heightened health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic.

The study also found that older people are quitting at slower rates than younger people, despite being categorized in the more vulnerable group.

""I don't want to be one of those people in a ward with an oxygen mask over my face struggling to tell my loved ones what I'm feeling,"" one recent quitter told Business Insider.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Saurav Dutt smoked up to six cigarettes a day.

The 38-year-old author from London first took up the habit as a way to unwind from college exams. But as the years went by he found that it helped him focus, and it became essential to his writing process.

""Smoking inspires my writing ... and drives me out of dark moods when I hit writer blocks or doubt my efforts,"" Dutt told Business Insider.

But as COVID-19 gripped the world, Dutt — who had tried quitting in the past, but never managed to do so — decided it was finally time to give up.

So, after 18 years of smoking, he quit.

""I don't want to be one of those people in a ward with an oxygen mask over my face struggling to tell my loved ones what I'm feeling,"" Dutt said. ""COVID-19 has brought the issue of personal health into focus for me like never before.""

He is not alone. According to a recent survey by the UK charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), conducted between April 15 to June 20, more than one million people in Britain have given up smoking.

Of those poeple, almost half (41%) said it was a direct response to heightened health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic, the study added. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has so far killed more than 700,000 people worldwide.

Their reaction is understandable: COVID-19 is known to attack the respiratory system first, with symptoms including a bad cough and shortness of breath.

Smokers may have higher risk of getting severe coronavirus symptoms

In the last few months, researchers have been trying to find out how strong the link between smokers and severe coronavirus cases really is.

A recent study by The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco found that smokers are nearly twice as likely to develop severe coronavirus symptoms.

The research examined more than 11,000 COVID-19 patients and found that about 30% of those who had a history of smoking saw their conditions progress to a more severe or critical state.

Another study published last month by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that one in three young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 are at higher risk of having severe COVID-19 cases, with smoking habits playing a big part.

Patients are considered vulnerable if they have at least one risk factor set out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including health conditions and smoking habits.

More young people are giving up smoking

Younger smokers appear to be giving up smoking at a much higher rate than their older counterparts.

The study by ASH found that of the 1 million people who quit between April and June, 400,000 were aged between 16 and 25.

""For young people who have been quitting, there's a desire to generally be more healthy, and take control at a time in their lives where that control has been taken away,"" Hazel Cheeseman, the policy dierctor for ASH told Business Insider.

""Younger people are more likely to be in employment that's been disrupted, or have their education or social lives disrupted. Their lives have been much more affected by the experience of lockdown, whereas older people have been in their own homes and maintained their own space.""

Cheeseman said that ASH's findings have been ""surprising"" considering it is older people who are more at risk of contracting the coronavirus.

""Older smokers have been smoking longer because most people start in their teens. They're therefore more likely to be more heavily addicted and therefore quitting is more difficult for them,"" she said.

""But they are also more insulated from some of the factors that have motivated people to quit right now.""

While the survey results showed a sign of short-term success for smokers giving up, it remains to be seen if this translates into a continued pattern.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that the disease poses particular risks to smokers.

At a press briefing in July, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Smoking kills 8 million people a year, but if users need more motivation to kick the habit, the pandemic provides the right incentive.""

That incentive has worked for Dutt. He said that while it hasn't been easy, he knows that it's for the better.

""Quitting has been incredibly difficult but nearing 40, the reality of looking after one's health is more important than ever, and I am no longer willing to allow a drug to rule my life,"" Dutt said."

""No one permitted in except those who must. Has helpers who are great with her,"" White's rep said in an email.

Of course, the comedian is keeping her sense of humor through all of this. White's publicist checks in with her several times a week and said ""we always have laughs.""

White is also apparently enjoying the wildlife in her backyard. It seems two ducks in particular have taken a liking to her. (Who wouldn't?)

""Betty has beautiful backyard with a number of wild animals visiting,"" her rep said. ""Two ducks always come by to say hello. They waddle up to her glass door and look in.""

Tom Sullivan, an entertainer who is friends with White, told Closer that she keeps busy reading the Los Angeles Times ""cover to cover.""

“She owns literally thousands of crossword puzzle books and is constantly doing them to keep her mind jumping. This is really serious with her,"" he said.

Fans of White first became concerned about the iconic actress after Tom Hanks tested positive for the coronavirus in March. At the time, White's publicist assured fans she was ""fine"" amid the outbreak.

More than two months later, that message remains the same.

""The animal community is watching over her,"" White's publicist said, adding, ""The virus is afraid of Betty!""

We sure hope so! Betty White must be protected at all costs."

Just hours after suffering injuries from a fall in his home Sunday morning, Carter traveled to Nashville to kick off a week of volunteer work.

Carter's injuries were visible to the audience during an appearance Sunday night. Under an Atlanta Braves baseball hat, the humanitarian leader's left eye was partially covered by a gauze bandage. Underneath the eye, purple and red swelling stretched across his cheekbone.

Gripping the podium, Carter began his address by acknowledging his fall while getting ready to go to church on Sunday morning.

""I fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge and had to go to the hospital. And they took 14 stitches in my forehead and my eye is black, as you've noticed,"" he said. ""But I had a No. 1 priority and that was to come to Nashville and build houses.""

"The Malaysian government has announced it will not allow any further expansion of oil palm plantations, and that it intends to maintain forest cover at 50%. Malaymail",https://www.malaymail.com/s/1669208/teresa-kok-govt-to-stop-oil-palm-expansion-keep-50pc-land-as-forest,"Minister of Primary Industries Teresa Kok speaks during the Corporate Malaysia Summit 2018 in Kuala Lumpur September 04, 2018. — Picture by Miera Zulyana

KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 4 — The government will not allow any more expansion of oil palm plantations in the country, Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said today.

She said Malaysia's forest cover was over 50 per cent and the government was committed to maintaining it.

“We are committed to maintain at least 50 per cent of the land as forest cover, so we won’t allow any expansion of these oil palm plantations,” she said after her keynote address during the Corporate Malaysia Summit this afternoon at the Sime Darby Convention Centre here.

Asked the impact of the government decision on its long-term revenue, Kok said the decision will be up to palm oil producing companies.

She noted the glut in palm oil supply worldwide due to overproduction by Malaysia and Indonesia. The two countries are the biggest producers of palm oil globally.

“The situation now is, there is excess palm oil supplies, here and in Indonesia.

“In the long run, we will let the individual plantation companies decide if they want to maintain their land as palm oil estates or harvest different crops,” she said.

She added that several companies were already mulling converting their estates into coconut plantation farms.

Kok was elaborating on an earlier statement that the local palm oil industry is looking to broaden its market internationally.

She also said her ministry is hopes all existing palm oil traders can achieve 100 per cent Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification by December 31 next year.

“This will be challenging as only 20 per cent or around one million hectares are currently registered,” she said.

Kok said ministry had already contacted Felda and the Sabah Parti Warisan-led government to hold talks on educating rural traders on standard guidelines.

“We are going to move fast, especially with the planters in the interior section of the certain states where the aim is to educate them on the standards they would need to comply to raise the marketability of their product.

“We want to explain to the planters the importance in making first class or five-star standard palm oil.

“And we have to make sure that all planters even the small ones are accepted and not marginalised, and they need the MSPO certification first to be accepted,” she said."

Tyreman said he immediately knew what had happened when he walked up to the museum on Sunday morning to find the door jimmied open and jewelry scattered on the ground outside. Someone had helped themselves to items estimated to be worth $6,000 to $8,000, including a piece of rare ocean jasper worth about $3,000.

They also stole the museum’s donation jar.

The initial shock of the robbery dampened Tyreman’s spirits on the future of the museum, but the uncertainty evaporated when he started getting calls and emails from all over North America.

“I’ve had nonstop emails since yesterday,” Tyreman said on Tuesday, noting all the attention has been slightly overwhelming but he’s thankful so many people are supporting his museum."

NEW YORK (AP) — Liam Elkind’s big heart and his break from college was a highlight of 83-year-old Carol Sterling’s week.

The retired arts administrator has been sheltering at home during the coronavirus outbreak, unable to shop for herself. Yearning for some fresh food, she found the 20-year-old through their synagogue, and soon he showed up at her door with a bag full of salad fixings and oranges.

Elkind, a junior at Yale, and a friend, Simone Policano, amassed 1,300 volunteers in 72 hours to deliver groceries and medicine to older New Yorkers and other vulnerable people. They call themselves Invisible Hands, and they do something else in the process — provide human contact and comfort, at a safe distance, of course.

On delivery day Tuesday, Elkind and Sterling met for the first time over her paper bag of groceries outside her 15th-floor apartment on the Upper West Side. It was a moment of “tikkun olam” between the two congregants of the progressive and service-minded Stephen Wise Free Synagogue.

The Hebrew for “world repair” is a phrase synonymous with the notion of social action.

“It’s neighbor to neighbor,” Sterling said. “A crisis like this often brings out the very best.”

Elkind, the son of a doctor, has watched his father and other caregivers working tirelessly in crisis.

“I figured, OK, I can go buy some groceries. That I can do.”

Life has changed radically for Sterling, a widow who lives alone. She’s a people person, a puppeteer who clearly misses human interaction as she busies herself at home with online classes through “something called Zoom, which I had never heard of.”

She was supposed to be in Vietnam and Bali attending a conference and teaching children and educators about puppetry. The outbreak dashed her plans. With her two children and other family far away, the usually busy Sterling has a new friend in Elkind.

“People are scared, and people are lonely,” he said. “We’re all so separated, and one of the things we need is that social cohesiveness. This is one opportunity to get them that social connection they’re looking for.”

For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.

Elkind and his fellow volunteers take the name of their project from their vigilance in maintaining social distance from the people they serve, and their meticulous care while shopping and delivering.

Grocery and pharmacy orders are placed on the Invisible Hands website. Shoppers must not have traveled out of the country for the virus’ 14-day incubation period, have any symptoms of COVID-19 or have come in contact with anybody who has tested positive.

They must pledge that they have practiced social distancing and other safety measures in their own lives before signing on. They wear gloves while shopping, wipe down bags they’re delivering and use self-checkout when possible.

Bags of goods are left at doors, and cash can be exchanged the same way, or directly to a store or through a digital transaction. Volunteers make a point to pause and chat as they deliver.

The effort started on Facebook. Policano, also a New Yorker, put out a call for volunteers. Word spread quickly as they built a website and distributed flyers in seven languages.

“It’s gone from extremely casual to extremely operational very quickly,” Elkind said. “This is one of those times when I remember that New York is such a small town, and people are willing to look out for one another and have each other’s back.”

Now, Elkind said, volunteers have offered to extend Invisible Hands to Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington and London.

“It’s been really exciting just to see that amount of interest and how many people there are in this world who want to do good and are looking for ways to do that,” he said. “This is a 24-7 operation right now. It’s overwhelming in the best way possible.”

Elkind is on spring break at the moment. After that, his school goes to remote learning. Unless told by officials to stop, Invisible Hands will press on. It was unclear what would happen to the efforts if New York is put under a shelter-in-place order, as Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed. Such a measure could force residents to stay home except for strictly limited activities like buying food or medicine or getting exercise.

Sterling was more than a little grateful, for the food and for Elkind and his colleagues of all ages.

“When we look back ... a lot of good things are going to come out of this,” she said of the crisis. “This will bring everybody together.”

"This Woman Has Rescued 72,000 Human Trafficking Victims",https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/she-has-rescued-72000-victims-of-human-trafficking/321595/,"Hasina Kharbhih’s Impulse NGO Network has used an innovative model to rescue 72,000 women and children trafficked across India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal.

Her innovative model partners with human rights organizations and governments across Asia and Europe, and stands out for its emphasis on financial compensations and repatriation.

Ella Sangma was in her early teens and living in a shelter in New Delhi when the authorities told her someone was coming to take her back to northeast India. “I was doubtful; I had been taken for a ride earlier,” says Sangma, who was sold by her mother to human traffickers as a child and brought to the Indian capital, where she was forced to keep the books at a liquor store connected to a brothel.

But there was something about Hasina Kharbhih that earned the teen’s instant trust. Sangma, who now calls Kharbhih Amma (mother), agreed to return to northeast India with her. Sangma is just one among the more than 72,000 women and children who have been victims of human trafficking across India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal and now find themselves free thanks to Kharbhih.

For Kharbhih, 49, it’s a matter of empathy as she strives to put a dent in the $32 billion human trafficking industry in India and its surrounding countries. When I arrive at a British-era building in Shillong in the northeast Indian hill state of Meghalaya, Kharbhih — wearing a traditional wraparound skirt and her hair in a bun — welcomes me into her office library.

Children were being taken away by recruiters who promised them better-paying jobs and put them into forced labor as domestic maids, tea stall helpers, miners or sex slaves. Hasina Kharbhih

Kharbhih was just a schoolgirl in Shillong when she started supporting the social development of vulnerable communities in the northeast. The area is rife with human trafficking due to its porous borders with Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh; rampant poverty; and clashes between locals and the Indian military. During the 1971 war that resulted in the formation of Bangladesh, Kharbhih’s father housed refugees in their farmhouse.

“I was born the year these people got to go back, but the stories remain etched in my brain,” Kharbhih says. “He did that as a human being and not a social worker — and maybe that got into me. I understood what you can do for human beings.”

While in school, she started cooking and cleaning at retirement homes and orphanages. That early volunteer work became the Impulse NGO Network. Kharbhih decided to go to a college with stacked early-morning classes, which gave her more time for social work than a social life. By 1993, Impulse was registered as a rural livelihood initiative for female artisans in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya.

The initiative’s focus shifted after a 1996 Supreme Court of India order banning the felling of trees in the northeast. While conservationists celebrated, the ruling came as a devastating blow for many female artisans — including those adjacent to the village where Kharbhih’s grandmother lived — who depended on access to bamboo and cane for their weaving.

“The forest resources ban forced the rural communities to seek employment in urban areas, and that eventually led many to become victims of human trafficking,” Kharbhih says in her trademark soft, calm voice. “We found that children were being taken away by recruiters who promised them better-paying jobs and put them into forced labor as domestic maids, tea stall helpers, miners or sex slaves.”

She reoriented the organization to tackle the spiraling problem. In 2000, Impulse took on its first human trafficking case after Prerana, a Mumbai-based nongovernmental organization, rescued three northeastern girls from a red-light district in the city.

Impulse’s immediate challenge was how to work with the government. And for that, it needed a plan of action. That turned out to be what is now called the Meghalaya Model, or the Impulse Model. The trafficking tracking system focuses on the six R’s (reporting, rescue, rehabilitation, repatriation, reintegration and restitution) and the six P’s (partnership, prevention, protection, policing, press and prosecution).

Karbhih’s tracking center works with 1,000 nongovernmental organizations and governmental departments across South and Southeast Asia and has been endorsed by the United Kingdom. Anyone can report a case to the Impulse Case Info Centre (ICIC), which quickly connects local authorities and NGOs.

Once a rescue operation is carried out, ICIC collaborates with social welfare departments and NGOs to provide shelter, medical care and a long-term plan. whether that’s vocational training or returning the person home. And they follow up to make sure trafficking survivors receive financial compensation.

Ajailiu Niumai, a professor of sociology at the University of Hyderabad who researches human trafficking in northeast India, believes that what makes Kharbhih’s model different from others across India are the components of repatriation and financial compensation. “Besides,” Niumai adds, “Impulse has been able to take their model to the global platform by connecting with the organizations across South Asia and also Europe.”

But Niumai also points out that there are regional factors at play. “What is possible in the hills of the northeast is actually more difficult in the urban regions of, for example, south India,” she says. “Here, down south, families are not willing to take back trafficked victims. So there are a lot more cases of re-trafficking.”

The best thing about Kharbhih, Sangma tells me, is the way she listens to survivors and incorporates feedback to evolve the system. When Sangma became the only survivor to testify in court against a human trafficker, Kharbhih was always with her, flying back and forth between Meghalaya and New Delhi.

Sangma emerged from the courtroom to find Kharbhih, and had a simple request for her Amma — to run away. So the pair did just that, running miles and miles through the streets of Delhi, in the hopes that, even if just for a moment, Sangma could feel safe."

India just banned all forms of disposable plastic in its capital,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-delhi-bans-disposable-plastic-single-use-a7545541.html,"India’s capital city Delhi has introduced a ban on disposable plastic.

Cutlery, bags, cups and other forms of single-use plastic were prohibited by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

There is particular concern in the country about the amount of plastic waste it produces. According to the Times of India, it is one of the top four polluters in the world.

The ban affects the whole National Capital Territory (NCT) area of Delhi.

It was introduced after complaints about the illegal mass burning of plastic and other waste at three local rubbish dumps, which has been blamed for causing air pollution. The sites are supposed to operate as waste-to-energy plants.

The Tribunal said in a statement: “Each of these sites is a depiction of the mess that can be created for environment and health of people of Delhi.

“We direct that use of disposable plastic is prohibited in entire NCT of Delhi.

“The Delhi government shall take steps for storage and use of plastic materials.”

The ban came into force at the start of this month.

“All the corporations … and other public authorities, including NCT of Delhi, are directed to take immediate steps for reduction and utilisation of dumped waste,” the Tribunal added.

78 elephants in Thailand permanently freed from carrying tourists because of COVID-19,https://www.yahoo.com/news/dozens-elephants-set-free-chairs-090000522.html,"Dozens of elephants were set free this morning (March 25) as their owners scrapped the heavy wooden chairs that are tied to their backs for carrying tourists.

The jumbos at the Maesa elephant camp in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, have been giving rides to holidaymakers for 44 years but the Covid-19 coronavirus has decimated tourism.

With no end to the pandemic in sight and a ban on such businesses opening, owners have decided to scrap the huge wooden and metal carriages that are strapped to the elephants' backs throughout the day.

Camp director Anchalee Kalampichit said this was the first time in 44 years that the elephants had not worn the seats at the start of the day.

She said the company will now change their business to allow the elephants to roam freely in the grounds and operate as a place for visitors to observe the animals - and all 78 of the jumbos will never have to wear them again.

She said: ""Since we entered the business in 1976, riding on the elephants has always been the favourite activity of tourists.

""But because the coronavirus has spread there have been fewer tourists and eventually the government ordered us to close so we have removed the chairs to liberate the elephants.

""We are not planning to put the seat supports back on the elephants, even if we can operate again. We want to change the style of the place and find more natural ways that the public can enjoy the elephants.

""We will welcome tourists to enjoy learning about the elephants' ways of life naturally instead of using them to entertain the tourists.""

Anchalee added that the government enforced closure of the elephant camp, along with 28 other types of non-essential customer-facing businesses, means that the owners will have to take care of the animals without any revenue from customers.

She said: ""The cost for taking care of the 78 elephants and 300 staff is five million THB (130,399GBP) per month. So for now, we have to bear that expense without income from tourists.

Story continues

""But we will not leave anyone behind and will try to take the best care of the elephants for as long as we can. Now we are planting vegetables for the staff to eat as one of the ways we can reduce the expenses.""

In Chiang Mai, where there are 93 elephant camps of varying size, officials said that 85 of them were facing closure unless the situation improved.

Boontha Chailert, president of the Chiang Mai Tourism Business Association and the Maetaeng Elephant Park, said hundreds of other elephant centres around Thailand were also facing closure due to the lack of tourists."

Australian man Tony Lethbridge couldn't sleep. It was early Monday morning and his 17-year-old son Samuel was missing.

It had been almost 24 hours since anyone had heard from him.

It was out of character and his family feared the worst.

SUPPLIED Emergency services attempting to free Samuel Lethbridge from his vehicle.

A few hours earlier, after a series of unanswered calls to Samuel's mobile, Tony and his wife, Lee, had left Canberra and driven home to search for their boy.

""We got back into Newcastle about 1.30am [Monday morning] and went straight to the police station,"" Lethbridge said.

SIMONE DE PEAK/SMH Tony Lethbridge, who found his son's crash site by helicopter.

""They told us that he might have ran away, he could have done this or he could have done that and we just said, 'It's out of character; it's not him'.

""They put all the things in motion and we waited and waited. They just told us to go home and wait.

But Lethbridge could not wait. ""I just couldn't get it out of my head that he'd crashed somewhere,"" he said.

Samuel had been driving back from the Central Coast around 6.30am on Sunday. He had messaged his girlfriend and arranged to meet her at the family home at Blacksmiths after she finished work around lunchtime.

He never arrived.

As Lethbridge's mind raced, he recalled an accident from a few years earlier along the same stretch of the Pacific Highway that he believed Samuel would have been driving on. That driver wasn't found for five days.

""And he'd passed away,"" Lethbridge said. ""That was in my head, so I just thought bugger this I'm not going to sit around and wait.

""With the way the bush is there, if a car goes in you're not going to see it. The only way you'll see it is from the air. And that's what we did.

""I thought, I'm going to get a helicopter no matter what.

""I just rocked in there and said 'Mate, I've got $1000 – I need you to search as much as you can'.

With the cash in his hand, Tony walked into the Lake Macquarie Airport at 9am. On the dot.

Lee Mitchell, of Skyline Aviation Group, said the man looked ""anxious and fatigued"".

""He asked if he could, no - he said, he 'needed a helicopter bad',"" said Mitchell, a helicopter pilot with 18 years' flying experience.

""He told us it was for missing son and said he believed his son had run off the road somewhere.""

The company had cancelled training flights for that morning because of high winds whipping the Hunter Region but it immediately agreed to start the search.

As Lethbridge - who struggles with flying - drove off to go and pick up his brother, the flight crew readied the helicopter.

Lethbridge's brother, Michael, took the flight while Lethbridge and his wife waited for news from the family home at Blacksmiths. It didn't take long.

Within 10 minutes, they received news that a car fitting the description of Samuel's vehicle had been spotted just off the Pacific Highway near Crangan Bay.

Immediately, Tony began the frantic drive out to the site.

The car was buried in deep bushland, and it was unclear from the helicopter if there was anyone inside.

The chopper put Samuel's uncle on the ground near the former Big Prawn service station.

As his uncle made the grim approach to the crash site, the pilot hovered above to provide a reference for Lethbridge and emergency services. ​

Fearing what he might find when he arrived, Samuel's uncle began to call his name as he began the 50-metre walk down to the accident site.

There was no response.

But then Michael Lethbridge spotted Samuel moving his head inside the wreck. At that point, he sent a text message to his brother: ""He's alive"".

""When I got there, I ran down there and it was just jubilation,"" Tony Lethbridge said.

""It was unbelievable, to find him there.""

Trapped in his vehicle for what was nearing 30 hours, Samuel was dehydrated and suffering serious injuries. A broken thigh bone was protruding three inches through the skin.

""You wouldn't have seen him if it wasn't for the helicopter, because I couldn't see him from the road,"" Lethbridge said.

""If the helicopter wasn't hovering above, I would have never had found him.""

Tony said it was likely the car was travelling around ""80kmh"" when it ran off the road and had been totally destroyed. It's believed the car hit a concrete pole – which ripped the driver's side door off – and spun, rolled and luckily, landed on its wheels.

Emergency services arrived on the scene and had to cut the vehicle open to pull Samuel from the wreckage.

Stable and in intensive care on Tuesday afternoon, Samuel had undergone several scans since arriving at John Hunter Hospital.

With a broken arm, dislocated elbow and small fractures ""here and there"" according to his dad, it's expected his recovery will be a long process. Surgery on Wednesday to his arm and leg should heal the most immediate problems.

Samuel was described by his dad as a ""good, tough and very fit kid"" who plays for Belmont-Swansea Football Club in a local under-19's soccer competition.

He had only started an electrical apprenticeship on Friday. That will have to be put on hold.

""He spoke to me when I got down to the car,"" Lethbridge said. ""I grabbed him and I said: 'Mate, dad's got you'.""

Samuel's first words to his father were: ""I'd love a drink"".

""They were the only words he spoke,"" Lethbridge said."
A university in Alabama gives up a $3 million annual donation rather than destroy its LGBT students group,http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/20/this-university-would-rather-give-up-3-million-than-destroy-its-lgbt-students-group/?utm_source=ET&utm_medium=ETFB&utm_campaign=portal&utm_content=inf_546_60_1&tse_id=INF_d16691f06d9e11e784dd0bde21677fc8,"(Facebook)

A Christian university has turned down $3 million in funding from a religious group which came on condition of shutting down an LGBT students group.

Samford University, which was founded by Alabama Baptists, rejected the hefty annual donation from the Alabama Baptist State Convention.

The university has seemingly chosen to support Samford Together, a group in which students can discuss topics relating to sexual orientation and gender identity, over the Christian group.

The Alabama Baptists had threatened to withdraw its contribution if when considering Samford Together, the university’s authorities “decide not to deny permanent recognition and revoke its provisional status”.

Instead of waiting to see if this threat would be fulfilled, Samford has preemptively rejected the donation.

Samford’s president, Andrew Westmoreland, said in a statement announcing the decision that all students must be respected.

“Our actions at Samford, irrespective of financial considerations, must demonstrate fidelity to God’s truth, abiding compassion and respect for all people, and solidarity with the timeless ideals of a strong university.”

After the university gave provisional status to Stamford Together in April, the Baptist group’s representatives John Thweatt and Rick Lance expressed their anti-LGBT views.

“We are saddened by this decision, which provides recognition for an agenda that we believe to be contrary to Scripture,” they said, according to news site Inside Higher Ed.

“We strongly believe that the Old Testament and New Testament each speak unequivocally against homosexuality.

“When addressing same-gender sexual relationships, the Bible without exception never affirms such behavior as an approved lifestyle.”

After the university’s refusal, Shane Windmeyer, executive director of Campus Pride – a national LGBT group for students, said Westmoreland’s move to “stand up” to the Baptist group was brave.

“The decision shows a great deal of courage to tell the [convention]: ‘Well, take your money, we’re going to do what we need to do on our campus’,” he said.

“If Samford wants to be seen as inclusive, safe and accepting, then they should allow this group to exist.

“Are they the worst of the worst? Well, it sounds like the president is willing to stand up and say, ‘You know what, we’re not going to take the money.'”

The university’s annual budget is around $166 million.

Earlier this year, Alabama passed a law permitting anti-LGBT discrimination in adoption cases."

MIT Will Post Free Plans Online for an Emergency Ventilator That Can Be Built for $100,https://scitechdaily.com/mit-posts-free-plans-online-for-an-emergency-ventilator-that-can-be-built-for-100/,"Clinical and design considerations will be published online; goal is to support rapid scale-up of device production to alleviate hospital shortages.

One of the most pressing shortages facing hospitals during the Covid-19 emergency is a lack of ventilators. These machines can keep patients breathing when they no longer can on their own, and they can cost around $30,000 each. Now, a rapidly assembled volunteer team of engineers, physicians, computer scientists, and others, centered at MIT, is working to implement a safe, inexpensive alternative for emergency use, which could be built quickly around the world.

The team, called MIT E-Vent (for emergency ventilator), was formed on March 12, 2020, in response to the rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Its members were brought together by the exhortations of doctors, friends, and a sudden flood of mail referencing a project done a decade ago in the MIT class 2.75 (Medical Device Design). Students working in consultation with local physicians designed a simple ventilator device that could be built with about $100 worth of parts. They published a paper detailing their design and testing, but the work ended at that point. Now, with a significant global need looming, a new team, linked to that course, has resumed the project at a highly accelerated pace.

The key to the simple, inexpensive ventilator alternative is a hand-operated plastic pouch called a bag-valve resuscitator, or Ambu bag, which hospitals already have on hand in large quantities. These are designed to be operated by hand, by a medical professional or emergency technician, to provide breaths to a patient in situations like cardiac arrest, until an intervention such as a ventilator becomes available. A tube is inserted into the patient’s airway, as with a hospital ventilator, but then the pumping of air into the lungs is done by squeezing and releasing the flexible pouch. This is a task for skilled personnel, trained in how to evaluate the patient and adjust the timing and pressure of the pumping accordingly.

The innovation begun by the earlier MIT class, and now being rapidly refined and tested by the new team, was to devise a mechanical system to do the squeezing and releasing of the Ambu bag, since this is not something that a person could be expected to do for any extended period. But it is crucial for such a system to not damage the bag and to be controllable, so that the amount of air and pressures being delivered can be tailored to the particular patient. The device must be very reliable, since an unexpected failure of the device could be fatal, but as designed by the MIT team, the bag can be immediately operated manually.

The team is particularly concerned about the potential for well-meaning but inexperienced do-it-yourselfers to try to reproduce such a system without the necessary clinical knowledge or expertise with hardware that can operate for days; around 1 million cycles would be required to support a ventilated patient over a two-week period. Furthermore, it requires code that is fault-tolerant, since ventilators are precision devices that perform a life-critical function. To help curtail the spread of misinformation or poorly-thought-out advice, the team has added to their website verified information resources on the clinical use of ventilators and the requirements for training and monitoring in using such systems. All of this information is freely available at e-vent.mit.edu.

“We are releasing design guidance (clinical, mechanical, electrical/controls, testing) on a rolling basis as it is developed and documented,” one team member says. “We encourage capable clinical-engineering teams to work with their local resources, while following the main specs and safety information, and we welcome any input other teams may have.”

The researchers emphasize that this is not a project for typical do-it-yourselfers to undertake, since it requires specialized understanding of the clinical-technical interface, and the ability to work in consideration of strict U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifications and guidelines.

Such devices “have to be manufactured according to FDA requirements, and should only be utilized under the supervision of a clinician,” a team member said. “The Department of Health and Human Services released a notice stating that all medical interventions related to Covid-19 are no longer subject to liability, but that does not change our burden of care.” he said. “At present, we are awaiting FDA feedback” about the project. “Ultimately, our intent is to seek FDA approval. That process takes time, however.”

The all-volunteer team is working without funding and operating anonymously for now because many of them have already been swamped by inquiries from people wanting more information, and are concerned about being overwhelmed by calls that would interfere with their work on the project. “We would really, really like to just stay focused,” says one team member. “And that’s one of the reasons why the website is so essential, so that we can communicate with anyone who wants to read about what we are doing, and also so that others across the world can communicate with us.”

“The primary consideration is patient safety. So we had to establish what we’re calling minimum clinical functional requirements,” that is, the minimum set of functions that the device would need to perform to be both safe and useful, says one of the team members, who is both an engineer and an MD. He says one of his jobs is to translate between the specialized languages used by the engineers and the medical professionals on the team.

That determination of minimum requirements was made by a team of physicians with broad clinical backgrounds, including anesthesia and critical care, he says. In parallel, the group set to work on designing, building, and testing an updated prototype. Initial tests revealed the high loads that actual use incurs, and some weaknesses that have already been addressed so that, in the words of team co-leads, “Even the professor can kick it across the room.” In other words, early attempts focused on super “makability” were too optimistic.

New versions have already been fabricated and are being prepared for additional functional tests. Already, the team says there is enough detailed information on their website to allow other teams to work in parallel with them, and they have also included links to other teams that are working on similar design efforts.

In under a week the team has gone from empty benches to their first realistic tests of a prototype. One team member says that in the less than a week full they have been working, motivated by reports of doctors already having to ration ventilators, and the intense focus the diverse group has brought to this project, they have already generated “multiple theses worth” of research.

The cross-disciplinary nature of the group has been crucial, one team member says. “The most exciting times and when the team is really moving fast are when we have an a design engineer, sitting next to a controls engineer, sitting next to the fabrication expert, with an anesthesiologist on WebEx, all solid modeling, coding, and spreadsheeting in parallel. We are discussing the details of everything from ways to track patients’ vital signs data to the best sources for small electric motors.”

The intensity of the work, with people putting in very long hours every day, has been tiring but hasn’t dulled their enthusiasm. “We all work together, and ultimately the goal is to help people, because people’s lives understandably hang in the balance,” he said.

1. Rick took a hiatus from acting, but he never really left.

There were rumors that work for Rick dried up and that’s why we hadn’t seen him on the big screen for a while, but c’mon, you know Rick better than this. He’s insanely talented and kept getting offers for roles left and right over the years, but Rick stayed home to be a single dad after his wife passed away from breast cancer.

In a Hollywood Reporter interview, Rick says he never really retired from the industry — he was just picky.

Although we didn’t see him on the screen for a while, Rick was always there. From 2001 to 2006, he voiced characters for three animated films and made a voice appearance in The Goldbergs to reprise his role from Space Balls, Dark Helmet.

2. His decision to be a stay-at-home dad wasn’t a tough one.

In an interview with Uproxx, Rick explains shifting his focus to his kids in a matter-of-fact, “duh, of course, my kids are the most important thing”-kind of way.

“Stuff happens to people everyday, and they make adjustments to their lives for all kinds of reasons. There was nothing unusual about what happened or what I did, I think the reason that people were intrigued by the decisions I was making and sometimes seem to have almost admiration for it had less to do with the fact that I was doing what I was doing and more to do with what they thought I was walking away from, as if what I was walking away from had far greater value than anything else that one might have.”

Other people might bat a few eyes at walking away from rising movie star fame, but not Rick.

When asked about walking away from a career in which he got to use his creativity every day, Rick said, “I didn’t walk away from that. I applied all of my creativity to my home life, to my kids, to my family. I was the same person. I didn’t change. I just shifted my focus.”

We love this guy and his attitude. We could all stand to be a little more like Rick.

3. He’s been confirmed for a “Honey I Shrunk the Kids” Reboot.

If you’ve been keeping up at The Dad then you already knew this one, and if you haven’t been keeping up with The Dad, why not? Well, good news: Rick is definitely on board for a reboot of “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.” Honey, I’ve been overtaken by nostalgia. Honey, I’ve busted a tear from my left eye. Honey, he’s back.

Rick starred as Wayne Szalinski, an inventor dad who committed the biggest “oh sh*t” of our time by shrinking his kids with an experimental ray gun. At some point he accidentally sweeps up his tiny kids in a dustpan and throws them in the trash, but like, who among us?

The reboot, called Shrunk, will focus on Wayne’s son, who’s now grown. Apparently the “accidentally shrinking your own kids” gene is strong in this family since Wayne’s son does the ole shrinkaroo on his own kids. We can’t wait to see what Wayne/Rick/the OG shrinker has to say about that.

4. Rick released a comedy/country album called The Agoraphobic Cowboy.

What are you doing with the rest of your day? I just cleared my calendar to listen to The Agoraphobic Cowboy on vinyl while wearing assless chaps and pondering my fear of public spaces, and I invite you to join me.

If you approached me in 2005 and said, “Guess what Rick Moranis is doing right now?” I would say, “Tell me.” And then if you said, “He’s writing a country album called The Agoraphobic Cowboy,” I would say, “Yes, I believe you. That sounds like the most Rick Moranis thing of all time.” He’s since released another comedy music album called My Mother’s Brisket & Other Love Songs, so it looks like I’ll have to clear my calendar for tomorrow, too.

5. Seymour and his plant in Little Shop of Horrors would make a good Halloween costume for a dad and his plant-sized baby.

This isn’t really a fact, just something we noticed. Do you love Rick Moranis and are you looking for an easy DIY costume for Halloween? Do you have a baby without the job, income, or wherewithal to plan its own costume? No worries. Dress like good old Seymour Krelborn, one of our favorite Rick Moranis characters. Slap on some glasses and tape leaves onto that baby. Sing him Little Shop of Horrors original music like “Grow For Me.” Pray that he doesn’t grow too large and one day overtakes you.

6. Rick breathed life into his Ghostbusters character by improvising.

There is writing a good screenplay, then there is hiring a good actor that makes that screenplay come to life in ways you couldn’t have written.

Rick improvised scenes in Ghostbusters, most notably the one in which Louis welcomes a couple to a party by airing out all their financial details to other partygoers. Apparently the whole thing was Rick’s idea and he kind of just made it up along the way.

Director Ivan Reitman explained:

“Right away, Rick had all these wonderful ideas. I think it was his idea to play him as an accountant; he wrote that extraordinary speech when he is inviting people to a party at his house and he’s walking that incoming couple through. I had the joke of throwing the coat on the dog that’s in his bedroom, but that whole wonderful speech … Rick just made all of it up as he was doing it. All these guys were so, so good at writing.”

7. There was talk of a Space Balls 2, but it didn’t pan out.

The movie’s cult following urged the question: will there be a Space Balls 2? The answer was almost yes, according to Rick:

“It wasn’t a box office hit. It was a cult video hit, and MGM wanted to do a sequel. And my idea for it was Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II…But the deal he presented me, what he wanted me to do, was not workable. It was two or three years later…It’s better if I don’t get into the particulars of it…But I was unable to make a deal, and it would have been something I wanted to do.”

Son of a. We were so close to getting another Space Balls. Maybe someday.

8. Rick improvised the Spaceballs scene where Dark Helmet plays with dolls.

You know how your kid can just pick up some dolls and create this whole fantasy world? Your kid and Rick Moranis have that in common.

Apparently, director Mel Brooks came to set with the idea for the scene one day, told Rick about it, and Rick was like, say no mo’. The king of acting/improvising strikes again.

9. Rick Moranis would rather not fly.

Celebrities: they hate flying just like us! It’s not that he’s afraid of flying — Rick Moranis isn’t afraid of anything. He just hates the grossness of being stuck on a plane in a germ stew with a hundred other strangers and the inefficiency of it all.

“We started to hear the stories of people stuck on the tarmac for six hours,” Rick told Heeb Magazine. “If that happens to me, I’ll be on the front page of the New York Post the next day. I’ll fake a heart attack or melt down. So it’s better for me to stay away from airports.”

If he can drive there, he will. Say, Rick, I hate flying too, wanna road trip together?

10. Rick has dated here and there over the years.



Can you imagine going on a date with Rick Moranis? Apparently, Rick’s been putting himself out there a bit, just not on dating apps: “What picture would I use? The guy from Ghostbusters? I don’t think dating sites work for people with famous punims.”

Rick told Heeb Magazine he’d probably travel more if he had a lady companion, but hear me out, Rick. You don’t need a lady to travel with you. What about a dude’s trip? I know at least 10 dads who would love to go on a road trip with you (no airplanes, promise).

11. Rick is Jewish but non-practicing.

If you hadn’t guessed already, that’s what his comedy album My Mother’s Brisket & Other Love Songs is all about. Funny, lively, delightfully Jewish — it’s basically a musical manifestation of Rick.

Rick described the album:

“When I first began writing jokes and sketches with various Jewish partners one of us would inevitably stop at some point and announce, ‘Too Jewish!’ Too Jewish for the star, the show, the network, or the audience. The songs on this album are all in that category.”

If you want to wax poetic/comedic about silver Yiddish cups, a challah, and a very Jewish mother serving up some brisket, then take this one for a spin.

12. Rick’s kids didn’t care that he was famous.

Who, that guy? The guy who changed our diapers? He’s alright, I guess.

Rick told Uproxx:

“My earliest memories were of being in public situations where people would get all excited because they were seeing a famous person, and my kids were just like, ‘Why are you so excited? It’s just him.’ They had a really good perspective on celebrity and fame very early on.”

But it sounds like his kids had a sort of indifference to celebrities and fame in general. About the time his five-year-old son saw Derek Jeter at a Knicks game:

“Derek Jeter turned around, recognized me, got kind of like, ‘Oh hi! Hi!’ And my son said, ‘Have you met Chuck Knoblauch yet?’ And Jeter looked at him like, ‘Who is this kid.’ But that was my son. He was comfortable around anyone, and I think the reason was, is because he just didn’t buy why anyone would get excited around me.”

I hope if I ever run into Rick Moranis, I play it as cool as his kids.

13. He “isn’t saying no” to performing his music live.

In an interview with Heeb Magazine, Rick said:

“I’m intrigued by the idea of playing this music live. I’ve never done that. To do a stage performance in a theater with this music, it might be enjoyable. I have no idea. I’ll see what happens. I’m not saying no to anything at this point, including all of the above.”

If we all start working on our Rick Moranis movie character cosplays now, we can be ready by the time you, me, and every dad we know turn up for the Rick Moranis live music function.

14. Rick was fired from The Breakfast Club.

First of all, director John Hughes, how could you. And second: guess the reason he was fired. You can’t.

Did you guess because he played the role of Carl the Janitor with a too-over-the-top Russian accent? Damn, how’d you guess that?

I’m now commencing my boycott of any The Breakfast Club rewatches and I invite you to join me. Rick Moranis belongs in any movie, in any role, even as a gimmicky Russian janitor, and it’s a cardinal sin to think otherwise. If I watch it now, all I’ll be able to think about is how much better it would’ve been with Rick Moranis.

15. His daughter is an architect and his son works in entertainment.

Talk about doing some hella fathering. Rick fathered these kids so good that they’re both doing super impressive things. Rachel, now 32, has multiple degrees in architecture, attended Harvard for grad school, and has co-founded multiple companies. Mitchell, also 32, has busied himself with all things entertainment biz: acting, screenwriting, producing, songwriting, you name it.

Looks like Rick stepping back from Hollywood to take care of his family paid off after all. We love you, Rick. Probably more than your own kids do. Okay, fine, it’s not a competition.

For anybody who was a victim of a violent crime such as Las Vegas there is in every state a victims compensation program that will compensate for medical bills or funeral expenses. For those who are worried about finances this can ease some or all of that burden.,http://www.nacvcb.org/index.asp?bid=14,"Return to Documents -- Quarterly Newsletter

CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION: An Overview

Crime victim compensation programs across the country offer crucial financial assistance to victims of violence. This overview provides information on how the programs operate and what victims can do to seek help.

Victims of violent crime may suffer financial stress as devastating as their physical injuries and emotional trauma. Recovering from violence or abuse is difficult enough without having to worry about how to pay for the costs of medical care and counseling, or about how to replace lost income due to disability or death.

The good news is that every state has a crime victim compensation program that can provide substantial financial assistance to crime victims and their families. And while no amount of money can erase the trauma and grief victims suffer, this aid can be crucial in the aftermath of crime. By paying for care that helps restore victims' physical and mental health, and by replacing lost income for victims who cannot work and for families who lose a breadwinner, compensation programs are assisting victims in direct ways.

Compensation programs are now serving an ever-increasing number of victims with larger amounts of benefits than ever before. Despite a substantial decline in violent crime (there are a third fewer crimes committed each year now, compared to 1993) applications and payouts continue to grow in most states. The national total of benefits is at record-high levels, and programs are addng new compensable costs and expanding outreach to ensure that more victims' needs are met.

Crime victim compensation was the first type of organized victim assistance in the United States. The earliest compensation program was created in 1965 in California, and nine states were operating such programs by 1972, when the earliest programs providing other types of direct victim assistance were established. Today, compensation programs across the country are paying out close to $500 million annually to more than 200,000 victims. Fittingly, most of this money comes from offenders rather than tax dollars, since a large majority of states fund their programs entirely through fees and fines charged against those convicted of crime. Federal grants to compensation programs, providing about 35% of the money for payments to victims, also come solely from offender fines and assessments.

Victims of rape, assault, child sexual abuse, drunk driving, and domestic violence, as well as the families of homicide victims, are all eligible to apply for financial help. Statistics show that victims of assault comprise about half of the claimants for compensation, with more than a third of those claims being paid to domestic violence victims. Child sexual abuse victims comprise 29% of the victims helped by compensation programs. About 10% of benefits overall are paid to families of homicide victims, and 8% goes toward sexual assault victims.

Compensation programs can pay for a wide variety of expenses and losses related to criminal injury and homicide. Beyond medical care, mental health treatment, funerals, and lost wages, a number of programs also cover crime-scene cleanup, travel costs to receive treatment, moving expenses, and the cost of housekeeping and child care if a victim is unable to perform those tasks. And states continue to work with victims and advocates to find new ways to help victims with more of the costs of recovery.

While each state operates under its own law, all compensation programs have the same basic criteria to determine eligibility for benefits. It is very important, however, to check with the individual state to see exactly what its requirements are (and the Program Directory on this Website can be useful in doing that). Generally, the victim must (a) report the crime promptly to law enforcement, and cooperate with police and prosecutors (many states allow exceptions to this requirement, particularly for child victims); (b) submit a timely victim compensation application (again, some exceptions may be possible); (c) have a cost or loss not covered by insurance or another government benefit program (victim compensation programs pay only after other collateral sources are used); and (d) not have committed a criminal act or some substantially wrongful act that caused or contributed to the crime (the eligibility of family members generally depends on the behavior of the victim when programs assess this requirement). Apprehension or conviction of the offender is not required.

Maximum benefits available from the states average $25,000, with some states able to offer more, and some states having lower limits. Lower caps within the maximum are common for some types of benefits, like funeral and burial costs, mental health counseling, or lost wages.

Telling victims about compensation is the responsibility of every individual who works in victim services and law enforcement. This resource also should be made known by those who provide medical and counseling services. Compensation programs depend largely on these professionals who work with victims daily to get the message out that financial assistance is available, and programs typically expend a great deal of time and effort in providing training and information to them. We encourage everyone with a role in helping victims to get more details from the program in their state by contacting it directly."
"Last year 920,000 children died of pneumonia, mostly in countries without access to expensive medical care. Now an Indian doctor has fashioned and artificial respirator out of shampoo bottles. It has been routinely deployed in his hospital, and infant pneumonia deaths have dropped by 75%.",https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/09/08/how-a-shampoo-bottle-is-saving-young-lives,"ON HIS first night as a trainee paediatrician in Sylhet, Bangladesh, Mohamad Chisti (pictured above) watched three children die of pneumonia. Oxygen was being delivered to them, through a face mask or via tubes placed near their nostrils, using what is called a basic “low-flow” technique which followed World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for low-income countries. But it was clearly failing. He decided to find a better way.

Last year 920,000 children under the age of five died of pneumonia, making it the leading killer of people in that age group. This figure is falling (in 2011 it was 1.2m), but it still represents 16% of all infant deaths. Such deaths are not, however, evenly distributed. In Bangladesh pneumonia causes 28% of infant mortality.

Pneumonia is a result of bacterial, viral or fungal infection of the lungs. Its symptoms of breathlessness result from a build-up of pus in the alveoli. These are tiny sacs, found at the ends of the branching airways within the lungs, that are richly infused with capillary blood vessels. They are the places where oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide leaves it. Stop the alveoli doing their job and a patient will suffocate.

Pneumonia is particularly threatening to malnourished children—which many in Bangladesh are. First, malnourishment debilitates the immune system, making infection more likely. Second, to keep its oxygen levels up and its CO 2 levels down, a child with pneumonia breathes faster and faster. But this takes a lot of energy, so undernourished infants do not have the ability to keep such an effort up for long. Dr Chisti’s device is designed to reduce the effort required to breathe, and to do so cheaply. (The reason for the WHO’s recommended approach in poor countries is that the sort of ventilator routinely available in the rich world costs around $15,000. But low-flow oxygen delivery does not reduce the effort required to breathe.)

His invention was inspired by something he saw while visiting Australia. On this trip he was introduced to a type of ventilator called a bubble-CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), which is employed to help premature babies breathe. It channels the infant’s exhaled breath through a tube that has its far end immersed in water. The exhaled breath emerges from the tube as bubbles, and the process of bubble formation causes oscillations of pressure in the air in the tube. These feed back into the child’s lungs. That improves the exchange of gases in the alveoli and also increases the lungs’ volume. Both make breathing easier.

At about $6,000, standard bubble-CPAPs are cheaper than conventional ventilators. But that is still too much for many poor-country hospitals. However, after a second piece of serendipitous inspiration, when he picked up a discarded shampoo bottle that contained leftover bubbles, Dr Chisti realised he could probably lash together something that did the same job. Which he did, using an oxygen supply (which is, in any case, needed for the low-flow oxygen delivery method), some tubing and a plastic bottle filled with water. And it worked.

In 2015 he and his colleagues published the results of a trial that they had conducted in the institution where he practises, the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research. This showed that the method had potential. The hospital now deploys it routinely and the number of children who die there from pneumonia has fallen by three-quarters. That means the survival rate in the Dhaka Hospital is today almost on a par with that of children treated in rich-world facilities, using conventional ventilators.

Dr Chisti says that, as well as saving lives, his device has cut the hospital’s spending on pneumonia treatment by nearly 90%. The materials needed to make his version of a bubble-CPAP ventilator cost a mere $1.25. The device also consumes much less oxygen than a conventional ventilator. In 2013 the hospital spent $30,000 on supplies of the gas. In 2017 it spent $6,000.

The idea is spreading. Dr Chisti and his team are about to start trials of the new ventilator in a group of hospitals in Ethiopia. If it works as well there as it does in Dhaka, it will surely be taken up elsewhere. All in all, the Chisti bottle-based ventilator shows what can be achieved by stripping an idea down to its basic principles. Effectiveness, it neatly demonstrates, need not always go hand in hand with high tech."

"South Korea to provide 10,000 face masks to help Navajo veterans fight coronavirus",https://www.stripes.com/news/south-korea-to-provide-10-000-face-masks-to-help-navajo-veterans-fight-coronavirus-1.630168,"Stars and Stripes is making stories on the coronavirus pandemic available free of charge.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea will provide 10,000 masks and hand sanitizer to help Navajo veterans of the 1950-53 Korean War fight the coronavirus, the government said Monday.

It was the latest in a series of humanitarian shipments from South Korea to foreign veterans ahead of the 70th anniversary of the June 25 start of the war that pitted the United States and the South against the communist-backed North.

The Navajo Nation has been one of the hardest-hit communities in the United States, with coronavirus infection rates rivaling those of New York City.

Health authorities have reported 3,912 positive cases and 140 deaths on the desert reservation, which covers parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, and has a population of 175,000.

South Korea’s Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said it was “sending protective items including 10,000 masks to the hidden heroes of the Korean War in the Navajo Nation for the people who are hit especially hard by COVID-19,” the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

About 800 Navajo men served in the war, many as Code Talkers who used their native language as an unbreakable code to confound opposing forces. Around 130 of the Navajo veterans are still alive, the ministry said.

The 70th Anniversary of the Korean War Commemoration Committee will deliver the masks and hand sanitizers to the veterans and their loved ones as an expression of gratitude for their contribution, according to a press release.

The items were originally supposed to be delivered on Monday, but the date has been delayed. Officials said they plan to hand them over sometime this week with the assistance of the South Korean consulate in Los Angeles, the Korean community in Arizona and the Korean Missionary Association in America.

“We hope our small gifts will console the veterans in the midst of the COVID-10 crisis,” said committee co-chairman Kim Eun-gi. “The government remembers those who made a noble sacrifice to defend a strange country 70 years ago, and we hope they will proudly tell their posterity about the choice they made so many years ago.”

Earlier this month, the committee sent 1 million masks to benefit all foreign veterans of the war, including 500,000 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for American vets.

Sea turtles in Greece thrive as result of coronavirus lockdown and downturn in tourism,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/30/turtles-greece-thrive-result-coronavirus-lockdown-downturn-tourism/,"A key population of turtles that nests on a Greek island has been given a rare respite from the pressures of tourism by the downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The unusual lack of human interference has produced one of the best years on record for the number of nests dug by female loggerhead turtles on Zakynthos, with conservationists counting more than 1,500.

Loggerheads are just the latest animals to have benefited from the absence of humans, along with pumas in South America and wolves and deer in Europe.

Beaches on the Ionian island are the most important nesting sites for loggerhead turtles in the entire Mediterranean but at the same time Zakynthos is a hugely popular tourist destination."
Tennessee congressman sets up phone line to talk to people experiencing anxiety and depression,https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2020/04/04/coronavirus-pandemic-tenessee-tim-burchett-mental-health-loneliness-depression/5104937002/,"Rep. Burchett set up a line for those 'feeling overwhelmed.' So far, he's gotten 1,000 calls.

Aaron Torres | Knoxville News Sentinel

A few days ago, Rep. Tim Burchett received a call from a woman in her 30s from Illinois. She told him news about the coronavirus pandemic was starting to overwhelm her.

Congressmen are used to hearing from constituents. It's part of the job.

But the woman got in touch directly with Burchett via a cellphone number he shared on Twitter. Burchett recommended she go for a walk outside, while also maintaining social distancing guidelines. She did.

Hers was just one among the 1,000 phone calls and 2,000 text messages to the phone since Monday.

Burchett, who has had friends who have died by suicide, decided he wanted to do something to help people directly. He asked for people who are ""feeling overwhelmed or scared and just want to talk to somebody"" to call him.

Some calls came as late as 1 a.m. Several calls came from other states, even as far out as California and Alaska. Some want to ask him if it's really Burchett himself, but when they hear him answer in his East Tennessee accent, they know.

The last few days, he's received hundreds of calls from the seven counties in his district. The social media-savvy freshman GOP congressman has developed quite a following.

""I've had people call me that are on the edge, and just want to talk, and yeah, some of them don't live in my district, but I don't give a rip,"" Burchett said in a phone interview. ""People are hurting, and they just need somebody to talk to.""

On Thursday, Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order, mandating Tennesseans stay at home, as the number of coronavirus cases in Tennessee continues to rise.

Physical distancing vs. social distancing

The effects of some of the distancing measures are alarming to mental health professionals.

""In social work, we've been very concerned,"" said Phyllis Thompson, a clinical associate professor and chair of the trauma treatment certificate program at University of Tennessee. ""The biggest concern is changes to behaviors, mental health and, ultimately, suicide.""

The term ""social distancing"" is used to describe the measures being taken to increase the physical space between people. But Laurie Novak, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the term ""physical distancing"" is more accurate.

""We're not asking people to be less social, we're asking people to be 6 feet apart,"" said Novak, who served as one of 15 members of the National Academy of Medicine's Committee on Health and Medical Dimensions of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults.

The committee recently released a report titled ""Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System."" It looked at the health impact of social isolation and loneliness in adults over 50, and made recommendations for health care organizations.

And in a press briefing March 20, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said that physical distance “doesn’t mean that socially we have to disconnect from our loved ones, from our family.”

Importance of social connections

Social connections between humans are important, Thompson said.

""The thing about the connection, they help us feel valued,"" she said. ""And it adds meaning to our lives.""

Katie Dorough Veit, a professor at UT's College of Social Work and a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in anxiety, depression and grief, explained: ""When we see someone, it provides a sense of hope and safety because it lets us know we can be connected with others.""

But access to in-person contact has been limited. The CDC has advised against gatherings of more than 10 people. Bars, restaurants, gyms churches and other staples where people interact socially are closed. This can lead to a feeling of loneliness.

""There is a correlation between feeling lonely and depression and anxiety,"" Dorough Veit said. She added loneliness can add to, ""increased feelings of depressive symptoms, a feeling of hopelessness.""

There is a difference between social isolation and the feeling of loneliness.

""Loneliness is the perception of social isolation, or the subjective feeling of being lonely,"" Novak wrote in an email. ""Social isolation, on the other hand, is the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others.

""Not all people who feel lonely are socially isolated, and not all people who are isolated feel lonely.""

There can be someone, for example, living with friends or family, but still feeling alone. And there can be another person who is living alone, but doesn’t feel lonely.

Loneliness can also have negative physical effects on people, particularly older adults.

""There is strong evidence that in adults, poor social relationships have been shown to increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease and stroke, and also to an increased risk of dementia,"" Novak wrote.

And as people start feeling lonely, it can lead to changes in behavior because some may turn to negative coping strategies to combat the feeling, Thompson said. The changes can range from how many cigarettes one smokes in a day to how much alcohol one consumes to how one responds to stress — and stressors.

And one stressor is the impact the pandemic is having on the jobs market. The number of unemployment claims has surged for two weeks across the state.

Losing a job already adds stress as people start to worry how to pay their bills and buy supplies. But for many people, ""their professions are wrapped into their identity,"" Thompson said.

""That’s almost a loss of self.""

You can slow the spread of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, by staying home for all but essential trips, practicing social distancing and washing hands with soap and water frequently. If Americans can slow the pandemic’s spread, it will prevent deaths by reducing stress on medical professionals and the health care system.

What to do if feeling lonely

Here are some things Novak, Thompson and Dorough Veit recommendation for people who feel lonely."
Kroger buys and redirects dairy farmers’ surplus milk to Feeding America food banks,https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2020/05/01/Kroger-buys-and-redirects-dairy-farmers-surplus-milk-to-Feeding-America-food-banks,"Food banks are experiencing surging demand as many Americans struggle to make ends meet during the crisis. According to Feeding America, an estimated 17.1 million additional people will experience food insecurity due to school closures and rising unemployment during the pandemic.

""With so many families struggling with unemployment and food insecurity today, providing access to fresh, nutrient-rich milk has never been more important,""​ said Blake Thompson, chief supply chain officer, Feeding America. ""Kroger's Dairy Rescue Program is keeping America's farmers productive, avoiding unnecessary food waste, and helping families in need.""​

Photo: Kroger

Through its expanded 'Dairy Rescue Program,' Kroger will process (at its facilities in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas) and donate dairy farmers' excess fluid milk – one of the most requested but harder to stock items at food banks – to Feeding America food banks and community organizations through the end of August.

""Kroger recognizes the growing need for fresh, highly nutritious food in our community, especially for children as schools remain closed during the pandemic to flatten the curve,""​ said Kroger group vice president of manufacturing, Erin Sharp.

""At a time when dairy farmers have surplus raw milk, we're doubling down on our mission to reduce hunger and waste.""​

Kroger's dairy processing plants and suppliers will be donating an additional 50,000 gallons of milk per month to local food banks and community organizations. Feeding America member food banks and other partners will help transport the gallons and half-gallons to local hunger relief agencies.

""As the COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses like restaurants and hotels across the country to close, some of America's farmers are left without buyers for their dairy supply. ​Kroger's Dairy Rescue Program is an invaluable resource for the dairy industry during this crisis and beyond, helping distribute and process surplus milk to communities who need it the most,"" ​added ​Heather J. McCann, director of public affairs for Dairy Farmers of America's Mideast Area.

In a similar effort, Publix announced last week that it would purchase and donate 43,500 gallons of milk from southeast dairy farmers in the first week of the initiative (which will run for several weeks).​ “As a food retailer, we have the unique opportunity to bridge the gap between the needs of families and farmers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic,”​ said Publix CEO Todd Jones.​

Dairy industry seeks additional relief​

As the COVID-19 crisis wages on, dairy losses will outpace those for cattle, oil seeds, and feed grain, with the average net cash income loss for a dairy farm projected to be $345,000, according to the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF).

In the second half of April, the USDA announced its agricultural stimulus plan, which reaffirmed agriculture’s eligibility for small-business loans. Under the plan, up to $2.9bn in payments have been promised to dairy producers. The USDA also pledged $1bn in dairy-product purchases for food-distribution programs.

Despite the welcomed relief plans there's still the lingering concern that the efforts won't be enough to offset the drastic losses dairy farmers are experiencing during the crisis. As outlined by NMPF in a May 1 blog post​​, the organization is concerned that the USDA's loss calculations don’t reflect the full damage dairy will feel going forward, and that a product-purchase program may not be able to buy enough dairy to help bolster markets or meet unprecedented food-bank demands.

""We continue to engage with USDA and allies in Congress to address these, and other, problems as we seek relief adequate to the scale of damage, and we are confident that many of these concerns can be addressed,""​ stated NMPF."
Cheers To Corona—It's The First Major Beer Brand To Test Plastic-Free 6-Pack Rings,https://www.delish.com/food-news/a25586620/corona-first-major-beer-testing-plastic-free-rings/,"Delish : Eat Like Every Day's the Weekend booksamillion.com $26.40 GET YOURS NOW

Corona recently announced that it will be testing an eco-friendly change in its packaging, making it the first major brand to test 100 percent plastic-free six-pack rings.

According to a press release, the decision came as part of Corona's commitment to an organization called Parley for the Oceans. Together, they plan to ""help protect the world's oceans and beaches from marine plastic pollution.""



Corona's packaging mostly consists of glass and fiberboard, but the beer brand found the commonly used six-pack rings to be an opportunity to help redesign a common source of plastic. The plastic-free rings Corona is testing are made with ""plant-based biodegradable fibers, with a mix of by-product waste and compostable materials."" These rings, rather than ending up in smaller pieces of plastic if not recycled, ""break down into organic material that is not harmful to wildlife.""

Business Wire

The new rings will be tested first in Tulum, Mexico, at the beginning of the year. Let's hope that Corona sets a trend, and plastic-free rings become standard for more beer brands!

EU agrees total ban on bee-harming pesticides,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/eu-agrees-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides,"The European Union will ban the world’s most widely used insecticides from all fields due to the serious danger they pose to bees.

The ban on neonicotinoids, approved by member nations on Friday, is expected to come into force by the end of 2018 and will mean they can only be used in closed greenhouses.

Bees and other insects are vital for global food production as they pollinate three-quarters of all crops. The plummeting numbers of pollinators in recent years has been blamed, in part, on the widespread use of pesticides. The EU banned the use of neonicotinoids on flowering crops that attract bees, such as oil seed rape, in 2013.

But in February, a major report from the European Union’s scientific risk assessors (Efsa) concluded that the high risk to both honeybees and wild bees resulted from any outdoor use, because the pesticides contaminate soil and water. This leads to the pesticides appearing in wildflowers or succeeding crops. A recent study of honey samples revealed global contamination by neonicotinoids.

Vytenis Andriukaitis, European commissioner for Health and Food Safety, welcomed Friday’s vote: “The commission had proposed these measures months ago, on the basis of the scientific advice from Efsa. Bee health remains of paramount importance for me since it concerns biodiversity, food production and the environment.”

The ban on the three main neonicotinoids has widespread public support, with almost 5 million people signing a petition from campaign group Avaaz. “Banning these toxic pesticides is a beacon of hope for bees,” said Antonia Staats at Avaaz. “Finally, our governments are listening to their citizens, the scientific evidence and farmers who know that bees can’t live with these chemicals and we can’t live without bees.”

Martin Dermine, at Pesticide Action Network Europe, said: “Authorising neonicotinoids a quarter of a century ago was a mistake and led to an environmental disaster. Today’s vote is historic.”

However, the pesticide manufacturers and some farming groups have accused the EU of being overly cautious and suggested crop yields could fall, a claim rejected by others. “European agriculture will suffer as a result of this decision,” said Graeme Taylor, at the European Crop Protection Association. “Perhaps not today, perhaps not tomorrow, but in time decision makers will see the clear impact of removing a vital tool for farmers.”

The UK’s National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said the ban was regrettable and not justified by the evidence. Guy Smith, NFU deputy president, said: “The pest problems that neonicotinoids helped farmers tackle have not gone away. There is a real risk that these restrictions will do nothing measurable to improve bee health, while compromising the effectiveness of crop protection.”

A spokesman for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs welcomed the ban, but added: “We recognise the impact a ban will have on farmers and will continue to work with them to explore alternative approaches.” In November, UK environment secretary Michael Gove overturned the UK’s previous opposition to a full outdoor ban.

Neonicotinoids, which are nerve agents, have been shown to cause a wide range of harm to individual bees, such as damaging memory and reducing queen numbers.

But this evidence has strengthened recently to show damage to colonies of bees. Other research has also revealed that 75% of all flying insects have disappeared in Germany and probably much further afield, prompting warnings of “ecological armageddon”.

Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex, said the EU ban was logical given the weight of evidence but that disease and lack of flowery habitats were also harming bees. “Also, if these neonicotinoids are simply replaced by other similar compounds, then we will simply be going round in circles. What is needed is a move towards truly sustainable farming,” he said.

Some experts are worried that the exemption for greenhouses means neonicotinoids will be washed out into water courses, where they can severely harm aquatic life.



Prof Jeroen van der Sluijs, at the University of Bergen, Norway, said neonicotinoids will also continue to be used in flea treatments for pets and in stables and animal transport vehicles, which account for about a third of all uses: “Environmental pollution will continue.”

The EU decision could have global ramifications, according to Prof Nigel Raine, at the University of Guelph in Canada: “Policy makers in other jurisdictions will be paying close attention to these decisions. We rely on both farmers and pollinators for the food we eat. Pesticide regulation is a balancing act between unintended consequences of their use for non-target organisms, including pollinators, and giving farmers the tools they need to control crop pests.”"
Employees at a Chick-fil-A in Houston gave away hundreds of sandwiches to drivers who were trapped by flooding on the highway,https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-employees-gave-food-houston-flooding-2019-9,"Tropical Depression Imelda left drivers stranded on I-45 in Houston on Thursday.

Employees at a nearby Chick-fil-A delivered between 200 and 400 sandwiches to drivers who were stuck on the highway.

For chicken sandwiches and acts of kindness, Chick-fil-A has got your back.

When Tropical Depression Imelda left drivers stranded on Houston highways on Thursday, employees at a nearby Chick-fil-A decided to step up and deliver hundreds of sandwiches to those who were stuck on the roads.

""It's just a little gesture of love for our community and a way of giving back in a time of need,"" said Jean-Paul Alvarado, the owner and operator of the franchise-owned location at 4410 North Fwy, just off I-45.

Though the store was closed due to the weather at the time, Alvarado's employees wanted to do something to help people who were stranded. They asked Alvarado for permission to deliver food, and he agreed. Alvarado estimated that the restaurant gave out between 200 and 400 sandwiches that day.

""That's what we're known for,"" Alvarado said regarding the chain's history of generosity in times of need. ""We need to take care of our community.""

Ryan Anthony was one of the drivers who was stuck on northbound I-45, just north of 610, when local Chick-fil-A employees brought him some food, local news reported.

In a Facebook post, his sister-in-law Caitlin Morgan praised the restaurant for the act of kindness.

""They may have walked on water considering it's heaven on earth,"" she wrote.

In August, a Chick-fil-A employee in Greensboro, North Carolina, brought some chicken sandwiches to ""stressed out"" workers at a neighboring Popeyes, shortly after the rival chain launched its extremely popular chicken sandwich.

""The local restaurant noticed how busy the Popeyes employees were and wanted to do something nice for them, so they brought them free breakfast,"" a representative from Chick-fil-A told Business Insider at the time.

Chick-fil-A is the third largest chain in the US by sales and has nearly tripled its annual sales over the last decade. The company did not immediately return a request for further comment."
US Senate passes landmark bipartisan bill to enlarge national parks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/senate-bill-public-lands-national-parks-expanded,"Joshua Tree and Death Valley national parks are to be enlarged, and stunning river landscapes in California and Utah will be protected, under new legislation that passed the US Senate on Tuesday.

In all the public lands package sets aside more than a million acres of new wilderness and conservation areas in western states.

The Natural Resources Management Act passed 92-8 in the Republican-controlled Senate, a notable bipartisan effort in an administration marked by conservation rollbacks. Since Donald Trump took office, his administration has shrunk national monuments and put large swaths of land up for oil, gas and mining leases, including on the doorsteps of national monuments, parks and wilderness areas. The bill will go to the Democrat-controlled House next, where it’s likely to pass, and then to the president’s desk.

The landmark bill protects nearly 500,000 acres in California alone, including adding 43,000 acres to Death Valley national park and Joshua Tree national park, which was damaged by unsupervised crowds during the recent government shutdown. The bill also designates 375,500 acres of new wilderness in the southern California desert, which is a critical ecosystem for bighorn sheep and desert tortoise and the setting for thousands of years of cultural history, including the Old Spanish Trail, a historic trade route that linked northern New Mexico to Los Angeles.

“Latinos make up nearly 50% of the population in the California desert,” said Maite Arce, the president and CEO of the Hispanic Access Foundation. “Protecting this area is significant to people across many cultures and communities, and it will help strengthen the diverse social fabric of the region.”

Nearly half a million wilderness acres will be added in Utah.

As for watersheds, some 30,000 acres adjacent to the Yellowstone River in Montana will be protected from mining, and 100,000 acres of the Umpqua watershed in Oregon, one of the most important areas in the Pacific north-west for salmon and steelhead trout, will be conserved. The bill classifies nearly 620 miles of river as “wild and scenic” – prohibiting, for instance, federal support for dam construction – including the Amargosa River in California, the Green River in Utah and tributaries of the Rogue River in Oregon.

Not least, it renews the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses income from offshore oil and gas leasing to safeguard natural areas. During Trump’s first years in office, the Republican-controlled Congress had declined to renew it.

Some conservationists worry that Trump may use the signing of the bill as a bargaining chip in a tussle over other political priorities, although they note that the Senate has clearly demonstrated widespread support for its passage.

“Those lands that were protected today belong to every single American,” said Land Tawney, the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers president and CEO. “This vote signifies that we still care about public lands. We are carrying out the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, and that is uniquely American.”"
Animal shelters across U.S. teach cats how to high five to make them more attractive for adoption,http://www.postbulletin.com/life/lifestyles/can-your-cat-high-five/article_bd2223f6-4266-11e8-8426-b77fcd318d2d.html,"Why are photos and videos of cats high-fiving suddenly popping up on Facebook and Instagram?

Ask Jackson Galaxy, host of Animal Planet’s ""My Cat From Hell.""

Last year, Galaxy launched Cat Pawsitive, a program that encourages animal shelters to teach cats how to do tricks, like giving high-fives, to make them more attractive for adoption. Shelters across the country, including KC Pet Project, have been participating.

The premise is simple. A kitty who can sit on command, jump through a hoop, give a paw bump or a high five demonstrates to a prospective owner that it can listen to instructions and connect with others.

A high five can make a shy cat open up and more aggressive cats play nice, Galaxy preaches.

Another benefit: Shelters can be a scary place for animals, and activities like learning tricks are a good stress relief.

Big life changes can lead to cats losing their mojo, their confidence, their ""raw cat essence,"" Christie Rogero, program manager for Cat Pawsitive, tells Mother Nature Network.

Cats can withdraw and shut down in a shelter setting.

""When they arrive in a shelter, they may have lost the only family they’ve ever known, or they may have come from a difficult life as a stray on the street,"" Rogero said.

""We help those cats to feel more confident, to feel safe interacting with new people, to even spend more time at the front of their cages actively soliciting attention than hiding in the corner with their face to the wall.

""They get the kind of enrichment that cats need to be themselves and show their true personalities to potential adopters. This helps them to make connections and to get adopted more quickly.""

Ahead of National High Five Day on Thursday — who knew that existed? — Galaxy is having a contest, inviting animal shelters and pet owners to post online photos and videos of cats giving high fives, using the hashtag #CatPawsitive and the tags @TheJacksonGalaxyProject and @HaloPets.

Entries are rolling in.

HAVE. YOU. EVER?

""Training a cat to do tricks is not as hard as we would think,"" said Stephen Holdeman, manager of feline behavior and training at KC Pet Project. ""All we need is the right amount of patience, timing and motivation.""

He explained how he does it.

After he finds out what kind of food the cat likes, Holdeman uses a technique called ""operant conditioning,"" which associates a cat’s action with the prediction of getting a reward such as a favorite food or treat.

He also uses a clicker, a popular training device that makes a clicking noise.

""In the initial stages, we get the cat used to the idea that when it hears the sound of the clicker, one of its favorite treats appears,"" Holdeman said.

""After we have bridged these two ideas together, we can use the clicker to reinforce different actions the cat does to let them know that if they repeat it, they will get a treat.""

Then he tries to get the cat to ""target"" something with its paws, usually getting them to play with a wand or toy. He ""clicks"" the clicker when the cat touches the object with its paw.

TIMING IS IMPERATIVE

""Making sure the timing of the click is lined up with the action we want is important, so the cat doesn’t start to ignore its relevancy,"" he said.

""After several repetitions, the cat starts to link everything together, and learn that when they touch the specific object, they get a treat, and they’re happy to repeat it. Now all you need to do is let your extended hand be the target, and we’ve got a high five.""

So far, about 30 shelters across the country have worked with the Cat Pawsitive program, with another 50 expected to participate this year, according to Mother Nature Network.

More than 400 cats who participated were adopted during the first two semesters of the program, created by The Jackson Galaxy Project, a charitable program of GreaterGood.org.

It’s a free program for shelters and rescues, with sponsors including the Petco Foundation and Halo Pets picking up the tab for training materials, online classes and other things such as training treats.

And what about all those high five photos and videos?

After Thursday, Galaxy will judge them, and five finalists will receive cash and prizes for the animal shelter or rescue of their choice. Grand prize is a $5,000 cash grant and 10,000 bowls of Halo pet food. More info is at felinehighfive.com."
A Kentucky tattoo shop is offering to cover up hate and gang symbols for free,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/14/us/tattoo-shop-hate-gang-symbol-cover-up-kentucky-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A tattoo parlor in Kentucky is using ink to unite communities across the country by offering free appointments to anyone who wants to cover up their hate or gang symbol tattoos.

Tattoo artists Jeremiah Swift and Ryun King at the Gallery X Art Collective in Murray said they decided to offer this service as a way to take a stance in the Black Lives Matter movement amid the protests calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice.

""It's definitely a long overdue change,"" King told CNN.

""Having anything hate related is completely unacceptable. A lot of people when they were younger just didn't know any better and were left with mistakes on their bodies. We just want to make sure everybody has a chance to change.""

Since posting on Facebook about the free coverups two weeks ago, the shop has already received over 30 requests which continue to pour in, according to Swift.

""One of the people we got was a man with both of his forearms completely covered in hate symbols, absolutely everywhere. How is this man going to interact with society with the mistakes he made 10, 15, 20 years ago?"" King said.

""We also got a guy with a giant swastika who said he has never taken his shirt off in front of his kids. I like seeing that. I like seeing people want to change themselves for the better. That swells me full of emotions.""

The artists said they will cover up anyone's tattoos, even if they are from out of state, and offer numerous designs they can choose from.

A new tattoo, a new life

King's first client was Jennifer Tucker, a 36-year-old mother of two who wanted to cover up a small Confederate flag she got tattooed on her ankle when she was 18 years old.

""I went to a school where there wasn't a single black person,"" Tucker told CNN. ""Our community had no black families, they would literally run them out every time one moved in. Everyone in my school flew rebel flags and had rebel flag tattoos and I bandwagoned and got the tattoo. It was a horrible thing to do.""

Jennifer Tucker.

After high school, Tucker moved to Paducah, Kentucky, where she became involved in various solidarity movements and peaceful protests aimed at uniting the community and fighting racial injustice against black people.

A friend of Tucker's sent her the tattoo shop's Facebook post offering the free coverups, and she immediately messaged the shop asking for an appointment.

""I just needed to get that symbol of hatred off of my body. Every time I attend a group meeting or protest, I make a new friend. And I don't want to be standing next to them with a confederate flag on my leg,"" Tucker said.

On Tuesday, after a 40 minute drive and nearly 20 years of ""looking down at the tattoo regretting it,"" King covered up the flag with a Pickle Rick, a character from the cartoon ""Rick and Morty.""

""It feels so amazing, it's life changing. I knew I had to do it, to be an example for other people who were in the same position. There's not a whole lot I can do, but this is something I can do to spread love, not hate.""

Because of their help, Tucker said she is finally ready to close the chapter of her old life and start looking forward to new days full of love and kindness."
'Remarkable' 16-Year-Old Praised for Leading Peaceful Protests in Detroit: 'I Made a Mark',https://people.com/human-interest/16-year-old-praised-for-leading-peaceful-protests-detroit/,"Stefan Perez urged the Detroit protesters to comply with the city's 8 p.m. curfew so that no one got hurt

A Detroit teenager is being commended for his actions after he helped lead peaceful protests, spurred by George Floyd's death, through the city and get people home safely at the end of the night.

Stefan Perez never expected to become a leader when he set out to protest racial injustices and police brutality over the weekend, but he quickly found himself in that role — with a megaphone in hand — as he urged protesters to go home and abide by the city's 8 p.m. curfew on Monday, The Detroit Free Press reported.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

""I tried to keep everybody together, I tried to keep everybody as a collective group, and we marched,"" the 16-year-old told the outlet in an interview. ""I'm surprised people listened to me. I'm glad they did because they're not hurt right now, 'cause they could be.""

""The fact that I was able to put my hand up and stop everybody from causing trouble here tonight, I look back and smile at that moment,"" Perez added. ""The people followed me into battle and I'm glad that I was able to get them home safely.""

Being a leader wasn't always something that Perez considered himself, but the teen — who is preparing to enter his senior year at the Communication and Media Arts High School — said his grandmother had a major role in helping him get there.

""If it wasn't for my grandmother, I wouldn't be here today,"" he explained to the outlet, noting how he's been living with her for a year but also has a good relationship with his mother and step-father.

""As a teenager, I have put her through a lot of stuff,"" he said of his grandmother. ""But she stuck by my side when I needed it the most and she'd be proud of what we accomplished tonight.""

Just one night earlier, things became dangerous in Detroit as police fired tear gas and shot rubber bullets at protesters who refused to go home on the first night of the curfew. Those who did not comply were arrested, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Perez — who said he is not affiliated with any political group — refused to let more violence happen and knew he had to step up to ensure that it didn't.

On his knees in the middle of Michigan Avenue on Monday, the teen — who is Black, Mexican, Puerto Rican and Nicaraguan — yelled into a megaphone and urged protesters to return home, the outlet reported.

His efforts, combined with the leadership of a few other individuals, ensured that the protest was peaceful and did not include any violence or major incidents, according to the Detroit Free Press.

""We did this. I'm not going to necessarily say I did this, because I didn't,"" Perez explained. ""I had plenty of help today. But I'm here. I'm alive. I woke up today enough to do this. I'm just glad that I'm here. I'm glad I was able to take a knee, put my hand up and say 'Black Lives Matter.'""

His leadership also caught the attention of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who watched the protest from a live stream. The two connected on a phone call shortly afterward, and Duggan applauded the teen for keeping the peace, according to the local newspaper.

""I was watching the video and I saw your leadership and I had tears in my eyes,"" Duggan told him on the phone while he was being interviewed. ""You are everything that is special about the city of Detroit... we're gonna fight this injustice because of people like you.""

Toson Knight, who previously worked with the mayor and was volunteering at the protest with the violence prevention organization Cease Fire, connected the pair on the call, and later reiterated Duggan's remarks to the outlet while reflecting on the moment.

""Mayor Duggan called me and said he thought the kid was remarkable and said he brought tears to his eyes,"" he recalled. ""I gave him the phone and at first he didn't believe me. To have the mayor call you and you're only 16, is major. I hope that motivates him to continue being the leader that he is.""

Perez was certainly inspired, telling the Detroit Free Press after the phone call, ""That was amazing. ... I didn't think I was gonna make it to 16.""

""The fact that people follow me... and the fact that the mayor just spoke to me, the fact that the Detroit police didn't shoot. And they could've. It's just amazing,"" continued the teen, who plans on attending Wayne County Community College after graduation. ""I'm glad I'm not a statistic because I could be.""

""At the end of the day I felt like I made a mark,"" Perez added. ""I felt like people that [were] with me felt that. They felt the pain. All we wanted was just to reconcile for ourselves to the people we lost: George Floyd, Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin. There are so many names ... I'm glad that I'm not a name.""

"The 22-year-old Brit who stopped the global cyberattack is donating his $10,000 reward to charity",http://uk.businessinsider.com/malwaretech-donate-10000-wannacry-reward-charity-ransomware-2017-5,"The WannaCry ransomware. gigi.h/Twitter LONDON — The 22-year-old Brit who ""accidentally"" halted Friday's devastating global cyberattack says he plans to give his $10,000 (£7,700) reward to charity.

""I don't do what I do for money or fame,"" he told Business Insider. ""I'd rather give the money to people who need it.""

Late last week, a ransomware attack that used a leaked National Security Agency ""EternalBlue"" software exploit spread rapidly around the world, infecting organisations in more than 150 countries, including Britain's National Health Service, the Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica, Nissan, and FedEx.

But the ""WannaCry"" malware's spread was halted when a pseudonymous British security researcher who goes by MalwareTech registered a website he found when investigating the malware's code. In doing so, he inadvertently triggered a ""kill switch"" — and he continued to host the website when he realised what he had done.

Since then, he has been inundated with unwanted publicity, with journalists tracking down his real name, publishing his photo, and appearing outside his home, where he lives with his parents.

""If you turn up at my house you're crossed off the list of potential media outlets I will do an exclusive with,"" he tweeted on Monday. ""For the record I don't 'fear for my safety,' I'm just unhappy with trying to help clear up Friday's mess with the doorbell going constantly.""

He has now been offered a $10,000 reward — but he says he doesn't want it.

HackerOne is a platform that lets security professionals responsibly report potential security issues in software, often in return for a cash reward, a so-called bug bounty. In recognition of MalwareTech's efforts, the company publicly offered him the $10,000 bounty, writing, ""Thank you for your active research into this malware and for making the internet safer!""

He responded that he would donate it to charity.

""I plan on holding a vote to decided which charities will get the majority of the money,"" he wrote. ""The rest will go to buying books/resources for people looking to get into [information security] who can't afford them.""

In a message, MalwareTech told Business Insider he hadn't decided the sort of charities he would give the reward to, and that he planned ""to let people suggest which they think is best.""

So why does he do what he does? ""Because it helps people, and I enjoy it,"" he said.

The vulnerability in Microsoft Windows that WannaCry exploited was patched in March, but because many organisations hadn't updated their software, they remained vulnerable.

On Monday, Microsoft published a blog post excoriating the NSA for ""stockpiling"" software exploits and for the subsequent leak of those exploits online by the hacking group Shadow Brokers.

""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,"" wrote Microsoft's president, Brad Smith. ""The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.""

MalwareTech has since been offered another reward for his work — a year's worth of free pizza, courtesy of the food delivery firm Just Eat.

""Yeah, I'll probably claim it,"" he said. ""I do like delivered food, and it would be perfect for con after-parties."""

Update: Georgia student who posted photo of a crowded school hallway no longer suspended,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/us/georgia-teen-photo-crowded-school-hallway-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The mother of a student who was suspended after posting a photo on Twitter that showed her high school's crowded hallways this week tells CNN that her daughter's suspension has been reversed.

The viral photo showed students at North Paulding High School, outside Atlanta, crowded in hallways and with few visible masks. Hannah Watters, the sophomore who posted it, said she was initially suspended over the act.

Hannah's mother, Lynne Watters, spoke with the school's principal Friday morning by phone, she told CNN. The woman was told her daughter would not be suspended and that a suspension would not appear on her daughter's record.

Hannah will be in school on Monday, she and her mother told CNN.

As schools have opened for the new academic year around the country, parents and administrators are making difficult decisions about how to ensure students get the education they need while also staying safe in an ongoing pandemic. While many have responded to the resurgence of cases with completely remote schooling, others have opted to return to classrooms , which the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has said works if safety measures are the priority.

Hannah felt compelled to share what it looked like inside her school, so she took a photo of the scene and posted it to social media, she told CNN on Thursday.

""I was concerned for the safety of everyone in that building and everyone in the county because precautions that the CDC and guidelines that the CDC has been telling us for months now, weren't being followed,"" she said.

This is the photo that Hannah took in North Paulding High School in Dallas, Georgia.

The superintendent responds

Watters was originally told Hannah was being suspended for violating several parts of the high school's code of conduct, including using a cell phone during school hours, using social media during school hours, and violating student privacy by photographing them, she said.

Her daughter posted the photo to social media after regular school hours, and North Paulding High School students are allowed to use their cell phones during class, Watters said.

CNN has reached out to North Paulding High School and the Paulding County School District.

In a letter to the community, Superintendent Brian Otott said the photo was taken out of context, writing: ""Class changes at the high school level are a challenge when maintaining a specific schedule. It is an area we are continuing to work on in this new environment to find practicable ways to further limit students from congregating. Students are in this hallway environment for just a brief period as they move to their next class. ... There is no question that the photo does not look good. ... Wearing a mask is a personal choice, and there is no practical way to enforce a mandate to wear them.""

Watters said the time to move from one class to another only lasts about five minutes, but students from all classes are often speed-walking from one end of campus to the other, passing by countless people.

'Some good and necessary trouble'

Hannah said she was suspended over the photo and that the school said she violated three conduct policies: using her phone during instruction time, using her phone during school hours for social media and filming students and posting on a social media platform.

But students in grades 9 through 12 are exempt from the phone ban, she said, and she didn't post the photo until school was over. Hannah admitted she broke the policy on posting images of students to social media, but she doesn't regret it.

""I'd like to say this is some good and necessary trouble,"" she said. ""My biggest concern is not only about me being safe, it's about everyone being safe because behind every teacher, student and staff member there is a family, there are friends, and I would just want to keep everyone safe.""

Otott's letter to parents said that the school district anticipated needing to make ""adjustments."" The district previously decided to make Thursday and Friday virtual learning days for students receiving in-person instruction, ""so that all of our schools can step back and assess how things are going so far,"" Otott said.

Asked Friday about the photo, Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan echoed Otott's letter, saying school districts would need to ""make adjustments"" as they figure out how to best educate students, calling it a ""work in progress.""

""Just like a businesses has got to earn the trust and the confidence of their customers, I think schools are going to have to earn the trust and confidence of the parents and the students,"" Duncan said. ""It's a work in progress, and we're going to do the best we possibly can."""

"Ruth Bader Ginsburg shows 'no evidence of remaining disease,' Supreme Court says",https://edition-m.cnn.com/2019/01/11/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-recovery/?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fpolitics%2Fnew%2F,"Washington (CNN) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recovery from surgery is ""on track"" but she will miss oral arguments next week, the Supreme Court announced Friday. Ginsburg is still recuperating from surgery to remove two cancerous nodules from her lungs.

""Post-surgery evaluation indicates no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment is required,"" said court spokesperson Kathleen Arberg.

Ginsburg, 85, who missed oral arguments this week, has not been on the bench since her surgery last month, but she has participated by reading briefs at home.

Her absence comes as the court is considering whether to take up several controversial issues including the administration's decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and its ban that blocks most transgender individuals from serving in the military. The justices met behind closed doors earlier on Friday to discuss pending petitions and Ginsburg participated by proxy.

Monday marked the first time she had ever missed oral arguments due to her health. She has survived two other bouts of cancer.

A 13-year-old runs his own bakery and matches every sale with a donation to the homeless,https://www.businessinsider.com/13-year-old-michael-platt-runs-bakery-donates-to-homeless-2019-6,"Michael Platt, a 13-year-old who lives in Washington, DC, started his own bakery called Michael's Desserts.

The bakery operates on a one-for-one donation model, meaning that for every cupcake sold he donates one to the homeless.

The teen bakes all sorts of things, but cupcakes are his biggest seller, he told The Washington Post.

As a child, Michael Platt loved to bake.

And when he turned 11, the Bowie, Maryland, resident turned his passion into a business and founded Michael's Desserts, The Washington Post reported.

The bakery operates on a one-for-one donation model, meaning that for every cupcake sold he donates one to the homeless, according to WJLA. He makes donation batches about once a month, he told the outlet.

Platt said it is important to him that his business has a philanthropic component.

""I knew that I wanted to make a business, but I knew I didn't just want to make money, I also wanted to help people at the same time,"" he told WJLA.

Michael's Desserts partnered with No Kid Hungry, which is a nonprofit that provides meals, hosts educational programming, and advocates on behalf of children.

In the past two years, Platt's business has grown.

The teen's baked goods include cookies and cupcakes, according to The Washington Post. He told the newspaper that each month he sells about 12 cookies, 75 cupcakes, and 12 rotating ""chef's choice"" items, which he also calls ""freedom fighter cupcakes.""

Every month the teen draws inspiration from a different historical figure and bases the ""chef's choice"" flavor on that person. Past honorees have included Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King Jr., who inspired the business, according to The Washington Post.

Cupcakes, in general, are by far his biggest seller — and a four-pack sells for $15, according to the newspaper. Platt, who is homeschooled, has gotten help and support from his mom, who he calls his ""baking consultant.""

He's grateful for all the support — and for all the orders people have put in. Most of which are placed by strangers.

""I always wanted to have a purpose for what I do,"" he told The Washington Post. ""It's all about helping people — not just having a purpose for yourself, but thinking about, 'How does this touch other things?'"""
Trump signs measure to preserve Native languages,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/trump-measure-protect-indigenous-languages-1.5407509,"U.S. President Donald Trump signed a measure that extends federal grant programs aimed at preserving Indigenous languages and expands eligibility so more tribes can participate.

The president's signature came Friday, after the measure cleared the U.S. House with bipartisan support. Senate approval came earlier this year.

The legislation was named after Esther Martinez, a traditional storyteller and Tewa language advocate from New Mexico's Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo. She died in 2006.

Her family, tribal leaders and members of New Mexico's congressional delegation say re-authorization of the programs through 2024 marks a commitment by the federal government to keep Alaska Native and American Indigenous languages alive.

Dozens of tribes and other groups from Alaska to Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Massachusetts have benefited from the programs over the years. Currently, there are over 40 active grants totalling more than $11 million U.S., that are being used for language preservation and immersion efforts.

Martinez's own Pueblo was awarded a grant earlier this year after seeing a decline in fluent Tewa speakers and the increase of English as the primary language in the homes of tribal members.

This Aug. 1990, file photo shows Esther Martinez at age 78 in San Juan Pueblo, now Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, New Mexico. (Dean Hanson/The Albuquerque Journal via The Associated Press)

U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat and Laguna Pueblo member who co-chairs the Congressional Native American Caucus, said programs that support language preservation are often underfunded.

""Now that our bill honouring the legacy of Pueblo storyteller and self-taught linguist Esther Martinez is signed into law, we will move forward on important work to revitalize our languages and traditions,"" Haaland said."

Flames continue to savage the Amazon and the Brazilian army could be deployed to help extinguish the vicious fires. More than 74,000 wildfires have been reported in the Amazon this year alone - and almost 10,000 of those just in the past week. French President Emmanuel Macron urged the G7 to pressure Brasil's president to take more action against the fires on Friday. The Brazilian army is ready to defend the Amazon rainforest, Edson Leal Pujol, head of the armed forces, has said amid increasing international pressure and calls for tough action to combat fires sweeping through the forest.

The Amazon rainforest is known as the “lungs of the world” and provides 20 per cent of all the world's oxygen.

The huge stretch of forest is currently experiencing the most intense blazes for almost a decade.

The sheer number of fires is the highest number since 2013 and compares with less than 40,000 in the same period in 2018.

But as the fires rage on, the rain has started to fall across some parts of the rainforest - with concerned citizens aros the globe pinning their hopes on rainfall helping to quell the spread of the blazing infernos."

On Wednesday, the city said spring kitten season combined with a high number of stray cats put the shelter over capacity, with more than 100 cats being housed with more arriving every day.

""Animal services has had to re-arrange rooms and cages in the shelter to accommodate all of these cats,"" Patti Smadis with the city's animal services said at the time.

The city dropped adoption costs for the weekend by half, and also threw in a one-year licence, a collar and a bag of food and toys.

The discount may have been effective. On Saturday, the city thanked Calgarians for helping the cats find homes, noting that there's a limited number of adoptable cats left.

A list of cats available for adoption, or those that have been impounded and may be up for adoption in the next few days, can be viewed on the city's website.

A 13-year-old boy has gained 100,000 followers after being bullied about an Instagram account he used to talk about his favourite books.

Callum Manning, from South Shields , started his Instagram page Cal's Book Account so he could flag up books he liked to his friends.

But when people started sending insulting messages to a group chat he had joined at his new school, he was left ""devastated"".

""I don't tend to cry that often but I think that was the first time in a while I've actually cried,"" Callum told the PA news agency.

But things turned around when Callum's sister, Ellis Landreth, wrote about the incident on Twitter.

She posted a picture of Callum's Instagram account and wrote: ""Can't believe how awful kids are. My little brother's made an Instagram reviewing and talking about books and kids in his new school have seen it and have created a group chat calling him a creep slagging him off about it and added him to it so he could see.""

Ellis, 24, told PA she was hoping ""20 or 30 of my friends (would) like a few of his posts or follow him or give him some words of encouragement"".

But within a few hours he had amassed thousands of new followers as people who saw the tweet rushed to support him.

(Image: PA)

""People saw it and people just thought 'it's not right' because it isn't,"" Callum said. ""Then I started getting loads of comments from everyone showing their support.

""I just think it's really nice that there's still people in the world who are nice.""

By Sunday morning his follower count had surpassed 50,000, while shops, authors, publishers and members of the public were offering to send him more books to read and review.

Among those to contact him was Caroline Kepnes, author of the book You.

Callum said: ""She's one of my favourite authors - she texted us, which was really cool. Obviously I'm a really big fan so I was kind of nervous but that was really cool.""

Some of Callum's new followers have been surprised to see books by the likes of Jane Austen, George Orwell and Mary Shelley feature on his account, alongside Harry Potter and Twilight novels.

""He's a very, very clever kid,"" Callum's mum, Carla Landreth, told PA.

""He's been reading since he was really young but he reads like Crime And Punishment and stuff that probably not your average 13-year-old would be interested in reading.

""He reads everything and anything.""

And it seems his collection is about to get bigger as offers to send free books roll in from around the country.

""I don't know where we're going to put all these books,"" she said. ""I think we're going have to go to Ikea and get some bookcases.""

Ms Landreth, 43, hopes Callum's story will help spread the message that bullying should not be tolerated.

""On Friday night he was in tears,"" she said. ""He was absolutely devastated that people could be so cruel.

""And since this has been happening, his confidence has just soared. He's a lovely kid, he's a very loving kid, and he's just saying, 'I can't believe these people want to follow me on Instagram and want to send me stuff'.

""We're just so shocked. It's been absolutely brilliant. He's just over the moon.""

Callum added: ""I never thought this would ever happen, this just happened out of the blue, and it's just showed that there are good people in the world."""
Kraft Heinz to give all of their salaried employees the day after the Super Bowl off instead of buying multi-million-dollar game ad,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4157696/Kraft-Heinz-employees-Super-Bowl-Monday-off.html,"Kraft Heinz plans to give their salaried employees the day after the Super Bowl off, in a stunt they hope will drum up enough publicity to substitute a pricey game ad.

The Chicago-based company announced their plans to forgo buying Super Bowl ad time on Wednesday, in favor of giving their employees a little R&R after the game-night festivities.

'The Heinz brand doesn't settle on delivering superior taste or quality, and we don't believe America should have to settle on the day after the best sports day of the year,' Nicole Kulwicki, head of Heinz brands, said in a press release.

Kraft Heinz is giving all of its salaried employees the day off after the Super Bowl instead of buying a multi-million-dollar game ad. They are also encouraging people to sign a petition to turn Super Bowl Monday - Smunday - into a national holiday

Super Bowl ad time is the year's most lucrative, and last year 30-second spots were estimated to cost $5million.

Giving their salaried employees the day off will also be pricey, since the company employed 42,000 employees at the end of 2015. The day off does not apply to the company's factory workers.

But the good press around 'Smunday' could make it worth their while.

The day off does not apply to the company's factory workers. Above, the company's headquarters in Chicago

In addition to promoting the effort in online videos released Wednesday, the company also started a Change.org petition to turn the Monday after the Super Bowl into a national holiday.

If the petition reaches 100,000 signatures, the company says they will sent it to Congress for consideration.

The idea has been gaining traction for some time since the Monday after the Super Bowl has long been notorious for absenteeism. And studies back up the fact that decreased productivity on the day amounts to the loss of a billion dollars on average.

The idea for the movement came from the same ad agency behind the company's weiner dogs stampede commercial for last year's Super Bowl.

'We loved ""Wiener Stampede"" as well. It was a great way for us to introduce the full Heinz Ketchup family. This year we're doing something different. We're always looking for ways to connect with our consumers. This is a cause that we felt that the American public feels strongly about. And we really wanted to rally behind that effort,' Nicole Kulwicki, head of the Heinz brand, told Adweek."
China’s ivory ban having a positive impact on the African elephant,https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/conservation/china-has-banned-ivory-but-has-the-african-elephant-poaching-crisis-actually-been-stemmed/news-story/b086f6a0e61acfcc15abeed18f899136,"WITH massive tusks that touched the ground, Satao towered over the rest of his herd.

One of the last great “tuskers”, the beast estimated to be around 50 years old was heralded as Kenya’s biggest, oldest, and arguably most iconic elephant. Tourists from around the world would flock to see Satao in his prime.

Yet his celebrity status, and the added protection it afforded him, was not enough to save Kenya’s most beloved bull elephant.

On May 30th, 2014, he was found dead. He was the victim of a poacher’s poisoned arrow. His face crudely hacked off. His ivory, gone.

Satao is just one casualty of the vicious ivory trade decimating the African elephant population; a trade that is estimated to cost Africa 20,000 to 30,000 elephants every year.

The continent’s current population is estimated to be as low as 415,000 — a decline of more than 100,000 since 2007.

However, it is not all bad news.

On December 31, 2017, China’s legal ivory trade ground to a standstill. China is thought to be the world’s largest consumer of ivory.

The move is in accordance with a 2015 announcement by Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama. Both leaders vowed to enact “near complete” ivory bans within their respective countries.

America’s came into effect in June 2016.

In November last year, Donald Trump’s administration announced it would lift the ban on importing elephant hunt trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, but after a political backlash, Mr Trump put the decision on hold.

The benefits of the 2015 decision are already starting to be felt.

Craig Millar, Head of Security and Field Operations for Big Life Foundation, told news.com.au: “Since China’s ban on ivory has come into effect we’ve seen not so much a drop in poaching, but a drop in prices.

“Kenya has been showing a steady decline in poaching for the last three years, and I’m hoping this year it will be a decline again. We reacted quite quickly to the most recent ivory poaching crisis so our elephant population is probably one of the least affected over the last five years.”

Mr Millar added that a drop in prices is only a good thing.

“Immediately after the announcement, we saw prices drop by as much as 50 to 60 per cent. And that just means the poacher on the ground here is getting way less than anyone at the end of the supply chain, so there’s even less incentive for him to risk his life.

“China seems to have a pretty firm hold of what’s going on, and the government deciding against something seems to be pretty readily accepted.”

All that aside, the poaching crisis has left is scars in Kenya, and the people working on the front line of conservation are not exempt.

“There are two scenes that have stuck with me,” Mr Millar said. “There was one, where six elephants were killed in a single poaching incident. A whole family basically mowed down, and one of those happened to be a pregnant female. And just the other day I was flying, and I saw a baby elephant less than a month old get killed; not for its ivory, that was more a case of senseless human wildlife conflict. Those are the worst things I’ve ever seen on the job.”

In addition to being faced with such brutal scenes, Mr Millar and his team place their lives on the line on a daily basis to protect Big Life’s animals. The foundation currently manages an area just under two million acres.

“There are lots of times you feel personally threatened doing this job ... but we’ve been very lucky as we’ve never lost a ranger to a poacher, we’ve just had injuries,” he said.

The biggest impact has been on the animals themselves. The poaching crisis has brought around significant behavioural shifts.

Mr Millar has seen Big Life’s resident big tusker “One Ton” hide his tusks from human gaze by shoving his head into a bush on more than one occasion.

“They’re very clever. I’ve seen a number of other changes in the animals that can be attributed to poaching. Their behaviour changes drastically depending on which area they’re in. They know where they’re safe, and they’ll be very relaxed; One Ton in particular, you can almost touch if he’s in the right place. But you find him elsewhere, and he’s much more nervous. It goes to the extent when if an elephant has been killed, all other elephants will move away from the area for the next couple of days, even if they weren’t in the immediate vicinity — they pass that message along.”

It doesn’t stop there. If a bigger, older animal does get killed, it impacts the population for generations.

“Taking out an older female in a herd is taking out their knowledge store. Elephants teach their young for 20-30 years, and a female will be 40, close to 50, before she’s ready to take on that role as a matriarch. If you lose your top two or three females in a herd, suddenly the survivors aren’t going to know where to find water in the dry season, where the best forage is, how to protect each other.

“Males are hugely affected in that they bred right up until their old age. They only slowdown in the last four to five years of their life. Taking out those big males means suddenly you’re getting immature males breeding, and passing on an inferior gene pool because they haven’t really proven themselves.”

While China’s ban on ivory has had a positive impact, the plight of the African elephant is far from over. Human wildlife conflict is still a very real threat.

“The recent incident involving the baby elephant is an example. A lot of our rangers’ time is now spent dealing with keeping elephants out of farms, or people out of areas where the animals are likely to be dangerous,” Mr Millar explained.

“We’re looking at land-use plans, and implementing large scale electrified fencing of areas. The fences have to be electric, it’s the only thing that stops elephants, and the fences have to be a specific design as well. It’s hugely expensive. It’s about $A13.8 per km, we’ve done about 60 kms now, and we’re looking at doing at least another 100 kms in the next two years. Sadly, the biggest problem facing nearly everyone in conservation is funds.”

Couple finds $1.8 million lottery ticket while cleaning before Thanksgiving,https://www.today.com/news/couple-finds-1-8m-lottery-ticket-while-cleaning-thanksgiving-t143493,"A couple made their house and their bank account look like a million bucks while cleaning up ahead of having family over for Thanksgiving.

Tina and Harold Ehrenberg were prepping their home in Mandeville, Louisiana, for Thanksgiving festivities when they found some old lottery tickets on the nightstand — including a winner worth $1.8 million.

The couple found the winning Louisiana Lottery ticket just in time, too, as it was set to expire in two weeks. The lucky ticket was from the June 6 drawing, and prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the drawing.

""The most fun is going to be depositing that check,"" Harold Ehrenberg told NBC affiliate WDSU.

No word on whether the couple has been playing the same numbers for 25 years — like this man — or accidentally bought the wrong ticket and won anyway — hey, it's happened — but it all added up to some good fortune.

The Ehrenbergs went online to check the numbers on the lottery's website and found out it was going to be a very happy Thanksgiving.

They will receive $1,274,313 after taxes, which they said they plan to put away for retirement.

""We don’t have any plans to buy anything crazy or go on any big trips,” Tina Ehrenberg said."
Wisconsin Church Hosts Thanksgiving for LGBTQ People Who Can’t Go Home,https://www.advocate.com/news/2019/11/29/wisconsin-church-hosts-thanksgiving-lgbtq-people-who-cant-go-home,"A local advocacy group organized the free event to give LGBTQ people rejected by their biological families a place to go.

A church in Beloit, Wis., hosted its third annual Thanksgiving dinner for LGBTQ locals who may be unable to celebrate with their biological families.

The free event was organized by the Yellow Brick Road advocacy group and held at the First Congregational Church in Beloit, a city of about 30,000 people in southern Wisconsin.

Yellow Brick Road organizers told the local CNN affiliate that they held the event to give LGBTQ people rejected by their biological families a place to go. “They can’t go home to their families because of who they choose to be so we give them a safe place to come have dinner and meet new people,” said Yellow Brick Road president Jen Schuler.

“Having someone not accept you is really hard but when it’s someone as close with your family it’s much harder,” added Yellow Brick Road leader Marilyn Schuh.

“We all deserve a place at a Thanksgiving table where we feel loved and accepted. Thanksgiving is about coming together and giving thanks for those people we love in our life. We couldn't think of anyone else we would rather spend this day with than you!” reads the event’s description on Facebook.

Organizers told the CNN affiliate that the event has grown over the years to include straight allies too.

""This is about equal rights. This is about being a human and having human decency towards one another,” said Schuler.

Yellow Brick Road hosts a number of other yearly events, including a costume ball in the spring and Pridefest in the summer.

Events like these can help LGBTQ people feel connected and supported in the face of ostracism. In a 2013 Pew survey, about four in ten LGBTQ people reported being rejected by a friend or family member. LGBTQ youth are at a much higher risk of becoming homeless.

And lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults who reported high levels of teenage rejection from parents were more likely to have attempted suicide, to have depression, and to use drugs than those who didn’t, according to a study published in Pediatrics in 2009."

The need for supplies in food banks around the country has surged, as millions of people are now out of work due to coronavirus. More than 22 million Americans are estimated to have filed unemployment applications since the pandemic began — with many still waiting for their first payment, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis of unemployment claims data from the U.S. Department of Labor.



""Within the past month, we have seen an absolutely uptick of people that are now furloughed or unemployed,"" Dr. Jessica Rosati, chief program officer at food bank Long Island Cares in New York, recently told CBS News. ""So, that's a newer face that we're seeing at the food bank.""

Feeding America, which is the largest hunger-relief organization in the U.S., said that before the coronavirus crisis there were 37 million people in the nation who did not have enough food. The number is now expected to increase by an additional 17 million."
Woman finds her corgi comforting grieving stranger in the airport,https://www.today.com/pets/woman-finds-her-corgi-comforting-grieving-stranger-airport-t123460,"Madison Palm has always known her dog Cora is special. It's why she's having Cora trained and certified as a therapy dog; it's why she always travels with her.

""She is very empathetic and in tune with my needs, yet she is so incredibly independent,"" Palm told TODAY.

The 23-year-old was still surprised, and deeply moved, by something Cora did when the two were recently flying from their home in Idaho to Alaska to visit Palm's mother.

On a layover at the Seattle airport, Cora approached a man who was sitting by himself near their gate.

""Before I could even call her she was already at his feet being loved on. I asked him if she was bothering him,"" Palm said. ""And with a somber face and watery eyes he said, 'No, no. I lost my dog last night.'""

Palm was deeply moved that her dog Cora seemed to know just who needed her attention. @the.corgi.cora

Cora stayed with the man for a little while. Palm, who lives in Coeur d’Alene in northern Idaho, recalls the man scratched behind Cora's ears, petted her and whispered to her about how cute she is. It was a profoundly emotional encounter to witness.

""I truly think she has a gift. She knows who is hurting and she knows who needs her,"" she said. ""Once he told me that his dog passed away I looked at Cora and I thought to myself, 'You are so amazing. How did I get so lucky?'""

""Totally the kind of dog she is — she will walk up to a crying child and try to lick them and rub her head on them. She lives for making people happy again,"" Palm said of Cora. @the.corgi.cora

This is how: Cora has lived with Palm since last summer. Palm, who is a deputy assessor title clerk at her county's Department of Motor Vehicles, was in the break room at work. A co-worker was browsing Facebook on her phone and told Palm she'd seen a post about a corgi who was killing a family's chickens and was therefore being given away to the first person who came for her.

Palm left work right away to meet the dog. She learned the dog was underfed and had been kept outside for nearly her whole life. She'd had many litters of puppies.

""Cora had never been to a vet,"" Palm said. ""She didn’t have a cute collar or a shiny tag with her name on it. The little food that she received was her owners' scraps, which were thrown into the yard for her.""

Palm already had another dog and knew her landlord wouldn't allow two. She'd have to find a new place to live if she took in Cora, but Palm felt she couldn't leave the dog behind.

On the drive home, Cora crawled into Palm's lap ""and she never looked back,"" Palm said.

""Cora has taught me the true meaning of unconditional love and forgiveness in a way that no person could have explained,"" said Palm. @the.corgi.cora

Cora's ears were infected, her teeth were rotted and the water turned black when she got her first bath. But her personality was, and is, sweet and loving.

""She just wants to be loved on and held all day long,"" said Palm. ""She is always right next to me and always keeps a close eye if she’s not. If I’m not available she’ll pick the next closest lap to sit in.""

They found a new place to live. The dogs both like it; they've got a yard.

Cora, who is becoming a therapy dog through the American Kennel Club's canine good citizen program, is a great comfort to Palm. She helps her with anxiety. Palm says Cora ""helps me stay calm in chaos.""

Cora celebrated her 8th birthday on Nov. 1. Palm gave Cora ""the canned version of her dog food and tried to make a little cake for her with a candle that said 8,"" she said. @the.corgi.cora

It had been seven months of feeling amazed by Cora's capacity for forgiveness and for love. Then Cora reached out to this grieving stranger in an airport, and Palm was astonished all over again by this dog, who early in her life wasn't given a lot of reasons to trust or even like humans, but still does.

""I am blown away by her on a daily basis. Who knew a dog who was unloved for 7 1/2 years could have so much love to give?"" Palm said. ""I can’t change her past but I’m doing everything I can to make up for it."""
Rapper Logic released a song titled 1-800-273-8255 and it increased suicide prevention calls by 50%.,http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/logic_mtv_vmas_2017_suicide_prevention,"Logic's inspiring VMAs performance of “1-800-273-8255,” a courageous song about the rapper's own struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, reportedly prompted a 50-percent uptick in calls to suicide prevention hotlines.

As reported by the FADER, the rapper took the stage at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards with artists Alessia Cara and Khalid, surrounded by suicide attempt survivors, to make a public plea for mental health awareness and suicide prevention with the tune from his recent album, Everybody. The empathetic performance apparently moved the needle, as the the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a reported 50-percent increase in calls.

“It's not just about the calls,” John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, tells CNN about Logic's VMAs showing. “It's about increasing awareness about suicide, and suicide prevention in particular. The calls don't even begin to count the number of people who, just by listening to the song and hearing the lyrics, feel more hopeful and less alone.”

“This past year, our audience was forced to say goodbye to musicians too soon because of suicide,” says the VMAs' executive producer Garret English, alluding to the recent deaths of both Linkin Park's Chester Bennington and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell. “We want to do more than remember these artists. We want to remind people that suicide is preventable and that there are ways to get help and feel better if you're struggling emotionally.”

Logic joins a growing list of musicians helping to push mental health issues to the collective fore, including recent exhortations from bands such as Foo Fighters, and artists like Real Friends' Dan Lambton and Clown from Slipknot.

Maine becomes the first state to ban Styrofoam,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/us/maine-ban-styrofoam-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Food containers made of Styrofoam, also known as polystyrene, will be officially banned from businesses in Maine after governor Janet Mills signed a bill into law Tuesday.

The law, which will go into effect January 1, 2021, prohibits restaurants, caterers, coffee shops and grocery stores from using the to-go foam containers because they cannot be recycled in Maine.

Maine has become the first state to take such a step as debate about banning plastic bags or other disposable products is spreading across the nation.

While states like New York and California have banned single-use plastic bags, others such as Tennessee and Florida have made it illegal for local municipalities to regulate them.

Maryland's legislature also has approved bills to ban polystyrene , but it's unclear whether Republican Gov. Larry Hogan will sign the legislation. Democratic Delegate Brooke Lierman, the primary sponsor of the Maryland House bill, said banning foam products was the first step to curbing people's reliance on single-use plastics.

""Polystyrene cannot be recycled like a lot of other products, so while that cup of coffee may be finished, the Styrofoam cup it was in is not,"" Mills said in a statement to CNN affiliate WMTW. ""In fact, it will be around for decades to come and eventually it will break down into particles, polluting our environment, hurting our wildlife, and even detrimentally impacting our economy.""

The Maine law, originally proposed by Rep. Stanley Zeigler (D-Montville), also applies to plastic beverage stirrers.

Those who violate the law could face a fine of up to $100, News Center Maine reports

""Maine has proven itself an environmental leader once again, this time in eliminating disposable foam containers that have become a common, costly, and deadly form of plastic pollution,"" said Sarah Lakeman, Sustainable Maine Director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM), in a statement.

""With the threats posed by plastic pollution becoming more apparent, costly, and even deadly to wildlife, we need to be doing everything possible to limit our use and better manage our single-use plastics — starting with eliminating the use of unnecessary forms like plastic foam.""

The NRCM reports that plastic foam food containers are among the top 10 most commonly littered items in the US.

More than 256 million pieces of disposable foam cups, plates, bowls, platters, and trays are used every year in Maine, the NRCM says.

Some 15 towns in the state have already banned foam food containers, it says.

The reason why Styrofoam is difficult to clean up is that it easily breaks into smaller pieces, according to Ashley Van Stone, executive director of Trash Free Maryland.

Foam also absorbs toxins faster than other plastics and is mistaken for food by marine life, Van Stone said. And the toxins that wildlife consumes makes its way up the food chain into people."

A blood test to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease has been developed.,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/01/health/alzheimers-blood-test-study-intl/index.html,"(CNN) A team of scientists from Australia and Japan has developed a blood test to detect early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

The noninvasive test was developed to detect the presence of the toxic protein amyloid beta, known to be present in people affected by the disease, and did so with 90% accuracy, according to the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature

The team trialed the test on 121 patients from Japan and 252 from Australia with varying levels of health, ranging from healthy to mild cognitive impairments or Alzheimer's disease.

The idea behind the test is to predict the presence and levels of amyloid beta in a person's brain. Buildup of the abnormal protein in the brain is one sign of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia.

Other teams have developed similar tests to detect Alzheimer's, with one 2017 study proving to have 86% sensitivity and specificity.

""This test is at least as good as current brain scan techniques and far surpasses existing blood tests,"" said Colin Masters, professor of dementia research at Melbourne's Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, who led the study.

But the researchers cautioned that they were still far from practical clinical application.

The onset of Alzheimer's can come as early as 30 years before the patient experiences any symptoms, such as memory loss.

There is no concrete test to determine early onset of dementia, and patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed based on a careful evaluation using brain scans and concise mental testing, according to the Alzheimer's Society UK.

The study used blood samples from patients to detect levels of the toxic protein in the blood and in turn predict how much of it is in the brain.

There is no treatment available for Alzheimer's disease, but early detection can speed access to therapy.

""Progress in developing new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease has been disappointingly slow. None of the three drugs currently on the market treat the underlying disease,"" Masters said in a statement.

The team highlights that more research needs to be conducted across a wider population to make the results more conclusive -- and applicable clinically.

""This is not a blood test for dementia that people who are worried about their memory and concentration should be asking their doctors about,"" said Rob Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at University College London, who was not involved in the study. ""Not everyone with amyloid in their brains will turn out to have dementia, and not everyone who has dementia will be found to have amyloid in their brains.""

In the UK, there are more than 520,000 people affected by the disease, costing £26.3 billion, according to the Alzheimer's Society.

Though the new study provides a breakthrough in research, it is performed only in laboratories in Japan, where it will take up to a year to conform it to a level suitable to distribute to other laboratories and apply it to clinical trials.

""We need to see whether the test works in a larger population, but it has the potential both to speed up clinical trials and help people in the very early stages of Alzheimer's to access new treatments if and when they become available,"" said Doug Brown, policy and research officer at the Alzheimer's Society UK.

Carol Routledge, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said that ""further work with more people will need to build on this study to understand how well this approach could predict those who will go on to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's in the future."""
Black leopard spotted in Africa for first time in 100 years.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/02/rare-black-panther-spotted-in-africa-century,"The headline was updated on February 13 to clarify that this is the first scientifically documented sighting since 1909.

They say that black cats bring bad luck, but when Nick Pilfold heard about one lurking around central Kenya, he knew he was onto something special.

The Kenya-based biologist and his team deployed a set of camera traps throughout the bushlands of Loisaba Conservancy in early 2018. It wasn't long before he got what he was looking for: undeniable proof of a super-rare melanistic leopard.

Remote cameras confirm rare black leopards living in Kenya San Diego Zoo Global researchers have confirmed the presence of rare black leopards living in Laikipia County, Kenya.

Footage Provider: San Diego Zoo

The juvenile female was spotted traveling with a larger, normally colored leopard, presumed to be her mother. (See our exclusive picture of a rare black wildcat seen in Africa.)

The opposite of albinism, melanism is the result of a gene that causes a surplus of pigment in the skin or hair of an animal so that it appears black. Melanistic leopards have been reported in and around Kenya for decades, but scientific confirmation of their existence remains quite rare.

Published in January in the African Journal of Ecology, these photos represent the first scientific documentation of such a creature in Africa in nearly a century.

As recently as 2017, only a single sighting had been confirmed—a 1909 photograph taken in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and stored in the collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Their range across much of the continent has shrunk by at least 66 percent due to habitat loss and prey decline.

""Almost everyone has a story about seeing one, it's such a mythical thing,"" says Pilfold, of San Diego Zoo Global's Institute for Conservation Research.

""Even when you talk to the older guys that were guides in Kenya many years ago, back when hunting was legal [in the 1950s and ‘60s], there was a known thing that you didn't hunt black leopards. If you saw them, you didn't take it.""

Life in the shade

There are nine leopard subspecies ranging from Africa all the way to eastern Russia. And while 11 percent of leopards alive today are thought to be melanistic, says Pilfold, most are found in Southeast Asia, where tropical forests offer an abundance of shade.

It's thought that melanism provides additional camouflage in those habitats, giving the predators an advantage when it comes to hunting, says Vincent Naude, leopard genetic forensics project coordinator for the nonprofit Panthera, who was not involved with this research.

But in Kenya, black leopards, sometimes referred to as ""black panthers”—an umbrella term that refers to any big cat with a black coat—seem to occur in semi-arid shrubland.

""Our leopards live in savannah-type environments, so having that extra melanism doesn't give them an adaptive advantage,"" says Naude. Even still, given their nocturnal lifestyle, a bit of additional pigmentation certainly doesn't hurt. (Also see ""'Strawberry' Leopard Discovered—A First."")

See How a Leopard Stealthily Stalks Its Prey Watch as Hosana, a young male leopard, sharpens his camouflage skills in the Sabi Sands.

The fact the young female was traveling with her mother also suggests that her unique coloration hasn't had an impact on familial bonding, Pilfold notes.

Comical coincidence

After hearing about Pilfold's findings, staff at Ol Ari Nyiro Conservancy—30 miles west of Loisaba—turned up a high-quality image of a second black leopard, taken in May 2007.

Since that photo is more than a decade older, the researchers conclude it must be of a different individual, which suggests black panthers are more prevalent in Kenya than in other African countries.

But African black panthers are still so rare that researchers don't even know if the genetic mutation responsible for the dark pigmentation is the same one that underlies melanism in Southeast Asian leopards.

Pilfold adds it’s curious that the fictional country of Wakanda, home of the superhero Black Panther, is located in East Africa, fairly close to Kenya."

Gorilla hugging man who saved her life wins Photographer of the Year,http://metro.co.uk/2018/02/13/gorilla-hugging-man-saved-life-picture-wins-wildlife-photographer-year-award-7308593/?ito=cbshare,"The People’s Choice award in the Natural History Museum’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition went to this photo of a lowland gorilla and the man who saved her (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

A tender hug between a lowland gorilla and the man who saved her life has been crowned the winner of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year People’s Choice award.

Photographer Jo-Anne McArthur took the photo in Cameroon, as the rescued gorilla – named Pikin – was being moved between animal sanctuaries.

Guard attacked with 'sharp tool' outside French Embassy in Saudi Arabia

Pikin had been captured by poachers to be sold for bushmeat but luckily, charity group Ape Action Africa stepped in at the last minute.

Primate poaching, which is rife in Cameroon, sees hunters slaughter wild animals in order to sell their meat both in their country of origin and abroad.

Baby apes are often left orphaned after their mothers are killed and either die in the wild or are sold on as pets.

Pikin was being moved to a new enclosure within a safe forest sanctuary but woke up during her transfer when her sedation wore off.

Luckily, she woke up in the arms of her caretaker, Appolinaire Ndohoudou, a man she shared a particular bond with.

Like Pikin, Appolinaire was forced from his home, having fled Chad because of a civil war.

As he rebuilt his life in Cameroon, his work in protecting wild animals revived his appreciation for the natural world.

Jo-Anne captured the moment the two travelled together – which became the winning photo chosen by the public in the competition run by the Natural History Museum.

It was chosen from a shortlist of 24, selected by staff at the museum from almost 50,000 entries.

The picture will now be showcased in the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition at the Museum until it closes on May 28.

The finalists

Sloth hanging out by Luciano Candisani (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Luciano Candisani had to climb the cecropia tree, in the protected Atlantic rainforest of southern Bahia, Brazil, to take an eye-level shot of this three-toed sloth.

Sloths like to feed on the leaves of these trees and so they are often seen high up in the canopy.

Elegant mother and calf by Ray Chin (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Every year from July to late October southern humpback whales migrate north from their Antarctic feeding grounds to give birth in the warm sheltered waters off Tonga.

Ray encountered this humpback mother and calf peacefully floating in the plankton-filled water around the island group of Vava’u, Tonga.

After Ray gently approached them, the giants swam a bit closer to have alook at him and he captured this shot as they turned around.

Roller rider by Lakshitha Karunarathna (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Lakshitha was on safari in MaasaiMara National Reserve, Kenya, when he spotted a lilac-breasted roller riding a zebra.

Normally they prefer to perch high up in the foliage, but this roller spent an hour or more riding around and enjoying the occasional insect meal.

Lakshitha waited for the surrounding zebras to form the perfect background before taking this tight crop.

Warm embrace by Debra Garside (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

When polar bear mothers and cubs emerge from their dens in the early spring, the cubs stay close to their mothers for warmth and protection.

Once the cubs are strong and confident enough, they make the trek to the sea ice with their mother so that she can resume hunting for seals.

Debra waited six days near the den of this family, in Wapusk National Park, Manitoba, Canada, before they finally emerged.

She risked frostbite in freezing conditions to capture the shot.

Chinese movie legend Chow Yun-fat says he plans to give his entire net worth, a whopping $5.6 billion HKD (that’s $714 million USD) to charity. “My dream is to be a happy and normal person,” Yun-fat recently told Hong Kong movie site Jayne Stars. “The hardest thing in life is not about how much money you earn, but how to keep a peaceful mindset and live the rest of your life in a simple and carefree manner.” The same site reported earlier that the actor claimed to spend only $800 HKD ($102 USD) per month.

Apparently, he stays frugal by taking public transportation as often as possible and doing charity work instead of spending it on himself. He also had a Nokia phone for 17 years (we can only assume it’s a flip phone), and only upgraded to a smart phone recently, when his Nokia one stopped working. He shops at discount clothing stores, because, he said: “I don’t wear clothes for other people. As long as I think it’s comfortable, then it’s good enough for me.”

A repeat player in John Woo films such as “A Better Tomorrow,” “The Killer,” and “Hard Boiled,” Yun-fat is best known to U.S. audiences for his role in Ang Lee’s martial arts film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” which won Best Foreign Language Film at the 2000 Academy Awards. Yun-fat played Li Mu Bai opposite Michelle Yeoh (“Crazy Rich Asians”) as Yu Shu Lien.

"Stan Lee's Missing Dog Found, Returned by NFL Legend Jim Brown",http://www.syracuse.com/sports/index.ssf/2018/03/jim_brown_stan_lee_dog.html,"Syracuse football legend Jim Brown has played an action hero in movies, but he's also a hero in real life to the man behind some of the biggest superheroes in comics history.

TMZ reports Stan Lee, the co-creator of Marvel characters like Daredevil, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Black Panther, X-Men and the Fantastic Four, lost his dog last week. Sources say the 95-year-old comics legend's mini Pomeranian, Charlotte, got loose in the Los Angeles area and had been missing for several days.

Lee's team posted ""Lost Dog"" flyers around his Hollywood Hills neighborhood, but hadn't heard anything for several days.

Brown, who lives about a mile away from Lee, and his wife Monique found Charlotte in their yard with no collar. They contacted several neighbors and took the pooch to a vet, but had no luck.

""The Browns then went old school and canvassed several neighborhoods and BAM,"" TMZ wrote. ""They saw the posters, called the number and just like that, Charlotte was reunited with Stan.""

That's good news for Lee, who's had a rough year. His wife of 69 years died in July; he was accused of sexually harassing nurses in January; $1.4 million went missing in a possible financial elder abuse case; and he was hospitalized last month due to pneumonia and other health issues.

It's unclear if there'll be a reward for Brown, an NFL Hall of Famer who excelled in football, basketball, track and field, and lacrosse while at Syracuse University. Maybe the 82-year-old No. 44 can get a role in a Marvel superhero movie; he's got acting experience in films like ""The Dirty Dozen,"" ""The Running Man,"" ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"" and ""Any Given Sunday."""

""We're in a particularly challenging time not just for this health crisis, this physical health crisis, but also a potential mental health crisis as well,"" course creator Laurie Santos, a Yale psychology professor, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour this week.

The course went online for free about two years ago under the name ""The Science of Well Being,"" according to the Yale Daily News. Anyone can audit the course for free, and $49 lets you complete assignments, submit them for a grade and earn a certificate of completion.

Although in-person social connections matter, Santos says the good news from science is that much of happiness stems from cultivating healthy practices and routines.

And the dramatic reorientation of your life might actually give you an opportunity in the coming weeks to rethink your daily rituals and therefore rewire your brain toward a happier life.

"Guy sacrifices Tesla to save unconscious driver, Elon Musk offers to cover repair costs",http://mashable.com/2017/02/16/tesla-driver-saves-another-driver/#GaTtfoqVLqqH,"It feels good to be the hero, and for the driver that exposed his Tesla (and himself) to danger in order to save another driver, it won't even be very costly.

According to Muenchner Merkur (via Jalopnik), 41-year-old Manfred Kick was driving his Tesla Model S when he noticed a man in a Volkswagen driving erratically on the Autobahn near Munich, Germany. When Kick realized the man was unconscious, he pulled in front of the Volkswagen and slowly braked until both cars came to a stop.

He then entered the Volkswagen and gave the man first aid, while some people who stopped called emergency services. The man, who appeared to have suffered a stroke, was taken to the hospital and is stable, the German police said Tuesday.

Walt Disney Company to eliminate plastic straws and more by 2019,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Travel/walt-disney-company-eliminate-plastic-straws-2019/story?id=56812530,"Walt Disney Company to eliminate plastic straws and more by 2019 Here's what travelers can expect in the coming years.

The Walt Disney Company is set to eliminate single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all its owned and operated locations across the globe by mid-2019, the company announced Thursday. This includes all parks with the exception of Disney Tokyo.

That elimination amounts to a reduction of more than 175 million straws and 13 million stirrers annually, the company said.

The move comes on the heels of an announcement from Starbucks earlier this month that would phase out single-use plastic straws from its more than 28,000 stores worldwide by 2020.

“Eliminating plastic straws and other plastic items are meaningful steps in our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship,” said Bob Chapek, Chairman, Disney Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products. “These new global efforts help reduce our environmental footprint, and advance our long-term sustainability goals.”

For patrons of Disney hotels and Disney cruise ships, there are additional changes coming.

Over the next several years there will be a transition to refillable in-room amenities, a move that is expected to reduce plastic by 80 percent, the company estimates.

The company also said they will reduce the number of single-use plastic shopping bags in owned and operated parks and on cruise ships, offering guests the option to purchase reusable bags.

“Disney has always been inspired by nature -- and it is a uniquely powerful brand that inspires, educates, and entertains, all at the same time,” said Dr. M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, a non-profit with which Disney has collaborated on environmental and sustainability initiatives.

“Today’s announcement is more than about reducing single-use plastic waste, it’s also about showing millions of kids and adults from around the world the many ways we can change our daily habits to care for the oceans and protect nature that sustains us all,"" Sanjayan said. ""It also builds on Disney’s longstanding commitment to conservation and environmental stewardship, a legacy that stretches from the highlands of Peru to the islands of the South Pacific.”

In addition to the Walt Disney Company and Starbucks, McDonald's announced in June that it would scrap plastic straws from restaurant locations in the U.K. and Ireland and replace them with paper straws, starting in September. Vail Resorts, owner of Northstar, Heavenly and Kirkwood at Lake Tahoe and sister resorts in Colorado, Utah, British Columbia, Vermont and the Midwest, has also banned plastic straws.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis told a group of children with autism and spectrum disorders Monday that they are beautiful, unique flowers in the eyes of God.

Francis met with members of an Austrian center for autism, Sonnenschein (“Sunshine”), in an audience at the Vatican. He told them that the center’s name evoked a flower-filled lawn in the sun “and the flowers of this house are you!”

Speaking to the children, their parents and caregivers from the center, Francis said: “God created the world with a great variety of flowers of all different colors. Each flower has its unique beauty. And each one of us is beautiful in the eyes of God, who loves us.”

Francis has a particular soft spot for children, allowing himself even amid coronavirus social distancing protocols to greet and pat them on the head during his public audiences.

He has frequently met with groups of children and parents who are experiencing difficulties in caring for them, hoping to encourage them through sickness, disability, poverty and other challenges."
Hospitals Sued to Keep Prices Secret. They Lost. - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/upshot/hospitals-lost-price-transparency-lawsuit.html,"A federal judge has upheld a Trump administration policy that requires hospitals and health insurers to publish their negotiated prices for health services, numbers that are typically kept secret.

The policy is part of a major push by the administration to improve transparency in health care. Insurers and health providers usually negotiate deals behind closed doors, and patients rarely know the cost of services until after the fact.

Administration officials said more price transparency would lead to lower and more predictable prices in an industry that has huge ranges in what insurers pay for services. A simple blood test, for example, can cost $11 or $1,000. Coronavirus tests show a similar variation, with prices from $27 to $2,315.

But in a lawsuit, the American Hospital Association said the administration did not have the legal authority to require the publication of negotiated prices, arguing that the publication of the prices could have perverse effects. On Tuesday, the judge, Carl Nichols, disagreed."
"A 6th-grade teacher wrote 'Invite me to your Harvard graduation!' -- 21 years later, the student did just that",https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/25/us/teacher-harvard-graduation-21-year-old-note-trnd/index.html,"A sixth-grade teacher from Yuma, Arizona, Toensing made a strong impact on one of her students 21 years ago.

At the end of the school year in 1997, Mrs. Toensing, wrote a note on the student's report card: ""It has been a joy to have you in class. Keep up the good work! Invite me to your Harvard graduation!.""

This week, the student, Christin Gilmer graduated from Harvard as a doctor of public health.

Gilmer who is now 33, was only 12 at the time, but she kept the message all these years.

""It meant a lot to me to know that outside my mom, someone who knew me so intimately believed in my dreams and my ability to accomplish them,"" Gilmer told CNN.

Gilmer, who wrote a thank you note prior to her graduation, said Toensing was the first person to encourage her in the journey of studying public health.

""Ms. Judy Toensing, taught me about current events, global health, and human rights. She was the first person who passionately conveyed the plight of people living with HIV/AIDS to me,"" the letter said.

This letter quickly grabbed the attention of school administrators, who decided to honor Toensing by inviting her to the 2018 Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's convocation, at no cost to her.

Mrs. Toensing and Gilmer's mom posed for a photo after the ceremony.

""You don't just teach young people. You inspire them, and you propel them along a path of fulfillment and service to others. Your work is what makes our work possible,"" Dean Williams said.

This came to a surprise to Toensing, who felt ""shocked, flabbergasted, humbled"" when she received the invitation from Harvard, which was personally delivered to her by Gilmer.

""I have high expectations of all my students, so to hear that Christin had achieved this goal did not surprise me in the least,"" Toensing told CNN. ""I feel honored that Harvard chose to tell Christin's story, her journey, and that I was a small part of that journey,"" she added.

Christin Gilmer received her doctor of public health degree on May 23, 2018.

Gilmer who got her master's degree in public health at Columbia University, says that Toensing always encouraged her students to think of ways to help others.

""She lit a fire in me that helping people is a powerful tool, and through education, you can better serve populations in need. I will never forget her passion for others,"" Gilmer told CNN.

As a student in Toensing's class, she and others wrote a 100-page advertisement, interviewed the mayor and envisioned how recycling could work in their town 15 years before it actually happened, and helping others is something she plans to focus on.

""I would love return to southern Arizona to work in health, politics, and community development,"" Gilmer said. ""I wanted to learn from the best institutions in the world so that I could bring back the knowledge and skills I have obtained and share them with the communities from which I came.""

Toensing, who says this experience revitalized and energized her to become a better teacher for her students, praised all the hard work Gilmer has done and believes this is just the beginning of a great future.

""She has many more miles to go, I know with her tenacity, her dedication, and her passion for helping humanity, she will be highly successful and that we will all be the better for knowing her,"" Toensing said.

Toensing, who taught Gilmer all her sixth-grade subjects, now teaches sixth- and eighth-grade Social Studies."
Hawaii Seems Poised To Ban Coral-Damaging Sunscreen: It would be the first state to prohibit the use of sunscreen containing ingredients that scientists say harm sea life.,http://www.civilbeat.org/2018/04/hawaii-seems-poised-to-ban-coral-damaging-sunscreen/,"Environmental groups and lawmakers gathered Wednesday at the Capitol in support of a bill to ban coral-damaging sunscreens.

Senate Bill 2571 would prohibit the sale of sunscreen with oxybenzone and octinoxate without a prescription. Although coral bleaching is mainly caused by the warming of ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification, research shows the chemicals can also bleach corals and inhibit the growth of sea life.

The bill is headed next to conference committee, where representatives from both chambers will try to hammer out differences in the versions that have been approved.

Nathan Eagle/Civil Beat

Samples of eco-friendly sunscreen were handed out. The stage was decorated with buckets of reef-toxic sunscreen that a group of Kaiser High School students took from Hanauma Bay visitors in exchange for reef-safe sunscreen.

More than half of Hawaii Island’s coral is bleached, said Elyssa Farmer of the Maui Ocean Center. The same is true for more than 40 percent of West Maui corals and 30 percent of those on Oahu. Fish, seaweed and other food sources have been contaminated with sunscreen chemicals, she said.

Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted Farmer as saying that half of the state’s coral is bleached.

On Maui alone, it’s estimated that 55 gallons of sunscreen are dumped into the water every day. No sunscreen is good for reefs, but some ingredients are worse than others, said Craig Downs, a scientist who tested water samples at Hanauma Bay.

His test results indicated sunscreen levels were high in the bay, “very close to the point of no return,” he said. Dead reefs could degrade to rubble and sand. Hawaii’s reputation as a tourism destination could be marred without sea life and reefs, he said.

“The weather’s great in California, too,” Downs said. “Hawaii has a lot to lose.”

Sen. Mike Gabbard, equipped with a guitar and harmonica, was on hand to sing a brief song about banning oxybenzone. Gabbard introduced SB 2571.

Despite pushback from the cosmetic industry and dermatologists, Sen. Will Espero said Hawaii is poised to make history as the first state to ban sunscreen with hazardous chemicals.

Rep. Nicole Lowen, who has previously introduced similar legislation, said a fifth of the world’s coral is dead. Ninety percent of reefs could be dead in 30 years, she said.

Lowen said her district, west Hawaii Island, once had the healthiest and most vibrant reefs in the state. The difference is palpable since the world’s last major bleaching event a few years ago.

“We have to do everything we can to prevent this from happening,” she said.

Rep. Gene Ward, a member of the House conference committee, warned participants to be wary of any last-minute changes to the bill. He compared the month of April in the legislative session to the Bermuda triangle.

“Be alert, be sober,” he said. “It ain’t over yet.”

Promising new ALS treatment funded by Ice Bucket Challenge donations shows significant slowing in phase 2 trial,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-treatment-may-help-slow-progression-als-research-shows-n1239144,"An experimental medication may slow the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, researchers reported Wednesday. The research was supported in part by donations from the Ice Bucket Challenge, the social media sensation that raised more than $200 million worldwide.

The drug is not a cure, but it may help slow the inexorable disability caused by ALS, which rapidly destroys the nerve cells that control the muscles that allow us to move, speak, eat and even breathe.

""Patients keep telling me their No. 1 goal is to be able to retain physical function for as long as possible,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Sabrina Paganoni, a neuromuscular specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital's Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS. ""They want to be able to continue to walk and to use their hands.""

About 20,000 people in the U.S. have ALS at any given time, according to the ALS Association. It usually strikes between the ages of 40 and 70. Once symptoms set in, life expectancy is two to six years, on average.

The treatment studied by Paganoni and her colleagues targets two cellular structures damaged by the disease: the mitochondria, which are the cells' power plants, and the endoplasmic reticulum, the cellular dump trucks that cart away waste that can gunk up the cells' machinery.

The multicenter, randomized, double-blind study is the second step — a phase 2 trial — in a three-step process required by the Food and Drug Administration for drug approval. In a double-blind study, neither the patients nor the researchers know who is receiving the drug. If a phase 2 study generates positive results, the FDA typically requires a larger and longer phase 3 trial.

To test the effectiveness of the two-drug combination, the researchers recruited 137 ALS patients who had become symptomatic within the previous 18 months. About two-thirds of the patients (89) received the drug, while the remaining third were given a placebo.

Participants were evaluated on a scale of 0 to 48, measuring the disabilities caused by the disease.

""By the time they entered the trial, on average, patients had already lost 12 points. Their baseline score was about 36, on average,"" Paganoni said. ""Each question addresses a specific domain of function and is scored on a scale from zero to four.""

For example, for walking:

4 = Normal

3 = Early ambulation difficulties

2 = Walks with assistance

1 = Nonambulatory functional movement only

0 = No purposeful leg movement

During the six months of the study, patients taking the medication lost an average of 2.32 points less than those receiving placebos, a 25 percent better functional outcome.

""A 2- to 3-point change can mean the difference between being able to do an activity independently or with an assistance device,"" Paganoni said.

The trial did not show a difference between medication and placebo in outcomes such as time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent intubation, or hospitalization. But that may be because it ran for just six months.

Paganoni suspects that, if it is approved, the new drug would be just one part of a cocktail of medications that would help to keep ALS at bay.

Because the trial showed that the medication might make a difference, all participants were offered the opportunity to stay on it or, in the cases of those who were given placebos, to start on it. The Mass General researchers will track how the patients taking the medication do in the long term.

Paganoni credited the Ice Bucket Challenge for getting her study and others going.

""The Ice Bucket Challenge was an important turning point in the fight against ALS,"" she said. ""It put ALS on the map and raised awareness of the disease and attracted more investigators and investment to the research.""

With the good news from the trial, the ALS Association hopes to persuade the FDA to allow other patients to have access to the drug, even before phase 3 trial results are available.

""It's very unusual for an ALS clinical trial to hit its primary endpoint, so we're very excited about it,"" said Neil Thakur, chief mission officer for the ALS Association. ""It's the difference between being able to feed oneself versus being fed or needing versus not needing a wheelchair.""

ALS experts cautioned against rushing ahead without more data.

""The current data are definitely positive, but they need to be replicated,"" said Dr. Martina Wiedau-Pazos, a neurologist who is director of the ALS Clinic and Research Center at UCLA. ""This study has limitations, such as being small and lasting just six months. I think a phase 3 trial is needed, because, in the past, positive outcomes from phase 2 trials were not confirmed in phase 3 trials.""

Another issue is that the study included subjects who had more rapid disease progression than normal, said Dr. David Lacomis, chief of the neuromuscular division at UPMC in Pittsburgh. ""So it's unclear what the effects would be in the broader ALS population,"" Lacomis said via email.

While the new findings are promising, they are not ""earth shattering,"" said Dr. Erik Pioro, director of the section of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and related disorders at the Cleveland Clinic. ""But it does add credence to the idea that other pathways are playing significant roles in ALS pathogenesis.""

Results of the trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

"Thanks to better science and engineering, no one died in Friday's 7.0 earthquake in Anchorage, Alaska",https://www.adn.com/opinions/national-opinions/2018/12/02/heres-who-to-thank-that-we-all-survived-the-quake-on-friday/,"For the second time in 54 years, an earthquake damaged roads and buildings across Anchorage and shook people in a way few will ever forget.

The 1964 Good Friday earthquake and the quake Friday had many differences, starting with the wonderful fact that no one died this time (131 died in the ’64 quake). The geological differences are interesting and important too.

But one thing is the same. Like every big earthquake, they taught us who is really in charge. To the extent we listen to that lesson, we can protect ourselves and those who come after us.

That’s important, because we can be sure this wasn’t Anchorage’s last big earthquake. Indeed, 7.0 magnitude quakes are expected regularly on the Alaska-Aleutian Subduction Zone. The nearby location made the shaking so severe in Anchorage. Our number came up and it will again.

I don’t want to minimize what happened. It was big.

1 of 17 Full Screen Full Screen Autoplay Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Caption Buy This Photo Vine Road, south of Wasilla, was heavily damaged by an earthquake on November 30, 2018. (Marc Lester / ADN) Wait 1 second to continue.

The damage will be expensive. That begins with precious things that were broken. Survivors often say — as they should — that those are only material things, not comparable to the value of our safety in coming through without deaths or many serious injuries.

But irreplaceable things that are lost do count. It’s natural to grieve over a grandmother’s china or a now-grown child’s smashed artwork.

The financial expense will be significant too, and we’re only starting to understand that.

Roads, bridges and schools will be repaired with government funds, including emergency reserves and federal assistance. The rush of relief funds after the ’64 quake, which brought so much more damage, saved Alaska from an economic slump. We can use the construction jobs these days too.

For homeowners, the hit may be worse, even if the numbers are smaller. Damaged foundations and chimneys can be extremely expensive to repair. Many Alaskans don’t have earthquake insurance, and for those who do, deductibles are high.

Even though you dread looking, it’s worth locating that damage now. Having a home inspector find it a few years from now, when you are trying to sell your house, could compound the financial hit.

All that said, the impact of this earthquake is nothing like that of the quake 54 years ago, which released almost 2,000 times more energy. (It was a magnitude 9.2 quake, compared to magnitude 7 this time; the scale is logarithmic.)

The ’64 quake relocated a block of the Earth’s crust carrying Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula, an area 600 miles by 250 miles. The west side, near Seldovia, sank into the ocean, while the east side, at Montague Island, rose as much as 38 feet.

The rupture lasted more than 4 minutes, and the shaking people felt went on longer. After what happened Friday, you can understand how in ’64, some started believing the shaking would never stop — they thought the world was ending.

The ’64 quake liquefied soil under West Anchorage called Bootlegger Cove clay. It’s too soon to make firm statements about Friday’s quake, but records from ‘64 say the clay didn’t collapse until well into the shaking. This quake may not have lasted long enough for that to happen.

When the clay liquefied in ’64, buildings large and small went down. In the Turnagain area, houses slid into the sea. Downtown, Fourth Avenue split down the middle, with businesses on the north side going down the hill. In Government Hill, a school broke in half and fell into a hole.

“The motion in 1964 was very, very different,” said Mike West, Alaska’s state seismologist. “Not only did it last a long time, but it was also more like rolling waves on the ocean rather than a vigorous shake.”

The ’64 quake was extremely rare — one of only a few in the world ever recorded that strong — and not expected to return for perhaps 500 years.

Afterward, a debate raged for a decade about how to prepare for another earthquake. A group of scientists and planners wanted to make the Turnagain area into a park and stop development along the L Street bluff, which also sits on Bootlegger Cove clay.

But some town leaders feared Anchorage would die if land was condemned. The city was less than 50 years old. Some residents did leave the week after the quake, turning in their house keys to their lenders. And condemning the land would hurt some of the city’s most powerful property owners.

Instead, the city adopted plans to limit building height, concentrate tall buildings on firmer ground in the core of downtown instead of its periphery (that’s why the Atwood and ConocoPhillips buildings are on Seventh Avenue) and to adopt tough codes for areas expected to have unsteady ground.

An unsung cadre of engineers has protected us since, reviewing plans and objecting when the danger is too high. They have been overruled at times, and Anchorage has a few buildings that geotechnical engineers do not approve of. But Friday’s lack of deaths and low number of serious injuries speaks to their success.

A magnitude 6.9 earthquake in August killed 460 people in Indonesia and displaced 350,000. In August of 2016, a 6.0 quake killed 298 people in central Italy.

I would not blame anyone for those deaths. Many variables make those places different from Alaska.

But it is worth noting that, as Alaskans, we just survived something that easily could have killed many of us. And we should learn from that.

The debate is not over. Endless meetings have weighed whether projects should go ahead when the experts have doubts. Cautious voices always face the excitement of jobs and economic growth.

The next time you hear about a developer who wants to build on view property along Cook Inlet — on Bootlegger Cove clay — think about that jolt you felt Friday morning. When a proposal comes forward to break the height limit or bend the geotechnical rules, remember who kept us safe Friday.

It was the engineers and scientists. They were the heroes who saved countless lives on Friday.

Adult recipient of stem cell transplant in Calgary cured of sickle-cell disease,https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/adult-recipient-of-stem-cell-transplant-in-calgary-cured-of-sickle-cell-disease-1.3870386,"An Edmonton woman who received donor stem cells from her sister during a procedure in Calgary last year has been declared cured of her sickle-cell disease and health officials believe Revée Agyepong is the first adult in Canada to be cured of the disease through this method.

Sickle-cell disease causes red blood cells to become misshapen and leads to the clogging of small blood vessels. The disruption can result in bone deterioration and organ failure.

“People with sickle-cell disease will often survive into their 40s or 50s,” explained Agyepong.

Stem cell transplant procedures had been used to treat children with the disease but doctors feared the complications could do more harm than good on adult patients.

Agyepong and her sister, Stephanie Amoah, advocated for a transplant and, once it was confirmed the sisters were a perfect match and Amoah was free of the disease, doctors agreed to the surgical procedure.

“I was just excited to know we would get the HLA testing which is the compatibility testing,” recalled Agyepong. “We hoped for the best, crossed our fingers, and then, on her birthday – which is crazy, we got the best news ever; that she was a ten-out-of-ten match.”

In November of 2017, Agyepong underwent a complicated and risky stem cell transplant at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre under the direction of Dr. Andrew Daly, who leads Alberta’s bone marrow transplant program.

“When Revée approached us, we had coincidentally been thinking about adult stem cell transplant for sickle-cell disease based on the remarkably good outcomes that Alberta Children’s Hospital has been seeing with transplants in the pediatric population,” explained Dr. Daly in a released statement. “She met all the necessary criteria in terms of being able to tolerate a transplant but, most important, she had a sibling who was a 100 per cent match.”

The procedure proved successful but there are concerns as her immune system will remain compromised as a result of the anti-rejection drugs. The side-effects are expected to persist for another year.

On Tuesday, blood tests confirmed the 26-year-old was sickle-cell disease free.

""Over the past few months, what we've seen is that Revée's sister's bone marrow has taken over the production of Revée's red blood cells,"" said Dr. Daly. ""The amount of sickle-cell hemoglobin in her bloodstream has decreased almost to zero.""

“I can see the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Agyepong. “I’m not feeling as much pain. I’m not exhausted. So I’m excited for that.”

Agyepong is optimistic and excited by the idea that the success of her stem cell transplant could result in additional sickle-cell disease patients being offered the treatment.

"Muslims in Pakistani town refuse to slaughter cows ""to avoid hurting the feelings of their Hindu fellows""",http://www.arabnews.pk/node/1360936/world,"KARACHI: Tharo Khan, a resident of Islamkot town of Tharparkar, bought a goat for sacrifice on Eidul Adha. This cost him Rs. 18,000 ($146). He could get a share in a cow which would cost him less than Rs. 6,000 ($49) but he opted for goat. The reason is not “affordability” but “respect for the fellow citizens practicing another faith.”

“Sacrifice (slaughtering animal) is a religious obligation which I have to fulfil. However, at the same time I have a social obligation to take care of the sentiments of my Hindu friends, who make up 90 percent of our town,” Khan told Arab News.

While the slaughtering of cows and subsequent lynching of Muslims who are the minority faith in India often makes headlines, in the Pakistani border district of Tharparkar the majority of Muslims opt to not slaughter cows to avoid hurting the feelings of their Hindu fellows.

Tharparkar, situated at the India-Pakistan border, has the lowest Human Development Index of all the districts in Sindh. It has a 1,649,661 population (1.6 million), as per census of 2017. Of these 1.6 million, well over 40 percent are Hindus.

However, in urban areas, including its headquarter Mithi and Tehsil towns of Diplo, Islamkot, Chachro, Dahli, Nagarparkar and Kaloi, Hindus forms majority of the population. In Islamkot Hindus are more than 90 percent.

“We are faced with drought and have the lowest human development index but we are rich in terms of love, respect and brotherhood,” Kaldeep Kumar, 40, and president of the Islamkot traders’ association, told Arab News.

Kumar on Wednesday visited his Muslim friends to greet them at Eid; he ate sweets and grilled mutton, since his Muslim friends like other Tharis don’t slaughter the cow.

“Hindus of Thar arrange Iftar dinners for the Muslim friends in the fasting month of Ramadan. They (Muslims) attend our religious rituals and festivals,” said Kumar.

“Although not prohibited by law, there is an unannounced ban on the slaughter of cow, which is sacred to Hindus. This ban is however not forced but self-imposed and reflects the centuries-old interfaith harmony,” said Abdul Ghani Bajeer, a local journalist.

“This is not confined to Eid. You can’t find a single of a dozen of meat shops across the district which may be offering cow’s meat to its customers,” Bajeer told Arab News. “In the Muslim weddings, serving food of cow meat is being avoided as many Hindus also attend the wedding ceremonies.”

At Eid, the locals chose to slaughter goats but in some cases if they slaughter a cow, it’s done away from the eyes of Hindu fellow citizens out of respect for their religious feelings.

Bajeer said that over the past few years, different welfare organizations including Al-Khidmat Foundation, Human Relief Foundation, Darul Uloom Karachi, Al-Mustafa Trust, have started arranging sacrifices for the underprivileged local Muslim communities. “But local volunteers make sure that slaughtering process is being done in closed spaces and the meat doesn’t reach the Hindus,” he said.

Piaro Shawani, the 40-year-old Hindu owner of Café Thar in Mithi, said that Tharparkar is backward in resources but is wealthiest due to its interfaith harmony, brotherhood, respect and love. “In the rainy season, we celebrate the rain related festival together. We also attend each other’s religious festivals,” he said.

Abdul Rehman Otho, the 45-year-old principal of a private school in Diplo town of Thar, said that there is no prohibition on slaughtering cow. “No Hindu can stop us from slaughtering (the cow) but we have inherited this legacy of not hurting the feelings of our fellow Hindus from our forefathers,” Otho told Arab News. “Hindu-Muslim women are even more attached to each other.”

Advocate Faqir Sagir, general secretary of the Mithi Bar Association, said: “This interfaith harmony leads to a tolerant society where the crime rate is low. We have a zero crime ratio.”

Ghansham Das, the 60-year-old former chairman of Islamkot City union council, said: “If we are not asked by someone about it we even don’t remember about cow slaughtering.”

In our area, people of two different faiths live together but this is a blessing for us not a curse, unlike what we see in many places around the world. “We are not only an example for the rest of our country but for the entire world. We participate in their festivals and they (Muslims) in ours.”

Amar Guriro, who has reported about Thar Desert extensively, said that Thar Desert is a hub of religious coexistence and interfaith harmony. “People of Sindh are emotionally attached to their motherland, language and culture, more than their religion. For Sindhi people, one’s religion or faith is not important but someone who loves their motherland, speaks their language, and practices Sindhi culture is important,” Guriro said.

Hunter Wart, 19, spent more than a year mowing lawns and scrapping metal to raise the $10,000 needed to purchase a Safe Haven Baby Box for the Seymour Fire Department.

Wart was a junior at Columbus North High School when he decided to raise the funds as part of his senior project.

""It was a lot of hard work,"" his mom Julia Kwasniewski told CNN. ""A lot of blood, sweat and tears."" Wart spent a lot of time collecting metal, which Kwasniewski helped him shuttle to a scrap yard.

The student's hard work paid off in June 2019, when the box was finally installed at the fire department. Such boxes are meant to prevent abandonment of newborns.

"Lifeguard, 15, saves toddler during first day on the job",http://pix11.com/2017/06/13/15-year-old-lifeguard-saves-toddler-during-first-day-on-the-job/,"LAKEWOOD, Ohio — It started out as a day of fun in the sun at the Charles A. Foster pool in Lakewood, Ohio last Thursday – but things quickly turned dangerous.

Lifeguard Jack Viglianco, 15, told WJW, ""I heard like a 'Help, ah,' kind of thing. And I looked over and I saw a guy who's probably like 3 feet 6 inches, in the 4-foot water and gasping for air.""

The victim was a 4-year-old boy at the pool for a summer camp field trip.

Viglianco said the young boy was bobbing up and down, screaming for help.

Not only was it Jack's first day on the job, it was only 20 minutes into his shift, when he had to put the lifesaving skills he had just learned to the test.

""Active drowners can still breathe, and they're still above water, but they are still in the act of drowning,” said Viglianco.

Lakewood aquatics manager Matt Demaline said, ""Jack activated our emergency response plan. He got down off the chair and jumped in and helped the kid to safety. He had just completed ... a five-hour orientation the day before for all of our new and returning staff and we were ready to go, day one.""

Lakewood’s aquatics department says the scary scene proved to be the perfect reminder to parents and caregivers about safety at the pool … knowing things can drastically take a turn for the worse in the blink of an eye.

""Never let them out of your sight,"" said grandmother Eileen McCray. ""That's what I do with her, no matter where we're at or where we go, she can't go where I can't see her.”

As for Jack Viglianco, he says being a lifeguard is a passion and dream come true. His first day on the job, he says, is one he’ll never forget.

""I was realizing that I just saved a kid's life. And that is something not many other people can say. Nothing my friends have ever said.""

Between Lakewood’s two public pools, WJW reports there were 42 lifesaving efforts in just the last two summers. All victims were saved, thanks to the well-trained lifeguards on duty.

"Singapore abolishes school exam rankings, says learning is not competition",https://citinewsroom.com/2018/10/singapore-abolishes-school-exam-rankings-says-learning-is-not-competition/?fbclid=IwAR32zBr20-zRK-axCNmkrz_NSUo8IUn0VhydzUPjjX-ZEC3mTYzzziUPlHI,"Whether a child finishes first or last will no longer be indicated in primary and secondary school report books from next year in Singapore, – a move which Education Minister Ong Ye Kung hopes will show students that “learning is not a competition”.

Report books will not just stop showing a student’s position in relation to class or cohort. The information to be dropped includes:

Class and level mean

Minimum and maximum marks

Underlining and/or colouring of failing marks

Pass/fail for end-of-year result

Mean subject grades

Overall total marks

L1R5 (English plus five relevant subjects), L1R4 , EMB3 (English, maths, best three subjects) and EMB1 for lower secondary levels

The Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Friday (Sept 28) that the change is to allow each student to focus on his or her learning progress and discourage them from being overly concerned about comparisons.

From next year all examinations for Primary 1 and 2 pupils will also be removed, and whatever forms of assessment they have will not count towards an overall grade.

The MOE said that teachers will continue to gather information about pupils’ learning through discussions, homework and quizzes. Schools will use other ways like “qualitative descriptors”, in place of marks and grades, to evaluate pupils’ progress at these two levels.

For older students in primary schools and secondary schools, marks for each subject will be rounded off and presented as a whole number, without decimal points – to reduce the focus on academic scores. Parents will continue to receive information about their child’s progress in school during parent-teacher meetings.

In an address to some 1,700 school leaders earlier this week, Mr Ong said: “I know that ‘coming in first or second’, in class or level, has traditionally been a proud recognition of a student’s achievement. But removing these indicators is for a good reason, so that the child understands from young that learning is not a competition, but a self-discipline they need to master for life.

“Notwithstanding, the report book should still contain some form of yardstick and information to allow students to judge their relative performance, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.”

Mom of two wins $5M on lottery ticket bought by mistake,http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/edgewater/2018/01/03/lucky-break-edgewater-mother-two-wins-5-m-ticket-bought-mistake/1001126001/,"Lucky break: Edgewater mother of two wins $5M on ticket bought by mistake

Show Caption Hide Caption Fewer millennials buying lottery tickets Young Americans are showing less interest in buying lotto tickets than their parents. And that's prompting lottery officials to worry about the odds for future growth.

EDGEWATER — A spur-of-the-moment lottery purchase landed a North Jersey mother of two a $5 million prize last week.

Oksana Zaharov, 46, was shopping in Manhattan when she decided to buy a $1 scratch-off ticket. The clerk handed her a $10 ""Set For Life"" ticket by mistake.

“When the clerk handed me the wrong ticket, I felt bad so I decided to just go ahead and buy it,” Zaharov said in a release from the New York Lottery. “I actually used the ticket as a bookmark for a couple of weeks before I decided to scratch it.”

When she did get around to scratching it, Zarahov at first didn't believe she'd won.

""I never win anything,"" she said. ""I was sure the ticket was fake.""

Now, Zaharov will receive a minimum of a guaranteed $5 million over the course of 20 years, distributed over 19 payments of $260,000, or $172,068 after taxes, then one payment of $60,000 or $39,708 after taxes.

After that, she'll receive $172,068 annually for the rest of her life.

While Zaharov said she plans to splurge on a big family vacation to the Bahamas, she wants her children to benefit from her good luck.

Supposedly extinct kangaroo rat resurfaces after 30 years,http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/supposedly-extinct-kangaroo-rat-resurfaces-after-30-years,"Supposedly extinct kangaroo rat resurfaces after 30 years

The last time anyone saw the San Quintin kangaroo rat was more than 30 years ago, in the arid scrublands of Baja California in Mexico. Mexican authorities declared the small mammal critically endangered, and possibly extinct, in 1994. So biologists couldn't believe their eyes when not one, but four San Quintin kangaroo rats (Dipodomys gravipes) hopped into their survey traps in 2017.

Named for their ability to leap like kangaroos, the rats are key species in arid areas across western North America, dispersing seeds and feeding predators such as coyotes and foxes. The San Quintin kangaroo rat is about 12 centimeters long, with a long, tufted tail and enormous hind legs that allow it to leap about 2 meters and speed away at 10 kilometers per hour. They once lived by the thousands in a narrow coastal valley stretching 150 kilometers along the Pacific coast of northern Baja California.

But their numbers began to dwindle with the introduction of intensive agriculture in the 1970s, after which their habitat and food disappeared. Then, just 9 months ago, a team of researchers doing a routine inventory of mammals in the region discovered the rats in their survey traps. None of them had ever seen the species before, so they had to compare it with museum specimens and photographs, they will report in an upcoming issue of the Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Sciences .

The researchers attribute the kangaroo rat's comeback to a dramatic decrease in farming over the past decade, thanks to drought-related water shortages. Although the researchers are concerned that farmers may eventually make their own comeback, they are optimistic that the San Quintin kangaroo rat will persist, as it has also shown up in a nearby nature reserve. They say it also offers hope for other ""extinct"" small mammals, which may be findable if only researchers take the time and effort to track them down."
"Holocaust hero: US soldier told Nazi captors 'We are all Jews' — To protect Jewish captives at a Nazi POW camp, US Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds ordered more than 1,000 Americans captives to step forward with him and pronounced: ""We are all Jews here.""",https://m.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2015/1202/Holocaust-hero-US-soldier-told-Nazi-captors-We-are-all-Jews,"The Nazi soldiers made their orders very clear: Jewish American prisoners of war were to be separated from their fellow brothers in arms and sent to an uncertain fate.

But Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds would have none of that. As the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer held in the German POW camp, he ordered more than 1,000 Americans captives to step forward with him and brazenly pronounced: ""We are all Jews here.""

He would not waver, even with a pistol to his head, and his captors eventually backed down.

Seventy years later, the Knoxville, Tennessee, native is being posthumously recognized with Israel's highest honor for non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II. He's the first American serviceman to earn the honor.

""Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings,"" said Avner Shalev, chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial. ""The choices and actions of Master Sgt. Edmonds set an example for his fellow American soldiers as they stood united against the barbaric evil of the Nazis.""

It's a story that remained untold for decades and one that his son, the Rev. Chris Edmonds, only discovered long after his father's death in 1985.

Edmonds was captured with thousands of others in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944 and spent 100 days in captivity. His son vaguely knew about his father's past from a pair of diaries Edmonds kept in captivity that included the names and addresses of his men and some of his daily thoughts.

But it was only while scouring the Internet a few years ago that he began to unravel the true drama that had unfolded — oddly enough, when he read a newspaper article about Richard Nixon's post-presidency search for a New York home. As it happened, Nixon purchased his exclusive upper East Side town house from Lester Tanner, a prominent New York lawyer who mentioned in passing how Edmonds had saved him and dozens of other Jews during the war.

The New York Times reported in 2008:

As a G.I. in World War II, Mr. Tanner had been taken prisoner by the Germans and was being held in the Ziegenhein stalag in January 1945, when the Nazi commandant demanded at gunpoint to know which of the American soldiers were Jews. As. Mr. Tanner recalled it, their brave officer, Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds, defied the camp commander, saying the Geneva Convention forbade the request, and Mr. Tanner and his fellow prisoners were spared, to be liberated shortly afterward.

That sparked a search for Tanner, who along with another Jewish POW, Paul Stern, told the younger Edmonds what they witnessed on Jan. 27, 1945, at the Stalag IXA POW camp near Ziegenhain, Germany.

The Wehrmacht had a strict anti-Jew policy and segregated Jewish POWs from non-Jews. On the eastern front, captured Jewish soldiers in the Russian army had been sent to extermination camps.

At the time of Edmonds' capture, the most infamous Nazi death camps were no longer fully operational, so Jewish American POWs were instead sent to slave labor camps where their chances of survival were low. U.S. soldiers had been warned that Jewish fighters among them would be in danger if captured and were told to destroy dog tags or any other evidence identifying them as Jewish.

So when the German camp commander, speaking in English, ordered the Jews to identify themselves, Edmonds knew what was at stake.

Turning to the rest of the POWs, he said: ""We are not doing that, we are all falling out,"" recalled Chris Edmonds, who is currently in Israel participating in a seminar for Christian leaders at Yad Vashem's International School for Holocaust Studies.

With all the camp's inmates defiantly standing in front of their barracks, the German commander turned to Edmonds and said: ""They cannot all be Jews."" To which Edmonds replied: ""We are all Jews here.""

Then the Nazi officer pressed his pistol to Edmonds head and offered him one last chance. Edmonds merely gave him his name, rank and serial number as required by the Geneva Conventions.

""And then my dad said: 'If you are going to shoot, you are going to have to shoot all of us because we know who you are and you'll be tried for war crimes when we win this war,'"" recalled Chris Edmonds, who estimates his father's actions saved the lives of more than 200 Jewish-American soldiers.

Witnesses to the exchange said the German officer then withdrew. Stern, who currently lives in Reston, Virginia, told Yad Vashem that even 70 years later he can ""still hear the words.""

About 6 million European Jews were killed by German Nazis and their collaborators during World War II. The names of those honored for risking their lives to protect Jews are engraved along an avenue of trees at the Jerusalem memorial.

More than 26,000 have been designated ""Righteous Among the Nations,"" the most famous being Oskar Schindler, whose efforts to save more than 1,000 Jews were documented in Steven Spielberg's 1993 film ""Schindler's List,"" and Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who is credited for having saved at least 20,000 Jews before mysteriously disappearing.

But prior to Edmonds, only four were Americans, who belonged to the clergy or volunteered for rescue groups. He's the first serviceman and the first whose actions saved the lives of fellow Americans. A ceremony for Edmonds is planned next year. And, thanks to his son's efforts, Edmonds is now also being considered for a Congressional Medal of Honor.

Irena Steinfeldt, the director of the Holocaust memorial's Righteous Among the Nations department, said all rescue stories were unique. She said Edmonds actions were reflective of those of a military man, who was prepared to take a quick, clear, moral decision.

""It's a matter of five minutes and that is it. When he tells the German, 'No,' that is something that can kill him,"" she explained. ""It is something very dangerous that is happening in one moment. ... But it is very heroic.""

Chris Edmonds, who leads a Baptist congregation in Maryville, Tennessee, said he believed his father had a ""deep moral conviction"" instilled in his faith that inspired his actions.

""All he had to fight with was his will power and his wits,"" he said. ""I'm just glad he did the right thing.""

LA County DA To Dismiss Nearly 66K Marijuana Convictions,https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/02/13/la-county-da-to-dismiss-nearly-66k-marijuana-convictions/,"LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – In a sweeping move, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced that her office has asked the court to dismiss nearly 66,000 marijuana convictions going back decades.

In a news conference Thursday morning, Lacey called it the largest such undertaking in state history.

“We believe it is the largest effort in California to wipe out old criminal convictions in a single court motion,” Lacey said.

Lacey said that when Proposition 64 passed in 2016 – which legalized marijuana in California — prosecutors across the state were tasked with reducing past marijuana convictions from felonies down to misdemeanors. However, she says her office decided to go even further.

“I’ve instructed by deputy district attorneys to ask the court to dismiss all eligible cannabis-related convictions,” Lacey said. “I also took the will of the voters one step further. I expanded the criteria to go above and beyond the parameters of the law to ensure that many more people will benefit from this historic moment in time.”

Those eligible include anyone 50 years of age or older, anyone who has not been convicted of a crime in the last 10 years, anyone with a conviction who successfully completed probation and anyone with a conviction under the age of 21.

“As a result of our actions these convictions should no longer burden those who have struggled to find a job or a place to live because of their criminal record,” Lacey said.

Of the total, about 62,000 were felony cannabis convictions and 3,700 were misdemeanor possession convictions, some of which had been separately prosecuted by 10 different cities in L.A. County, including Burbank, Pasadena, Inglewood, Santa Monica and Torrance.

The motion, which was filed Tuesday, also calls for the court to seal the convictions.

“If you have a record, you don’t have to worry about even going through and having it sealed…We’re making a motion to seal it because we realize that’s the issue,” Lacey said. “When you go to apply for a job, you go to apply for housing and you’re record comes up, even though we’ve expunged it,that may not give you help.”

The move comes just three weeks before the March 3 Primary Election where Lacey is in a heated fight to keep her position. Her seat is being challenged by George Gascon, the former San Francisco DA, along with Rachel Rossie, a former federal public defender. Lacey is hoping for a third term.

Lacey said the sheer volume of the undertaking has created major challenges for prosecutors, with some of the cases going back to 1961. The county worked with the nonprofit group Code for America to create an algorithm to find all the eligible convictions.

“It had to do with developing an algorithm and developing our criteria, we wanted to go above and beyond what Prop 64 required,” Lacey said. “In working with Code For America, it took some time for them to develop a particular algorithm, find the right type of computer system to plug them in. In addition we wanted to go further and capture the misdemeanors.”

Following the passage of Prop 64, in October of 2018 then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1793, which required the California Department of Justice to review its records for all cannabis convictions that are eligible to be expunged or reduced. That information was then passed on to all county prosecutors, who have until July 1, 2020, to review those cases and decide whether to challenge them.

People who want to know if there case are being cleared can contact the L.A. County Public Defender’s Office, where a hotline has been established at 323-760-6763."
Bees Love Cannabis And It Could Help Restore Bee Populations,https://captain-planet.net/cannabis-could-help-restore-bee-populations/,"According to a new study, bees are fans of hemp. Taller hemp plants, it seems, attracts bee populations to it in droves.

According to a new study, bees are fans of hemp. Taller hemp plants, it seems, attracts bee populations to it in droves.

The latest research, conducted by Cornell University researchers, was published in Environmental Entomology. The findings reinforce findings from a previous study published at Colorado State University, that bees are highly attracted to cannabis because of the plant’s plentiful amounts of pollen.

The finding could pave the way for future research that might uncover new ways to prop up the struggling bee populations of no less than 16 different varieties along the north-eastern United States. The study also found that the tallest hemp plants attract 17 times more bees than the shorter ones.

The findings are unusual. Cannabis doesn’t produce the sweet nectar found in typical floral varieties that attract insects. The bright colours that often attract bees and other insects to other plants are also less dazzling compared to other flower species, compounding the unique finding.

The author of the study explains the significant implications of these findings as having a crucial impact on declining bee populations in the United States.

“The rapid expansion of hemp production in the United States… may have significant implications for agroecosystem-wide pollination dynamics.

As a late-season crop flowering during a period of seasonal floral dearth, hemp may have a particularly strong potential to enhance pollinator populations and subsequent pollination services for crops in the following year by filling gaps in late-season resource scarcity.”

Bees, a crucial pollinator across the world, are responsible for plant reproduction and play a pivotal role in our food production. Without bees, many crops would simply disappear.

The study’s authors go to lengths to explain that although bees are significantly attracted to hemp, cannabinoid-rich pollen won’t infiltrate our diets, and nor will it “have an impact on bee development due to the loss of cannabinoid receptors in insects.”"

"The End Of Root Canals: Stem Cell Fillings Trigger Teeth To Repair Themselves, Research Study Claims",https://www.inquisitr.com/4759240/the-end-of-root-canals-stem-cell-fillings-trigger-teeth-to-repair-themselves-research-study-claims/,"What if damaged teeth could heal themselves without the need of a root canal? Apparently, that’s what Harvard and the University of Nottingham are trying to figure out. They believe they can create stem cell stimulated fillings.

Worldwide, dentists treat hundreds of millions of cavities each year by drilling out the decayed part of the tooth and replacing it with a filling. According to Popular Science, the problem is up to 15 percent of those procedures will fail, which will lead to a root canal to remove the tooth’s pulp, a soft tissue in the center of the tooth that contains blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue. The downside is, following a root canal, the tooth’s strength is weaker and could eventually need to be removed.

Adam Celiz is a therapeutic biomaterials researcher who believes that stem cells could help reduce the number of root canals and the need for dentures. Celiz and his team developed a new kind of filling that is made from stem cells that can help your tooth heal. Just like regular fillings, the biomaterial stem cells are injected into the tooth and hardened with ultra-violet light.

“Existing dental fillings are toxic to cells and are therefore incompatible with pulp tissue inside the tooth. In cases of dental pulp disease and injury, a root canal is typically performed to remove the infected tissues. We have designed synthetic biomaterials that can be used similarly to dental fillings but can be placed in direct contact with pulp tissue to stimulate the native stem cell population for repair and regeneration of pulp tissue and the surrounding dentin. ‘Our approach has great promise to impact the dental field and this prize provides a great platform to develop this technology further with industrial partners.”

Celiz believes that all fillings could be made of such regenerative material so that damaged teeth could heal themselves, which, in theory, would reduce the filling failures and could completely eliminate the need for root canals.

The researchers believe that if used on a damaged tooth, those stem cells can repair the tooth. It would mimic a filling but would have a very low risk of rejection or failure. The easiest way to explain it is the tooth would heal itself, with the help of the stem cell biomaterial injection.

According to Daily Mail, the research placed second in the materials category of the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Emerging Technologies Competition in 2016. Applications were judged on the degree of innovation, the potential impact, and the quality of the science behind it.

Many dentists aren’t sure if stem cells have a place in dentistry. They suggest additional research to prove (or disprove) its benefits."

New Zealand's COVID-19 'eradication' strategy looks to be paying off

Strict, early lockdown by prime minister may end coronavirus on island nation

Professional surfer and surf instructor Zen Wallis, 28, says he initially disagreed with 'criminalizing' surfing as part of New Zealand's lockdown. But now he believes the gains may have been worth it. (Zen Wallis/Facebook)

After more than a month confined to dry land without being immersed in the salt and sea, New Zealander Zen Wallis says it feels like he's living in someone else's body.

""It's really strange to not go into the water,"" the professional surfer told CBC News in an interview by Skype. ""My skin feels different; my hair feels different.""

Surfing has been one of the casualties of New Zealand's extreme COVID-19 lockdown introduced in mid-March, one of the most stringent virus-fighting regimes anywhere in the world.

Wallis, 28, runs a surfing school in Piha on New Zealand's North Island, about 40 kilometres southwest of Auckland.

Coming at the tail end of the Southern Hemisphere's summer, his classes would normally have been full, he says, and he'd have been in water for as long as there was daylight.

""It was an interesting call to make — to actually make [surfing] criminal,"" he said.

But with the end of the prohibition on surfing and many other activities now just days away, Wallis says he feels the gains in New Zealand probably made the ban worthwhile.

""We may be able to open New Zealand back up if we can 'crush' this,"" he said of the government's stated goal of eradicating the infection.

Eradicate COVID-19

On Monday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that what New Zealand calls its Alert Level 4 measures — the most intense level — would last until end of day April 27, after which the country will revert to Alert Level 3, a level with greater freedoms.

""We have done what few countries have been able to do — we have stopped a wave of devastation,"" said Ardern, who has received widespread praise both at home and abroad for taking early, decisive action against COVID-19.

""The number of cases that each person with the virus passes it on to is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas, the average is 2.5 people, so we have among the lowest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the world.""

As of Tuesday, the country of five million people had registered 1,445 cases and just 13 deaths, most of them in nursing homes.

The majority of those infected have also now recovered.

For much of March and April, under the Alert Level 4 lockdown, only essential trips to the grocery store and pharmacies were permitted, along with brief trips outside for exercise. Swimming at the beach — and surfing — were not designated as essential activities, and related businesses closed.

Stringent measures

The measures, in place since March 25, go significantly beyond what most Canadian provinces have brought in.

In British Columbia, for example, restaurants have been serving takeout food, many public parks and beaches have remained open, organizations such as Amazon and Canada Post have been making deliveries and some retailers have been able to continue with in-store sales as long as they abide by physical distancing guidelines.

Whereas most countries have focused on ""flattening the curve"" of cases to ensure health-care systems aren't overwhelmed at the peak of infections, New Zealand's government decided early on it would go a big step further and try to wipe out COVID-19 completely.

""It's only a viable strategy if you do it early enough. It becomes harder to do it the longer you leave it,"" said Siouxsie Wiles, an infectious disease expert at the University of Auckland.

Wiles, with striking, bright pink hair and an easy way of communicating difficult concepts, has become something of a national celebrity since the beginning of the epidemic with near daily appearances on local media.

Measles outbreak

In an interview with CBC News, she said one of the key considerations for Ardern's government in adopting the strictest measures possible, was the interconnectedness the country has with many small Pacific islands that were in an extremely poor position to fight COVID-19.

In 2019, the small nation in the South Pacific registered almost 6,000 cases of measles resulting in 84 deaths. Scientists believe the disease was carried there by an infected patient who arrived on an Air New Zealand flight.

After April 27, Wiles says the plan is to keep New Zealand's borders closed to international travellers and to carefully track every new COVID-19 case that turns up, seeking out and isolating anyone who had contact with the infected person.

""If your contact tracing and testing is good enough, then you can minimize outbreaks — you can find cases and stop that spread.""

While New Zealand health officials have not released the raw data on their capacity to contact trace, several independent experts brought in as consultants have agreed with the Ardern government's approach and that New Zealand is in a position to make contact tracing work.

Incomplete data

Opposition politicians, however, insist the lockdown could have ended even sooner if the government had been more forthright about its ability to monitor the spread of the virus.

""This is a real shame, as businesses will suffer further damage, and that will lead to poor health outcomes as a result of the huge stress this will cause for a lot of people,"" said opposition National Party Leader Simon Bridges.

Practically speaking, Alert Level 3 will leave New Zealanders freer than Canadians in some ways but not in others.

People will be able to extend their ""bubble,"" as health officials refer to it, by having caregivers or cleaners return to their homes, for example, as long as those workers don't also visit other homes.

Schools will open for elementary and middle school students, but the expectation is that any student who is in a position to continue with online learning from home will do so.

Industries such as construction and forestry will be allowed to resume. Restaurants will not be able to open up for table service, but takeout will be permitted.

And people will be able to head to the beach again to surf.

Relapse possible

After two weeks, if there is no COVID-19 relapse, the prime minister said the nation could move down to Alert Level 2 by the middle of May, which would permit even greater freedoms.

Taiwan and South Korea have had similar success to New Zealand's in cornering the virus, though Singapore, which was also seen as a textbook case, is now experiencing a dramatic second wave of infections after initially relaxing its prohibitions.

Wiles says it is still too soon to know when international flights will resume to New Zealand but she says she expects the first steps may be to resume flying to other nations, such as Taiwan, or those in the South Pacific, that have also virtually wiped out the infection.

""We may end up having countries around the world that are these little islands that you could travel between,"" she said.

""Going forward, it's an interesting thing how you maintain [a virus free status].""

All of that is heartening news for Zen Wallis, who is planning to be back in the water first thing once the surf ban is lifted.

""I'm psyched up. I am getting ready now,"" he said.

Still, after that instant rush, he says, he worries about how long it will take his business and so many others to recover.

""I am sure people are going to want to surf, but obviously, there's no tourism.""

""There's going to be a hit … for a long time.""

Costco raising minimum wage to $14 an hour,http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/390210-costco-raising-minimum-wage-to-14-an-hour,"Retail giant Costco said Thursday that it would raise its starting minimum wage to $14 an hour, a $1 increase for entry level positions.

MarketWatch reported that the company will also raise wages for other hourly workers by up to 50 cents.

The changes will take effect on June 11 and are expected to affect 130,000 employees.

Costco finance chief Richard Galanti said the change is expected to cost between $110 million and $120 million annually, but that due to the new GOP tax law, the company expects a 7 percent drop in its tax rate, according to MarketWatch.

The wholesale chain announced its quarterly earnings on Thursday, reporting a $750 million profit, a $50 million increase from last year, and a total revenue of $32.36 billion.

The company also announced Thursday that it has had a strong showing in e-commerce, with a reported 36.8 percent increase in online sales, according to USA Today.

Other major companies, including Walmart and Starbucks, announced in the past year that they would raise wages or invest in workers in other ways after the GOP-backed tax bill passed, resulting in major corporate tax cuts."
Virginia is first Southern state to provide sweeping anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people,https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/april/headline-856051-en.html,"Governor Northam Signs Virginia Values Act

Virginia is first Southern state to provide sweeping anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people

RICHMOND—Governor Ralph Northam today announced he has signed the Virginia Values Act, making Virginia the first state in the South to enact comprehensive protections for the LGBTQ community against discrimination in housing, employment, public spaces, and credit applications.

Senate Bill 868, sponsored by Senator Adam Ebbin, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in housing, public and private employment, public accommodations, and access to credit. The legislation also extends important protections to Virginians on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, marital status, disability, and status as a veteran.

“This legislation sends a strong, clear message—Virginia is a place where all people are welcome to live, work, visit, and raise a family,” said Governor Northam. “We are building an inclusive Commonwealth where there is opportunity for everyone, and everyone is treated fairly. No longer will LGBTQ Virginians have to fear being fired, evicted, or denied service in public places because of who they are.”

“With the Governor’s signing of the Virginia Values Act, we have made discrimination against our gay, lesbian and transgender friends, family, neighbors and co-workers in employment, housing and public accommodation illegal in the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said Speaker of the House Eileen Filler-Corn. “It is now the law of the land that every Virginian can work hard, earn a living wage, and live their lives without fear of discrimination based on who they are or who they love. A tremendous victory.”

“I am grateful to Governor Northam for signing the Virginia Values Act, which represents years of dedicated work by activists, legislators, and progressive members of our business community to ensure full protection for every Virginian under the law,” said Senator Adam Ebbin. “Sadly, during times of crisis like these, discrimination rises, and its effects become more apparent. When jobs are scarce and housing unaffordable, the reality of who you are must be an additional hurdle to putting food on the table or providing shelter for your family. This law provides important new protections.”

“After decades of hard work, we are closer to making Virginia the Commonwealth that we all want it to be,” said Delegate Mark Sickles. “This new law will bring protections that Virginians need to live, work, and access services free from discrimination and harassment. I am grateful to Governor Northam for signing this legislation, and to the broad coalition of dedicated advocates, legislators, constituents, faith leaders, and members of the business community, who worked together to pass the most comprehensive civil rights bill in Virginia’s history this session.”

New study reveals a dog's heart rate increases when their owners say 'I love you',https://7news.com.au/the-morning-show/new-study-reveals-a-dogs-heart-rate-increases-when-their-owners-say-i-love-you--c-1308556,"We’ve all heard the phrase “a dog is a man’s best friend”.

But have you ever wondered how much your dog really loves you?

Watch the full story above

In a new study by Canine Cottages, four different pups were fitted with special heart rate tracking collars to show what gets them excited when interacting with their owners.

Combining the heart rate tracking data from the four dogs over seven days, their average heart rate was 67 beats per minute.

But when the dogs were told “I love you” by their owners, their heart rates rocketed up to 98 beats per minute.

The findings also revealed that cuddling can calm a dog’s heart rate - and let’s be honest, we humans love it too.

According to the results, the dogs’ heart rates decreased by 23 per cent on average when they were being cuddled by their humans.

But that’s not all - the study also highlighted the ways your dog can express their love for you. These include:"

The men had made similar transactions before, and Archbold -- who owns the Curiosity Inc. store in Edmonton, Canada -- is generally quick with his appraisals. But this one was different.

At first Archbold thought he had bought a replica of an animation cel from the 1980s or 1990s. He thought if he removed the broken frame and cleaned it up, the picture might fetch $80 to $100.

He paid the homeless man, Adam Gillian, $20 for it.

But when he it took it out of the frame and flipped it over, Archbold discovered an old certificate of authenticity. Even more surprising: It had a copyright date of 1937. ""Bambi"" hit theaters in 1942.

"California waitress who ejected racist diner gets $82,000 in tips.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8511011/California-waitress-ejected-racist-diner-receives-82-000-tips.html,"A waitress has received $82,000 in tips from people around the world who have been left heartened after they saw her stand up to a racist Silicon Valley CEO inside her restaurant.

Gennica Cochran, a server at Lucia restaurant in Carmel Valley, California, escorted Michael Lofthouse, 37, out after he yelled 'Trump is going to f*** you' at an Asian family enjoying a meal out on Fourth of July.

She was hailed an 'everyday hero' by people who have been donating money to the waitress on GoFundMe.

One page set-up to tip Cochran is titled 'A Big Tip for an Everyday Hero', and has already raised $65,000.

Two other GoFundMe accounts have raised an additional $15,000 collectively - and the money is still pouring in.

Cochran told KGO-TV that the money will allow her to pursue yoga teaching, and she is also trying to devise a way to send some of the money on to others in the service industry.

Cochran told KGO-TV that the $80,000 will allow her to pursue yoga teaching. She is also trying to devise a way to send some of the money on to others in the service industry

Cochran was seen on video last week ordering Lofthouse out of Lucia after he called Jordan Chan and her family a 'f***ing Asian piece of s**t' during a racist tirade.

'I felt very protective of them,' Ms Cochran said. 'To hear the emotion coming out of my voice, to see my mannerisms, it was unbelievable it was just something that came over me and I just did what needed to be done.

'I did what anybody else should or would do in that situation.'

Cochran said it was one of the first times her customers were allowed back into the restaurant after it reopened following the coronavirus pandemic, and she couldn't let racial abuse ruin their experience.

They had been celebrating a birthday at Bernardus Lodge and Spa's Lucia restaurant on Saturday.

The shocking footage shows Lofthouse shouting racist abuse.

Within seconds Cochran confronted Lofthouse. She said: 'You do not talk to a guest like that, you need to leave now.'

The mother of a British tech CEO who was filmed hurling vicious racist abuse at an Asian family says she is 'totally appalled' by his behaviour as MailOnline can reveal his own sister-in-law is mixed race. Michael Lofthouse was pictured flipping the bird at Jordan Chan and relatives

Jenny Chan (back left) posted the footage on Instagram. The family were celebrating the birthday of Jenny's aunt Mari Orosa (back right with Mari's husband Raymond front right)

Lofthouse called the family a 'f***ing Asian piece of s**t' before an outraged Ms Cochran stepped in and told him to 'get out'

Lofthouse, who was born in Britain, is the CEO of California-based Solid8, a small tech company.

The company has a low-budget website saying it offers industry-leading cloud storage and online security for companies. It has between two and ten employees, according to LinkedIn.

'Racist' boss's tech firm Lofthouse's Solid8 is a cloud tech services firm launched in 2017. The company's offices are based near the financial district of San Francisco, California. Solid8 aims to improve their clients' computer systems and reduce their IT costs by offering network services, infrastructure or business services that store and access data and programs over the Internet rather than a computer hard drive. On its website, the company, which also offers cyber security advice, boasts of having '38 years of collective experience' and says: 'Our team are decisive problem-solvers, our breadth and depth of experience means we've dealt with most situations before – which means we move quickly from analysis to action, working as an agile team for each project, quickly drawing upon talent from across our global network of over 100 leading Cloud Providers.' Solid8's CEO is Briton Michael Lofthouse, who according to his now-deleted LinkedIn page, graduated from Newcastle Business School, associated with Northumbria University, in 2005 and emigrated to America in 2010.

In the footage, Lofthouse targetss Chan and her family who had been at the restaurant to celebrate her aunt Mari Orosa's birthday.

Mari was accompanied at the restaurant by her husband, Raymond, a sales rep for a Mercedes car dealership in California.

The film began after Lofthouse had already apparently started on his unprovoked, racist abuse. The person filming told him to 'say that again'.

'Oh, now you're shy,' the person behind the camera said. 'Say it one more time.'

Lofthouse responded by flipping his middle finger and said 'that's what I'm saying now'.

'Trump's going to f*** you!' he then yelled, as he got up to leave the restaurant.

'You f***ers need to leave,' he said, before Cochran stepped in.

'Get out of here,' she was heard shouting.

'You are not allowed here. You do not talk to our guests like that.'

Lofthouse continued with his vile attack on the family, yelling: 'You f***ing Asian piece of s**t.

He turned to Cochran and said: 'Who are these f***ers?'

'They are valued guests,' she responded.

Lofthouse replied: 'Are they? They are valued guests in America?'

The waitress continued to tell him to 'get out' and said: 'You are not allowed here ever again.'

Chan wrote on Instagram that the 'white supremacist' businessman had begun harassing her family soon after they sang happy birthday to her aunt.

Aside from the racist comments caught on camera, she said he also told them to 'go back to whatever f****** Asian country you're from' and that 'you don't belong here'.

She added on the post that he 'had a LOT more to say after I stopped recording'.

Lofthouse later issued a grovelling apology, telling DailyMail.com: 'My behavior in the video is appalling. This was clearly a moment where I lost control and made incredibly hurtful and divisive comments.

'I would like to deeply apologize to the Chan family. I can only imagine the stress and pain they feel.

'I was taught to respect people of all races, and I will take the time to reflect on my actions and work to better understand the inequality that so many of those around me face every day.'"

Show Caption Hide Caption After World Cup win, best could be yet to come for France Fox Sports' Alexi Lalas explains that although France is the 2018 World Cup winner, their young talent could mean they're just getting started.

Kylian Mbappe garnered global recognition for his performances in this year’s World Cup, but the proceeds he earned are not going to him.

Mbappe, who scored four goals this year as France claimed its second World Cup, decided to donate his earnings from the tournament to a charity that gives free sports instruction to hospitalized and disabled children in sports, Premiers de Cordee.

The organization also coordinates disability awareness campaigns for schools and businesses, according to the French news outlet L’Equipe. After consulting with his entourage, Mbappe decided his World Cup premiums can serve a humanitarian cause, according to L’Equipe.

“Kylian, he's a great person,” Sebastien Ruffin, general manager of Premiers de Cordee, told Le Parisien. “When his schedule allows it, he intervenes for us with pleasure. He has a very good [relationship] with children, he always finds the right [words] to encourage them. I sometimes even feel that [he] takes more pleasure to play with the kids than the kids themselves.”

Radio host (Iain Lee) keeps suicidal caller on the line for half an hour until ambulance arrives,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/iain-lee-radio-host-talkradio-suicide-caller-ambulance-overdose-im-a-celebrity-a8693726.html,"Radio host Iain Lee has been credited with helping save a suicidal man's life by keeping him on the phone for 30 minutes until an ambulance arrived.

The man, identified only as Chris, called during Lee's talkRADIO show on Wednesday and said he had taken an overdose.

Lee, who appeared on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! last year, said the man was ""lying in a street in Plymouth, dying"" at the time of the call.

Chris, who said he was almost 59 and suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, explained he was close to a nightclub and told Lee: ""I don't want to die, Iain"".

Lee, 45, has previously discussed his own mental health struggles and explained he has suffered from suicidal thoughts while coming off anti-depressants.

The radio host spoke to Chris while emergency services worked to track down the caller, telling him at one point: “Shut up, man... I love you. You may want to die, but we can talk about that tomorrow.”

Meanwhile, producers gave emergency services details of Chris's appearance and location, helping them assist the caller as promptly as possible.

The man stopped talking at several points during the call, causing Lee to become increasingly worried about the caller's safety.

Lee sounded clearly relieved when Chris came back on the line, at one point telling him: “Yes, brother. The whole country is punching the air. We lost you for about 10 minutes, man.”

Police told Lee after 27 minutes that they had located the caller.

Lee tweeted after the incident: ""Tonight we took a call from a man who had taken an overdose. He was lying in a street in Plymouth, dying. We managed to keep him online, get a description of what he looked like and was wearing, work out where he was and send an ambulance and police to him.

""Kept him on the phone for 30 minutes while he got harder to understand. Long periods of silence where I thought he'd died. F***, that was intense and upsetting. Thanks for your kind words. I really hope he makes it.""

On Thursday, Lee shared another update, writing: ""Thanks everyone for your kind words. Been an odd day for so many reasons. I really appreciate your kind words.""

He planned to be back on the air at 10pm.

The ambulance service said that the caller was taken to the hospital for further treatment.

"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA reported 0 deaths due to the coronavirus yesterday, the first time since March 20th.",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/06/30/nation/mass-reports-zero-new-coronavirus-deaths-first-time-months/,"A state official said the startling decline in the daily death count to zero was unrelated to the data cleanup.

The Department of Public Health also said it was decreasing the official total of coronavirus deaths in the state due to “ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.” On Monday, the running tally of confirmed and probable deaths was 8,095; that number dropped to 8,054 on Tuesday.

For the first time in months, state officials on Tuesday reported zero new deaths in Massachusetts due to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, an encouraging sign that stood in stark contrast with other states nationwide that have seen recent spikes in their numbers.

The first Massachusetts death due to coronavirus was reported on Friday, March 20.

The number of deaths announced, which reflects the number reported to the state as of 10 a.m. each day, can swing dramatically from day to day. On Friday, the number was 50, on Saturday it was 28, on Sunday it was 19, and on Monday it was 35.

And although the metric might appear uplifting, officials have warned residents not to let their guard down against the virus — especially as the state heads into July 4th weekend. At a news conference earlier Tuesday, Governor Charlie Baker urged people to continue wearing face coverings, washing their hands, and practice social distancing.

“We do not want to take one step forward and two steps back as we keep climbing out of this horrific pandemic,” Baker said.

Meanwhile, the state also reported 114 new coronavirus cases — 73 confirmed and 41 probable — in Massachusetts, bringing that total tally to 108,882.

The state also reported that 5,813 new individuals had been given the coronavirus test, bringing the total number of individuals tested to 842,960. The total number of molecular tests that have been administered rose to 1,066,060.

The state also reported that new antibody tests had been completed for 918 people, bringing that total to 71,686.

Meanwhile, all four key metrics that the state is monitoring to determine the pace of reopening fell, according to Tuesday’s report.

The seven-day weighted average of positive test rates decreased slightly from 1.9 percent on Sunday to 1.8 percent on Monday. It has dropped 94 percent since April 15.

The three-day average of the number of patients hospitalized for the coronavirus also fell slightly on Monday to 748, down from from 760 a day earlier. It has dropped 79 percent since April 15.

The number of hospitals using surge capacity also dropped to one on Monday. That number is down from a high of more than 20 in early May, and has seen a 95 percent decrease since April 15.

A fourth metric, the three-day average of confirmed COVID-19 deaths by date of fatality — rather than the date reported — also fell slightly, from 18 on Friday to 16 on Saturday. It has dropped 89 percent since April 15.

Earlier Tuesday, Baker touted the state’s performance on the numbers reported Monday, particularly the metrics that are being monitored for reopening, and announced that he was relaxing the travel rules for people visiting the state from seven nearby states.

“Our public health information continues to show a downward trend in our key metrics,” Baker said. “This obviously represents solid progress as we head into July, and will continue to influence when and how we move into the next phases of reopening the Commonwealth.”

However, he warned that “COVID-19 will not be taking a summer vacation,” and pointed to other states that have seen an alarming spike in numbers recently.

“As we’ve all seen, several other states are seeing sharp increases in new cases and hospitalizations, which is a very real reminder to all of us just how contagious this virus can be,” he said.

Indeed, states like Florida, Arizona, Texas, and California have either paused or walked back reopening measures, such as closing or clamping down on bars, shutting beaches, and rolling back restaurant capacity, among other measures.

With newly reported infections running at around 40,000 a day in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, warned Tuesday that the number could rocket to 100,000 if Americans don’t start following public health recommendations.

“Clearly, we are not in total control right now,” Fauci said during testimony at a Senate hearing that focused on reopening, citing recent news clips that showed some people congregating in crowds, often without masks. “We’re going to continue to be in a lot of trouble and there’s going to be a lot of hurt if that does not stop.”

While the drop in the number of announced deaths in Massachusetts was encouraging, models suggest there is still heartbreak ahead. A University of Massachusetts released Tuesday model estimated that the coronavirus death toll in the state will reach 8,505 by July 25.

The UMass estimate comes from a lab headed by UMass Amherst associate professor Nicholas Reich that collects various coronavirus pandemic models and develops a combined, or ensemble, forecast that is intended to reflect their collective wisdom.

Reich’s lab releases the ensemble forecast weekly. It only creates the forecast for a four-week window ahead because it believes forecasts aren’t reliable enough after that. Last week, the model estimated there would be 8,389 deaths tallied by July 18.

Reich’s lab posts its national- and state-level data at the Reich Lab COVID-19 Forecast Hub. The lab, already an Influenza Forecasting Center of Excellence, collaborates with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on coronavirus predictions.

The lab also feeds the data it has collected and its ensemble forecast to the agency, which posts the data on its own website. The data is also used to feed the fivethirtyeight.com website.

The closely-watched University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model, looking further into the future, offered a bleaker vision, predicting that Massachusetts will see as many as 10,154 deaths by Oct. 1, with a possible range of outcomes from 9,480 to 11,402 deaths.

The latest UMass ensemble model also predicts the United States as a whole will see a cumulative total of 147,865 deaths in the next four weeks. Last week it put the four-week number at 139,276. The current US death toll is over 126,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.

One week after his sister-in-law's death, David Spade has donated $100,000 to help those afflicted with mental illness.

Spade didn't announce this on social media or make a big fuss; People magazine confirmed the news late Wednesday via his representative.

The donation will support the National Alliance on Mental Illness and Spade tells the magazine that, ""More people suffer from mental health issues than we may realize but no one should ever feel ashamed to reach out for support.""

He added, “If you or anyone you know is in need of help or guidance please contact the national suicide prevention hotline at 800-273-8255 or go to nami.org to learn more and help those who may be in need.""

Kate Spade, who was married to the comedian's brother andy, took her own life at the age of 55 last week and the ""Joe Dirt"" star has been vocal about the shock and grief that comes from losing a member of the family so suddenly.

Shortly after her death, Spade posted a happy photo to Instagram with the caption, ""Fuzzy picture but i love it. Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still cant believe it. Its a rough world out there people, try to hang on.""

And then this past week, Spade went back to work, addressing the loss further during a stand-up routine in Southern California.

""Thank you for coming. It was a rough week, but I didn't want to cancel and I appreciate you all coming out here,"" he told the audience, according to E! News. ""And, if my jokes don't work then I get sort of a free pass.""

Spade's brother Andy has also spoken out since Kate's death, saying that her suicide was a complete shock to the family.

""We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this,"" he told the New York Times. ""It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn’t her. There were personal demons she was battling.""

 -- Colorado resident Michael Kent recently sat down at a tattoo parlor in Colorado Springs to have his swastikas covered up.

Kent, a former neo-Nazi, credits an African-American parole officer named Tiffany Whittier with helping him to see beyond skin color and changing his views about white supremacy.

“If it wasn’t for her I would have seeped back into it,” said Kent. “I look at her as family.”

Whittier, 45, even inspired Kent, 38, to take down the Nazi flags he had hanging in his living room and replace them with smiley faces.

“I’m not here to judge him. That’s not my job to judge. My job is to be that positive person in someone’s life,” Whittier said.

Added Kent, “When you wake up and see a smiley face, you’re going to go to work and you’re going to smile.”

Kent now works full-time on a chicken farm in Colorado, where all his co-workers are Hispanic.

“Before all this, I wouldn’t work for anybody or with anybody that wasn’t white,” said Kent. “[Now] we have company parties, or they have quinceañeras, I’m the only white guy there!”

Redemption Ink, a national non-profit that offers free removals of hate-related tattoos, helped connect Kent with Fallen Heroes Tattoo in Colorado to begin the 15-hour process of covering his swastikas. The sterile environment is new to Kent who had his previous ink work done in prison.

“I’ve never, never, never been inside of a tattoo shop getting a professional tattoo,” he said.

Kent believes the painful process will help him move forward after spending years as a member of a violent skinhead group based in Arizona. As a father of two young children, Kent also hopes his children will see the world differently.

“I don’t want my kids to live the life I lived and live with hate,” said Kent. “I want my kids to know me for who I am now—a good father, a hard worker, and a good provider.”"

My community came together to buy a new bike for a woman who had hers stolen. She lives with cerebral palsy and used her bike as transportation to all destinations.,http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Friends-raising-money-to-get-disabled-woman-a-new-bike-461113463.html,"A thief is making it harder for a woman with a severe disability to get to work. And now friends are trying to raise money to get her back on the road.

Bridget Kuhlman has cerebral palsy. She can’t drive and walking any distance is a strain.

So Kuhlman rode a special 3-wheel bike to her job at Arby’s on 1st Avenue S.E.

She parked her bike next to the restaurant’s fenced-in dumpster area in full view of the drive through window.

Nothing happened for two years until last Friday when someone snipped the lock and rode off. Now her friends are trying to make it right with a fund raiser to get her a new bike.

Kuhlman says she was devastated last Friday when she got off work and found her bike gone.

“I was very shocked and I lost it. I was crying because I’m like what am I going to do,” she said.

But that shock eventually turned to elation when she learned her boss at the fast food restaurant was organizing a fund drive to buy her a new 3-wheeler.

“Yes, I lost my bike and yes it’s not right. But I’m glad I have a boss who got it started even with her own family,” Kuhlman said.

Arby’s store manager Angie Takes launched a Go Fund Me page called “Bike for Bridget” with her own family making the first contributions.

The hope is to do better than the used pawn shop 3-wheeler that someone swiped.

Takes says she hopes to get a bike with more back support to make pedaling easier for Bridget and lights for riding at night. Certainly, she plans to buy a better bike lock.

“Bridget goes to the laundromat with her bike. She does everything with her bike. She has two dogs and gives them rides on her bike. It was something I had to do,” Takes said.

Bridget says nobody saw the bike disappear so she doesn’t know what happened or when. All she knows is she’d like the freedom to move about again. And that means getting another bike she can ride.

"Kenyan Woman Saves 15,000 Young Girls From Female Genital Mutilation",https://www.ebony.com/news-views/kenyan-woman-saves-15000-young-girls-from-female-genital-mutilation,"Nice Nailantei Leng’ete was recently named one of Time’s Most Influential People, and for good reason. The 27-year-old Kenyan has made it her life’s work to help young African girls escape “female cutting,” commonly referred to as female genital mutilation (FGM). While discussing her mission with Yahoo Lifestyle, Leng’ete explained the cause is close to her heart because she escaped the archaic practice herself at 8 years old.

“I escaped by running away,” Leng’ete shared, saying she and her sister hid in a tree until the ceremony was over. And she has now helped over 15,000 others avoid FGM as well.

Leng’ete is also working to rid Africa of child marriage and FGM by 2030, introducing alternative rites of passage to her male-dominated Maasai community.

“FGM, for Maasai, is a rite of passage from girlhood to womanhood. Women are not considered women unless they have gone through FGM,” Leng’ete said, explaining the societal role of female circumcisions. “FGM in my community connects to girls ending their education, with child marriage, and with teenage pregnancies. A girl is 10 or 12 years old when she undergoes FGM. Then she’s told she’s a woman, and that means she’s ready for marriage, and that means she has children. They all go together.”

Leng’ete knew she was destined for more while witnessing the ritual as a child.

“I saw pain. I saw death. Since I was 7 years old, I used to attend these ceremonies in my community with girls undergoing FGM. I saw my friends leave school and get married. And I wanted to continue my education.”

That’s just what she did, becoming the first girl in her village to go to high school. Her school uniform inspired other girls in her community, who later sought her help to avoid “the cut.” While she initially hid those seeking help, this made her a wanted woman in the region, leading her to take a different approach.

The young hero, instead, received permission to share information about sexual health and wellness with her village. After four long years of educating her community, the elders were convinced that Maasai would be more prosperous if women were able to stay in school longer, marry later and forego female circumcisions. Elders officially renounced the practice of FGM in 2014.

“I’m driven by passion,” Leng’ete said. “Being able to protect these younger girls from these harmful practices is what I want to do; it’s an important job. When I see the girls in school, that’s my happiness. I’m hoping to reach many more — every girl — if I’m able.”"

It comes as the UK announced a further 170 deaths of people with coronavirus - the lowest since the day after lockdown began.

Speaking at Sunday's Downing Street news conference, which was delayed due to technical difficulties, the cabinet minister said work by the University of Oxford to find an effective drug was ""progressing well"".

But while pointing out the government had now committed more than a quarter of a billion pounds towards developing a COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, Mr Sharma warned there was no certainty one would ever be found.

He said: ""In order to definitively conquer this disease we need to find a safe, workable vaccine.

""Last month I announced a new vaccine task force to co-ordinate the efforts of government, academia and industry in the critical mission to find a vaccine.

""I'm very proud of how quickly our scientists and researchers have come together in their efforts developing a vaccine that will combat coronavirus.""

He added: ""The first clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine is progressing well with all phase one participants having received their vaccine dose on schedule earlier this week.

""The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.""

The secretary of state also said Imperial College London was ""making good progress"" and would look to move into clinical trials for a vaccine by mid-June, with larger scale trials in October.

So far the government has invested £47m in the Oxford and Imperial vaccine programmes. Mr Sharma announced a further £84m in new funding ""to help accelerate their work"".

He added: ""This new money will help mass-produce the Oxford vaccine so that if current trials are successful we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.""

He said the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca had finalised a ""global licensing agreement"" with Oxford University with government support, and added: ""This means that if the vaccine is successful AstraZeneca will work to make 30 million doses available by September for the UK as part of an agreement for over 100 million doses in total.""

He said ""the UK will be first to get access"" but that the government would also ensure that ""we're able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost"".

Mr Sharma also announced the UK's first vaccines manufacturing innovation centre is expected to open in summer 2021, a year ahead of plan, after receiving an extra £93m in government cash.

He said: ""The centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months.""

But with no guarantee of a successful vaccine being found, he also stressed the need to look at other drug treatments for those who get the virus.

He reported that six drugs have entered initial live clinical trials, which could be expanded if the results were positive."

"New Zealand wants to make people happy, not rich - New Zealand’s latest budget, unveiled this week, is being touted as the first in a Western country to put well-being over economic pressures.",https://www.newscientist.com/article/2205026-new-zealand-wants-to-make-people-happy-not-rich-will-it-work/,"New Zealand’s priorities are changing REX/Shutterstock

New Zealand’s latest budget, unveiled this week, is being touted as the first in a Western country to put well-being over economic pressures.

The country’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern promised billions of dollars in additional funds to address mental health problems, suicide and child poverty. Almost NZ$2 billion is earmarked for mental health services, following yet another year of the country having the highest teen and young adult suicide rates in Western countries.

As well as boosting existing mental health services, more money will be used to help people with mild or moderate mental health issues before they become an emergency.

Almost NZ$200 million will go to an initiative to provide long-term shelter for people who are homeless, with no strings attached, and more than NZ$1 billion to addressing child poverty.

“Today we have laid the foundation for not just one well-being budget, but a different approach for government decision-making altogether,” Ardern said while unveiling her budget.

The goal is to downplay the importance of gross domestic product (GDP), a measurement of country’s economic activity that is normally seen as a key indicator of success. But despite what Ardern and her team suggest, no budgets are solely about GDP.

“All budgets in pretty much all developed countries are well-being budgets,” says Arthur Grimes of the Motu Economic and Public Policy Research Trust, New Zealand. He notes that the definition of well-being is welfare, and virtually every budget allocates money to services such as poverty, mental health and housing.

Grimes is also sceptical about how well-being will be measured, with around 60 different indicators proposed. “In my view that’s a really scattergun approach,” he says.

Child poverty is the only metric being tracked, he says, making it difficult to assess whether the budget will achieve what it is designed to do.

One way of tracking well-being is to ask people how they rate their lives overall. But a limitation is that it might take several years for policies to shift the population’s aggregated well-being up or down compared to other countries – beyond the short time-frame politicians operate in.

Nevertheless, the government could still use these self-reported questionnaires to assess specific interventions, for example, someone’s well-being before and after they move into public housing, Grimes suggests.

New Zealand is actually not the first country to prioritise well-being. The Kingdom of Bhutan has discussed the need to value happiness over economic growth since the 1970s, and made it official with its “gross national happiness index” in 2008.

The French launched a well-being framework following a 2009 report commissioned by then-president Nicholas Sarkozy, that led to ongoing tracking of “new indicators of wealth”. These include poverty, education, healthy life expectancy, income inequality and carbon footprint.

The UK also had a short-lived attempt at bringing well-being to the forefront under former prime minister David Cameron. While it hasn’t overtaken GDP in budget discussions, the UK’s Office for National Statistics continues to track well-being, giving useful insights into the population’s life satisfaction, happiness, employment levels and more.

Perhaps the key difference is that New Zealand says it is placing well-being at the heart of the budget. It might take many years for the machinery of government to come around to it, but the reframing of a country’s success could start there."
"Coca-Cola grants permission to two men In Beaumont, Texas -- a city with no water -- to steal bottled water from the company's warehouse",http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/christopher-maag/2017/09/03/beaumont-tx-city-no-water-two-men-get-coca-colas-permission-steal/629965001/,"Beaumont, Texas: In a city with no water, two men get Coca-Cola's permission to steal it

Christopher Maag | NorthJersey

Show Caption Hide Caption Video: Man saved by hovercraft Cody Adams of Beaumont, TX tried to cross State Route 96 when he was caught in a rough current and had to hold onto the median until Bill Zang rescued him with his hovercraft in Beaumont on Saturday, September 2, 2017.

In a city with no water, here is a list of items required to break into a warehouse and steal 14 cases of bottled water:

One (1) hand saw

One (1) hammer

One (1) hovercraft, capable of zinging over the flooded streets of Beaumont, Texas, at 60 miles an hour.

Oh, and permission from the Coca-Cola Company.

Fortunately, Bill Zang recently found himself equipped with all four things. At a few minutes after 3 p.m. on Saturday he killed the hovercraft’s engines and floated toward the Coca-Cola warehouse on the northern edge of Beaumont. At the back gate, Zang hacked the lock with a saw, then his friend Sam Byers slammed the lock with a hammer.

The lock broke. The gate swung wide. Both men laughed.

“This is so much fun!” said Byers, happy finally to find water in Beaumont, where the water treatment plant had been offline for two days.

Story continues after this collection of Harvey video reports:

A week after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, most of the rescue and recovery efforts in south Texas are no fun at all. The work is simultaneously plodding and emotionally charged. Relief workers spend days floating through flooded neighborhoods, checking and rechecking houses to make sure all the people and pets have been evacuated.

Sometimes they rescue a cat. Sometimes they discover a corpse. Sometimes they find nothing but flooded homes and silence. At this point, as the adrenaline of early rescue efforts fades into fatigue, many rescuers find the inertia of routine becomes their primary fuel.

“I have no idea when we got here,” said Zang, president of the Hovercraft Unlimited company, who drove from his home in Rockport, Illinois, with two hovercraft to help rescue hurricane victims. “What was that, two days ago? Four? The days all start running together after a while.”

Sometimes, however, the routines get scrambled, and relief workers get the opportunity to do something they will remember for the rest of their lives. Their stories serve as a reminder that even though the sky over south Texas has brightened, and the nation’s attention has begun to move on with the rain, thousands of people are still in desperate need of help.

“There is still a lot of work to do,” Zang said.

For Edwin Toy, the break in the monotony came Thursday night, when he was the lead driver of a 16-truck convoy delivering bottled water from Houston to Beaumont. The trip normally takes about an hour and a half, Toy said.

On Thursday it took 10 hours. Toy sat in the cab of his truck with water lapping halfway up his gas tank.

“We just had to get through,” said Toy, 53, a driver for the H-E-B Grocery Company. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget it.”

Split reality after Harvey: Houston wet vs. dry While most Houston residents are moving on with their lives a little more than week after Hurricane Harvey, hundreds of homes remain flooded and more than a thousand remain housed in emergency shelters. (Sept. 5)

For Cassidy Meeks, the adrenaline came from running up and down U.S. Route 69 northeast of Beaumont, looking for people to save. At 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, Meeks met a woman at a nearby Shell gas station who said her brother was trapped on the highway by water rushing from the flooded Pine Island Bayou.

Meeks didn’t have any special gear at her disposal. She simply started walking. She went north as far as she could, hugging the highway’s concrete median for support as the water rose to her neck.

Finally she turned around and flagged down Zang, aboard his bright blue hovercraft.

“He’s out there somewhere, but I can’t find him,” Meeks, 20, of Joshua, Texas, told Zang. “We’ve got to find him. It sounds like he’s about to drown.”

Zang was not excited about the mission. The current was moving at about 15 miles an hour, he said, and one mistake could drown both himself and the man he was trying to save. He roared off anyway, sending a plume of spray behind his craft’s main propeller.

Seven minutes later Zang returned with Cory Adams, looking wet and sheepish, sitting in the backseat.

""He was in the nasty part"" of the water flow, said Zang. ""If you fall in there, you're swept away for 2 miles and nobody will ever find you.""

No one else in the vicinity had a boat powerful enough to even get close to Adams, however. He had been in the torrent for an hour, he said, and he was losing strength.

""I thought I was going to drown,"" said Adams. ""If he didn't come and save me, there's no way I would have made it.""

Compared with most of his rescue missions after Hurricane Harvey, Zang’s effort to remove water from the Coca-Cola warehouse was a bit of a lark. Someone with the Coca-Cola Company informed Beaumont’s Fire Department that the facility contained thousands of bottles of fresh water, but flooding in and around the building prevented people in most vehicles from entering and retrieving it.

President Trump has a button on his desk for getting Coca-Cola In case you never noticed, there’s a button on President Trump’s desk. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains what it does.

The firefighters asked Zang if he could help, he said. And so he and Byers found themselves standing behind the Coca-Cola warehouse a few minutes after 3 p.m. After entering the gate they motored to the building, where Byers broke a window with a hammer, reached inside and pulled a door open.

Inside they found tens of thousands of bottles of Fanta, Dr. Pepper, Coca-Cola and Dasani brand bottled water. They loaded 14 cases of water onto the hovercraft’s flat deck, powered up and sped away. The cases later would be picked up by other volunteers and delivered to National Guard troops, who would distribute them to Harvey evacuees."
Trader Joe’s Phasing Out Single-Use Plastics Nationwide Following Customer Petition,https://www.ecowatch.com/trader-joes-plastic-waste-2630818452.html,"As the world suffocates from its plastic addiction, a growing number of businesses are stepping up to the plate to reduce their plastic waste. Most recently, Trader Joe's announced that it will be taking steps to cut back on plastic and other packaging waste after a petition launched by Greenpeace harnessed nearly 100,000 signatures.



At the end of last year, the company announced several improvements geared towards making packaging more sustainable in an effort to eliminate more than 1 million pounds of plastic from stores. Already, the retailer has stopped offering single-use plastic carryout bags nationwide and is replacing plastic produce bags and Styrofoam meat trays with biodegradable and compostable options.

""As a neighborhood grocery store, we feel it is important for us to be the great neighbor our customers deserve. Part of that means better managing our environmental impact,"" Kenya Friend-Daniel, public relations director for Trader Joe's, told EcoWatch in an email. ""As we recently shared with our customers, we are working to reduce the amount of packaging in our stores and while we have made a number of positive changes in this space, the world is ongoing.""

Each year, enough plastic is thrown away to circle the earth a whopping four times. Despite that, just one-quarter of plastics produced in the U.S. is recycled even though recycling plastic takes 88 percent less energy than making it from raw materials. If just three-quarters of plastics were recycled, the Recycling Coalition of Utah says people could save an estimated 1 billion gallons of oil and 44 million cubic yards of landfill space annually.

""Every minute of every single day the equivalent of a truckload of plastic enters our oceans. Not only are these plastics hurting or killing marine animals, they are impacting all of us through our seafood, sea salt, tap water, and even the air we breathe,"" Greenpeace U.S.A. plastics campaigner David Pinsky told EcoWatch. ""We know that we can't recycle our way out of this crisis, as only 9 percent of the plastics ever made have actually been recycled.""

In recent years, a number of companies have taken the lead in reducing plastic waste, including United Kingdom food retailer A.S.D.A., who plans to remove single-use cups and cutlery this year. McDonald's says that 100 percent of its packaging will come from renewable, recycled or certified sustainable sources within the next seven years while water company Evian plans to go carbon neutral and plastic free by 2020. It's a solid start in battling the so-called ""war on plastics,"" one that Trader Joe's says is just a small part of its ""never-ending work.""

Indeed, plastic has been found on every continent – including Antarctica – and at the bottom of the world's deepest waters.

""For far too long, corporations have deflected blame and made the issue of plastics about individual responsibility, but it's time for the world's largest corporations and retailers to show some accountability. The only way we are going to tackle this crisis is by pressuring corporations and governments to move away from throwaway plastics for good, and toward systems of reuse,"" said Pinsky.

Correction: An earlier version of this article indicated the wrong link for the Greenpeace petition. The link has been corrected."
'I never saw stars before': Gene therapy brings back 8-year-old Canadian boy's sight,https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/health/i-never-saw-stars-before-gene-therapy-brings-back-8-year-old-canadian-boy-s-sight-1.5145830,"TORONTO -- For the thousands of Canadians at risk of blindness, eight-year-old Sam is a beacon of hope.

He is the first Canadian to be treated with gene replacement therapy for a rare form of blindness which had left Sam unable to see sky on a cloudy day, and unable to make out shapes in the dark.

“Sometimes you have to walk in the night and I couldn’t see things and you bump into things,” Sam told CTV News.

He had to have lights on always, and had trouble seeing his shoes or objects on the floor. And the condition was progressive, meaning things would get worse as he grew older -- a daunting prospect when there was no treatment available.

But now he can see cloudy skies, shoes and more. The best part of his improved vision, says Sam, are the stars at night.

“I never saw stars before,” he said. “And I also never saw airplanes flying at night.”

He was diagnosed after birth with a genetic disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, a form of genetic retinal degeneration resulting from mutations in the RPE65 gene.

“You lose perception of light,” Dr. Elise Heon, of Sick Kids Hospital, explained to CTV News. “You end up in darkness and [it’s] slowly progressive, it's relentless, your visual field shrinks and shrinks and shrinks and shrinks.”

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects between 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 4,000 Canadians, according to Fighting Blindness Canada. It actually refers to a group of disorders, as there are numerous versions of RP depending on which pair of genes are damaged. More than 64 genes have been identified by scientists as potentially having mutations that cause RP.

Now, Canada has approved the first-ever gene replacement therapy for this form of blindness. Sick Kids Hospital has 29 children in its program with this mutation. The drug can be used on children and adults with the condition, but the earlier it’s used, the more sight it will save, doctors believe.

“It's a huge deal, because for these patients before, there’s no treatments,” Heon said.

She said she had recently met two patients, brothers, who were suffering the same problem as Sam, and for the first time, she was able to provide hope.

“They're 10 years old, and they're losing their vision,” she said. “If we do nothing, they're just going, fine, they'll just end up with no light reception. So for the first time [we were] able to say, well, actually we need to have a discussion. And it was just, it was priceless.”

The gene therapy, which goes by the brand name Luxturna, was developed in the U.S by the drug company Spark Therapeutics.

It works by placing a copy of the healthy gene into inactivated viruses, which are then injected into the retina. The gene then allows cells to produce the necessary protein to convert light into an electrical signal in the retina in order to provide healthy vision and prevent progression of the disease.

It is the first targeted gene therapy to be approved by Health Canada, which gave it the all-clear this week.

Back in 2019, Sam and his family travelled to the U.S to get the new gene therapy because it wasn’t available in Canada yet.

His mother, Sarah Banon, noticed changes quickly.

“About a week later, I noticed he could get dressed by [himself],” she said. “He could get his shoes on by himself, independently.”

His improvements have continued in the year since he first received the gene therapy.

“He is so much more confident,” his mother told CTV News. “Like getting dressed by himself, matching clothes, doesn’t have to have things enlarged. Being able to [see], even when it’s dark outside, no lights on and it is a cloudy day. He would have to, at school, keep the lights on.

“Now he is able to function as a normal child.”

With the approval of this gene therapy in Canada, doctors are hoping to be able to use it on more patients who qualify -- and the earlier the better.

Dr. Peter Kertes, a vitreo-retinal surgeon and Ophthalmologist-in-Chief at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, told CTV News that the approval of the therapy is “fantastic.”

“This is a huge breakthrough,” he said. “Most of the advances that we have in medicine are incremental. Every once in a while, once in a generation, something revolutionary like this comes along that really changes the course of therapy.”

Luxturna specifically treats individuals with biallelic mutations of the RPE65 gene -- meaning they have mutations in that gene stemming from both parents -- which manifests as either RP or Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). It’s a very small patient group compared to the entirety of Canadians with inherited retinal diseases.

This may be just one gene therapy for one condition, but it will open to the door to this strategy being used in other scenarios, Kertes pointed out.

“This is the tip of the iceberg. I think this is a vector that will prove to be very effective and holds great promise,” he said. “I think many people who are living with blindness or facing blindness, have much to look forward to. I think we're on the cusp of a revolution in this group of diseases.”

The company licensing the therapy, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc., isn’t detailing the cost, but based on the price in the U.S it could top $1.1 million in Canada, making it among the most expensive drugs in the country.

The therapy is currently under review by both the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and the Institut national d’excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS).

Novartis said in a statement that they “look forward to receiving their recommendations following Health Canada’s approval.”

They said they are eager “to help eligible Canadians affected by this rare disease gain access to the first-ever gene replacement therapy as quickly as possible.”

The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board will be disclosing their new guidelines in terms of capping drug prices in an online media briefing this Thursday.

As this will likely be the first of many gene replacement therapies -- with similarly high price tags -- Ottawa and the provinces will have to make the decision on whether it will be covered by provincial health plans. The question is an ongoing ethical debate, with some saying that drug companies will only take advantage of it if governments show that they are willing to pay.

“Should it be the responsibility for the government to pay for any drug at any price?” Marc-André Gagnon, a researcher with Carleton University who looks into pharmaceutical policy, told CTV News. “The problem is, if we say yes to this question, you can be sure that the day after, all the drugs in the market will be asking for much higher prices.”

“It’s a very expensive drug,” Heon acknowledged.

However, she pointed out that this is a rare disease, and it’s “not a recurrent treatment.” It’s a one-time injection to the eyes.

“You treat both eyes and then that’s it,” she said.

“To be able to change someone's life is quite a privilege. And to be able to prevent someone from going blind is a real privilege.”

For Sam and his mother, the gift of independence has been priceless.

“This is a story of hope,” his mother said. “A child told ‘it is what it is.’”

And now, when he looks up at night, he can see stars."

Dorsey, who has a net worth of about $3.3 billion according to Forbes, announced the plan Tuesday on Twitter. He said the $1 billion represents about 28% of his wealth. The funds will be distributed through his Start Small LLC charitable fund.

“Why now? The needs are increasingly urgent, and I want to see the impact in my lifetime,” Dorsey, 43, wrote on Twitter. “I hope this inspires others to do something similar. Life is too short, so let’s do everything we can today to help people now.”

According to a Google Doc that Dorsey set up to disclose his donations, the first funding he contributed was $100,000 on April 2 to America’s Food Fund, an initiative launched by Leonardo DiCaprio, Apple, Laurene Powell Jobs, and the Ford Foundation and backed by Oprah Winfrey to provide food to those in need during the coronavirus crisis.

Dorsey said that “After we disarm this pandemic,” the focus of the fund will shift to two other causes: girls health and education and universal basic income (UBI). That’s because “I believe they represent the best long-term solutions to the existential problems facing the world,” he wrote. “UBI is a great idea needing experimentation. Girl’s health and education is critical to balance.”

Dorsey also explained that he is tapping into his Square holdings because “I own a lot more Square” than Twitter equity, and that he will need to pace sales of the stock “over some time.” He added, “The impact this money will have should benefit both companies over the long-term because it’s helping the people we want to serve.”

According to Dorsey, he has previously donated $40 million to “many orgs with proven impact and efficiency in the past, mostly anonymously” but said he is making his contributions public because, “It’s important to show my work so I and others can learn.”

Dorsey’s dual-CEO status has raised questions among investors about how effectively he’s able to lead Twitter and Square simultaneously. In March, Twitter reached an agreement with activist investor Elliott Management — which reportedly had been looking to oust Dorsey — under which Dorsey remained chief exec of the social network. In addition, private-equity firm Silver Lake invested $1 billion in Twitter, while Twitter also appointed Elliott and Silver Lake execs to its board."

"""Game Of Thrones"" Fans Have Raised More Than $130K For Emilia Clarke's Brain Injury Charity",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/game-of-thrones-charity-fans-emilia-clarke-kit-harington,"HBO / Helen Sloan

A fundraising campaign for Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke's charity SameYou has surpassed its goal of £100,000 (approximately $130,000) in two weeks, with donations pouring in around the world from more than 5,000 fans eager to thank the show's actors for their hard work.



Clarke, who played Daenerys Targaryen, founded the brain injury rehabilitation charity after having two life-threatening aneurysms while filming Game of Thrones.



The idea for the fundraiser — as well as a companion campaign in honor of Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow — was born on Reddit, specifically /r/freefolk, an active, irreverent community (with an incredibly strong meme game) devoted to the show and the Song of Ice and Fire books.



After learning of the fundraiser on May 30, Clarke made an Instagram post thanking fans for raising — at the time — £38,000 for her charity.



""I’m so incredibly moved and blown away and grateful,"" she said. ""[The fundraising campaign] has made my day, week, month, year, decade, and I couldn’t think of a more beautiful way to wave goodbye to the Mother of Dragons than with this step towards making brain injury sufferers feel less alone.""



But on Thursday, SameYou announced that the campaign had reached its goal of £100,000. The charity uploaded a video of a beaming Clarke lip-synching the song ""Simply the Best"" with a caption thanking /r/freefolk and campaign founder, redditor elle_ellaria.



The incredible support of Elle Ellaria, @reddit’s r/FreeFolk and Emilia’s fans worldwide means their campaign has raised over £100,000 for SameYou. Thank you so, so much. As Emilia says, you guys are simply the best! 🧡 #sameyoucharity

In an email to BuzzFeed News on Thursday, elle_ellaria, who asked to only be identified by her first name, Sarah, said that she never expected the fundraiser to raise so much money.



""I truly thought this fundraiser peaked around 35k, so seeing it hit 100k and keep climbing just fills my heart with joy,"" she wrote.



Sarah told BuzzFeed News that the success of these two campaigns is a testament to Game of Thrones fans and their enduring support for the show's cast, regardless of the mixed reactions to the final season. ""Every fandom,"" she said, ""[has people] who love to kill a good thing or veer the passion over into vitriol, but, by and large, the outpouring of love and support has been unmistakable.""



The SayYou fundraiser's success — and the recent news that Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow, had checked into a wellness retreat in the wake of the series finale — inspired another member of /r/freefolk to create a companion campaign so fans could donate to charity in honor of him. This second campaign is raising money for Mencap, a UK-based charity for which Harington is an ambassador that ""works to support people with a learning disability, their families and carers by fighting to change laws, improve services and access to education, employment and leisure facilities."" Harington has spoken previously about his cousin, who has a learning disability, and how their relationship inspired him to work with Mencap. In the week since its creation, the campaign in honor of Harington has received donations totaling more than £42,000 (approximately $53,000) from nearly 2,700 fans."
Muslims Raise More Than $50K For Pittsburgh Synagogue Victims In 6 Hours,https://forward.com/fast-forward/412885/muslims-raise-more-than-50k-for-pittsburgh-synagogue-victims-in-6-hours/?attribution=more-articles-carousel-item-1-headline,"Image by Getty Images

A crowdfunding campaign formed by two Muslim groups has raised more than $180,000 for the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, which killed 11.

Muslim-American non-profits Celebrate Mercy and MPower Change were behind the campaign, “Muslims Unite For Pittsburgh Synagogue.” It is also in partnership with the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh.

The campaign reached its initial goal of $25,000 goal in six hours. As of press time, it raised $183,287, exceeding its $150,000 goal. The proceeds will help with funeral expenses and medical bills.

“We wish to respond to evil with good, as our faith instructs us, and send a powerful message of compassion through action,” the campaign reads. “Our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: ‘Show mercy to those on earth, and the One in the Heavens will show mercy to you.’ The Quran also teaches us to ‘Repel evil by that which is better’ (41:34).”

Messages of solidarity were shared throughout the day Sunday.

"Cities may not prosecute homeless people for sleeping outside if they have no access to shelter, appeals court rules",http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-homeless-9th-circuit-20180904-story.html,"Prosecuting homeless people for sleeping on public property when they have no access to shelter violates the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, a federal appeals court decided Tuesday.

The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned a district court decision in favor of the city of Boise, Idaho, in a case in which homeless people challenged two city ordinances that barred them from staying overnight on public property.

The ruling will protect the homeless not only in Boise but in California and other Western states from ordinances that punish them for being unable to obtain shelter.

The challengers, who had been cited under the Boise ordinances, sought damages and a court order barring the city from enforcing the laws.

After the litigation began, the Boise Police Department decided in 2010 to prohibit enforcement of the ordinances against any homeless person on public property on a night when no shelter had “an available overnight space.”

Police continued to cite homeless people on nights when there was availability in the shelters.

The 9th Circuit, though, cited evidence that some shelters limited the number of days a homeless person could stay or turned away people who arrived past certain hours.

Others required a religious commitment, the court said.

“A city cannot, via the threat of prosecution, coerce an individual to attend religion-based treatment programs,” Judge Marsha S. Berzon wrote for the court.

Even though the shelters had beds, some homeless people did not have access to them, the court noted.

Tuesday’s decision reinstated a 2006 9th Circuit ruling in a challenge to a Los Angeles homeless law. A settlement was eventually reached in the Los Angeles case, and the ruling lost its value as a precedent.

The panel hearing the Boise challenge said it agreed with the ruling in the Los Angeles case and reiterated that the homeless may not be held criminally responsible for sleeping on government property when no alternative shelter was available.

“The 8th Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter,” Berzon wrote.

The court said its holding was narrow. It does not require a city to allow anyone on public property at any time or mandate that cities provide adequate shelter.

Rather, the court said, “as long as there is no option of sleeping indoors, the government cannot criminalize indigent, homeless people for sleeping outdoors, on public property, on the false premise they had a choice in the matter.”

In a partial dissent, Judge John B. Owens wrote that he agreed with most of the ruling but would have limited some of the plaintiffs’ claims.

Indian fishermen are pulling Plastic from the Oceans to build roads and have removed 25 tonnes of plastic from the Arabian Sea in first 10 months.,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/these-indian-fishermen-take-plastic-out-of-the-sea-and-use-it-to-build-roads,"Every one of India’s 1.3 billion people uses an average 11kg of plastic each year. After being used, much of this plastic finds its way to the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, where it can maim and kill fish, birds and other marine wildlife.

Fisherman in India’s southern state of Kerala are taking on the battle to cut the level of plastic waste in the oceans.

When the trawlers drag their nets through the water, they end up scooping out huge amounts of plastic along with the fish. Until recently the fishermen would simply throw the plastic junk back into the water.

But last summer Kerala’s fisheries minister J. Mercykutty Amma started a scheme to change this. Under her direction, the state government launched a campaign called Suchitwa Sagaram, or Clean Sea, which trains fishermen to collect the plastic and bring it back to shore.

In Suchitwa Sagaram’s first 10 months, fisherman have removed 25 tonnes of plastic from the Arabian Sean, including 10 tonnes of plastic bags and bottles, according to a UN report on the scheme.

From waste to roads

Once all the plastic waste caught by the Keralan fishermen reaches the shore, it is collected by people from the local fishing community - all but two of whom are women - and fed into a plastic shredding machine.

Like so many of India’s plastic recycling schemes, this shredded plastic is converted into material that is used for road surfacing.



There are more than 34,000km of plastic roads in India, mostly in rural areas. More than half of the roads in the southern state of Tamil Nadu are plastic. This road surface is increasingly popular as it makes the roads more resilient to India’s searing heat. The melting point for plastic roads is around 66°C, compared to 50°C for conventional roads.

Using recycled plastic is a cheaper alternative to conventional plastic additives for road surfaces. Every kilometre of plastic road uses the equivalent of a million plastic bags, saving around one tonne of asphalt. Each kilometre costs roughly 8% less than a conventional road.

And plastic roads help create work. As well as the Keralan fishing crews, teams of on-land plastic pickers across India collect the plastic waste. They sell their plastic to the many small plastic shredding businesses that have popped up across the country.

Plastics ban

The need for schemes such as Suchitwa Sagaram is emphasised by research that shows 90% of the plastic waste in the world’s oceans is carried there by just 10 rivers - two of which are in India.

According to a study by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, India’s Indus and Ganges rivers carry the second and sixth highest amounts of plastic debris to the ocean. The Indian Ocean, meanwhile, is choked with the second highest amount of plastic out of all of the world’s oceans.

Like Kerala’s fisheries minister, Indian politicians appear to be taking action in the face of this mounting crisis.

This month India’s prime minister Narendra Modi pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022, starting with an immediate ban in urban Delhi.

The move came just three months after India’s western state of Maharashtra issued a ban virtually all types of plastic bag, disposable cutlery, cups and dishes, as well as plastic containers and packaging.

Residents face fines from 5,000 rupees (US$73) for a first time offence to 25,000 rupees ($367) and jail time for repeat offenders, while the state’s Environment Department is also encouraging people to recycle bottles and milk bags through a buy-back scheme.

While’s India’s plastic problem is substantial due to the size of its population and its rate of economic growth, schemes such as those in Maharashtra, Delhi and Kerala set an example to western nations.

In the US, for example each person on average generates up to 10 times the amount of plastic waste generated by their Indian counterpart."
Tennessee becomes first state in the South with hate crime law protecting transgender people,https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/14/tennessee-transgender-lgbt-hate-crime-protection/2869223002/,"Tennessee becomes first state in the South with hate crime law protecting transgender people

Natalie Allison | The Tennessean

Show Caption Hide Caption What does being transgender mean? People who are called ""transgender"" have a gender identity or expression that differs from the gender typically associated with the sex that they were assigned at birth.

Tennessee has become the first state in the South with a hate crime statute protecting transgender individuals.

State Attorney General Herbert Slatery issued an opinion Feb. 8 in response to a question posed by Rep. Mike Stewart, D-Nashville.

""A defendant who targets a person for a crime because that person is transgender has targeted the person because of his or her gender within the meaning"" of the current state law that outlines sentence enhancements for hate crimes, Slatery wrote.

Tennessee does not have an explicit hate crime charge, though the General Assembly in 2000 added a hate crime factor to judges' sentencing rules for crimes targeting a person based on race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry or gender.

Slatery's decision affirms that transgender individuals should be covered under the existing law, but must still be tested in court in a case involving bias against a transgender victim.

Stewart sought clarification from Slatery on whether transgender people would be covered after a discussion last year in a Senate committee regarding a bill filed by Sen. Sara Kyle, D-Memphis, to add gender identity and expression to Tennessee's hate crime sentencing law.

The bill failed to move but raised the question about whether transgender individuals are already included under the gender protection.

Stewart said that in light of the attorney general's opinion, he would take a wait-and-see approach before suggesting that the legislature alter the statute or develop an explicit hate crime charge.

""Let's see how the courts actually utilize the law in practice and let's see how much protection it provides,"" Stewart said.

Authorities in Cookeville in 2016 said they would not investigate as a hate crime a case that involved a transgender woman's truck being set on fire after someone wrote ""Trump"" on the vehicle's hood.

The Putnam County Sheriff's Office said at the time that the vandalism did ""not fit the criteria of a hate crime.""

Chris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ rights advocacy organization, said they worked with Stewart to seek the opinion.

""What we as a community were all telling ourselves was nothing could be done in Tennessee as far as a penalty enhancement, if the perpetrator were even caught,"" Sanders, said of the 2016 case.

He said he is pleased with Slatery's ruling and is hopeful that it will be applied as future cases involving transgender victims move forward with sentencing.

In addition to hate crime sentencing enhancement, in Tennessee, certain hate crimes can be prosecuted as a felony under the Civil Rights Intimidation Act, a statute violation that can be difficult to prove.

A Teacher in India buys a bus and becomes a bus driver to make sure no one drops out of school,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/udupi-teacher-buys-bus-turns-driver-all-ensure-students-don-t-drop-out-school-84350,"Udupi teacher buys bus, turns driver - all to ensure students don’t drop out of school

Students in Baarali began dropping out as they had to trek through 3km of forest area.

news Human Interest

For students of Baarali village in Udupi district’s Brahmavar taluk, Rajaram is not just their science and mathematics teacher but also the one person, who ensured that they did not drop out of school.

The students in Baarali and surrounding villages began dropping out of the Baarali Government Higher Primary School over a year ago as the children had to trek through 3-km of forest area to reach the school.

“There are no roads from the houses of the children to the school. There is a mud path through the forest and most of the girl students began dropping out as their families were scared of allowing their children to walk for a total of 6 km to and from school,” Rajaram says.

Saddened by the state of affairs, Rajaram reached out to one of the school’s former students – Vijay Hegde, who runs a property management company in Bengaluru.

“The children were dropping out quickly and with the head count in our school falling low, we were at the threat of shutting down too. One evening, I had finished counting how many children had dropped out and I was upset. Every week at least five to six students were not turning up. I called up one of our former students – Vijay Hegde and proposed the idea of buying a bus to pick up and drop the children,” Rajaram says.

Around six months ago, Vijay Hegde, another alumna of the school Ganesh Shetty and Rajaram pooled in money and bought a bus for the school. Appointing a driver would have cost Rajaram at least Rs 7,000, which he could not afford, so he decided to drive the bus himself.

“I live on the meagre salary of a government school teacher. I could not afford to pay for a driver. Hence, I decided that I would learn how to drive the bus and do the task myself,” he adds.

Rajaram also got himself a license to drive the bus and he began the pick-up and drop service for the students. Once the pick-up and drop facility began, the school’s strength increased from 50 to 90.

Every morning, Rajaram leaves home early in the morning and completes four pick-up trips by 9.20 am.

“The school starts at 9.30 am and I make sure that all students are on time. There are three teachers including me and a headmistress in our school. One of the teachers comes to school before the students from the first trip reach school. The teachers stay back in school until all the students are dropped off and I come back to park the bus,” Rajaram says.

Rajaram spends money from his own pocket on vehicle insurance and diesel for the bus. Now, he wants to construct a track for the school so the students can practice 100 m and 200 m sprints for track events.

“I am thinking of constructing a fence around the school and also a track so children can practise sports. The problem is I don’t have enough money. I have reached out to the alumni of the school and asked if they will help. So far, there is money trouble but I am sure we will surpass that hurdle as well. The children will be motivated to attend classes if there are sports and other activities,” Rajaram added."
"Former slave escaped to US, went on to compete twice in the Olympics, joins Air Force to give back",https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/02/23/former-slave-two-time-olympian-becomes-airman.html,"After enduring countless hardships and overcoming unimaginable obstacles, Airman 1st Class Guor Maker, a dental assistant currently in technical training, found his way out of war-torn South Sudan, Africa and into the U.S. nearly 20 years ago.

Surviving

As one of roughly 20,000 children uprooted by the gruesome Second Sudanese Civil War, Maker's childhood was far from normal. After losing 28 family members, including eight of his nine siblings, 8-year-old Maker set out on foot from South Sudan to live with his uncle.

""The country I came from was torn apart by war,"" said Maker. ""It was all I knew growing up, nothing else. I've seen people die in front of me, but I knew no matter what, I had to make it.""

During his harrowing journey, Maker was captured and enslaved twice: once by Sudanese soldiers, and once by herdsmen.

""When I was captured, I was forced to be a slave laborer,"" said Maker. ""I would wash dishes or do anything else needed to get by. I slept in a small cell and rarely got to eat...but not always.""

Both times, Maker successfully escaped from enslavement and was finally able to join his uncle in Khartoum after three perilous years. However, his journey to safety was far from over.

During a nighttime attack on the perceived safety of his uncle's home, Maker sustained serious injuries when he was beaten unconscious by a soldier who smashed his jaw with a rifle.

""My mouth was shut for two months and I could only consume liquids because my jaw was broken,"" he said. ""We fled to Egypt after that, and the United Nations treated my injuries.""

After two years of filling out paperwork at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Egypt, Maker and his uncle's family were finally granted permission to enter the United States.

""I was very excited to come to the U.S.,"" said Maker. ""Looking back at everything my family and I endured, it is a miracle that we made it out of there.""

Dreaming

When Maker first arrived in the U.S. in 2001, he settled in Concord, New Hampshire. Not only did he want to survive, but he wanted to thrive.

""I wanted to change my life, help my parents back in South Sudan, and give my future children a better childhood than the one I had,"" he said. ""And the only way to do that was through education and determination.""

Maker started with the basics and began learning English by watching children's cartoons and spending plenty of time with other high school kids just listening to their conversations and absorbing all that he could.

""Within a short amount of time, I was able to communicate with effectively with other students and teachers, order food, and really get by on my own,"" Maker said.

While learning English was a crucial step on his personal journey, Maker's high school career really took off when one of his teachers introduced him to running.

""Running was always just natural and easy for me,"" said Maker. ""It was a great high school experience and it helped me meet a lot of friends, build confidence and it was genuinely fun.""

After winning the National High School indoor two-mile title, Maker received a scholarship to compete at Iowa State University, where he allowed himself to dream of things that had never been done before.

""When I got to college in 2005, I remember hanging a piece of paper on my wall that said I was going to run in the Olympics in 2012 for South Sudan,"" said Maker. ""I thought 'Why not me? Why can't I do it?'""

Maker graduated with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry and reached All-American status as a student athlete, Ready to start his new life. Maker planned to head to Flagstaff, Arizona to train for the 2012 Olympics.

The same day he left for Arizona in 2011 was the day South Sudan officially gained its independence.

""I drove the whole way celebrating and it was a very special day that I will always remember,"" said Maker.

Following his year of training, Maker qualified to run the marathon in the 2012 Olympics in London.

Even though South Sudan officially gained its independence, the country was not yet a member of the International Olympic Committee and Maker was still not an official U.S. citizen.

""State senators from New Hampshire and Arizona presented my case to the Senate in Washington D.C. so the International Olympic Committee allowed me to run in the Olympics without a country,"" said Maker.

Even though his dream of running for South Sudan had not yet come true, Maker accomplished a great deal as an unaffiliated Olympian.

""All of the people in South Sudan knew where I was from,"" said Maker. ""I wanted to be the inspiration for the children to say, 'Hey, if Maker can do it, you know what, I can do it too.'""

After the 2012 Olympics, Maker was undeterred and set a new goal for himself and his country.

""I said to myself, 'In 2016, I'm going to bring South Sudan to the Olympics for the first time,'"" said Maker. ""I wanted to try to do more for my country and the 2012 Olympics only strengthened my conviction to accomplish my goal.""

This time around Maker's dream became a reality in Rio de Janeiro 2016 when he became one of three athletes to be the first to represent South Sudan in an Olympic games, as well as South Sudan's flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

""Walking into that stadium, carrying the South Sudan flag was just indescribable,"" said Maker. ""The people of South Sudan were in my mind the whole time I was running into the stadium with that flag and it meant so much to me.""

While it was a truly incredible and improbable moment for Maker, his thoughts were filled with the people of his home country while he was running with that flag.

""Over 50 years of civil war and my country finally got independence,"" said Maker. ""So many lives were lost for our freedom, it was just ringing in my head that we have done it, we have done it. On that day, everyone in South Sudan was at peace watching the Olympics for the first time.""

The 2016 Olympics were an enormous accomplishment for the former slave and South Sudan native that went far beyond his 82nd overall finish.

""I couldn't have accomplished any of it without all the support I received from my family and the opportunity the United States gave me. It's the highlight of my athletic career so far and a moment I'll treasure forever.""

Serving

The next chapter in Maker's life began when he decided to join the U.S. Air Force to serve the country that gave him so many opportunities.

""All of the things I've accomplished have derived from the opportunities the U.S. has afforded me,"" said Maker. ""When I first came to America, I didn't have hardly anything, but with the support and opportunity this country has given me, I've been able to completely change my life.""

The staff at basic military training had no idea who Maker was, but he quickly stood out to leadership at the 324th Training Squadron.

""I went out to the track and saw the instructors were putting their attention on one trainee in particular,"" said Maj. John Lippolis, director of operations for the 324th TRS. ""I could see him running noticeably faster than everyone else and the instructors explained to me that we had a two-time Olympian at BMT.""

In addition to Maker's Olympian status, his unique personal story also stood out Lippolis.

""I was just absolutely floored when I talked to him about what he went through to get to where he is today,"" said Lippolis. ""Not only did he get survive, he wanted to better himself and he has accomplished so much. He has an amazing story and the drive he has displayed to succeed like that in the face of such adversity is truly inspiring.""

Maker not only inspired Lippolis, but other members of his flight were inspired too.

""All of his wingmen said the same things when I talked to them,"" said Lippolis. ""They told me what an inspiration he was within the flight; that the flight rallied around him and he doesn't do anything he's supposed to do for himself until he helps out everybody else.""

While Maker has accomplished a great deal in his lifetime, he's not done dreaming.

Maker hopes to join the Air Force World Class Athlete Program, a program designed to allow elite athletes the opportunity to train and compete in national events to make the Olympics.

Redditors of the Marvel Studios subreddit are trying to start a Campaign to allow a fellow redditor who is terminally ill to see an early Screening of Avengers: Endgame,https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/01/05/cancer-patient-avengers-endgame-early-access-reddit-rally/,"Earlier today, Reddit began to rally around a member of /r/MarvelStudios who's been battling cancer. Reddit member /u/alexander_q posted earlier today that he's suffering from three types of cancer and the Marvel Studios subreddit instantly banded together in hopes of getting him an early screening of Avengers: Endgame.

Jumping to the top of /r/MarvelStudios, alexander_q posted he's suffering from cancer of the liver and mouth in addition to bone marrow failure. In response, the post has started being passed around various circles in hopes that it gets noticed by either Joe and Anthony Russo — directors behind Endgame — or Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige.

""I'm not a child or anyone with a particularly tragic story,"" Alexander detailed in his post. ""Just a normal guy. I'm 33, lost my sister three years ago to the same rare genetic disease it turns out I have too. I'll behind a devoted girlfriend and an adopted greyhound.""

The post has attracted enough attention so far that a vendor working on visual effects for the movie has shared they'll do everything in their power to escalate the post up the VFX food chain.

""I'm currently working on Endgame in London,"" /u/Tinoh revealed. ""And will try and pass this message up the VFX ladder.""

Tinoh went on to offer alexander_q his cast and crew screening ticket to the premiere of Avengers: Endgame, typically held a week or so prior to its release date. Also in the thread, fans are trying to put together an organized effort on Twitter using the #Avengers4Alexander hashtag.

Marvel Studios and Disney have previously demonstrated going out of there way to accommodate the final wishes of fans before. It's just a matter of fans giving the right push to bring the situation to light in front of the right executives at Disney.

Our thoughts are with Alexander and his family during this time.

"New York City bans foam containers, coffee cups and more in landmark legislation",https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-city-bans-foam-containers-coffee-cups-in-landmark-legislation,"New York City is taking a stand against foam.

The nation’s largest city has officially banned foam containers, coffee cups and packing peanuts, among other items made from expanded polystyrene, New York Magazine reported.

The legislation, which was first approved by lawmakers in 2013, went into effect on Tuesday. The delay was largely a result of the city's restaurant industry, which filed a lawsuit in an attempt to prevent the so-called “foam ban"" because it is made of a low-cost material. Those against the ban also argued expanded polystyrene could possibly be recycled, according to the publication. However, the ban was approved by a judge in June.

The city’s department of sanitation says online that businesses across New York City have until June 30 to dispose of their plastic foam items or they could face fines up to $1,000.

“For our planet’s future, New York City is kicking off 2019 as a styrofoam-free town!” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter.

That said, some business are exempt from the foam ban. Butchers who use the containers to store raw meat or fish will not be affected by the measure and non-profit and small business owners may also be exempt in some cases, according to New York Magazine."
People Are Picking Up Trash in Parks and Beaches for the 'Trashtag Challenge',http://time.com/5548966/trashtag/,"As online challenges go, #trashtag, which went viral on social media over the weekend, is a pretty wholesome one. Hundreds of people shared photos of themselves litter-picking in trash-strewn parks and streets on Saturday and Sunday, while calling on others to start cleaning up their communities.

The idea for #trashtag has been around for several years, with one company promoting the idea back in 2015 as a way to protect threatened wilderness areas.

But it gathered steam over the weekend, as users on Instagram, Reddit and Twitter shared dramatically different before and after photos of one wooded area where a man bagged up hundreds of plastic objects — accompanied with an invitation to find a place “that needs some cleaning or maintenance” and “take a photo when you have done something about it.”

The idea soon spread, with some social media users incorporating “trashtag” into their weekend trips.

Others cleaned up in their local communities.

Many added a message explaining why movements like #trashtag are needed to protect natural landscapes.

Show Caption Hide Caption Vomit-repellant sneakers are now a reality Adidas has unveiled a pair of new limited-edition sneakers, which are resistant to both beer and vomit. The Germany company unveiled the shoes just in time for Oktoberfest.

Adidas sold 1 million shoes made out of ocean plastic last year, CEO Kasper Rorsted told CNBC on Wednesday.

The German sportswear giant launched last year three new versions of its UltraBoost shoe made out of plastic found in the ocean. It teamed up with environmental initiative Parley for the Oceans to create the shoe.

At the time, Adidas said it wanted to create a million pairs of the UltraBoost shoes.

""We last year sold 1 million shoes made out of ocean plastic,"" Rorsted told CNBC in a TV interview.

Each pair of shoes reuses 11 plastic bottles.

Adidas reported quarterly earnings on Wednesday in which it said it expected another year of sales and profit growth, but at a slower pace than in 2017.

"Microsoft will require suppliers to offer paid parental leave - In a move that could prompt more companies to offer paid parental leave, Microsoft is announcing today that it will require all of its U.S.-based suppliers and vendors with more than 50 employees to offer such benefits.",https://www.axios.com/microsoft-require-suppliers-offer-paid-parental-leave-dc573198-123c-4c51-ab78-432863003165.html,"In a move that could prompt more companies to offer paid parental leave, Microsoft is announcing today that it will require all of its U.S.-based suppliers and vendors with more than 50 employees to offer such benefits.

Why it matters: Many leading companies offer paid leave, but others need a push. History shows that when progressive companies require benefits or policies from their suppliers, it can help increase adoption. Microsoft's move alone will mean many thousands of new workers getting paid parental leave, as the company has more than 1,000 partners in the U.S.

Some states already have laws offering or mandating paid parental leave, including California. Microsoft's home state of Washington has also enacted paid parental leave that will go into effect in 2020.

""As we looked at this legislation, however, we realized that while it will benefit the employees of our suppliers in Washington state, it will leave thousands of valued contributors outside of Washington behind,"" Microsoft general counsel Dev Stahlkopf said in a blog post. ""So, we made a decision to apply Washington’s parental leave requirement more broadly, and not to wait until 2020 to begin implementation.""

What they're saying: Activists praised the move, with the National Partnership for Women & Families VP Vicki Shabo calling it bold and impressive. ""It showcases the ripple effects that state-level public policy changes — like Washington state's paid family and medical leave program adopted last year — can have in changing private sector practice and behavior,"" she said.

History lesson: It's not the first time Microsoft has required suppliers to offer specific benefits. Three years ago the company insisted that its partners offer full-time workers at least 15 days of paid time off each year."

President Bachelet signs ‘unprecedented’ measure into law

Chile has created five sprawling national parks to preserve vast tracts of Patagonia – the culmination of more than two decades of land acquisition by the US philanthropists Doug Tompkins and Kristine McDivitt Tompkins and the largest donation of private land to government in South America.

The five parks, spanning 10.3m acres, were signed into law on Monday by Chile’s president Michelle Bachelet, launching a new 17-park route that stretches down the southern spine of Chile to Cape Horn.

McDivitt Tompkins, the former chief executive of the outdoors company Patagonia, handed over 1m acres to help create the new parks. The Chilean government provided the rest in federally controlled land.

McDivitt Tompkins has spent 25 years working on land conservation in Chile with her late husband Doug, who founded North Face and Esprit. Doug Tompkins died in a kayaking accident in Chile in 2015.

“This is not just an unprecedented act of preservation,” said Bachelet, who flew to this remote Patagonian valley on Monday to receive the donation. “It is an invitation to imagine other forms to use our land. To use natural resources in a way that does not destroy them. To have sustainable development – the only profitable economic development in the long term.”

The creation of the parks marks the latest in a flurry of environmental protection laws which have brought Chile to the forefront of worldwide conservation efforts.

Last month, Bachelet – who leaves office in March – completed a five-year negotiation with residents of Easter Island to form one of the world’s largest Marine Protected areas, which will protect some 720,000 sq km of the Pacific Ocean.

“President Bachelet is leaving behind a bold legacy of environmental protection,” said Maximiliano Bello, an advisor to the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy program.

“This is more impressive because Chile is still a developing country, with a long history of development and exploitation of resources – in most cases over-exploitation. If Chile can take these huge environmental steps, there are few reasons why developed nations can’t act as well.”



After moving to Chile from California in the early 1990s, the Tompkinses spent hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and “rewild” swaths of land.

The approach hasn’t been without controversy: some locals bristled at what they considered a clumsy American land grab. Loggers and ranchers complained that valuable land was taken, and the couple were also criticized for successfully agitating to prevent a huge hydroelectric scheme.

Relations have improved in recent years, with the handover of hundreds of thousands of acres to the Chilean national park service. McDivitt Tompkins has touted the ecotourism potential of a region of stunning beauty, with glaciated fjords, roaring rivers, snow-capped mountains and coastal volcanoes.

In the windswept Valle Chacabuco, the couple transformed a rundown sheep ranch into the world-class Parque Patagonia. First, they removed an estimated 25,000 sheep, then removed 240 miles of fencing and retrained former ranch workers as conservation workers.

“All of us who love the earth can see how the threats to wild places and creatures are growing,” said Tompkins. “This is crucial work – it’s the work we’ve been doing for decades.”

Argentine’s centre-right president Mauricio Macri has praised the Tompkins model of conservation, which preserves wild land while bringing in tourists and related business to try to promote sustainable local development.

In December 2015, Macri accepted a donation of approximately 370,000 acres from the Conservation Land Trust and McDivitt Tompkins, and announced his support for the planned Iberá national park, a 1.7 million-acre wetland that is home to hundreds of bird species, giant anteaters and wild macaw parrots and includes a breeding program to re-introduce jaguars.

But opposition to conservation efforts remains strong in Chile’s controversial farmed salmon industry, which has been fighting efforts for greater regulation.



Last year, local ranchers briefly occupied one of the Tompkins’ parks in protest against what they see as the removal of productive lands from the local economy.

Patricio Ulloa, the mayor of Cochrane, the closest town to Parque Patagonia, rejected an invitation to the launch of the new park. “They have erased our history and there is no pardoning that,” he said. “That’s what we who were born and raised in this land of pioneers feel. They have never shown any evaluation that truly shows how this is going to benefit the community.”

President Bachelet’s conservation measures are one part of her progressive legacy that is likely to survive the country’s looming change of government.



Incoming president Sebastian Piñera – a billionaire businessman supported by an extreme rightwing coalition – has indicated his intention to reverse efforts to loosen the country’s draconian abortion laws and provide free university education to more students, but he is a keen supporter of the Tompkins conservation model."

This donation, earmarked as a ""conservation easement"" (which typically require landowners to forfeit the right to develop, subdivide, or otherwise interfere with the preservation of a natural landscape), is a nice example of how a successful member of the game industry might invest some of their wealth in a way that benefits others.

“It’s still in private ownership but the easement ensures it can never be developed,"" Sweeney told The Citizen-Times. ""It’s not open to anyone in the public at any time, but people can email and get a permission card and go and enjoy it.""

The region Sweeney has invested in is known as the Box Creek Wilderness; several years ago it came under threat of being subdivided to make room for the Rutherford Electric Membership Corporation to construct power lines, but Sweeney (who previously owned a smaller swath of the land) fought back in court.

This isn't the first time he's done this, either. Outside of his place in the game industry, Sweeney is recognized as something of a conservationist in North Carolina; the Epic Games chief reportedly began buying up land in 2008 and now owns roughly 40,000 acres in the state, some of which he has previously donated for conservation."

A Movement to Transform Coal Miners Into Beekeepers Is Great News for the Planet,http://nationswell.com/west-virginia-coal-alternative-beefarming/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=contentshare&utm_campaign=atlasobscura,"As coal mines shutter across West Virginia, a nonprofit is helping unemployed miners and low-income residents make money by raising bees and selling their honey. It’s extra income for them and a big bonus for local ecosystems.

Tucked inside an old gymnasium, hundreds of wooden boxes are stacked along a far wall. The space, formerly home base for a summer camp, is now host to labs and classrooms filled with bright, freshly painted blue boxes.

But children won’t be playing here this summer. Instead, among the boxes and stainless steel vats, displaced coal miners and low-income West Virginians will learn a new trade — beekeeping. It’s part of a program run by the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective, a program for low-income West Virginians to make supplemental income through beekeeping.

While beekeeping may seem like an odd choice for former coal miners, it’s a viable and increasingly popular way for people in rural areas to make money. In West Virginia, where poverty is high and jobs are scarce, a large part of the population is struggling to make ends meet.

Coal mining once bolstered the region, but between 2005 and 2015, employment in the coal industry decreased by about 27 percent, according to research by West Virginia University. Across the nation, states like Kentucky, Wyoming and Pennsylvania have to find jobs to fill the employment gap left by the coal industry.

Enter the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective. The collective operates across 17 counties in southern West Virginia and offers classes in subjects like, Is Beekeeping Right for Me?, bee basics and advanced beekeeping. It’s a branch of the Appalachian Headwaters, a nonprofit formed to develop sustainable economic opportunities across the region.

Interested beekeepers can take Beekeeping 101, which is a five-week course where they learn the basics of beekeeping, bee biology and solutions to common problems. Once the new beekeeper has completed this course, he or she can become a partner in the collective. The partnership offers training, mentorship, equipment and bees for free or at a reduced cost.

But the startup cost to becoming a beekeeper can be a barrier of entry.

This was the case for Jason Young, a resident of White Oak, West Virginia.

Young originally started beekeeping as a hobby but quickly realized it could turn into a small business. “We had decided that we wanted to move forward,” he says. “But it was really the money that was holding us back.”

When Young discovered the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective offered training and equipment at low cost, he leapt at the opportunity.

Young and his daughter enrolled in the free Beekeeping 101 course and received 12 hives from the collective for a reduced price. From there, he formed White Oak Bee Co.

Last spring was their first harvest. It produced enough honey for his family and his honey-roasted coffee, which is White Oak Bee Co.’s signature item. This season, however, he has 14 hives ready to harvest and hopes to make a profit that he can reinvest in the business.

“Beekeeping and our relationship with the collective has really made that possible,” Young says.

The Appalachian Beekeeping Collective successfully trained 35 beekeepers this past year and plans to train another 55 this spring.

When it’s harvest time, the nonprofit will process, market and distribute the honey for its beekeepers for free. That can result in a nice chunk of change. In 2018, the market value for a pound of honey was about $7.33. A single hive can produce 20 to 100 pounds of honey a year, which means a single productive hive could earn its owner over $700 a year. With multiple hives, a beekeeper has the potential to make thousands of dollars every year.

And the bees do more than produce income for their owners. The forests provide nectar for the bees, and in turn, the bees pollinate these key natural habitats and create more plant diversity, says Parry Kietzman, an entomologist and educator at the collective.

Kietzman says she’s noticed people are more aware of the land and plants once they have bees.

“It seems to give people more of a handle on environmental concerns,” she says. “Simply because they’re worried about their bees.”

For others, like Young, it’s a chance to accomplish goals.

“What I feel most thankful for is the opportunity to take some dreams we’ve had for a really long time,” Young said. “And to really see them, kind of, come to be.”"

An Amazonian parrot called Freddy Krueger has made headlines in Brazil after managing to find its way back to the zoo from which it was stolen while recovering from a four-year nightmare that saw it shot in a gun battle, abducted by armed thieves and bitten by a snake.

The turquoise-fronted Amazon parrot – whose Elm Street-inspired moniker stems from its bullet-disfigured face – was pilfered from a zoo in the southern city of Cascavel on the night of 16 April.

According to Brazil’s Folha de São Paulo newspaper, Freddy’s capture was just the latest in a series of misadventures to affect the Amazona aestiva bird.

Freddy was first brought to the zoo about four years ago, having been severely injured in a shootout between police and gangsters during a raid on the drug den where he had lived with his villain owner.

“In the shootout, [Freddy] was hit in the upper-beak … blinded and suffered burns to the feathers that grow between the eyes,” the Folha de São Paulo reported.

Freddy’s ordeal was far from over. Earlier this month, the parrot was reportedly bitten on the leg by a snake – thankfully of a non-venomous variety.

Freddy bled profusely but survived, only to be stolen days later when three armed raiders burst into Cascavel’s zoo, overpowered its security guard and made off with two parrots and a cylinder of gas.

Two days later, however, Freddy returned, discovered by zoo staff at the foot of a pine tree beside his cage.

The details of Freddy’s comeback remain murky, although drops of blood found near his former abode have fuelled speculation that the notoriously aggressive parrot bit his way out.

“He’s a bit of a wild one,” Ilair Dettoni, the zoo’s vet, was quoted as saying.

Dettoni suspected Freddy’s mangled features might have proven his salvation, given the limited market for deformed parrots. “I don’t know if Freddy is really unlucky or really lucky,” he said.

The second parrot and the gas cylinder have yet to be found."

Three heroic schoolchildren who refused to let go of a man trying to jump off a bridge and saved his life are set to be presented with national awards.

Devonte Cafferkey, 13, and Sammy Farah, 14, rushed to grab a man sitting with a rope around his neck on the edge of an A10 overpass in Waltham Cross on September 21 last year.

Friend Shawn Young, who was 12 at the time, called for help.

While trying to keep the man back and talk him out of suicide, he passed the boys his mobile phone saying “if it rings, don’t answer it”.

The boys were helped by 47-year-old Joanne Stammers, who is registered disabled with Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome, a rare disability that makes her highly prone to blood clotting.

Despite her condition, which prevents her from working, Joanne took over from the boys and held onto the man ""for what feels like forever"" and was left with bruising all over her arms.

Another man, James Higlett, did his part in saving the man’s life. All five will receive awards from the Royal Humane Society, a charity promoting life-saving intervention.

Shawn’s mum, Carol, has been amazed at the boys’ maturity and said they have “just got on with it” since their life-saving efforts..

She said: “I am extremely proud of all three of them, they are all good boys and it’s nice that they are getting recognised for doing something good in the community.

“Quite often in the national news there are a lot of negative reports about young people so it is nice to have something positive.

“They are very young and I marvel at how they are all dealing with it. Every time I speak to them I learn something new about what happened.

“For example, the man was passing out and got heavier for them, I didn’t know that until recently.”

Jacqueline Cafferkey, Devonte's mum, found out the good news a couple of weeks ago and described it as a “huge achievement”.

The three children, who go to St Mary’s High School, picked up Special Achievement Awards at the Broxbourne Youth Awards for their bravery.

Joanne described the award as a “great honour” and said she is still in touch with Jacqueline.

“It’s amazing to get this award, it’s obviously under sad circumstances but it’s also great that the kids are getting something for what they did,” she said.

“I am really pleased for them and I hope other children can see it’s worth stopping to help someone.”

Joanne, who was on her way back from visiting her mum in Waltham Cross when she saw Shawn calling for help, told the Mercury she “hates” going under the bridge now and avoids it when she can.

She still sees her mum once a week and pays special attention to any bridge she goes under now to make sure nobody is standing by the edge.

The heroes that day were nominated for these awards by Hertfordshire Police. A date for the awards presentation has not yet been set."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In a mission to clean up trash floating in the ocean, environmentalists pulled 40 tons (36 metric tons) of abandoned fishing nets this month from an area known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Mariners on a 140-foot (43-meter) cargo sailboat outfitted with a crane voyaged from Hawaii to the heart of the Pacific Ocean, where they retrieved the haul of mostly plastic fishing nets as part of an effort to rid the waters of the nets that entangle whales, turtles and fish and damage coral reefs.

The volunteers with the California-based nonprofit Ocean Voyages Institute fished out the derelict nets from a marine gyre location where ocean currents converge between Hawaii and California during their 25-day expedition, the group’s founder, Mary Crowley, announced Friday.

The group is among a handful of nonprofits working to collect plastic trash from the open ocean, an endeavor that can be dangerous, time consuming and expensive.

“Our success should herald the way for us to do larger clean ups and to inspire clean ups all throughout the Pacific Ocean and throughout the world. It’s not something that we need to wait to do,” Crowley said.

The cargo ship returned June 18 to Honolulu, where 2 tons (1.8 metric tons) of plastic trash were separated from the haul of fishing nets and donated to local artists to transform it into art work to educate people about ocean plastic pollution. The rest of the refuse was turned over to a zero emissions energy plant that will incinerate it and turn it into energy, she said.

A year before they went to pick up the nets, the Sausalito, California-based group gave sailors going from California to Hawaii buoyant GPS trackers the size of bowling balls to attach to the nets they encountered during their voyage so they could be tracked.

The group then sailed to collect the nets entangled with plastic chairs, bottles and other trash in an effort that cost $300,000. The group plans to deploy dozens more GPS trackers and next year embark on a three-month trash collection expedition, Crowley said.

It is estimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 metric tons of fishing gear is abandoned or lost during storms each year in the oceans, said Nick Mallos, Director of the Trash Free Seas Program at Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group.

Another 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) of plastic waste, including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items, flow annually into the ocean from beaches, rivers and creeks, according to experts.

The Ocean Voyages Institute is one of dozens of groups around the world trying to tackle the problem. Most focus on cleaning up beaches, ridding shores of abandoned fishing nets, traps and other gear and pushing for a reduction on single-use plastic containers.

Collecting the trash already in the gyres is also the goal of The Ocean Cleanup project, which was started by Dutch innovator Boyan Slat and last year first deployed a trash collection device to corral plastic litter floating in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

The group has raised millions of dollars from donors around the world, including San Francisco billionaire Marc Benioff.

"Whales Seen In Hundreds Off NYC Shores, Drawn By Cleaner Waters",https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/whales-seen-hundreds-nyc-shores-drawn-cleaner-waters,"NEW YORK, NY – Staggering numbers of whales are being sighted off New York City shores as vastly cleaner waters have caused a 540% increase in the numbers of the massive mammals in just eight years.

Experts at the Rockaway-based non profit Gotham Whale started tracking sightings in the area in 2010 – counting just five. Last year, they spotted an awe-inspring 272, almost all humpbacks. The rise is monumental and points to the success of environmental policies such as the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Gotham Whale's founder said.

Paul Sieswerda, who worked as a curator at the New York Aquarium for more than 20 years before starting Gotham Whale, says lessening pollution in the Hudson River has also had a dramatic effect.

Artie Raslich/Gotham Whale ""So the Hudson River, instead of bringing out pollution to the areas we see whales – the lower estuary and the area right outside the mouth of the Hudson – it's bringing nutrients,"" he said.

Those nutrients feed tiny algae that attract the fish Menhaden - a major humpback food source that's known as the ""most important fish in the sea"" for the amount of other animals they feed, according to Pew Charitable Trust's Mid-Atlantic Conservation Project. Gotham Whales recently kicked off its ninth season partnering with American Princess Cruises, providing New Yorkers the chance to see humpbacks from May 4th to November 3rd.

""The sheer size alone is incredible,"" Sieswerda said of the whales.

""They're like buses, and to think that's a living animal and to think that is has the power and grace to completely jump out of the water when they breach is a spectacle that I think is unique to the animal kingdom.""

Archie Raslich/Gotham Whale Gotham Whale is able to identify individual Humpback whales from the underside of their fluke (tail), which serves like a fingerprint having distinct patterns and colorizations. The non profit is building a catalogue of the whales they see near the city, which is now up to 110 individuals.

The favorite of the bunch is a Humpback called Jerry – named after Jerry Garcia by the group's photographer Artie Raslich, a Grateful Dead fan. The animal was first seen from a boat named after the band's song ""Ship of Fools"" on what would have been Garcia's birthday."

Associated Press

A giant array of solar panels near the famed sandstone buttes of Monument Valley has begun producing electricity for the Navajo Nation at a time when the tribe is bracing for the loss of hundreds of jobs from the impending closure of a nearby coal-fired power plant.

The Kayenta Solar Facility is the first utility-scale solar project on the Navajo Nation, producing enough electricity to power about 13,000 Navajo homes.

The plant comes at a time when the area's energy landscape is shifting.

The coal-fired Navajo Generating Station near Page is set to close in December 2019, leaving a site that both tribal and private entities say has the potential for renewable energy development.

The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, which owns the solar plant, said the project advances clean energy on the reservation long known for fossil fuel development, the Arizona Daily Sun reported.

Walter Haase, general manager of the tribal utility, said the plant proves to investors, developers and tribal communities that renewable energy projects are possible on the reservation.

Economic development often is hampered by the lack of infrastructure, required environmental clearances and consent from anyone holding a permit or lease for use of the land.

Before the solar facility, ""we had a reputation in the industry of not being able to get something built or brought online,"" Haase said.

The town of Kayenta benefited, too. The contractor hired and trained about 200 Navajos to build the plant, said Deenise Becenti, a spokeswoman for the tribal utility, leaving a qualified workforce for other projects.

The tribal utility avoided passing on the $60 million cost of the solar plant to its customers through federal solar investor tax credits, said Glenn Steiger, project manager for the solar farm.

A two-year power purchase and renewable energy credit agreement with the Salt River Project will cover loan repayments for the plant's construction, Steiger said.

The tribal utility is working on extending the agreement.

"China ban on ivory sales begins Sunday, aims to curb elephant poaching",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-ivory/china-ban-on-ivory-sales-begins-sunday-aims-to-curb-elephant-poaching-idUSKBN1EN0I5?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:%20Trending%20Content&utm_content=5a46260e04d30170a52a5e59&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A ban on ivory sales in China, the world’s largest importer and end user of elephant tusks, takes effect on Sunday with wildlife activists calling it a vital step to reducing the slaughter of the endangered animals.

China has made a big push to eradicate ivory sales and demand has fallen since early 2014 because of a crackdown on corruption and slower economic growth.

Public awareness campaigns featuring celebrities have helped boost awareness of the bloody cost of ivory. Wildlife groups estimate 30,000 elephants are killed by poachers in Africa every year.

“It is the greatest single step toward reducing elephant poaching,” said Peter Knights, chief executive of the group WildAid.

China has allowed the sale of pre-convention ivory, which refers to products such as carvings and crafts acquired before the 1975 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as long as it is accompanied by certificates.

The trade in pre-convention ivory has been legally thriving in China and Hong Kong since 1975, and environmental activists have long asserted that it has spurred demand for all ivory.

The ban on all ivory sales has already led to an 80 percent decline in seizures of illegal ivory entering China as well as a 65 percent decline in raw ivory prices, said conservation group WildAid.

Under the ban, China’s 172 ivory-carving factories and retail outlets will also close. Some factories and shops started closing in March.

Illegal ivory supplies have also been rife in unlicensed shops and online across China.

This year, ivory prices in China were about 65 percent lower than 2014 levels, said WildAid, with retailers in some places trying to sell off stocks and offering heavy discounts before the ban.

The Chinese ban has been hailed by activists but they warn that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, remains a big obstacle to the eradication of elephant poaching.

China’s ban on sales does not apply in the former British colony, which has the largest retail market for ivory and has traded it for more than 150 years.

Hong Kong is a prime transit and consumption hub for ivory with more than 90 percent of consumers from mainland China.

Since 2003, Hong Kong has intercepted about 40 tonnes of illegal ivory, only about 10 percent of what is believed to have been smuggled in, WildAid said in a paper to the city’s legislature in May.

Hong Kong set a timetable for a ban on ivory trading last year, with a phase-out time of five years. A final vote on the ban is expected in the city’s legislature in early 2018.

Conservationist Zhou Fei said the Chinese ban could be a catalyst for the closure of ivory markets across Asia.

However, Kenya-based conservation group Save the Elephants said this year that neighboring Laos has expanded its retail market more rapidly than any other country.

Wombats are digging water wells and saving other animals during Australia's drought,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-07/water-diviner-wombats-bring-animals-to-water-hole/11937990,"Wombats on a New South Wales Hunter Valley farm are being hailed as heroes for burrowing down to an underground soak and supplying water to an array of native fauna hit hard by drought.

Key points: A well dug by wombats has attracted a variety of native fauna to the unique water source

A well dug by wombats has attracted a variety of native fauna to the unique water source The wombats have been compared to water diviners by one biologist because of how they dug right at the location of the underground water source

The wombats have been compared to water diviners by one biologist because of how they dug right at the location of the underground water source It's not known why the wombats dug there, whether it was intentional or happy accident

Beef farmer Ted Finnie's property sits 30 kilometres south-west of Merriwa, an area of the valley that has had almost no rain for the past three years.

He said the hole has been there for long time, but has recently grown larger as wombats dig deeper during the drought.

""It's best described as being a crater,"" he said.

""Being about 20 metres in diameter, with the rim of the crater going down maybe four metres into the ground.

""And as the crater has dried out due to the drought the wombats have burrowed to get closer to the water and so they've gone underground a little bit.""

Macropods like kangaroos are known to use the wombat well even before the drought, but are now seen more frequently. ( Supplied: Upper Hunter Landcare )

Mr Finnie said the ""wombat soak"" was often used by wombats, kangaroos, wallabies and wallaroos, but it was now vital to many more animals during the drought.

He said a camera trap recently set up by Hunter Region Landcare Network showed new species including birds, goannas, possums, echidnas, and even emus drinking from the soak.

Mr Finnie, who is a retired Taronga Zoo veterinarian, said the animals had the hero wombats to thank.

The wombats have been called 'water diviners' by one biologist for their skills. ( Supplied: Upper Hunter Landcare )

""They're the ones keeping the hole open and accessible,"" he said.

""I think it's really quite surprising how intelligent wombats are in the matter of survival; they are great survivors.

""Especially given the fact that they are able to source this water supply fairly deep down.""

Wallabies are frequent users of the wombat well. ( Supplied: Upper Hunter Landcare )

'Like water diviners'

Western Sydney University biologist Julie Old has visited the wombat soak in the past and said the site was unique.

The associate professor said she was not aware of other recorded instances of wombats digging for water, but it was clearly what was happening on Mr Finnie's property.

Goannas have been seen more regularly using the 'wombat well' during the drought. ( Supplied: Upper Hunter Landcare )

""It's almost like the wombats are water diviners, they're finding the water and digging the holes to get to the water and the other animals are taking advantage of it,"" Dr Old said.

""We often call wombats ecological engineers because they're digging burrows and they make habitat for other animals.

""In this case, the wombat wallow on Ted's place is being created by this ecological engineer — the wombat.""

Dr Old said the hole could have been dug intentionally for water, and it was unlikely to have begun as a burrow that accidentally struck water.

""They tend to build burrows on the sides of creeks and near tree roots to help hold the burrow together,"" she said.

""So where this spot is, not near a creek, would have been very unusual for the wombat to dig a burrow.

""We don't know why it started, but it's become quite deep."""
Mexican scientist cures the Human Papilloma Virus,https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/mexican-scientist-cures-human-papilloma-virus,"Leer en español

Eva Ramón Gallegos, a researcher from Mexico National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) was able to completely eradicate the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) in 29 patients.

This scientific achievement was accomplished through photodynamic therapy, a non-invasive technique that seems to be an efficient method to prevent malignant neoplasm, which is the second cause of death among Mexican women.

The scientists from the National Biological Sciences School explained that she has studied the effects of photodynamic therapy for 20 years and said she was treated 420 patients in Oaxaca and Veracruz with this method, as well as 29 women in Mexico City.

“During the first stage of the investigation, when it was used to treat women in Oaxaca and Veracruz, the results were encouraging. The treatment was also very positive when applied to women in Mexico City, which opens the possibility of making the treatment more efficient,” she said.

She also explained that besides eradicating HPV, the main cause behind cervical cancer, photodynamic therapy is also used to eliminate premalignant lesions of cervical cancer in its first stages. The results of her investigation show that she was able to eradicate HPV in 100% of the patients who had the virus but had no premalignant lesions, 64.3% in women with HPV and lesions, and 57.2% in women who had lesions but don't have HPV.

Dallas Morning News reporter Dave Tarrant chronicled the struggles many federal employees in Dallas are facing.

Twisted Trompo's $1 M.F. Tacos are made with a choice of protein and come served on corn tortillas with onions and cilantro.

Federal employees who want a cheap taco need to show federal identification to receive the $1 deal.

"""Elephants have first right over forest"" - Indian Supreme Court. Orders for demolition of wall that was blocking elephant migration corridor",https://nenow.in/north-east-news/assam-sc-orders-demolition-of-nrl-boundary-wall-for-elephants.html,"The Supreme Court of India on Friday dismissed an appeal filed by Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) and ordered demolition of the entire 2.2 km boundary wall blocking an elephant migration corridor in Deopahar Reserve Forest in Golaghat.

The apex court said that “Elephants have first right on forest”.

The wall became the eye of a storm in 2015 after a 7-year-old male elephant that had reportedly died of “severe haemorrhage” in May that year from violently thrusting against the wall.

The same year, environmentalists captured videos showing elephants trying to cross the high boundary wall.

The green crusaders then started demanding demolition of the wall built by the oil refinery. It was alleged that the wall and the refinery township were being built illegally in a “No Development Zone” declared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) in 1996.

In August 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered NRL to demolish the entire length of the wall within a month. But only a 289-metre stretch was demolished.

As per reports, the NRL challenged the NGT order, saying the entire wall need not be demolished as it is not a part of Deopahar Reserve Forest in Golaghat.

Gauhati High Court has stayed any further demolition of the Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) boundary wall as ordered by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) last month.

The NRL claimed it had paid Rs 25 lakh to the State Forest Department, which will be kept in a separate bank account for restoration of the area and for the improvement of the surroundings adjoining the NRL complex and to reduce man-animal conflict especially man-elephant conflict."

Gregg Garfield was in the hospital due to coronavirus for 64 days. For 31 of those days, he was on a ventilator.

Garfield, 54, was ""patient zero"" at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, about 10 miles north of Los Angeles. He had a 1% chance of survival. And he beat the odds, leaving the hospital on Friday.

He became ill and was hospitalized after a February trip to northern Italy — an early source of coronavirus infections — with a dozen of his friends.

""The disease kicked off, and my immune system just ate me alive,” Garfield told KCAL-TV in Los Angeles.

An avid skier who considers himself an athletic person, Garfiewas on the verge of losing his fight with coronavirus.

Per a report on the ""Today Show,"" Garfield suffered pneumonia and kidney failure. His sister Stephanie Garfield Bruno told KABC-TV that four different parts of his lungs collapsed. He was unable to walk.

But with the help of physicians and physical therapists, he was slowly able to regain his mobility and returned home with a walker.

He's 5 years old | Noah Woods is being named an honorary firefighter and will receive a rare lifesavers award for his heroics on Friday.,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/us/house-fire-five-year-old-saved-family-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A 5-year-old Georgia boy awoke to flames in the bedroom. But he didn't panic, and his actions helped save his entire family.

Noah Woods is being named an honorary firefighter and will receive a rare lifesavers award for his heroics on Friday.

Noah was one of eight family members asleep in their home in Bartow County, Georgia, on Sunday when he woke up to smoke and flames in the bedroom he shared with his 2-year-old sister.

He jumped out of bed, grabbed his sister and got out of the house through the only exit available, an open window.

But Noah didn't stop there — he went back in to get the family dog and pulled it to safety. He then ran next door to his uncle's house for help. Together, they alerted the rest of the family.

South Korean court outlaws killing dogs for their meat,https://nypost.com/2018/06/21/south-korean-court-outlaws-killing-dogs-for-their-meat/,"A South Korean court ruled for the first time that it’s illegal to kill dogs for their meat, a decision that activists hope will pave the way to making the controversial practice illegal, reports said.

Long shrouded in a gray area of cultural relativism, eating dogs has become a taboo in the country as younger generations gravitate closer to the Western belief that a pooch is man’s best friend, rather than a tasty delicacy, according to AFP.

Still, lawmakers have hesitated to outright ban the practice and have instead acted with weaker regulatory laws, such as hygiene regulations or measures that ban cruel slaughter methods, the outlet said.

“It is very significant in that it is the first court decision that killing dogs for dog meat is illegal itself,” according to Kim Kyung-eun, a lawyer with the animal rights organization Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth.

She added the precedent has “paved the way for outlawing dog meat consumption entirely.”

Last year, CARE filed complaints against a dog farm operator and accused him of “killing animals without proper reasons,” as well as violating hygiene and building regulations.

Prosecutors ended up charging the man and he was convicted, which meant meat consumption could not be used as a legal defense to kill dogs. He was also fined about $2,700 and waived his right to appeal.

The decision was made in April but the details were only released this week.

CARE leader Park So-youn plans to continue tracking down similar dog farms and slaughterhouses across the country with the intent of filing similar complaints against them with authorities.

“Over the past decades, public discourse over dog meat consumption has shifted towards banning it,” she said.

“The dog meat industry will take greater heat because of the court ruling.”

Roughly 70 percent of South Koreans don’t eat dog meat, but only 40 percent of them believe it should be banned. The meat — boiled to tenderize it — is typically eaten as a summertime delicacy."

"AC/DC's Angus Young has donated $19, 260 to a Canadian fan who skated for 19 hours and 26 minutes while listening to AC/DC as part of a charity fundraiser.",https://www.loudersound.com/news/acdcs-angus-young-donates-money-to-canadian-skaters-charity-fund,"Last month it was revealed that Canadian postman and AC/DC fan Steve McNeil was planning a marathon skating challenge to raise money for charity.

McNeil has been raising cash for a Montreal Alzheimer’s charity by skating for 19 hours and 26 minutes in cities across Canada to pay tribute to his mother Eunice, who was born in 1926 but died in 2013 after suffering from Alzheimer’s for 20 years.

He also skates in memory of AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young, who passed away in 2017 after being diagnosed with dementia in 2014.

McNeil listens to AC/DC non-stop while he does so and so and CBC are reporting that after finding out about the story, AC/DC icon Angus Young has donated $19,260 (Canadian) to McNeil and asked that the cash be distributed to dementia music programmes across Canada.

McNeil tells the website: “It's funny how things work in the world, but rock’n’roll is such a powerful tool. This is AC/DC. This could open so many doors.”

As for why he listens to the band during the gruelling sessions, McNeil explains: “It's like touching an emotional lottery. You've got to understand, this is what's been my driving force.

""When I go out in these conditions, that's all I listen to because it's my tribute to Angus and the boys because I know they lost a big part of their family.”

The JustGiving page has now raised £1,413 - more than double its original target. Archant

A Wisbech mum whose 13-year-old son was attacked and robbed of his Suzuki motorbike is thanking the “little angel” who set up a fundraising page which has raised £1,413 in a week to buy him a replacement.

Daniel Sobey-Harker launched a JustGiving page last Wednesday (25) after he read that the victim, who had saved for eight months to buy a £600 Suzuki, was kicked, punched, ran over and robbed – just three days after buying the bike.

The victim’s mum said: “I’ve been speechless.

“How one person that’s not related to any members of our family could put so much effort in for a child, who is really a stranger, is just amazing.

“We never thought about raising any finances because I was more concentrating on supporting my son.

“You don’t really get many people around here doing things like this.

“Daniel is just a little angel. I think he’s doing it just because he’s a good, kind person. He’s gone beyond any expectations.”

Daniel, who lives in London, will travel to Wisbech to meet the boy and his mum in the next few weeks and buy him a new bike.

He is also going to take the boy shopping so that he can buy safety items with the remaining money.

“Seeing my son having hope and making him feel happier in this difficult time is just lovely,” the victim’s mum added.

“Although he still doesn’t feel comfortable being around people and is a little insecure. It could take a bit of time, but Daniel’s just given him a huge surprise.

Daniel, who set up the page with a target of £601, said: “It’s quite heart-warming how many people have come together to donate money.

“Because there’s a good amount of money left over, I’m going to go shopping with him to get him some safety bits.

“It’s something that shouldn’t happen to anyone, but for each of the two attackers there’s been 20 or more people wanting to help. He seems like a good kid.

“As a motorcyclist myself I know the joys of going for a ride and while it can be dangerous, the only risks he should face are ones faced on a trail.”

The attack happened near the Thomas Clarkson Academy (TCA) on Corporation Road at 4.45pm on Sunday (22).

Detectives are hunting the assailants, thought to be two men aged between 20 and 25.

The mother said her son had saved pocket money to buy the off road bike. She said he went out of the house and pushed the bike around Railway Road, Queens Road and Weasenham Lane before the attack happened.

She said when they were near the TCA two men started to walk towards her son.

When her son was found on the pavement “he was still conscious but panicking, crying, screaming and bleeding from the mouth”, she added.

He was treated at hospital but allowed home: his mother said he would return to school later in the week.

A police spokesman said: “If you were in that area at approximately 16:45hrs on Sunday January 22, or have seen a bike matching that description please call 101 in confidence and quote CF0037860117, or call crime stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”"
"Work less, get more: New Zealand firm's four-day week an 'unmitigated success'",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success,"This article is more than 2 years old

The New Zealand company behind a landmark trial of a four-day working week has concluded it an unmitigated success, with 78% of employees feeling they were able to successfully manage their work-life balance, an increase of 24 percentage points.

Two-hundred-and-forty staff at Perpetual Guardian, a company which manages trusts, wills and estate planning, trialled a four-day working week over March and April, working four, eight-hour days but getting paid for five.



Academics studied the trial before, during and after its implementation, collecting qualitative and quantitative data.

Work four days, get paid for five: New Zealand company's new shorter week Read more

Perpetual Guardian founder Andrew Barnes came up with the idea in an attempt to give his employees better work-life balance, and help them focus on the business while in the office on company time, and manage life and home commitments on their extra day off.

Jarrod Haar, professor of human resource management at Auckland University of Technology, found job and life satisfaction increased on all levels across the home and work front, with employees performing better in their jobs and enjoying them more than before the experiment.

Work-life balance, which reflected how well respondents felt they could successfully manage their work and non-work roles, increased by 24 percentage points.

In November last year just over half (54%) of staff felt they could effectively balance their work and home commitments, while after the trial this number jumped to 78%.

Staff stress levels decreased by 7 percentage points across the board as a result of the trial, while stimulation, commitment and a sense of empowerment at work all improved significantly, with overall life satisfaction increasing by 5 percentage points.

If you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing? Andrew Barnes

Helen Delaney, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business School, said employees’ motivation and commitment to work increased because they were included in the planning of the experiment, and played a key role in designing how the four-day week would be managed so as not to negatively impact productivity.

“Employees designed a number of innovations and initiatives to work in a more productive and efficient manner, from automating manual processes to reducing or eliminating non-work-related internet usage,” said Delaney.

Andrew Barnes said he would take the results of the trial to the board to open up a discussion on how a four-day work week could be implemented long-term in his company.

“If you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing?” asked Barnes, who believes the new work model has the potential to profoundly impact society for the better.

“Are you likely to get fewer mental health issues when you have more time to take care of yourself and your personal interests? Probably ... if you have fewer people in the office at any one time, can we make smaller offices?”

New Zealand’s workplace relations minister, Iain Lees-Galloway, said the results of the trial were “very interesting” and he was keen to encourage businesses to trial new and improved work models.

“I’m really keen to work with any businesses that are looking at how they can be more flexible for their staff and how they can look to improve productivity whilst working alongside their staff and protecting terms and conditions,” Less-Galloway said.

An earlier version said that there was a 24% increase in the percentage of employees who felt they were able to successfully manage their work-life balance.

Drone finds climber presumed dead on world's 12th largest mountain,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rick-allen-mountain-climber-found-by-drone-broad-peak-himalayas/,"A missing climber who was presumed dead on the world's 12th highest mountain was rescued after being spotted by a drone.

Scottish mountaineer Rick Allen was attempting to climb to the summit of 26,401 foot Broad Peak in the Himalayas when he fell from an ice cliff.

Later, when he didn't return to base camp, ""a number of people had assessed the situation and come to the conclusion that I was not going to come back,"" Allen told CBS News partner BBC News.

Brothers Bartek and Andrzej Bargiel, the latter of whom was planning to beat a record for climbing nearby mountain K2 and skiing down it, were at base camp and had a drone with them to film their journey.

When, 36 hours after Allen first went missing, a cook spotted something that looked like a backpack in the distance, the Bargiels launched their drone to investigate. Through the drone's camera, they discovered Allen clinging to the side of the mountain.

A rescue team was deployed, guided by the drone, and Allen was returned to safety with only a few cuts and frostbite.

Allen told BBC News that he had previously found encountering drones while mountain climbing irritating, ""but this has changed my perception of them."""
Muslims lend Christians hijabs to help them escape Isis in disguise in The Philippines,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/muslims-christians-hijab-islamic-militants-philippines-marawi-rodrigo-duterte-a7791056.html,"Terrified Christians are escaping Isis militants in the Filipino town of Marawi by wearing hijabs borrowed from Muslims.

There are around 1,500 people trapped in the besieged Filipino city, which is about 60 miles south of Cagayan de Oro.

Almost 100 people have escaped on foot, while others have swum across the river. Medics tending those who have made their way out alive recounted the resourcefulness of those who fled.

“Some of the stories that stuck were Muslims helping protect Christian workers by letting them borrow a hijab,” said Dr Gioia Ancheta, head of the psychosocial therapy team.

The civilians face starvation, being held as human shields and are also under attack from bombing assaults by the military who are trying to oust the jihadists.

There are reports that some local residents are so hungry they had “started to eat their blankets”, according to local politician Zia Alonto Adiong, who is managing the relief and rescue efforts.

“Some residents are eating (cardboard) boxes. They just dip it in water to soften the material and eat it,” he said.

Islamic militants stormed Marawi three weeks ago, leaving 290 people dead, including 205 Isis fighters, 58 soldiers and 26 civilians. Mr Adiong said that residents reported seeing terrible carnage left by the fighting.

“Dead bodies, at least 100, scattered around the encounter area,” he said.

Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera said his security forces were edging towards the business area of Marawi City, which is under the control of the combatants who have sworn allegiance to Isis.

"Senate Passes Bill to Protect Sea Turtles, Whales, Dolphins from Drift Gillnets",https://seaturtles.org/senate-passes-bill-to-protect-sea-turtles-whales-dolphins-from-drift-gillnets/,"For Immediate Release, July 24, 2020

Senate Passes Bill to Protect Sea Turtles, Whales, Dolphins from Drift Gillnets

Bans large mesh drift gillnets that indiscriminately kill or severely injure many endangered, protected marine species

WASHINGTON—The Senate last night unanimously passed the Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act, a bipartisan bill to phase out harmful large mesh drift gillnets utilized in the federal waters off the coast of California, the only place the nets are still used in the United States.

Large mesh driftnets, which are more than a mile long, are left in the ocean overnight to catch swordfish and thresher sharks. Other marine species including whales, dolphins, sea lions, sea turtles, fish, and sharks can also become entangled in the large mesh nets, injuring or killing them. Most of these animals, referred to as bycatch, are then discarded.

Turtle Island Restoration Network has led a coalition of concerned citizens and partner organizations for nearly 20 years, working to stop the devastating impact of this driftnet fishery on sea turtles, whales, dolphins, and other ocean animals. In 2018, California passed a four-year phase out of large mesh drift gillnets in state waters to protect marine life. The Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act would extend similar protections to federal waters within five years and authorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to help the commercial fishing industry transition to more sustainable gear types.

“Drift gillnets are responsible for trapping and killing more than 60 different species of marine wildlife, and this legislation will ensure no more whales or dolphins fall victim to this unsustainable fishery,” said Annalisa Batanides Tuel, policy and advocacy manager for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “We are encouraged that the United States is taking steps to address harmful fishing methods in the ocean and off our coasts, as a major cause of biodiversity collapse.”

The use of large mesh driftnets by a single fishery in California is responsible for 90 percent of the dolphins and porpoises killed along the West Coast and Alaska. At least six endangered, threatened, or protected species are harmed by driftnets off the California coast.

The bill was introduced by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).

“California’s coast is one of the last places where large mesh drift gillnets are still used to catch swordfish, resulting in needless deaths of whales, dolphins, porpoises, sea turtles and other marine animals,” Senator Feinstein said. “We are now one step closer to removing these nets from our waters. There is no reason to allow the carnage of large mesh drift gillnets when there are better, more sustainable methods to catch swordfish. We can preserve the economically important swordfishing industry while protecting the ocean and its wildlife that are vital to California’s economy.”

“While the use of large mesh drift gillnets is already prohibited off the coasts of most states, these tools are still injuring or killing a whole host of marine animals off California’s coast,” Senator Capito said. “These driftnets, which can be more than a mile long, are left in the ocean overnight to catch swordfish and thresher sharks. However, at least 60 other marine species – including whales, dolphins, sea lions, and sea turtles – can also become entangled in these nets, injuring or killing them. With the passage of our bill, we are a step closer to helping protect our marine species by ensuring that these dangerous driftnets are no longer allowed in U.S. waters.”

Large mesh drift gillnets are already banned in the U.S. territorial waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Hawaii. However, they remain legal in federal waters off the coast of California. The United States is also a member of international agreements that ban large-scale driftnets in international waters.

The bill would phase out the use of the nets and help the industry transition to more sustainable methods like deep-set buoy gear that uses a hook-and-buoy system. Deep-set buoy gear attracts swordfish with bait and alerts fishermen immediately when a bite is detected. Testing has shown that 94 percent of animals caught with deep-set buoys are swordfish, resulting in far less bycatch than drift gillnets.

Turtle Island Restoration Network is a global nonprofit based in Olema, California whose mission is to inspire and mobilize people around the world to protect marine biodiversity and the oceans that sustain all life on Earth.

He’s sitting in a lawn chair on the front porch of the Austin home he built nearly 70 years ago, working on his fifth Tampa Sweet cigar on a 91-degree sunny day. The smooth tunes of the Isley Brothers flow from a portable speaker. Birds are chirping in the late afternoon breeze.

“I’m feeling pretty good today,” Overton says, emphasizing the word pretty, because any day spent on this porch smoking cigars is a pretty good day for the 111-year-old.

This is where you’ll find the nation’s oldest veteran for 10 hours every day when the weather is nice. His friends call it his “stage.” It’s where Overton sits and thinks about life, his starting in 1906, the same year as the first wireless radio broadcast and a year before the paper towel was invented.

On this day, Overton is wearing a red cardigan buttoned over a powder blue polo, with light blue slacks and a black World War II veteran hat. He’s smiling and joking and feeling thankful.

The previous week, Overton was wearing a hospital gown. He spent those sunny days stuck in a hospital bed with a 102-degree fever, in a non-smoking room, hooked to an IV as his body tried to fight off its latest bout of pneumonia.

Overton

and flirted with nurses. Four days later, he was back where he wanted to be, on his stage with the birds and two packs of cigars.

Life has slowed year by year for the lifelong Austin resident. He was once a soldier in the U.S. military, serving in a segregated unit. After returning from war, he spent the bulk of his career working at furniture stores, then at the Texas Department of Treasury. He was a marksman, with a keen eye for hunting rabbits.

“But now, I just sit out here and rest,” he says, releasing a plume of Tampa Sweet smoke.

Overton starts his mornings as early as 3 a.m., drinking two to four cups of coffee. He’ll walk around his house to increase blood flow to his limbs, then smoke his first of 12 daily cigars. If he can, he’ll fall back asleep. Every day, he’s eager for the sun and the neighborhood to rise.

The supercentenarian has been married twice. He never had kids. He’s outlived all of his closest relatives. He has a first cousin who lives down the street, and third cousins who stop by daily.

In December, they started a GoFundMe page, when the price of 24/7 in-home care made it improbable for Overton to remain in his Austin home. Without his house or porch, they feared the worst. But five months later, the GoFundMe page has raised nearly $190,000.

Overton has two caregivers who work 12-hour shifts each day. They make him grits with a glass of whole milk for

and anything from chicken to meatloaf to fried catfish for lunch and dinner.

They also keep track of his visitors, because people stop by all the time at the house on Richard Overton Avenue. That’s right. On his 111th birthday on May 11, the town renamed his street. Some 200 people came out

the party on his front lawn, lining up to take a photo with Overton like kids waiting to meet Santa Claus.

Many brought gifts, like fancy cigars and bottles of whiskey. That’s his drink of choice — a whiskey and Coke — and when his caretakers are pouring, it’s always more Coke than whiskey. His cousins estimate he received more than 40 bottles that day, now dispersed throughout his home in kitchen cabinets, a bedroom closet and dresser drawers.

Certificates, war medals and photos of those he’s loved adorn almost every flat surface in his home. There are photos of Overton when he was in the Army, with broad shoulders, tight skin and a thin mustache. There’s one with President Barack Obama, when the 44th president honored him at a Veteran’s Day ceremony in 2013, his first of two trips to the White House.

He’s met celebrities and politicians and athletes, each asking him the same question about his secret to longevity. His answer? God and cigars.

In 2015, National Geographic released a

short documentary

about Overton made by Austin filmmakers. At the time of filming, he was

and had just renewed his driver’s license. He stopped driving soon after.

Before his latest visit to the hospital, Overton used to take strolls up and down his street. Maybe he’ll do that again if he builds enough strength.

For now, he’s content spending his hours on the stage. He stares at planes as they fly overhead and wonders where they’re going. He talks and sings with the birds. He waves at honking cars, and gazes at the trees he planted long ago, their roots digging into the dirt with each passing year.

All the while smoking a Tampa Sweet.

"The billionaire who promised to pay off student loans for an entire graduating class just pledged to pay off their parents' educational loans, too",https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-f-smith-morehouse-grads-parents-student-debt-pledge-2019-9,"The private-equity billionaire Robert F. Smith isn't just going to pay off the Morehouse class of 2019's student loans as he promised at their graduation: He's now promising to pay off their parents' education debt too.

The gift will cost Smith $34 million, the historically black college said in a press release on September 20.

Smith has a net worth of $6.08 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In May, the private-equity billionaire Robert F. Smith announced he'd be setting up a grant to wipe out the entire Morehouse College class of 2019's student-loan debt.

Now that offer has been expanded to also cover those students' parents' education debt, according to a September 20 press release.

The gift cost Smith $34 million, the historically black college said in the press release. According to the press release, Smith will make the donation to Morehouse's new Student Success Program, which will in turn completely pay off all federal student loans borrowed by the 400 Morehouse students who graduated in May, nearly all of whom are black men, as well as loans owed by their parents and legal guardians.

""This liberation gift from Robert Smith — the first of its kind to be announced at a graduation in higher education —will be life-changing for our new Morehouse Men and their families,"" Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said in a statement. ""It is our hope that our graduates will use their newfound financial freedom to pursue their career goals, to lead and serve the community, and to remember the spirit of the gift given to them by paying it forward to support the education of future classes of Morehouse Men.""

Smith first announced the gift while speaking at the class of 2019's commencement in May. ""My family is going to create a grant to eliminate your student loans,"" Smith told the graduates at the ceremony, Business Insider previously reported. ""You great Morehouse men are bound only by the limits of your own conviction and creativity.""

Smith is the chairman and CEO of the Austin, Texas-based private-equity firm Vista Equity Partners. He has a net worth of $6.08 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

""With the Student Success Program in place, there is a model for all colleges and universities, starting with Morehouse and HBCUs, to receive gifts from alumni and other supporters that can offset the burden of student loans and give students the freedom to pursue their dreams, the capital to invest in the economic growth of their families and the time that they can give back meaningfully to strengthening their communities,"" Smith said in a statement to Business Insider."

Florida man who gave generator to stranger down on her luck gets a free one,http://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-man-gave-generator-stranger-luck-free/story?id=49713379,"Florida man who gave generator to stranger down on her luck gets a free one Ramon Santiago was called a ""hero"" by the Lowe's manager who heard his story.

 -- It was a moment that captured the hearts of many: A Florida woman tearfully embracing a complete stranger who'd given her his generator after she'd lost out on one of her own in the mad rush before Hurricane Irma.

On Thursday, ABC affiliate WFTV in Orlando was at a Lowe's Home Improvement store as residents frantically prepared for Irma.

Sanford resident Pam Brekke had driven more than 30 miles from her home to buy a generator, of which the store had received a surprise shipment of little more than 200. Within two hours, though, the generators were gone. And Brekke, who had been next in line to buy one, got nothing.

Amid Hurricane Irma prep, Florida man offers generator to stranger in need

WFTV captured her breaking down in tears in a corner.

Enter Ramon Santiago of Orlando.

He also saw Brekke crying and insisted that she take the generator he'd carted but had not yet bought. Brekke shared that she'd wanted the generator not for herself but actually for her ailing father who needed it to power his oxygen supply.

""I'm worried about this storm,"" she told WFTV.

The two embraced and went their separate ways but their story -- a random act of kindness in the middle of chaos and stress before a deadly storm -- made the rounds not only on social media, but also at Lowe's.

When a new generator became available later that day, the store manager told WFTV that she immediately thought of Santiago. On Friday, Santiago returned to Lowe's with WFTV to get his own generator for free from the store.

""I wanted to make sure he received it because he definitely deserved it,"" manager Melissa Rodriguez told WFTV. ""He's the hero of the day.""

Durban - A specialised unit, set up to fight poaching have made great strides in their bid to stamp out rhino poaching. Over the last six months, a total of 365 rhino poachers have been convicted and an additional 15 men aged between 33 and 50, have been arrested. National police spokesperson, Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the 15 were nabbed following sting operations in Mpumalanga. He said police recovered four unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Naidoo said between January and June 2018, the Rhino 9 Task Team secured various convictions, the maximum nine years’ imprisonment and the least being three months’ imprisonment with the option of paying a R1 500 fine. “Of the 365 suspects who were arrested, 165 remain in custody while facing court processes, six were deported to their native countries, 11 received fines and 57 are serving their various jail terms. These convictions are evidence of the commitment of law enforcement agencies and game reserve parks to preserve endangered species for future generations,” Naidoo said.

Meanwhile, the 15 nabbed last week have since appeared in court on charges of unlawful possession of firearm/s, unlawful possession of ammunition, possession of dangerous weapon/s, trespassing, hunting of protected animal, kidnapping, assault, possession of the remains of a wild animal, possession of suspected stolen property and being in the country illegally or without proper documentation.

“Axes, tog bags, cellphones, and other incriminating evidence were also seized during the arrests. The Rhino 9 Task Team is a multidisciplinary team operating in Mpumalanga comprising of various government departments including members from various disciplines in the South African Police Service, Customs and Excise, the South African National Defence Force, as well as Ezemvelo and SANParks game rangers,” Naidoo said.

He added that a the strategies that the unit has put in place is significantly reducing the chances of smugglers operating at ports of entry in national parks.

“These arrests should serve as a warning and deterrent to other potential poachers,” Naidoo said.

He said community support and assistance is welcomed in the fight against this scourge. “Poachers and smugglers are warned that over and above facing criminal prosecution, their ill-gotten gains will also be confiscated in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 121/1998 (POCA). We urge the people of South Africa to continue supporting the police in its efforts to bring down the scourge of crime because together we can do more. Anyone with information related to rhino poaching may contact the nearest police station or SAPS Crime Stop number: 08600 10111,” Naidoo said.

Soviet submarine officer who averted nuclear war awarded 'Future of Life' prize,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/27/vasili-arkhipov-soviet-submarine-captain-who-averted-nuclear-war-awarded-future-of-life-prize,"A senior officer of a Soviet submarine who averted the outbreak of nuclear conflict during the cold war is to be honoured with a new prize, 55 years to the day after his heroic actions averted global catastrophe.

On 27 October 1962, Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov was on board the Soviet submarine B-59 near Cuba when the US forces began dropping non-lethal depth charges. While the action was designed to encourage the Soviet submarines to surface, the crew of B-59 had been incommunicado and so were unaware of the intention. They thought they were witnessing the beginning of a third world war.



Trapped in the sweltering submarine – the air-conditioning was no longer working – the crew feared death. But, unknown to the US forces, they had a special weapon in their arsenal: a ten kilotonne nuclear torpedo. What’s more, the officers had permission to launch it without waiting for approval from Moscow.

Two of the vessel’s senior officers – including the captain, Valentin Savitsky – wanted to launch the missile. According to a report from the US National Security Archive, Savitsky exclaimed: “We’re gonna blast them now! We will die, but we will sink them all – we will not become the shame of the fleet.”

But there was an important caveat: all three senior officers on board had to agree to deploy the weapon. As a result, the situation in the control room played out very differently. Arkhipov refused to sanction the launch of the weapon and calmed the captain down. The torpedo was never fired.

Had it been launched, the fate of the world would have been very different: the attack would probably have started a nuclear war which would have caused global devastation, with unimaginable numbers of civilian deaths.



“The lesson from this is that a guy called Vasili Arkhipov saved the world,’’ Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, told the Boston Globe in 2002, following a conference in which the details of the situation were explored.



Now, 55 years after he averted nuclear war and 19 years after his death, Arkhipov is to be honoured, with his family the first recipients of a new award.

The prize, dubbed the “Future of Life award” is the brainchild of the Future of Life Insitute – a US-based organisation whose goal is to tackle threats to humanity and whose advisory board includes such luminaries as Elon Musk, the astronomer royal Prof Martin Rees, and actor Morgan Freeman.



“The Future of Life award is a prize awarded for a heroic act that has greatly benefited humankind, done despite personal risk and without being rewarded at the time,” said Max Tegmark, professor of physics at MIT and leader of the Future of Life Institute.

Speaking to Tegmark, Arkhipov’s daughter Elena Andriukova said the family were grateful for the prize, and its recognition of Arkhipov’s actions.

“He always thought that he did what he had to do and never considered his actions as heroism. He acted like a man who knew what kind of disasters can come from radiation,” she said. “He did his part for the future so that everyone can live on our planet.”

The $50,000 prize will be presented to Arkhipov’s grandson, Sergei, and Andriukova at the Institute of Engineering and Technology on Friday evening.

Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the Nobel peace prize-winning organisation, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said Arkhipov’s actions were a reminder of how the world had teetered on the brink of disaster. “Arkhipov’s story shows how close to nuclear catastrophe we have been in the past,” she said.



The timing of the award, Fihn added, is apt. “As the risk of nuclear war is on the rise right now, all states must urgently join the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons to prevent such catastrophe.”

Dr Jonathan Colman, an expert on the Cuban missile crisis at the University of Central Lancashire, agreed that the award was fitting.

“While accounts differ about what went on on board the B-59, it is clear that Arkhipov and the crew operated under conditions of extreme tension and physical hardship. Once the nuclear threshold had been crossed, it is hard to imagine that the genie could have been put back into the bottle,” he said.

“President Kennedy had been very worried about the possibility of a clash between American warships and Soviet submarines in the Caribbean, and it is absolutely clear that his fears were justified,” Colman added, noting that certain decisions at the operational level were out of his control. “Ultimately, it was luck as much as management that ensured that the missile crisis ended without the most dreadful consequences.”"

Dave Kallmann | Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

Show Caption Hide Caption That time Pierre-Cedric Labrie and Tom McCollum didn't fight Pierre-Cedric Labrie needed to get home to Milwaukee from Grand Rapids, Mich., before Jana Pieuze-Roy gave birth to their son. Tom McCollum was there to help.

Pierre-Cedric Labrie and Jana Pieuze-Roy expected a baby in the new year.

Instead they got a story about a snowstorm bad enough to scare a Canadian, and an act of kindness that would turn a hockey bruiser into a 6-foot-3, 228-pound teddy bear.

And they got Lionel.

Although the littlest Labrie got an early start on the party, he waited just long enough.

“We played here on Friday, left for Grand Rapids on Saturday and she texted me. In the bus. Half way,” said Labrie, who plays left wing for the Milwaukee Admirals.

“She’s like, ‘Yeah, I’m having some cramps.’ I’m like, ‘Tell me right now. I’ll stop the bus and get a ride from here.’ She said, ‘No, I’m going to be fine.’ ”

So Labrie and the Admirals completed their 4 1/2-hour bus ride around the southern tip of Lake Michigan, hoping to carry the high from a home-ice victory over Chicago into an evening game against the Grand Rapids Griffins.

“I went to bed around midnight, and at 2 a.m. the phone rings,” Labrie said after practice Thursday at the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena.

“Water broke.”

The first flight out of Grand Rapids to anywhere close would have got Labrie to Chicago at 6:30 in the morning, and he’d still have had a 90-minute drive to Milwaukee.

“Her mom, for two kids, (labor was) less than six hours,” Labrie said. “I knew I had really a small gap.”

Other options were getting him nowhere, and time was wasting.

His last thought was to wake up Admirals teammate Mark Zengerle, who spent two seasons as a Griffin. It couldn’t hurt to ask him for ideas, right?

“I was like, ‘Zenger, you played in GR (Grand Rapids) a couple years ago,’ ” Labrie said. “ ‘Do you know anybody that would let me borrow a car?’ Because I called taxi drivers, there’s a bad storm, no one wants to take me to Milwaukee. With the New Year’s Eve parties, all the chauffeurs for the private cars are reserved.

“He’s like, ‘There’s a guy on the other team. He’s a really good guy.’ ”

The Griffins were headed back from a night game in Cleveland when Zengerle’s text message popped up on backup goaltender Tom McCollum’s phone. McCollum was watching a movie. He can’t sleep on the bus.

“It was kind of funny the way he said it,” McCollum said in a telephone interview Thursday. “He was like, ‘Hey, I’ve got a question; it’s totally cool if you say no,’ and just kind of explained the situation of what happened.”

Although the team wouldn’t be back to Grand Rapids for another 90 minutes, McCollum lives virtually across the street from the Admirals’ hotel. His girlfriend was at home. McCollum wasn’t going to need his Ford F-150 for a couple of days anyway, and the Griffins were headed to Milwaukee two days later.

McCollum didn’t think twice about helping out someone he'd only run into on the ice.

“I’ve never actually met PC, but I played against him a bunch when he was in Rockford,” McCollum said. “He’s one of those ... you can just tell he’s an honest hockey player.

“Especially the tough guys, they always seem to be the nicest guys off the ice. Again, knowing that he’s been around for a few years and knowing he’s an older guy, those are the kind of guys you trust.”

Although McCollum doesn’t have children, he’s seen the effect fatherhood has had on teammates. He had a good idea of what getting home would mean to Labrie.

“If he didn’t let me, I would have been panicking,” Labrie said. “I would have been walking the street, like, ‘Hey, you. How much you want, you drive me to Milwaukee right now?’ I was, like, panicking. I need to get there.”

Before 3 a.m. local time, Labrie was on his way. And before long the lake-effect snow picked up to a near whiteout.

“Good thing I had the big truck of the guy,” Labrie said, showing a video from along the way. “It got worse.

“(It’s) so nerve-wracking, driving through. Soon as I passed that, my eyes start getting (strained). I have to stop, like, 15-20 minutes, and just lay there.”

Then he pressed on.

“Got to the hospital at 6:15,” Labrie said. “And deliver the baby at 6:54.

“I was there for only 40 minutes, the last, final pushes. Here we go. I missed all the contractions earlier, the toughest part, when she doesn’t have the — what do you call it? — the epidural.

“She was with her mom. Thank God she was here or I don’t know. Everything turned out good.”

Lionel weighed in at 5 pounds, 15 ounces.

“Just like me,” Labrie said, “tiny.”

Labrie was being serious, too; he knows he was a small baby although he'd have had to ask his mother for the specifics.

McCollum and Labrie actually met for the first time Wednesday, after the Griffins beat the Admirals, 4-2. They had time for little more than hello and a handshake. Labrie returned McCollum’s keys, and McCollum followed his bus back to Michigan.

“He offered to pay me for (using the truck),” McCollum said. “I just asked him to fill it up with gas, and he was nice enough he washed it for me before he gave it back. That’s all I need honestly.

“I was happy to be able to facilitate the situation. I was more than thrilled when he texted me that he made it in time.”"

Much as the Sorting Hat did at Hogwarts, Pet Alliance staffers divide adoptable dogs into the houses of Gryffindogs (Gryffindor), Ravenpaw (Ravenclaw), Hufflefluff (Hufflepuff) or Slobberin (Slytherin), based on their personalities. Employees observe the dogs interacting with toys and other dogs before assigning them to a house, the shelter said.

When potential adopters arrive at the shelter, they read about the dogs' characteristics rather than their breeds.

“We want people to look at the dog for their behavior and personality and what their talents are,” said Stephen Bardy, Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando’s executive director. “We really wanted people to take a look at dogs for the dogs.”

He said he came up with the idea for the “Harry Potter”–themed houses as a fun way to address what is a serious problem: breed discrimination.

The Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando, a nonprofit shelter, gets about 1,800 pets per year that are surrendered because their owners are moving and their new landlord does not accept certain breeds, Bardy said, adding that most of those pets are dogs.

The shelter hopes that by not attaching breeds to dogs during the adoption process, people will pay more attention to the type of dog that will be the best fit for them. Bardy would like the initiative to spark a national conversation and encourage more shelters to do the same.

“We want people to understand what they want in a dog and what will work in their lifestyle rather than going into a shelter and saying, ‘I want a black Lab,’” Bardy said. “We want people to start talking about their own lifestyles and personalities and allow us to match a dog to them not based on looks or breed.”

The shelter took another page from the “Harry Potter” books by not separating puppies younger than 6 months into houses, Bardy said. In the series, only kids 11 or older are sorted into houses.

Dogs at the shelter stay in a house dubbed Pawgwarts while they wait to be sorted, he said.

The shelter has created an online quiz for dog owners everywhere to match their dogs with one of the four houses.

Bardy reports the shelter has seen a significant spike in foot and online traffic since launching the initiative last month. In the last week alone, 23 dogs were adopted from ""Harry Potter""-themed houses.

The most popular so far has been the Hufflepuff house, whose characteristics apply to nearly all dog breeds: hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, justice and fair play.

“We don’t want to build a bigger shelter. We want to figure out a way to end pet homelessness,” said Bardy. “It comes down to understanding dogs’ behavior and personalities and being a responsible pet owner.”"
"No more active bushfires in New South Wales, after more than 240 days",https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/119972159/no-more-active-bushfires-in-new-south-wales-after-more-than-240-days,"There are no more active bushfires in New South Wales, Australia for the first time in more than 240 days.

""For the first time since early July 2019, there is currently no active bush or grass fires in #NSW,"" the NSW Rural Fire Service posted on Instagram.

BRETT HEMMINGS/GETTY IMAGES The NSW Rural Fire Service work on putting out a fire in November 2019.

""That's more than 240 days of fire activity for the state.""

Since the fires began, at least 33 people have been killed, including firefighters, and about 11 million hectares of land had been scorched across NSW, Victoria and Queensland.

Australian wildlife was also hugely impacted by the unprecedented bushfire season; it's estimated more than one billion animals were killed.

World Wildlife Fund policy manager Dr Stuart Blanch said the summer bushfire crisis had an enormous impact on koala habitats.

LISA MAREE WILLIAMS/GETTY IMAGES Koalas affected by the bushfires sit in a recovery pen at the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park.

Preliminary surveys in NSW's north indicated some populations had shrunk by 80 to 85 per cent following the fires, Blanch told a NSW parliamentary inquiry in February.

Some NSW koala populations could be extinct by 2050, or sooner, he added.

For locals in the state, the NSW government paid out more than A$37 million (NZ$38.6m) in disaster relief grants to primary producers affected by fires.

California Program to Erase Old Marijuana Convictions,https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/marijuana-los-angeles-san-francisco-recreational-pot-559590321.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_LABrand,"Every California county prosecutor can now use new technology to erase or reduce an estimated 220,000 old marijuana convictions after voters broadly legalized the drug in 2016.

Code for America, a San Francisco-based nonprofit tech organization, announced Thursday it is making its computer algorithms available for free to all 58 district attorneys. The program quickly finds eligible cases in court documents that may date back decades.

Six counties including Los Angeles and San Francisco earlier used the Clear My Record program on a trial basis to clear an estimated 75,000 cannabis convictions.

Voters approved eliminating some pot-related crimes and wiping out past criminal convictions or reducing felonies to misdemeanors when they legalized adult marijuana use in 2016.

But there was no easy way to identify those who qualified.

The computer program not only identifies eligible cases, but automatically fills out forms to file with the courts. It can analyze conviction eligibility for about 10,000 people per minute, instead of requiring county employees to dig through individual records.

District attorneys have until July to decide whether to dismiss sentences or fight reducing the convictions.

Code for America founder and executive director Jennifer Pahlka said in a statement that the expansion ""will open the door to relief for tens of thousands of Californians...who have been denied jobs, housing and other opportunities because of their criminal record.""

The announcement comes a week after Cook County, Illinois, State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx announced she would use the technology, becoming the first county outside California to participate."
Colorado law would bar convicted animal abusers from owning pets,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/01/29/colorado-animal-abusers-pet-ban/,"People convicted of animal abuse could be banned from owning, babysitting or living with an animal if a Denver Democrat’s bill becomes state law.

Judges would also get the option to include therapy or anger management classes as part of a sentence.

“I think the real important piece of this legislation is the component that deals with judges being able to sentence folks to anger management or mental health treatment,” Rep. Alex Valdez, D-Denver, said.“There’s a correlation between people who commit acts of violence against animals and those same people committing acts of violence against people.”

HB19-1092 would give judges the discretion to prohibit adults and juveniles convicted of misdemeanor animal abuse from “owning, possessing, caring for, or residing with an animal of any kind” for a certain number of years. The ban would be mandatory for people convicted of felony animal abuse.

Valdez, a first-year lawmaker, modeled the bill after a California law that bans pet ownership for five years after a misdemeanor conviction and 10 years for a felony. But he said he got some pushback from members of the House Judiciary Committee where the bill is scheduled for its first hearing Thursday. He plans to change it during that hearing to give judges more leeway when it comes to sentencing.

“We’re leaving (misdemeanors) up to judicial discretion,” Valdez said. “They’re dealing with these cases day in and day out, and we don’t want to take away their ability to evaluate cases individually.”

Currently, Valdez said, judges don’t have a lot of discretion when it comes to the pets of people who mistreated an animal.

“As much as I love animals, this bill is about helping people who do these sorts of things, so we can prevent them from committing worse crimes in the future,” Valdez said.

Women in domestic violence shelters were 11 times more likely to report a partner had harmed or killed a pet than women who hadn’t experience domestic violence, according to a 2007 study for Sage Journals. Another study, by researchers at Northeastern University, found people who commit animal abuse were five times more likely to commit violent crime against a person.

Republicans in the Colorado House declined to comment through their spokesperson, but Valdez is optimistic his bill will find support from both parties.

Florida Republican Rick Scott signed a similar bill into law there in March 2018 when he was the governor.

“If Florida can pass this under complete conservative leadership, I think that we have a really good chance of doing this in Colorado as well,” Valdez said."

Criminals feel remorse and return the stolen belt, Along with apology and vow to get sober.",https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/thieves-return-wwe-belt-autistic-boy-brain-tumor-apology-letter-204715362.html,"Timmy Vick, a 5-year-old autistic boy from Delaware, likes to sleep with his replica WWE belt at night. (Credit: Sergio Moreira)

A group of porch pirates returned a stolen package of WWE belts that were meant for a sick 5-year-old boy and penned a heartfelt apology letter following public outcry.

The belts belonged to Timmy Vick, a boy with autism from Delaware who needs surgery to remove a dangerous brain tumor. According to the young boy’s father, Tim Sr., his son takes the wrestling belt with him everywhere and finds comfort sleeping with the accessory.

After Timmy’s father reached out to Sergio Moreira, a wrestling belt artist who refurbishes WWE replica belts with metal, leather, cubic zirconia and more, Moreira offered to decorate the sick boy’s accessory free of charge.

“When [Timmy’s father] sent me a message and asked me for help, he just was hoping for a discount,” Moreira tells Yahoo Lifestyle. Moreira, 50, has been restoring WWE replica belts to make them seem like the real champion belts for two years.

“I told him to just pay shipping and I would take care of the rest. I felt like it was the right thing to do for Timmy and his family. They have been through so much.”

The package with Timmy’s belts was delivered to Moreira’s home in Edgewood, Wash. on Monday. While Moreira was ringside at a WWE Raw show, an app on his phone alerted him that two women and a driver had swiped the package from his front porch.

Determined to make good on his promise for the sick boy, Moreira went to a local news station to bring attention to the story and Timmy’s illness.

“I want them to know they took hope from a 5-year-old boy who is looking forward to that item coming back to him,” Moreira told local news station KIRO7. “You stole that from him. You broke a child’s heart.”

Moreira went on television to plead with the unidentified thieves to return the package and the Edgewood Police Department also posted surveillance footage of the theft on their Facebook, leading community members to swiftly join the rallying cry to return the package to its rightful owner.

Story continues

Just two days later, the thieves went to Moreira’s home to return the box with Timmy’s belts along with a emotional four-page apology letter.

“We are so sorry for taking your stuff. Never in a million years would I have expected I would have stolen from a sick five year old,” reads the apology letter obtained by Yahoo Lifestyle. “I have a 6 year old myself and am ashamed of what I did.”

Homeless and addicted to drugs, the women explained that they were just “trying to make a quick dollar.” After watching the news and realizing what they had done, the women decided to rectify the situation.

“We never wanted to steal a child’s hope,” reads the letter. “After seeing ourselves looking like low lives on the news, we have both decided to get clean and sober.”

The two women who stole the package later returned the belts to Sergio Moriera's home, along with a heartfelt hand-written apology letter. (Credit: Sergio Moriera)

Edgewood Police Department Chief Micah Lundborg says he was surprised but glad the outreach was effective.

“I think it says something about people deep down inside that they want to do right for themselves and their children. Hopefully, that carries on beyond just children and the whole community,” Chief Lundborg tells Yahoo Lifestyle. He adds that the Edgewood Police Department hopes to find the women to give them the help they need to get clean.

Moreira says the women were crying and seemed very sorry when they dropped off the package at his home. He gave them a big hug and told them he didn’t plan to press charges.

With the belts returned, Moreira plans to have it delivered to its rightful owner by next week.

“Timmy is going to have a belt of a lifetime,” Moreira says. “It will be something he can carry with him as a symbol of people coming together to right a wrong and it was all for him.”

'The shelter pets absolutely love their chairs! If anyone has any older chairs they no longer want, please think of the shelter pets!' the humane society wrote on Facebook.

And that call was answered when about a dozen chairs were donated to the shelter by local residents on Wednesday.

'We have had so many chairs donated this morning! Thank you everyone for sharing and donating! The shelter pets send many licks and purrs of thanks!' the shelter wrote.

And not only did the dogs have comfy chairs to sleep on, but their feline friends received a few chairs as well.

Employees at the shelter showed off their free roaming cat room with some of their cats sitting on their chairs.

Michigan is officially a no-kill state for animal shelters!,https://www.wilx.com/content/news/Michigan-is-a-No-Kill-state-for-shelter-animals--559845821.html,"Michigan is now officially a ""no-kill state"" for shelter animals.

To be considered a ""no-kill"" state, 90 percent of animals are either returned to owners, transferred to other shelters and rescue organizations, or adopted.

“This is an amazing first for our state,” said Deborah Schutt, MPFA founder and chairperson. “When the shelters in a state combine to meet the 90% target, that state is considered No-Kill for shelter animals. Only Delaware, which has three shelters, compared to 174 in Michigan, also reached the No Kill benchmark last year.”

In 2018, Michigan reached that percentage.

“While it’s exciting to see Michigan as a state achieve No-Kill status by reaching the 90% goal, we still have a few communities struggling to save lives, especially with cats,” Schutt said. “We will continue to work with shelters and rescue organizations to implement best practices, decrease overall length of stay in the shelter and improve the quality of life for homeless pets while they are in a shelter.”

The Michigan Pet Fund Alliance (MPFA) began tracking these statistics in 2009 from annual reports submitted by shelters to the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development.

According to the MPFA, approximately 120,000 dogs and cats were being euthanized in Michigan shelters every year.

The MPFA said that number is now just over 13,000."
Police officer called the 'Guardian of the Golden Gate Bridge' has talked more than 200 people out of jumping off it,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/outintheopen/last-words-1.4512355/he-has-talked-more-than-200-people-off-the-ledge-of-the-golden-gate-bridge-1.4512600,"Kevin Briggs has been called the ""Guardian of the Golden Gate Bridge"".

He got the nickname while working as a California Highway Patrol officer for more than 23 years. Briggs spent most of that time positioned on the Golden Gate Bridge.

But the job turned out to be a lot more than he originally thought he was signing up for.

When Briggs started out in 1994, he was trained to handle traffic incidents but had never received training on how to deal with people contemplating suicide.

He didn't know at the time how pervasive the issue of suicide on the bridge was.

""There were four to six cases of suicidal folks on the bridge each and every month. And I had no idea about this, and I grew up in Marin County, which connects to San Francisco via that Golden Gate Bridge...I had no training to handle these types of situations.""

Briggs says in his first encounter with a suicidal person he ""did about everything wrong that you could"".

""In the back of my mind I was thinking, 'Am I responsible if she does jump? What happens here? I had no training in this. This is a really bad scene.'...I was afraid, I didn't know how to handle that situation.""

Briggs says he learned a lot from the encounters that followed.

""I think my approach right from the start was wrong. Just to walk up right to those folks and start talking with them. Now what I do is I stand back and I'll just introduce myself. I'll say 'Hi I'm Kevin' or 'I'm Kevin with the Highway Patrol, is it okay, is it alright if I come up and speak with you for a bit?' I want to get their permission and empower them.""

Since then, Kevin has talked to more than 200 people standing on the edge of the bridge.

One of those people is Kevin Berthia.

""He was very, very, very angry,"" says Briggs, ""And he wanted nothing to do with me. And he kept yelling at me 'Stay back! Stay back, if you come one step further I'm jumping!' And he was very serious about this. In my mind, if I took one step further then he was gone.""

The two spoke for more than 90 minutes about the problems Berthia was facing in his life. Briggs says he only spoke for about four or five minutes during the entire conversation. Eventually, Berthia decided to come back over and Briggs helped him over the edge and congratulated him.

""I asked him... 'What happened here? What was the turning point in this? What did I do that helped this situation? And what did I do that wasn't so good that hurt this situation?' And all he told me was, 'You listened. You let me speak, and you listened.' And that's all he was looking for and that's all that many, many people are looking for is someone to listen.""

Briggs says he thinks people contemplating suicide don't want to hear things like, ""You'll get over it,"" and, ""It's going to get better"".

""What I believe, personally, they want to hear is, 'Yeah, it is tough'.""

""I try to explain to them, wow that sounds really tough. And normalize their situation. That's a real big one, is to try to normalize their situation. You know, 'Wow, what you're going through is a whole lot of stuff and that'd be tough on anybody. I think anyone going through all that might be thinking about suicide'.

""It takes a lot of courage to be over that rail. It takes a lot of courage. But it also takes a lot of courage to come back and face the reality that is with them right now. But there is a brighter side to this, and it can happen, and it might take a long time and a lot of work. But life is beautiful and, you know, it is worth living.""



Briggs says that although he can't fix any of the issues that people are dealing with, it is important to listen and to try to understand what they are going through.

Briggs retired from the California Highway Patrol in 2013, and he now works in suicide prevention.

"New Texas laws: Illegal to send unsolicited nude photos, starting today.",http://www.fox4news.com/news/texas/new-texas-laws-illegal-to-send-unsolicited-nude-photos,"article

As states push to criminalize the sharing of intimate photos to get revenge on former sex partners, Texas is teaming with Bumble to crack down on people who send unsolicited nude images on dating apps and elsewhere in cyberspace.

The new Texas law banning so-called cyber flashing comes after state Rep. Morgan Meyer of Dallas collaborated with the Austin-based social and dating application company to shepherd a bill earlier this year.

""They had a number of people who were using the app complaining about the sending of these images and they quickly realized there was no recourse,"" Meyer said, recalling how Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd approached him about crafting a measure. ""There was nothing that could be done. It wasn't a criminal offense - although it was definitely digital sexual harassment.""

The law set to take effect Saturday forbids what is often characterized as technology-enabled sexual harassment. It makes electronic transmission of sexually explicit material a Class C misdemeanor with a fine of up to $500 if the person who received it hasn't given consent.

Meyer said the law targeting unwanted images will apply to text messages, email, dating apps and social media.

A 2017 survey by Pew Research Center found women encounter sexual harassment online at much higher rates than men. The study found 21% of women ages 18 to 29 report being sexually harassed online compared to 9% of men in the same age group. Roughly 53% of those women said someone has sent them explicit images they didn't ask for.

Caroline Ellis Roche, Bumble's chief of staff, said the company plans to take the legislation to the federal level and other states in hopes of enacting it more broadly.

The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative reports that 46 states have laws tackling so-called revenge porn, but almost none combat unsolicited sexually explicit images.

A handful of other states have laws criminalizing the electronic messaging of lewd content, but most of them are linked to the sender's intentions.

Washington, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have laws against cyberstalking, which is defined by intent to harass, said Pam Greenberg, a senior fellow for the National Conference of State Legislatures. In South Carolina, it's illegal to anonymously send any lewd content without the consent of the person receiving it.

Bumble, which bills itself as a feminist dating app where women make the first move, isn't the first dating app company to take on a legislative effort.

Match Group, which owns multiple dating app companies, helped pursue legislation that was passed in California and Vermont, according to its website. The California legislation requires all online dating platforms to post safety tips, and Vermont's requires the platforms to notify users where they engaged with another user who was removed for fraud.

Austin-based attorney J.T. Morris, who specializes in First Amendment cases, said the Texas law will face enforcement difficulties as well as legal challenges for being overly broad and vague.

""It reaches things that arguably could cover images related to medical advice or moms sharing information about breastfeeding or their babies' health - things like that which certainly can't be criminalized,"" Morris said.

Roche said Bumble understands enforcing the law will be a challenge, but the Texas legislation is intended to serve as a deterrent."

"Unanimous Maine Legislature passes 2 bills to reduce ‘welfare cliff’ - The bills, sponsored by Democratic and Republican leaders, are designed to let families keep some welfare benefits as they gradually gain more independence and income.",https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/18/bills-to-reduce-welfare-cliff-effect-pass-maine-legislature/,"AUGUSTA — A pair of bills aimed at lessening the impact of the so-called “welfare cliff” easily cleared the Legislature Tuesday with unanimous votes in both the House and the Senate.

The bills, called the Invest in Tomorrow package, are aimed at keeping families that are transitioning from welfare to work from losing health, financial and education benefits until they are earning enough to fully support themselves.

One of the measures raises the income limits for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, while the other allows those enrolled in state-funded education and job-training programs to gradually earn more money before losing all assistance. The bills are sponsored by House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, and Assistant House Minority Leader Trey Stewart, R-Presque Isle.

The term welfare cliff refers to the total loss of benefits that can occur when someone achieves even a relatively low level of income. Supporters of the bills say losing benefits because of a relatively minor increase in income is a disincentive for people seeking a higher-paying job or to gain skills that allow them to earn more.

Gideon, in her testimony to lawmakers in support of one of the bills, said a family of three must have a gross income of less than $12,276 to qualify for TANF. Under the bill approved Tuesday, the same family of three would qualify for TANF if its income was up to 88 percent of the federal poverty line, or $18,870 per year.

Stewart’s bill increases the earnings limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, while allowing a TANF recipient to apply the time spent studying for a General Equivalency Diploma toward work and education requirements.

“We have the chance to make real, positive change in the lives of Mainers experiencing poverty – for families who are struggling and only want better, brighter futures for themselves and their kids,” Gideon said in a prepared statement. “If we make the investments that are called for in these bills, we’re going to see the dividends pay off in a big way for our state’s economy today and in the years to come.”

A coalition of organizations that advocate for the poor in Maine praised the votes Tuesday, urging Maine Gov. Janet Mills to sign the bills into law.

“Passing these bills is the first big step to advance the Invest in Tomorrow policy agenda to increase economic security and opportunity for Maine kids and families, which reflects the thinking of community members, stakeholders and experts all over the state,” said Robyn Merrill, executive director of Maine Equal Justice. “The bipartisan effort we’ve seen to make a real difference for Maine families in our state is inspiring. It shows that poverty is not a partisan issue, it’s something we all care about.”

Dana Connors, the president of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, which also backed the bill package as part of the coalition, said the legislation will help Maine employers by increasing the workforce and equipping workers with more skills.

“With the passage of these bills, it’s great to know that the state will not only be doing the right things to help Maine families and young children succeed, we’ll also be making an investment in the future of our workforce,” Connors said, also in a prepared statement.

Stewart, in his testimony to the Legislature, said the measures are meant to encourage people to seek work.

“These hard-working individuals have aspirations for themselves and their families that far exceed their current situation and status,” Stewart said. “They simply need a targeted and coordinated hand-up, along with some good advice from experts in this area in order to make it happen.”

The two measures, funded with $11 million a year from federal block grants, now head to Mills’ desk.

"Mexican Girl Bullied For Being “Weird” Has A Higher IQ Than Einstein, So Let’s Protect Her Instead Of Giving Her A Supervillain Origin Story",https://tanksgoodnews.com/2019/11/18/adhara-perez/,"She may have had a difficult past, but Mexico City resident Adhara Pérez has a bright future. At just eight years old, she already has an IQ of 162— higher than both Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, who each had an IQ of about 160.

Now, the little girl has written a book about her experiences (Do Not Give Up is the rough translation), and was recently featured in Forbes México‘s 100 Most Powerful Women in Mexico list. She’s even working on a smart bracelet that will monitor the emotions of differently-abled children.

But it took a long time before Pérez’s extraordinary gifts were recognized.

After being diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder at three years old—a developmental disorder that oftentimes causes difficulties with social interaction and communication—the little girl faced bullying and harassment from the other kids at school.

Pérez was “made a joke at school,” reports The Digital Weekly, and her mother Nallely Sanchez said: “I witnessed that Adhara was playing in a little house, and they bolted her up. And they began to chant: ‘Oddball, weirdo!'”

The bullying got so bad that Pérez fell into “intense” depression and stopped wanting to go to school. Teachers said when she did go to class, she would often fall asleep and daydream.

It wasn’t until her mother took her to therapy that Pérez’ unusually high IQ was discovered and she was placed into classes according to her abilities.

Her rare intelligence allowed Pérez to finish elementary school at five years of age, middle school at six, and high school at eight. She is currently studying two online degrees: Industrial Engineering in Mathematics at UNITEC and Systems Engineering by CNCI, and she dreams of entering the University of Arizona to study astrophysics in the near future, according to The Yucatan Times."

United Nations (United States) (AFP)

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has donated a $100,000 prize she won from a Danish foundation to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for use against the COVID-19 pandemic, the world body said Thursday.

""Like the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is a child rights crisis,"" Thunberg, 17, was quoted as saying in the UNICEF statement.

""It will affect all children, now and in the long term, but vulnerable groups will be impacted the most,"" she added.

""I'm asking everyone to step up and join me in support of UNICEF's vital work to save children's lives, to protect health and continue education.""

The Danish anti-poverty non-governmental organization, Human Act, will match the $100,000 donation, the statement added.

UNICEF said the funds would give it a boost as it struggles to support children impacted by anti-virus lockdowns and school closures, particularly in the fields of ""food shortages, strained health care systems, violence and lost education.""

Thunberg said at the end of March that she had ""likely"" contracted the coronavirus, after experiencing several symptoms after a trip to central Europe.

U.S. Marshals Find DOZENS of Missing Children in Georgia - Breaking911,https://breaking911.com/breaking-u-s-marshals-find-dozens-of-missing-children-in-georgia/,"Washington, DC – The U.S. Marshals Service Missing Child Unit, in conjunction with the agency’s Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Georgia state and local agencies, led a two-week operation in August in Atlanta and Macon, Georgia, to rescue endangered missing children.

“Operation Not Forgotten” resulted in the rescue of 26 children, the safe location of 13 children and the arrest of nine criminal associates. Additionally, investigators cleared 26 arrest warrants and filed additional charges for alleged crimes related to sex trafficking, parental kidnapping, registered sex offender violations, drugs and weapons possession, and custodial interference. The 26 warrants cleared included 19 arrest warrants for a total of nine individuals arrested, some of whom had multiple warrants.

“The U.S. Marshals Service is fully committed to assisting federal, state, and local agencies with locating and recovering endangered missing children, in addition to their primary fugitive apprehension mission,” said Director of the Marshals Service Donald Washington. “The message to missing children and their families is that we will never stop looking for you.”

These missing children were considered to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area, based on indications of high-risk factors such as victimization of child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and medical or mental health conditions. Other children were located at the request of law enforcement to ensure their wellbeing. USMS investigators were able to confirm each child’s location in person and assure their safety and welfare.

The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 enhanced the U.S. Marshals’ authority to assist federal, state, and local law enforcement with the recovery of missing, endangered or abducted children, regardless of whether a fugitive or sex offender was involved. The Marshals established a Missing Child Unit to oversee and manage the implementation of its enhanced authority under the act.

In 2019, the USMS helped recover 295 missing children based on requests for assistance from law enforcement and has contributed to the recovery of a missing child in 75 percent of cases received. Additionally, of the missing children recovered, 66 percent were recovered within seven days of the USMS assisting with the case. Since its partnership with NCMEC began in 2005, the agency has recovered more than 1,800 missing children.

“When we track down fugitives, it’s a good feeling to know that we’re putting the bad guy behind bars. But that sense of accomplishment is nothing compared to finding a missing child,” said Darby Kirby, Chief of the Missing Child Unit. “It’s hard to put into words what we feel when we rescue a missing child, but I can tell you that this operation has impacted every single one of us out here. We are working to protect them and get them the help they need.”

This initiative was the culmination of several months of planning and coordination between the USMS, NCMEC, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Georgia Office of the Attorney General, Georgia Department of Family and Children Services, Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.

"Jacinda Ardern and ministers take 20% pay cut in solidarity with those hit by Covid-19 | New Zealand PM says: ‘If there was ever a time to close the gap between groups of people across New Zealand in different positions, it is now’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/jacinda-ardern-and-ministers-take-20-pay-cut-in-solidarity-with-those-hit-by-covid-19,"New Zealand PM says: ‘If there was ever a time to close the gap between groups of people across New Zealand in different positions, it is now’

New Zealand’s prime minister has said she and other ministers will take a 20% pay cut lasting six months to show solidarity with those affected by the coronavirus outbreak, as the death toll continues to rise.

Jacinda Ardern said it was important the government’s most highly paid politicians show “leadership and solidarity” with workers on the frontline and those who had lost their livelihoods. Ardern, government ministers and public service chief executives will take the cut for six months, effective immediately.

The pay cut will reduce Ardern’s salary by $47,104. Cabinet ministers would take a cut of NZ$26,900 each, while deputy prime minister Winston Peters’ salary would be cut by $33,473.

Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health who has led the elimination response to the crisis, confirmed he would “definitely” take a pay cut too, as would opposition leader Simon Bridges.

Ardern said: “If there was ever a time to close the gap between groups of people across New Zealand in different positions, it is now. I am responsible for the executive branch and this is where we can take action … it is about showing solidarity in New Zealand’s time of need.”

Ardern accepted the cut would not influence the government’s overall fiscal position: “This was always just going to be an acknowledgement of the hit that many New Zealanders will be taking at the moment.”

New Zealand has been in full lockdown for three weeks, meaning no one is allowed to leave their homes except for necessities or a brief respite of fresh air. More than 1,300 people have been infected with the virus, and there have been nine deaths, all older people with pre-existing health conditions.

A total of 1.5 million people have claimed the government’s wage subsidy to help them weather a temporary loss of income. Modelling from Treasury has suggested that a prolonged and strict lockdown could see one in four New Zealanders out of work in the worst-case scenario. A swift end to the lockdown along with a further government stimulus package could reduce joblessness to 8.5%. Currently, unemployment stands at 4%.

The International Monetary Fund is forecasting that the New Zealand economy will shrink by 7.2% this year. In its World Economic Outlook, it says New Zealand will see the biggest economic contraction outside Europe, except for Venezuela.

Also on Wednesday, the epidemic response committee heard from major media players about the challenges they were facing under lockdown, which had seen Stuff and NZME lose more than 50% of their advertising revenue, and NZME lay off 200 staff and order those remaining to take a 15% pay cut for three months.

Stuff chief executive Sinead Boucher told the committee that 2 million New Zealanders visited its website every day, and it and other domestic news media were playing a “crucial” role in providing quality news throughout the crisis, and debunking fake news that had mushroomed online.

“There is an immediate need to survive these next few months,” Boucher said, adding she was unable to rule out redundancies. “There needs to be some kind of ongoing government support for a commercial media industry in New Zealand.”

A government rescue package for the media is expected this week."

India's only openly gay prince discusses coming out and turning his pink palace into a centre for at-risk LGBT+ people,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-openly-gay-prince-mavendra-coming-out-pink-palace-lgbt-centre-vulnerable-people-interview-a8202921.html,"Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil might have grown up in a vast and opulent rococo palace in prosperous Gujarat with servants responding to his every beck and call but it would be wrong to assume his life has been free of problems.

The Indian prince, who is the son and probable heir of the Maharaja of Rajpipla in Gujarat in western India, was forced to shroud his sexuality from public view for years. Marrying a princess of Jhabua State in Madhya Pradesh in 1991, Prince Manvendra lived a lie and his matrimony remained unconsummated for its entirety.

Unable to endure the secrecy, he eventually confided in his wife about his sexual orientation. Barely a year after the wedding she filed for divorce despite separation being virtually unheard of in India at the time and still massively taboo now.

Like many in India – where sex between people of the same gender is punishable by law – the 52-year-old kept his homosexuality a secret from everyone for many years after the divorce. Fortunately his wife kept her promise to never divulge his sexuality.

But this was not easy and in 2002 Prince Manvendra had a nervous breakdown and found himself in hospital. It was there that his psychiatrist told his parents he was gay. This did not go down well and his parents insisted his sexuality must be kept a secret. They tried to “cure” him with both medical and religious measures.

If this was not bad enough the prince’s life was thrown into yet further disarray and chaos after he publicly came out as gay. The revelation was not only breaking news all over India but also grabbed headlines worldwide. In his home state of Rajpipla, effigies of the prince were burned and people called for him to be robbed of his title and ostracised. His parents brought out public notices saying they wanted to publicly disown him and disinherit him from the ancestral property.

“Coming out in India is very difficult. There is so much stigma. Society doesn’t allow parents to accept it,” the prince, who is the first and only openly gay royal in India, tells The Independent.

“Parents blackmail their children and force them to get married to the opposite sex. People in the community tell me their mothers have threatened to kill themselves if they are gay. They do not want their mother to jump into a well so they are pressured to get married.”

The royal said homelessness is a massive problem in the LGBT+ community in India. “People in India are so attached to their parents they are not able to live without them. When they try and come out parents do not understand and disown their children and throw them out of the home. The children don’t know where to go and are homeless,” he said.

“I need to rescue these people who have been rendered homeless otherwise they will die, commit suicide, or get depressed.”

Prince Manvendra is not talking in vague, nebulous terms and actually has a solution in mind. The royal is going so far as to transform his 15-acre pink palace into a centre for vulnerable LGBT+ people.

The centre aims to deliver clinical services, financial support and skills training for young LGBT+ people so they are able to become financially independent from their families. He will run the centre with his community-based organisation The Lakshya Trust which he started to support gay men and educate people about the prevention of HIV/Aids.

“There are two aims. One is social empowerment and the other is economic empowerment,” he explains. “The idea is to teach people how to become self-reliant so they can earn their own living based on their skills and talents. There is a lot of discrimination which the community faces so we want people to feel confident.”

The royal, who says he has been thinking about the idea for 15 years, also plans to use the centre to offer free safe-sex seminars to young LGBT+ people across India and run workshops with parents who have accepted their children’s sexuality. He is constructing more buildings to house visitors to the centre who will be able to stay in shared accommodation.

The aptness of the palace being pink is not lost on Prince Manvendra. “Our city is called the pink city of Gujarat and most of the buildings are painted pink,” he explains. “It has been pink for almost 300 years now and I always say maybe one of my ancestors painted it pink because they knew one of their relatives would like it.”

He says the palace was visited by many Hollywood stars back in the day and that Ian Fleming, who wrote the James Bond series of spy novels, visited the palace as he was a friend of his great-grandfather’s.

But the prince is not getting the centre up and running on his own and has procured the support of Kanwar Amarjit Singh – a 28-year-old Indian royal who is also an LGBT+ activist.

Prince Manvendra is so appreciative of Mr Singh’s decision to help with funding he has named the centre after him – it will be called Hanumanteshwar Amar 1927. Mr Singh, who divides his time between India and London, describes the prince as his “mentor” and explains their ancestors were great friends.

Mr Singh, who runs a feminist art gallery near Kings Cross in London called Amar Gallery currently showing Guerrilla Girls artwork, was driven out of India at the age of just 20 after he spoke out about supporting gay rights – though he himself is heterosexual. The activist, who is the main funder and support of Prince Manvendra's LGBT centre, runs a grassroots network of activists in India that confronts the oppression of the LGBT+ community and women through education.

“We work on advocacy for LGBT+ and women’s rights,” Mr Singh says. “It makes me so angry the police in some townships are beating gay men and people for handing out condoms, and girls as young as four being forced into prostitution"".

“We connected a decade ago and he has been a champion for LGBT+ rights since I have known him. I consider him as an ally,” Prince Manvendra chips in.

Over in India Prince Manvendra also emphasises the importance of education and uses his platform to speak to university students about LGBT+ issues. In fact, the royal has had something of a turnaround since coming out and being shunned by society after coming out.

He has not only been accepted by his family but has been on The Oprah Winfrey Show three times and even appeared on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

“Oprah’s interview was a big turning point in my life,” he reflects. “The whole of society had turned against me but the moment I got invited on things changed. She was extremely nice to me, said she had interviewed many people in the last 25 years, but I was one of the most honest people she had ever met.”

Despite the progress Prince Manvendra has made and continues to make in India, it is worth remembering that Indian law continues to criminalise sexual acts between members of the same sex and homophobia remains deeply culturally ingrained. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of India has ordered a review of the legislation later this year.

In Prince Manvendra’s view, the problem is rooted in Indian society’s attitude to sex as a whole. “It is a taboo to even speak about sex and there is no sex education in schools,” he says.

Ironically the prince, who campaigns for the reform of India’s anti-LGBT+ laws, says homosexual behaviour is far more accepted than heterosexual behaviour in the country. “Men are affectionate with each other but heterosexual behaviour is not accepted,” he explains. “Our country is a paradox in that way. It is very easy to get a room for same sex at a hotel but if a male and female want a room you have to prove the relationship."
"Alaska Airlines today made history flying the first commercial flight using the world’s first renewable, alternative jet fuel made from forest residuals, the limbs and branches that remain after the harvesting of managed forests.",https://news.wsu.edu/2016/11/14/forest-powered-biofuel-flight/,"SEATTLE – Washington state-based Alaska Airlines today made history flying the first commercial flight using the world’s first renewable, alternative jet fuel made from forest residuals, the limbs and branches that remain after the harvesting of managed forests.

The alternative jet fuel was produced through the efforts of the Washington State University-led Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA).

The demonstration flight departed Seattle-Tacoma International Airport this morning for Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. The flight was fueled with a 20 percent blend of sustainable aviation biofuel, which is chemically indistinguishable from regular jet A fuel. The flight, the first commercial passenger flight of its kind, continues to advance viable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels for aviation.

Reducing carbon footprint

“This latest milestone in Alaska’s efforts to promote sustainable biofuels is especially exciting since it is uniquely sourced from the forest residuals in the Pacific Northwest,” said Joe Sprague, Alaska Airlines’ senior vice president of communications and external relations. “NARA’s accomplishments and the investment of the U.S. Department of Agriculture provide another key in helping Alaska Airlines and the aviation industry reduce its carbon footprint and dependency on fossil fuels.”

While the 1,080 gallons of biofuel used on the flight has a minimal impact to Alaska Airlines’ overall greenhouse gas emissions, if the airline were able to replace 20 percent of its entire fuel supply at Sea-Tac Airport, it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 142,000 metric tons of CO2. This is equivalent to taking approximately 30,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year.

NARA is a five-year project that launched in 2011 and is comprised of 32 member organizations from industry, academia and government laboratories. Today’s flight represents its efforts to develop alternative jet fuel derived from post-harvest forestry material that is often burned after timber harvest.

The forest residual feedstock used to power Alaska Airlines Flight 4 was sourced from tribal lands and private forestry operations in the Pacific Northwest. In addition to producing 1,080 gallons of biofuel used for the flight, other key tasks of the project included evaluating the economic, environmental and societal benefits and impacts associated with harvesting unused forest residuals for biofuel production.

Empowering regional, rural economies

The NARA initiative was made possible by a $39.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to support research on biofuels and biochemicals, foster regional supply chain coalitions, empower rural economic development and educate the public on the benefits of bioenergy.

“Today is a tribute to all of our NARA partners, and especially to NIFA who supported our mission to facilitate the revolutionary development of biojet and bioproduct industries in the Pacific Northwest using forest residuals that would otherwise become waste products,” said Ralph Cavalieri, NARA executive director. “We are proud of every one of the partners and stakeholders – from forest managers to Gevo and Alaska Airlines – who have laid the foundations for a renewable fuel economy that will keep skies clear and healthy with the potential to bolster economically challenged timber-based rural communities in our region.”

Gevo, Inc., a NARA partner, successfully adapted its patented technologies to convert cellulosic sugars derived from wood waste into renewable isobutanol, which was then converted into Gevo’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) fuel. Believed to be the world’s first alternative jet fuel produced from wood, the fuel meets international ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standards, allowing it to be used safely for today’s commercial flight.

WSU among many partners, stakeholders

“This first of its kind flight demonstrates Gevo’s commitment and ability to convert a wide range of sugar feedstocks into drop-in renewable fuels,” said Pat Gruber, Gevo’s chief executive officer. “We are pleased that we had the opportunity to prove, through the NARA project, that cellulosic sugars from wood can be used to successfully make commercial jet fuel. We congratulate our fellow NARA partners and thank the USDA-NIFA for its unwavering support in the pursuit of renewable jet fuel. I also thank Alaska Airlines, which continues to be a great partner.”

Several elected officials joined the 163 passengers on the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-800 jet bound for the nation’s capital, including U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene (WA-1), U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert (WA-8) and U.S. Rep. Denny Heck (WA-10).

“I am proud to see the world’s first biojet fuel made from forest residuals being flown on an Alaska Airlines airplane,” said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray. “The Pacific Northwest continues to be on the cutting edge of new technology that will make airplanes better, safer and more efficient, and I’m thrilled that so many stakeholders came together and that Washington State University has led this important effort.”

Expanding global competitiveness

“Today’s flight comes after years of investments to help the aviation biofuels industry take off,” said U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell. “By creating these sustainable biofuels, we will revitalize our rural agricultural communities, foster economic growth, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cut our dependence on foreign oil while growing our competitiveness in global markets.”

“Today’s flight demonstrates that Washington state’s innovation economy is once again at the forefront of collaborative, transformative research by using material that would otherwise be discarded to create a new biofuel,” said DelBene. “Here in the Pacific Northwest, we know that the natural environment that surrounds us is what makes living here so special. We have a tremendous opportunity in our region to build a new green economy and find innovative solutions to address climate change for our health and future generations, as this project highlights.”

The invasive pampas grass has been uprooted from all known locations on Hawai’i Island. The Big Island Invasive Species Committee announced the eradication of the grass on Tuesday.,https://bigislandnow.com/2020/09/23/pampas-grass-eradicated-from-hawaii-island-biisc-reports/,"The invasive pampas grass has been uprooted from all known locations on Hawai’i Island.

The Big Island Invasive Species Committee announced the eradication of the grass on Tuesday. Two species of pampas grass occur in Hawai‘i, Cortaderia jubata and Cortaderia selloana; both are on the state’s Noxious Weeds list.

Removal of the plants by BIISC crews took time, as permission from property owners was required for most of the sites, according to a BIISC press release.

“Locating and contacting property owners can pose a significant challenge for control efforts, but overall most homeowners were cooperative and eager to support the removal of an invasive plant from their property,” the release stated.

Hawai‘i Department of Agriculture assisted with securing access for removal where permission was difficult to obtain. When BIISC crews removed the last known plant in 2019, they replanted the area with native mamaki.

Although most of the adult plants were removed early in the eradication timeline, Joel Brunger, the field operations supervisor for BIISC, explains that with a potential seed spread of up to 20 miles, surveying for pampas grass near known locations required a significant investment of time.

“After the adult plants are removed, we have to return and conduct sweeps regularly for new sprouting keiki for as long as the seeds are viable,” Brunger said. “For pampas grass, that’s six years.”

BIISC said pampas grass is still sold throughout the world in the horticultural trade and for landscaping. During the course of the eradication effort, BIISC developed the Plant Pono program, a nursery endorsement and education effort aimed at stopping the sale of invasive plants in Hawai‘i.

Plant Pono-endorsed nurseries voluntarily pledge to sell only non-invasive “pono” plants. There have been no sales of pampas grass in Hawaii for the last several years, although seeds purchased online continue to be a risk for introductions of invasive plants.

“People often look at widespread invasive plants like albizia or clidemia and say, why didn’t anyone do something about it before it became this bad?” asked Franny Brewer, communications director for BIISC. “That’s what we’re trying to do. Identify what has come in that is potentially the next serious problem, and remove it before it has decades to spread.”

Brewer explains that once a harmful species reaches a certain point, complete eradication becomes so expensive — in the tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars — that removal of the species is no longer feasible.

Currently, BIISC is targeting a number of other plants for eradication, including Mollucca raspberry, a thorny, sprawling brush species, and a holly tree that can establish in native forest areas.

As with pampas grass, public reports are a critical tool in efforts to eradicate invasive plants. To learn how to identify and report target species, visit www.biisc.org."
"The largest reforestation project in history will see 73 million trees planted in the Brazilian Amazon across land the size of 30,000 soccer fields",https://www.fastcompany.com/40481305/the-largest-ever-tropical-reforestation-is-planting-73-million-trees,"There are more habitable planets in our galaxy than humans living on planet Earth. But the nearest one is about 70 trillion miles away , which means that, for now, and for the foreseeable future, Earth is the only life-supporting rock hurtling through infinite space we’ll ever know. It’s really not the best idea to let it burn up–and key to keeping it cool are the massive rainforests of the Amazon. Sadly, we’ve had a hard time not cutting them down.

A new project should help prevent–or at least slow down–that hot future. If all goes to plan over the next six years, a project led by Conservation International will become the largest tropical reforestation project in history. Seventy-three million trees will sprout up across what’s known as the “arc of deforestation,” in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Rondônia, and throughout the Xingu watershed. The short-term plan is to restore 70,000 acres (the area of 30,000 soccer fields) that have been cleared for pastureland to their former forested glory.



“If the world is to hit the 1.2°C or 2°C [degrees of warming] target that we all agreed to in Paris, then protecting tropical forests in particular has to be a big part of that,” M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, tells Fast Company. “It’s not just the trees that matter, but what kind of trees. If you’re really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most.”

He’s right: Simply stopping deforestation could allow existing forests to absorb up to 37% of our annual carbon emissions; replenishing degraded areas could do significantly more for the planet.

“This is not a stunt,” Sanjayan says. “It is a carefully controlled experiment to literally figure out how to do tropical restoration at scale, so that people can replicate it and we can drive the costs down dramatically.”

Over the past 40 years, about 20% of the Amazon has been cut down or destroyed, and scientists worry that another 20% of the rainforest will be lost in the next couple of decades. So, instead of following precedent and planting saplings, which are labor and resource intensive to manage (and, depending on the selected species, may not be best-suited for the territory, resulting in less than ideal survival rates), the organizing coalition is trying something different.



Developed in Brazil only a few years ago, the new planting technique is called muvuca. “In Portuguese, it means a lot of people in a very small place,” says Rodrigo Medeiros, Conservation International’s vice president of the Brazil program and the lead on the ground.

Have you heard about the plastic bag ban in Bali? But did you know it's partly because of two teen sisters who have been campaigning for years to rid their island of plastic,https://www.kinder-world.org/articles/solutions/teen-activists-the-sisters-who-convinced-bali-to-ban-plastic-bags-18983,"These questions (and a dozen more) set us on the path to become the world first organisation trying to make sense of the charitable space and all the organisations in it. The vetting framework we started to build should allow us to benchmark charitable organisations focussing on a certain problem in a certain region and simply allowing the funders to pick the best performers. Everybody wins. The funders, the organisations, the beneficiairies, the planet.

So fast forward to 2020.

The pandemic is making it very tough for organisations to connect to funders in the conventional ways. All sports events (often used for fundraisers) are paused. All fundraising events they normally organise are cancelled. Even door collections or street raising has come to a halt. So there is some real urgency in providing new and improved ways to raise funds.

Right now we are at the stage that we have a great university backed framework. We've vetted over 2500 organisations and tweaked the algorithm. And we've created some great products and services to raise funds. Right now it is time to connect the data to the funders and start raising for the top 10%.

Call for brands

And for this we need to involve brands.

Bold brands that really want to do good, better. Brands that want to tackle important problems in the world.

Brands that will embrace an appeal to fix that problem.

Because together we have the power to effect change and to inspire and motivate people.



We want to enable this strength to make a difference, creating a community of concerned citizens and organisations that are creating lasting impact.



I’ve seen the effects of a silo mentality in the charitable landscape.



This call is for Brands that dare to stand up and tear down these silos. Because only together we can make a change.

Nicki Minaj celebrates Thanksgiving by handing out over 500 turkeys to Queens residents,https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/nicki-minaj-hands-out-over-500-turkeys-to-queens-residents-for-thanksgiving-a3996816.html,"Nicki Minaj handed out more than 500 turkeys as she helped residents getting ready for Thanksgiving Day in her old hometown.

Minaj, 35, wrapped up warm to brave the biting New York City cold as she returned to South Jamaica, Queens, to volunteer.

Fans lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the star, who stopped to greet the crowd and take photos with fans before getting behind the table to help.

Minaj later shared her own snap on Instagram, writing: “Mommy & I had a great time with y’all today. (Yea, that’s her with the hoodie on).

“Love all of you for coming out. @seanbellrecords & @bone_mbz + everyone who helped make this happen today, thank you so much. QUEENS #QGTM LOVE YOU 4 LIFE.”

The Anaconda artist stopped to take a photo with the Commanding Officer of the local police department, who posted the snap on social media.

The department also shared pictures of Minaj with her fans and the crowds gathered in South Jamaica for the giveaway.

Minaj wasn’t the only star returning to their hometown to help out before the major holiday, with rapper Nick Cannon helping at a foodbank.

Cannon posted a picture with his seven-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe, who he shares with pop icon Mariah Carey, in Harlem.

He captioned a shot of the three of them: “Giving back and volunteering Family Style!”

In a different snap, Cannon and his children posed with one of the other volunteers, with Cannon writing that they had a ""great day""."

After a cluster of local teen suicides, stay-at-home dad Colby Wallace launched the “You Matter” campaign to strengthen mental health.

On May 12th, Wallace, the 42-year-old father in Queen Anne, Seattle, heard about four teen suicides in King County. “These were local high school students and no one was really talking about it,” Wallace tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

A friend told Wallace about the Don’t Give Up Movement, started in 2017 by Amy Wolff, a mom in Newberg, Oregon who, affected by the suicide rates in her community, started distributing motivational signs. Now, she runs a non-profit that sells signs, wall decals, and wristbands with encouraging phrases.

It was smart, thought Wallace, so he called Wolfe and spent $105 on 15 signs: ‘You’re Worthy of Love,’ ‘Don’t Give Up,’ ‘You Matter,’ and ‘Your Mistakes Don’t Define You.’ He paid $30 for 200 branded wristbands.

“We placed signs across the street from my daughter’s school and an older woman told me, ‘Thank you so much because people my age really need to hear this,” Wallace tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The gentle signs are non-intrusive reminders to keep going. “I’ve learned that you never know who is struggling,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “Some people seem like they have it together but need to hear this.”

When his five- and nine-year-old daughters’ elementary school asked to feature the signs in its newsletters, naming them the “You Matter” campaign, people started helping Wallace with distribution. “A woman told me she was in tears after dropping off her daughter at school because the sign made her feel heard,” he says.

Wallace and his family placed the signs all around town, including one with “Don’t Give Up” on a steep hill for bicyclists in need of literal motivation.

But someone has been tearing down Wallace’s work, bending the metal stakes and stealing the signs altogether. “Maybe it’s someone who needs to hear these messages,” says Wallace.

Now, neighbors are donating money to Wallace for him to fund new orders and he’s already spent $400 on new supplies. The dad will post signs throughout the spring and continue again when school starts.

“I would love for someone to continue this work in other neighborhoods,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “Really, anyone can do this.”

"In 2011, Sonia Vallabh was handed a genetic report that contained a death sentence: she carried the gene for a prion disease, fatal familial insomnia. She quit her job, got a PhD and is now working with Ionis Pharma to develop a potential drug for her condition.",https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611672/one-womans-race-to-defuse-the-genetic-time-bomb-in-her-genes/?utm_campaign=social_button&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2018-07-23,"In 2011, Sonia Vallabh was handed a genetic report that contained a death sentence. But it also held a map for how to escape.

Her body, she learned, harbored a gene mutation, a single wrong letter of DNA in her “prion” gene, that would eventually lead to a rare brain condition called fatal familial insomnia. Her mother had died of it the year before, and the test had revealed Vallabh had inherited the flaw too.

By now, the decision by Vallabh and her husband, Eric Minikel, to try to prevent her disease—“a prion love story,” the New Yorker called it—is well-known. After the diagnosis of the genetic time bomb, they dropped out of their careers in law and engineering and became scientists dedicated to defusing it. They expect to get PhDs next spring (see “Sonia Vallabh, 35 Innovators Under 35, 2016”.)

Now, after seven years, they think they have found a treatment that can do it. It’s called an antisense drug, a type of mirror-image molecule that, if it reaches the brain, could greatly reduce the amount of the prion protein. That could potentially forestall the mysterious chain reaction of misfolding proteins that characterize prion diseases.

Less of the protein, Vallabh reasons, and less chance she’ll get sick.

Two weeks ago, on their blog, Vallabh announced she and Minikel were working with a commercial partner, the California biotech company Ionis, which specializes in antisense compounds. “For the first time, I am optimistic about a specific therapeutic strategy,” she wrote. It’s “plausible” that antisense could treat the disease “in our lifetime.”

Vallabh’s race to prevent her own prion disease raises a question for the genetic age. Given a perfect DNA blueprint of your inherited disease, what’s your chance of stopping it in your lifetime, or that of someone you love?

There are reasons to think these types of medical long shots have become more likely to hit the mark. That is because gene sequencing can cheaply reveal molecular flaws, but also because a set of promising technologies—antisense, gene therapy, and CRISPR gene editing—are able to replace genes or silence them, in effect fixing genetic problems at their source.

What’s more, these treatments employ the genetic code; they are actually made of DNA or RNA. That means that they’re fundamentally modular and programmable. At least on paper, it is now possible to take any genetic flaw and quickly sketch an antidote.

In reality, drug development is notoriously complicated. Most drugs fail, torn down by biological surprises and unexpected toxicity to the human body. But Vallabh says in the early, confusing days of her quest, she received critical advice from Eric Lander, the biologist who leads the Broad Institute, where she and Minikel now study and work. He told her to focus on the genetic error itself—the blueprint of which was in her diagnosis.

“You need to see what you have in your hand and stop looking,” she recalls him saying.

That meant not waiting to answer important scientific unknowns, like what the prion protein does in the body, or why, when it misfolds, it kills brain cells. “There are so many interesting questions about prion disease,” says Vallabh, who is 34. “And those questions will still be there when we are treating it.”

Prion diseases are profoundly strange because they’re caused not by a virus, but by an infectious protein. They include scrapie in sheep, Kuru (spread by cannibalism), Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, and the human version of mad cow disease.

The key drug insight was that mice engineered to lack the prion protein gene never get sick, even when scientists inject infectious prions into their brains. “The biological concept of a prion is a protein that changes it conformation, and that can template further copies. It’s self-templating. That allows it to spread,” says Kurt Giles, a researcher in the lab at the University of California, San Francisco, where prions were first discovered. “That leads to the idea of reducing the [protein]. The less of it there is, then you will get less templating.”

For genetic therapies, though, there’s a further problem, which is how to get them into the body so that they reach, for instance, billions of brain cells.

Antisense technology, conceived decades ago, had its big breakthrough last year when a drug developed by Ionis proved to be astoundingly effective in treating a childhood neurological disorder, spinal muscular atrophy.

By then, Vallabh and Minikel had been introduced to Ionis, and the company had agreed to provide them with antisense compounds targeted to the prion gene to test in mice. Holly Kordasiewicz, the head of neuroscience at Ionis, recalls the 2014 meeting. “We left the room saying we need to do everything that we can to help these people,” she says.

The company gave Vallabh and Minikel a to-do list, which they quickly worked through. Patient registry? Check. Animal studies? Check. Biomarker to show if a drug is working? That research, too, is under way at a Boston hospital studying prion protein levels in spinal fluid.

“Sonia and Eric are doing this with no real funding, just trying to make it happen,” says Jeff Carroll, another patient scientist (he’s got the mutation for Huntington’s disease), who introduced them to Ionis.

One problem not as easily addressed is that prion disease is astoundingly rare, quickly fatal, and rarely diagnosed in advance. That means there has been no great clamor for treatments. Maybe only 200 people in the U.S. know they have a time bomb like Vallabh, she says, and there’s not a single drug currently in human testing. Early on, Ionis let the pair know the collaboration was strictly academic and not a commercial prospect.

But by blotting out the prion protein at its source, an antisense treatment might help with a range of rare conditions linked to it. Fatal insomnia is vanishingly uncommon, as are cases of mad cow disease, but adding these “ultra-rare” diseases together makes them, as a group, slightly less rare.

Vallabh and Minikel say they now have proof that Ionis’s antisense molecules partly protect mice from prion disease. Those animals given the drug live about 70 percent longer.

Kordasiewicz now terms the program a “commercial” project at Ionis, though it remains too small and early-stage to appear on the company’s pipeline chart of drugs under development. “What changed is the data is looking good enough that we think we can have a drug in five years,” she says.

Vallabh hopes it can all go even faster. The fatal insomnia could begin to afflict her tomorrow, or in 30 years. There’s no way to predict it. She and Minikel just had their first child. The girl was conceived through IVF, and Vallabh says the lab employed a genetic test to assure them she wouldn’t carry the mutation.

To save herself, it’s not going to be enough to have a drug. She needs to get it before she ever falls ill. Yet doctors have little experience giving such a genetic drug over many years as a form of prevention.

Figuring out how to carry off such a study is the next challenge for Vallabh and her husband. It appears they hope the US Food and Drug Administration will permit a prevention trial in patients who carry the prion mutations. Since it can take decades for people to get sick (or not), such a study would instead rely on a biomarker, such as whether antisense injections can reduce prion protein levels in the spinal fluid.

Vallabh told me she would volunteer to take the drug. “The big picture,” she says, “is we are moving much more quickly than anyone could expect due to this beautifully clear genetic blueprint we were handed.”"

"LGBT workers are protected from workplace discrimination, Texas judge says in 'earth-shattering' new ruling | LGBT | Dallas News",https://www.dallasnews.com/news/lgbt/2018/04/10/lgbt-workers-protected-workplace-discrimination-texas-judge-says-earth-shattering-new-ruling,"AUSTIN — For the first time in Texas, a federal judge said LGBT workers should be protected from employment discrimination based on their gender identity and sexual orientation.

Judge Lee Rosenthal, the chief judge in the Houston-based Southern District Court of Texas, said in a decision last week that federal employment law protecting workers from discrimination based on sex also applies to sexual orientation and gender identity.

Nicole Wittmer, an engineer who alleged she wasn't hired by energy company Phillips 66 because she's transgender, couldn't prove her claim, Rosenthal ruled. But if she had proof, the judge added, Wittmer would have had cause to sue under federal law.

Rosenthal's ruling doesn't mean it's suddenly illegal in Texas to discriminate against LGBT workers. But it may be cited in the future by others who believe their sexual orientation or gender identity was a factor in workplace decisions, Wittmer's lawyer told The Dallas Morning News.

""We're certainly disappointed that this particular ruling did not fall in her favor,"" Alfonso Kennard Jr. said Monday. ""The silver lining here is it has helped to define the landscape for people who have been discriminated [against] in the workplace due to their transgender status.""

""This ruling is earth-shattering — in a good way.""

A growing trend

Federal judges in several other states have already decided that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers are also covered under Title VII, the civil rights era-law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.

But there has never been such a decision by a federal court in Texas, Louisiana or Mississippi, the states covered by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Texas state law also doesn't prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, which means it's still legal for Texas employers to fire or fail to hire someone because they're LGBT.

Rosenthal, who was appointed in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush, said recent decisions in other jurisdictions helped shape her decision.

""Within the last year, several circuits have expanded Title VII protection to include discrimination based on transgender status and sexual orientation,"" Rosenthal wrote. ""Although the Fifth Circuit has not yet addressed the issue, these very recent circuit cases are persuasive. ... The court assumes that Wittmer's status as a transgender woman places her under the protections of Title VII.""

Harper Jean Tobin, policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality, characterized the decision as part of a growing consensus that Title VII covers trans workers as well.

""This ruling, along with dozens of others, shows that discrimination against transgender workers is illegal under federal law,"" Tobin said in a prepared statement. ""This is the overwhelming approach of the courts across the country over the last decade.""

Dale Carpenter, a constitutional law and LGBT rights expert at Southern Methodist University, said the ruling was the first of its kind in Texas.

It goes beyond a 2008 case in which another federal judge in Texas said gender nonconforming persons could not be discriminated against in the workplace, he said, because this one also recognizes transgender status as a protected trait.

""It is significant,"" Carpenter said of Rosenthal's decision. Agreeing with Tobin, he called it ""part of a growing trend around the country.""

The decision could provide cover for other LGBT workers, Carpenter added, who are not protected for employment discrimination under state law. Someone could sue and cite this case, he said, and if they win at the 5th Circuit, it would create a new precedent for the entire region.

""Just based on the sheer population of Texas,"" Carpenter said, ""if it becomes the rule in Texas, this would be the single biggest victory against employment discrimination that has yet to be enjoyed by the LGBT rights movement."""
"Old Navy, Target, Warby Parker, and Compass Coffee are paying employees for time off to vote and work at the polls.",https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/9/10/21428934/companies-pay-employees-poll-workers-2020,"On August 31, Civic Alliance announced that more than 60 of its “member companies” — which include Starbucks, Old Navy, Target, and Microsoft — will work to encourage employees and consumers to serve as poll workers. The organization set a recruitment goal of 350,000 poll workers, the projected number of staffers necessary to keep precincts up and running smoothly.

The 2020 election is less than two months away, and for months, voting rights organizations have sounded the alarm bells about the possibility of a poll worker shortage. Poll workers are the community members who greet voters at their local precinct, check their registration, and direct them to voting booths. According to Pew’s Stateline, these staffers’ presence could be “the difference between a smooth election and long lines, mass confusion, and miscounted ballots.” Anyone over 16 can sign up to work during Election Day and be compensated for their time. However, a majority of these crucial workers are usually senior citizens, who are likely to refrain from working at the polls out of concern for their health during a pandemic. Even prior to the coronavirus, however, nearly 70 percent of states and jurisdictions have struggled to recruit a sufficient number of staff.

The responsibility of poll worker recruitment should theoretically fall on local and state policymakers, but currently, corporations are jumping in to fill this gap and partnering with bipartisan voter organizations, like Civic Alliance and Power to the Polls, to address the shortage.

Old Navy, a subsidiary of Gap, Inc., announced on September 1 that its employees would receive a day’s worth of pay if they signed up to work at the polls. Target, Warby Parker, and DC-based coffee chain Compass Coffee will also give workers paid time off to serve as election workers. On top of these efforts, high-profile companies like Starbucks, Twitter, PayPal, Walmart, and Uber have said they plan to give workers time off to vote. Some are offering workers as little as three hours of paid leave while others are giving employees Election Day off.

Poll workers are needed now more than ever. We’re proud to offer paid time off to our team volunteering on Election Day, and we want YOU to join us. By volunteering you are making a real and meaningful difference in our democracy. Check out @PowerThePolls for more info! pic.twitter.com/HsJCtmnvow — Compass Coffee (@CompassCoffeeDC) September 1, 2020

Heather Marshall, a café manager at Compass, told Vox that in previous years, she had voted via absentee ballot, and that the thought of serving as a poll worker hadn’t really crossed her mind when she was a college student. “Given the pandemic, I wasn’t sure what this year would look like in terms of in-person voting,” she wrote via email. “So when [Compass employees] were approached with the idea [to be poll workers], I knew it was something for which I needed to volunteer my time. I want to be any part of the effort to ensure a free, fair, and Covid-19 safe election.”

This push from employers like Compass to staff up the polls is the latest move by corporate America to encourage civic participation, as companies take on a “pro-democracy and pro-voter” stance without fear of alienating the political views of any given customer or employee. In 2018, Bloomberg reported that a record 44 percent of US firms committed to giving workers paid time off to vote in the midterm elections; this was an increase of 7 percentage points from the 2016 election, according to the Society for Human Resources Management. For the 2018 midterms, the outdoor apparel company Patagonia launched a campaign called Time to Vote and enlisted 411 companies that represent over 2 million workers. In addition to staffing up election sites this year, companies are also donating personal protective equipment, disseminating information about how to vote, and even offering up building space, the director of Civic Alliance told the Wall Street Journal.

American consumers and workers increasingly expect corporations to take stances, or at the very least engage on political and social issues. A 2019 case study by the Harvard Kennedy School found that consumers are more likely to buy from companies that have encouraged people to participate in the democratic process. The companies analyzed in the study, which included Snapchat, Spotify, Patagonia, Target, and Gap, had a range of voter engagement programs — from internal efforts directed at employees to public campaigns that sought to reach millions of people.

“What’s interesting is that more and more companies are making their voting policies public, which shifts the burden of knowledge away from the individual,” said Philip Chen, an assistant professor of political science at Beloit College. “Before this, if you didn’t have the civic knowledge or engagement to figure out that you are legally allowed to have three unpaid or paid hours to go vote, you probably weren’t going to vote.”

Employee voting policies, though, fluctuate depending on the company: Patagonia will shut down all of its operations on Election Day (as it did in 2016 and 2018), while Walmart will grant its employees three hours off if the hours of their shift prevent them from voting. In some cases, workers will have to give their supervisor a day’s notice about their need to leave to vote, since managers are creating “voting plans” to ensure that shifts remain staffed on Election Day.

“What’s interesting is that more and more companies are making their voting policies public, which shifts the burden of knowledge away from the individual”

These corporate-driven voter initiatives are a positive development, considering how companies decades ago remained mum on the issue. However, the growing involvement of employers — and the reliance on companies to staff polls and increase turnout — is emblematic of the US being “an outlier in established democracies,” Chen said. The US’s voter turnout rate is behind that of other established democracies: In the 2016 presidential election, the Census Bureau reported that only 61 percent of the voting-age population cast a ballot. That’s low compared to countries like Belgium (87 percent turnout) and Sweden (82 percent); America ranks 26th out of 32 developed democracies when it comes to voter participation.

Voting is not compulsory in the United States, nor is voter registration automatic or simple. Plus, there isn’t a federal holiday for citizens to take time off from work to vote. (Thanks to a federal law passed by Congress in the 19th century, Election Day always falls on a Tuesday in November.) This is unlike what other democracies have: Countries like Austria, Australia, Luxembourg, and Singapore mandate attendance at the polls, while others like France, Israel, and South Korea vote on weekends or have instituted federal holidays to encourage turnout. In the US, however, each state has established its own voting laws.

“The short answer is, these laws are entirely dependent on the state,” Chen told Vox. “Some states require paid time off, while others have universal vote-by-mail. Some have no requirements and simply encourage employers to allow their workers to vote. Most states, though, have something in the middle where workers have to meet a set of criteria to take off time to vote.”

In 13 states, Election Day is a paid holiday for state employees, although workers might only get a few hours of leave. Meanwhile, in places like Oregon and Washington, residents have ballots mailed out to them, so voting is a task primarily completed at home. With more companies actively encouraging their employees to vote and serve as poll workers, that could likely contribute to an improvement in turnout.

Yet it’s difficult to predict how the coronavirus pandemic and the Postal Service slowdown will affect the 2020 election and voter participation. During the primaries earlier this year, the Washington Post reported that some half a million mail-in ballots were rejected as a result of late delivery or voter error. Plus, as Recode’s Adam Clark Estes reported, mail service has recently been disrupted nationwide due to Covid-19 and a series of cost-cutting policies instituted by its new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy. Voting rights advocates and politicians are encouraging citizens to make a plan and vote early, and tech companies like Snapchat and Facebook are rolling out “voter checklist” features for users to easily register.

Companies are trying to reduce institutional barriers to voting, but political scientists aren’t exactly certain how having a federal voting holiday or automatic registration would increase turnout, Chen added. “These barriers absolutely have an effect, but it’s hard to figure out the exact effect.” What these corporations are looking to do is “trying to approximate the system we see in other established democracies,” he said. “They’re trying to replicate what we see with paid election holidays, which certainly helps with informing people, and it also looks good from a corporate standpoint.”

"California declared drought free after more than 7 years, experiences beautiful super bloom.",https://educateinspirechange.org/nature/california-is-finally-drought-free-after-over-7-years-experiences-most-beautiful-super-bloom/,"Nearly 100 percent of the state has been classified as being free of drought. This has been a result of one of the wettest winters that has replenished lakes, reservoirs throughout the state.

A first in 7 years – California has been officially declared drought-free.

In turn, the most beautiful flora has emerged all because of an unusually abundant winter with heavy rain and snow fall.

According to the U.S. Drought Monitor’s latest survey, “There has been an extraordinary turnaround from the dire and prolonged spells of dry weather that had been the norm in recent years in the state.”

These same dry spells have wreaked absolute havoc on irrigation supplies to farmers and vegetation, causing strict water restrictions throughout households. Along with that came a spate of disastrous wildfires.

Not all of the state have however joined in on the party. A smallish patch of the southernmost region including the majority of San Diego County are still buttoned up and are currently labeled “abnormally dry” on the drought map index. The Oregon border is also still in a threatening state.

This is a first since December 2011 and nearly 100% of the state has been declared drought-free. Additionally, most of California has been declared “normal”. Just a year ago marked 70% of the state as still being moderately to severely under pressure from the drought, so the latest findings have sparked quite an abundance of joy among residents.

The crucial factor in all of this was the last winter season, one of the wettest recorded in the state. All thanks to a few Pacific storms that have successfully replenished lakes and reservoirs. Also, this has left the Sierra Nevada mountain snowpack with a well above normal supply of fresh surface water. The LA Times reported an approximate 580 Billion gallons of water have been added to reservoirs across state.

“Reservoirs are full, lakes are full, streams are flowing and there’s tons of snow,” said jessica Blunden, a climate scientist with the National Climatic Data Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She further confirmed, “All the drought is officially gone.” In fact, the snowpack levels have doubled up in February alone.

3 years ago marked the snowpack reserve being at almost zero.

Jerry Brown, the Governor in 2017 has since rescinded a drought declaration after record breaking rainfall.

Experts agree that these swings in weather patterns are all in the era of climate change. “Dry conditions can easily creep back in,” Jessica Blunden, added.

With the assistance of well above average precipitation this last winter, drought conditions have much been eased throughout the region.

Bare in mind though that will restored snowpacks come potential avalanches.

The resulting widespread bloom and tremendous growth of vegetation is beauty like never seen before. With residents flocking in from all over the state, posting the most beautiful flower filled meadows and rolling hills. Sue Hamel has highlighted on Twitter how after crippling fires and the driest period ever, this blessing of winter rains has led to “a gloriously display of Springtime Wild Flowers.”

Another Twitter handle by the name California Snowflake wrote: “The California drought is officially OVER! CA is free of drought for the first time in more than 7 years and only a small amount of its territory remains dry as a very wet winter winds down, experts are reporting. The California bloom is real. Time to celebrate the new Spring!” A native of California state, Kevin Waggoner‏ also pointed out on Twitter: “If I had one good thing to say about my state (California) it would have to be our rare superbloom.”

He added: “We have just been officially declared drought free and was blessed with a superbloom we only see once every decade in a matter of a few years of the last. Yet another Twitter handle, LUVKHMER‏ wrote: Blooming season is arriving right in the yard of Angkorborie Temple in Central California. Very beautiful when ones observing closer to the flowers.”

First Trial of Moderna's Coronavirus Vaccine Produces Immune Response in All Participants,https://www.ecowatch.com/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna-antibodies-2646411488.html,"Results from the Phase 1 trial of Cambridge, Massachusetts biotech firm Moderna's coronavirus vaccine show it is safe and produces an immune response.

The preliminary report of the trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine Tuesday, reveals that all 45 participants developed so-called neutralizing antibodies that bind to the virus and stop it from attacking other cells. They developed these antibodies at levels comparable to the upper half of COVID-19 survivors. ""The good news is that this vaccine induced antibodies,"" director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci told Bloomberg News. ""Not just any kind of antibodies, but neutralizing antibodies.""

Public health experts agree that a vaccine is necessary to return life to normal in the wake of a pandemic that has infected millions and killed almost 575,000, according to Reuters. More than one vaccine will probably be required, because it will be difficult for any one company to produce the billions of doses needed, The New York Times pointed out. ""None of us are safe unless all of us are safe,"" Columbia University virologist Dr. Angela Rasmussen told The New York Times. ""It's not just us. It's everybody in the world."" The Moderna vaccine candidate was the first to be tested on human subjects, and Tuesday's published paper confirms the positive results reported by the company in May.

In the trial, 45 people aged 18 to 55 received two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart, according to Reuters. They received doses of either 25, 100 or 250 micrograms. More than half of the people who received the middle dose experienced side effects like fatigue, chills, headache and muscle pain and 40 percent of them developed a fever after the second dose, according to Bloomberg. Three of the 14 people who received the highest dose suffered severe side effects, but the company has decided to stop testing that dose. Fauci said the side-effects were normal and not a cause for concern, but other experts disagreed. ""Man, that is a lot of adverse events,"" Tony Moody, a doctor and researcher at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute, told Bloomberg. However, Moody also said the amount of antibodies produced was ""really encouraging."""

While 24 fires still remain in NSW and the ACT, none are burning out of control after heavy rain in the southern parts of the state, where all the remaining fires are located.

Bonnie Kimball was fired on March 28 by Fresh Picks, which supplied food the Mascoma Valley Regional High School in Manchester, New Hampshire, after telling a student ""tell (your) mom you need money"" but giving the student lunch anyway, according to CBS Boston.

Kimball explained to The Associated Press why she gave the student a pass. ""His family is very well known in this town and I can guarantee that if I called his mother, she would have come right in and paid the bill. But I didn't want to get her out of work. I know they would have brought the money the next day. The bill was going to get paid.""

The company said it had offered to rehire Kimball, provide her back pay and would ""work with the school district to revise policies and procedures regarding transactions,"" according to CBS Boston. Kimball hasn't heard of any job offer from the company and expressed no desire to get it back, she told CBS Boston.

In a prepared statement, the school district said any student who could not afford a lunch would be with meals, milk, fruits and vegetables.

Kimball's story has gone viral, and even celebrity chef José Andrés took to Twitter to offer Kimball employment at his nonprofit World Central Kitchen. ""The hero is Bonnie Kimball! If she needs a new job we have openings @thinkfoodgroup,"" Andrés tweeted.

Andrés is known for his humanitarian efforts which include feeding disaster-ravaged areas across the country and the world. Kimball has not announced whether she has applied for any positions within Andrés nonprofit since the tweet was published but there are opportunities available for the former cafeteria worker."

Man drops 326 pounds after needing two plane seats in evacuation from Fort McMurray fire,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nl-man-drops-326-lbs-after-fort-mcmurray-escape-1.4601130,"His weight got in the way of someone escaping the Fort McMurray wildfire and Tony Bussey, 43, vowed that would never happen again.

He dropped 326 pounds.

In May 2016, everyone thought the worst of the Fort McMurray fire was behind them and they were out of its reach.​

Bussey, pictured in 2010 with his daughter, Emma, says he hopes his lifestyle change will inspire others. (Submitted)

Workers, including Bussey, a heavy equipment tire changer, had been sent back to camp and things were moving forward, when, unexpectedly, the fire picked up again.

Planes were brought in to evacuate the site.

""The fire, for all the destruction, and for all the hell that it caused … it saved my life,"" Bussey said.

Two seats to carry his weight

When he arrived at the airport, staff shuffled him to the front of the line because of his weight. It was attention he hated but was becoming used to.

Seeing people having to wait because I was too fat to sit next to, that was it for me. - Tony Bussey

At that point, Bussey weighed 567 pounds. He struggled to put on his socks. He wore size 66 pants.

And he needed two seats on an airplane.

""Seeing people having to wait because I was too fat to sit next to, that was it for me,"" he said.

""It was like, 'I've got to do something about this.'""

Bussey fits in just one of the legs of pants he wore two years ago. (Submitted)

He had already escaped the fire once, driving to Edmonton by himself days prior.

But it was this moment — physically taking up two seats and preventing someone else from getting to safety — that changed things.

""I kept thinking, 'Here it is: somebody's wife, somebody's husband, somebody's family member is waiting for their mom or dad or their loved one to come home, and their loved ones have to wait longer now because I'm too fat to sit next to.'

""That had a profound effect on me.""

'No surgery, no anything'

He reached Edmonton. And that's when he started his quest to lose weight.

""Three-hundred and twenty-six pounds gone. All naturally. No surgery, no anything. Just watching what I eat and walking,"" he said.

""I basically went on a low-carb, high protein diet.""

Bussey hopes to run a marathon on the fifth anniversary of the fire. (Submitted)

Even during the evacuation, when he was living out of a hotel room and eating out was his only option, he made the effort.

He took the skin off his chicken and ordered veggies instead of fries. He started walking, gradually increasing his exercise time — first five minutes, then 10.

""Two years ago, I could barely walk to my car,"" Bussey said. ""I could barely fit in my car.""

'There is hope'

He's down to 241 pounds now, having lost more than half his own body weight.

He just bought a pair of size 34 jeans.

It was almost as if you were just waiting to die. - Tony Bussey

Doctors say Bussey, because of the weight loss, has about 20 to 30 pounds of excess skin, which he plans to have removed.

""And then after that, I want to start in the gym,"" he said.

His next goal is to run a marathon. He wants to do it in three years, on the fifth anniversary of the fire.

And he wants to travel. He moved away from St. Lunaire-Griquet on Newfoundland's Northern Peninsula when he was 18. He hasn't gotten home much since because his size made travelling uncomfortable.

Bussey plans to travel more now that it will be more comfortable to do so. (Submitted)

Bussey wants his story to inspire others struggling with their weight.

""You used to think there was no hope. That it was just total despair that you were that big. That there was no going back. It was almost as if you were just waiting to die, as sad as that sounds, but that's all your life was.""

""There is hope. I was 41 when I started this, almost 600 pounds. If I can do this, anyone can."""

Giant panda no longer Endangered,http://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/giant-panda-no-longer-endangered,"In a welcome piece of good news for the world’s threatened wildlife, the giant panda has just been downgraded from ‘Endangered’ to ‘Vulnerable’ on the global list of species at risk of extinction, demonstrating how an integrated approach can help save our planet’s vanishing biodiversity.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced the positive change to the giant panda’s official status in the Red List of Threatened Species, pointing to the 17% rise in the population in the decade up to 2014, when a nationwide census found 1,864 giant pandas in the wild in China.

“For over 50 years, the giant panda has been the globe’s most beloved conservation icon as well as the symbol of WWF. Knowing that the panda is now a step further from extinction is an exciting moment for everyone committed to conserving the world’s wildlife and their habitats,” said Marco Lambertini, WWF Director General.

“The recovery of the panda shows that when science, political will and engagement of local communities come together, we can save wildlife and also improve biodiversity,” added Lambertini.

While the panda’s status has improved, other species are under increasing threat, including the Eastern gorilla that is now listed as critically endangered, just one step away from extinction, due primarily to poaching.

WWF’s panda logo was designed by the organisation’s founding chairman, the naturalist and painter Sir Peter Scott in 1961. Twenty years later, WWF became the first international organisation to work in China.

Ever since, WWF has been working with the government on initiatives to save giant pandas and their habitat, including helping to establish an integrated network of giant panda reserves and wildlife corridors to connect isolated panda populations as well as working with local communities to develop sustainable livelihoods and minimise their impact on the forests.

These efforts have seen the number of panda reserves jump to 67, which now protect nearly two-thirds of all wild pandas. They have also helped to safeguard large swathes of mountainous bamboo forests, which shelter countless other species and provide natural services to vast numbers of people, including tens of millions who live alongside rivers downstream of panda habitat."
Teamtrees officially pass the goal of 20 million dollars.,https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21026379/mrbeast-team-trees-youtube-charity-20-million-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-pewdiepie,"YouTubers have surpassed their goal of raising $20 million to help the Arbor Day Foundation plant 20 million trees, with the help of more than half a million donors and some wealthy tech executives. The charity campaign began nearly two months ago, when hundreds of YouTubers, led by Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, teamed up to fight climate change and prove that YouTube “isn’t just a drama fest.”

Donaldson partnered with some of YouTube’s most popular creators to promote the “Team Trees” initiative, including Mark Rober (8.7M subscribers), Guava Juice (14.6M), Marques Brownlee (9.5M), Smarter Every Day (7.4M), Ninja (22.4M), Jacksepticeye (22.9M), and more. More channels participated after Donaldson and friends announced their plans on October 25th.

Through organizers’ videos and charity streams, the initiative quickly found its way to the halfway mark. By October 31st, more than $10 million had been raised, with donations coming in from some friends in very high places. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk donated $1 million, which was beat by Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke, who donated $1,000,001. Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey seemed to make two donations, one for $150,000 and another for $200,000 (representatives for Square and Twitter declined to comment). Naturally, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki also donated — she gave $200,000 to the campaign and made a video with Rober highlighting the cause.

Raising this much so quickly makes Team Trees one of the fastest-growing environmental fundraising initiatives, according to a representative for the Arbor Day Foundation. Trees planted as part of the fundraised will absorb and store 1.6 million tons of carbon, according to the representative. They’ll also help to remove 115,000 tons of chemical air pollution.

By October 31st, more than $10 million had been raised

Team Trees used social media sites like Twitter and even a spot on Jimmy Kimmel to spread awareness outside of YouTube, but they made concerted efforts to ensure news about the initiative spread on YouTube itself. Flooding YouTube with videos about Team Trees on the initiative’s launch day was meant to game the algorithm to promote their content on the homepage. Ensuring that each video was tagged as being about climate change and a charity initiative could have also helped videos reach more viewers.

The fundraiser was built around a joke started by Donaldson’s fans, who suggested he celebrate passing 20 million subscribers by planting 20 million trees. The joke turned into a charity drive — but it’s also been great for YouTubers’ channels. Donaldson’s own video on the initiative saw more than 35 million views, while other creators also saw tens of millions of views on their videos about the fundraiser. It’s one of the more positive moments on YouTube, and a sign of what creators can do when they work together for a good cause.

“We want to show that YouTube isn’t just a drama fest,” Donaldson said in a private video for YouTubers ahead of the campaign launch, as seen by The Verge. “We actually have real influence and can make real change.”

“We want to show that YouTube isn’t just a drama fest”

Trees will start to be planted in January 2020, according to an FAQ for the project. The goal is to have all 20 million trees planted “no later than December 2022.” Although the Arbor Day Foundation operates both within the United States and internationally, many of the trees will be planted in national parks around the US.

Of course, just because the $20 million milestone has been reached, it doesn’t mean donations have to stop.

“We know that 20 million trees isn’t going to cure climate change,” Rober said in a private planning video. “But the point here is to end the decade on a super strong note. It’s a constructive way to send a message to the politicians that it’s freaking time to do something about climate change.”"

Journalist Sarah Jane Murphy relayed the exchange, which took place at a Dublin court on Monday, to her followers on Twitter and it has gone viral with almost 2,000 retweets.

It reads:

""Man: I can’t serve; I’m away for weekend.

Judge: Then you GO and you GO with my blessing.

Sarah-Jane reveals that the man spoke hesitantly at first but then with more confidence when he delivered his reason for not being able to serve.

""The judge broke into a broad smile and the man walked away grinning,"" she revealed, ""The woman beside me turned to me and said, 'Did I imagine that?'""

Twitter users have been commenting that the exchange is like a scene from Richard Curtis' romantic comedy Love Actually.

""Is this the ending to Love Actually II?"" wrote one, while another commented, ""This honestly sounds like the ending to a film and it’s lovely!""

Another quipped, ""Guilty of 'Love In The First Degree', perhaps?""

"A Kentucky Republican With a Gay Son Wants to Ban Conversion Therapy | Alice Forgy Kerr, taking a position rare in her party, was moved by seeing the film Boy Erased.",https://www.advocate.com/politics/2020/1/30/kentucky-republican-gay-son-wants-ban-conversion-therapy,"A bill to ban the use of conversion therapy on minors in Kentucky is coming from a surprising source.

The lead sponsor of the measure is a conservative Christian Republican, Sen. Alice Forgy Kerr of Lexington, who has a gay son and says the horrors of the practice were driven home when she saw the movie Boy Erased.

“I think it’s religion gone bad,” Kerr said of conversion therapy in a recent interview with Louisville TV station WHAS.

Being gay “can’t be fixed and it shouldn’t be fixed,” she said. “In my Christian faith, I am taught that we are all fearfully and wonderfully made, wonderfully made, and I believe that very strongly.” She has two sons, age 33 and 31; the younger one is gay.

“We’ve got to understand that, wherever we come down on the issue of homosexuality, this bill is about banning conversion torture,” she added.

Kerr introduced her legislation, Senate Bill 85, this month with cosponsors Sen. Julie Raque Adams, a Republican, and Sen. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat. It would bar mental health professionals from performing conversion therapy, designed to turn LGBTQ people straight or cisgender, on people under 18, or on adults who have a “mental or physical dysfunction” that prevents them from managing their own affairs. Those who violate the law would be subject to discipline, and the legislation would also keep public funds from going to conversion therapy.

In a speech introducing the bill, Kerr said such therapy is based on the “false premise that being LGBTQ is a mental illness,” The Courier-Journal of Louisville reports. She called conversion therapy “discredited” (as it is, by every major medical and mental health organization) and “barbaric,” and noted that it is linked to higher rates of suicide. She urged anyone wanting more information about the practice to see Boy Erased.

The 2018 film, based on Garrard Conley’s memoir, is about a gay youth sent to conversion therapy by his conservative Baptist parents (his father is a minister). It portrays such therapy as horrific and abusive.

Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have banned the use of conversion therapy on minors by licensed professionals, as have numerous cities and counties. Kerr acknowledged her bill may have an uphill battle, as both the House and Senate have Republican majorities, and she is one of the few Republicans to support such legislation. But she’s willing to be patient, and she sees an opportunity to educate members of her party.

“We can keep working this,” she told WHAS. “A friend of mine once said that instant coffee ruined the world. You have to let things percolate.”"

It borders Batéké Plateau National Park in neighboring Gabon, and together the two parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than 5,500 square kilometers (2,120 square miles).

The official designation of Ogooué-Leketi National Park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down.

All of the rights-holding communities that live close to the Ogooué-Leketi National Park were involved in the process of creating the protected area, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Congo program.

The Republic of Congo has officially created its fifth national park, lending protection to great apes, forest elephants and other threatened wildlife.

The new Ogooué-Leketi National Park spans 3,500 square kilometers (1,350 square miles), and borders Batéké Plateau National Park in neighboring Gabon. Together, the two national parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than 5,500 square kilometers (2,120 square miles).

Ogooué-Leketi is also part of the Batéké Plateau landscape, a unique patchwork of large rolling savannas on sandy hills, interrupted by long strips of dense forests and turquoise-blue river valleys. This savanna-forest complex is home to several threatened species, some found nowhere else in Congo, according to a press release from the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Congo program, which has been surveying the area with the country’s Ministry of Forestry Economy since 2004.

In 2009, the IUCN identified the region in which the park sits today as a priority conservation site for the protection of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the endangered central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), said Mark Gately, country director for WCS-Congo.

The forest sector of the new park is also home to several other species, such as the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), and several species of monkey including the iconic mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx). The savanna part of the national park, too, hosts a wide range of wildlife. The park has at least six species of rare savanna plants that are specialists of the Kalahari Sands, the substrate that forms the Batéké Plateau, and other savanna specialists like the bush duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), and several species of birds. The national park area was in fact identified by BirdLife International as a site of high importance for bird conservation in 2007.

The official designation of Ogooué-Leketi National Park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down. Logging activity had expanded into the proposed protected area since 2013, Gately said, with loggers searching mainly for okoumé trees (Aucoumea klaineana) for use in plywood. All three logging companies, which are still active around the periphery of the park, completed logging within parts of the concessions overlapping the park in December 2016.

“With the support of the Congolese Minister of Forestry Economy, Mrs. Rosalie Matondo, the creation of the park has eliminated logging activity within the protected area boundaries, securing the closed canopy forest habitat that covers roughly a third of the park,” Gately said.

The roads and bridges that the logging companies built into the proposed park area have, however, facilitated commercial bushmeat hunting. Such hunting “is currently the biggest threat to the area’s wildlife and this trade links to cities like Pointe Noire and Brazzaville but also across [the] border towards Gabon,” Gately said.

“Great ape numbers have declined significantly in the area since 2010 and elephants, even if their population seems stable, recently started changing their behaviour — visiting forest clearings more at night than during the day, behaviour that is generally observed in elephant populations that perceive threats from humans in their habitat,” Gately added.

With the logging companies out, the government and WCS-Congo are now working with local communities to draw up a management plan for the national park. While no villages existed inside the area now designated as Ogooué-Leketi National Park, there are five villages very close to the park boundary. The residents of these villages have traditionally used the national park area for their needs, and continue to depend on the forest for their sustenance.

All of the rights-holding communities living near the national park were involved in the process of creating the protected area since the project was launched, Gately said. The boundaries of the protected area were mapped to ensure the villages weren’t incorporated into the national park. The communities also helped identify and map areas of cultural and traditional importance to them.

“The participatory mapping process led the government to … highlight any cultural or natural resource use zones that overlap with critical high ecological value areas, including bais [swampy, mineral-rich meadows], that will be integrated into the park under eco-development zones,” Gately said. “In these identified areas, which will be integrated into the management plan of the park, rights-holding communities will be able to continue traditional and subsistence-based gathering, fishing or hunting. The maps including the limit of the future park and the eco-development zones were validated for each village in order to ensure full consent.”

"Charles Rucker, the Home Depot employee fired for confronting a racist customer last year, has a new job helping parolees find jobs ""I'm Happy Here.""",https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Churchill-Fired-for-confronting-racism-Maurice-13511148.php,"Albany

Nothing I wrote last year generated as much attention, or anger, as the columns about what happened to Maurice Rucker.

Rucker was an employee at the Home Depot on Central Avenue. On a day in July, he encountered an unpleasant (to put it mildly) customer, who was standing in Rucker's line in the Albany store's garden center.

I hate to repeat it all again, but the man called Rucker slow, said he owed his job to Donald Trump and hit him with an additional string of ugly insults.

""You're from the ghetto,"" the man said, who was white.

Rucker, who is black, eventually left his booth, got in the man's face and told him to leave the store. Five days later, Rucker was fired.

If I'm remembering correctly, I heard about Rucker's experience from an acquaintance of his. I initially figured there had to be more to the story, but there wasn't. A Home Depot spokesman at corporate headquarters said the company was appalled by the customer's behavior but defended the firing because Rucker had violated protocol.

Rucker had worked for Home Depot for 10 years.

""Firing a man for defending himself seems unfair,"" Rucker told me then. ""I'm a black man, and I have dealt with all levels of racism all my life. I am not going to accept racist behavior at work, home, the streets or anyplace else.""

Many of you agreed that Rucker had been poorly treated. In fact, the story just about exploded on the internet, with Rucker receiving messages of support from around the world.

Home Depot backtracked and offered Rucker his job back. He declined to return.

Rucker, a visual artist and lead singer for the country-rock-soul band Mozz, was widely known before the column ran. Everyone who I spoke to described him as a gentleman — and a gentle giant. (He's a big guy.) Nobody believed he deserved to be fired.

After the column ran, I heard from a frequent Home Depot customer who purposely chose to line up at Rucker's register, because he enjoyed interacting with him. I heard from a parent who appreciated how Rucker, who ran the store's workshops for kids, had handled their child's birthday party.

And this is the guy the store decided to fire?

I knew, as I was writing the column, that it was going to resonate. I knew people would be angry at the company's decision. I still underestimated the reaction. Rucker seemed surprised by all the attention, too.

A few days ago, I asked Rucker, who is 61, if he had any idea why his story moved so many people. It wasn't about him, Rucker said. It was about disgust with declining civility in what he called the ""age of Trump"" and a growing willingness to say anything at all.

I agree that was part of it, as was people's anger at the simple injustice of it all. But there was also, in many of the emails I received, frequent criticism of how so many employees are being treated by the global economy and the big corporations that increasingly control it.

Many readers focused on how Rucker's salary increased by just 78 cents — from $12 to $12.78 an hour — during a decade with the company. That small increase was partly because Rucker had started at a higher-paid store in the Boston area and took a pay cut when he transferred. Still, it's remarkable that his pay didn't even keep up with the rate of inflation.

It's water under the bridge now, at least for Rucker.

After the publicity, several employers reached out to interview him, including Albany County Executive Daniel McCoy, who had a position open in the probation department. That's the job Rucker ultimately took.

On a recent morning, I visited him in his South Pearl Street office, where he spends his days trying to place recent parolees in open jobs. Some have little experience in the working world, but Rucker guides them through the process and prepares them with interviews.

In short, he helps the parolees get a new start. It's satisfying and important work. Plus, the hours are regular.

""Maurice is just what we needed,"" said Mike O'Connor, his supervisor, who echoed what so many others said by describing Rucker as a kind gentleman. ""I got lucky on this one,"" O'Connor added.

In his early days on the job, Rucker sensed that some of his co-workers were wary of him, fearing his hiring was more about political optics than merit. But Rucker earned trust and won his co-workers over. He looks back at the confrontation and his firing as a fortuitous turning point, albeit a terribly unpleasant one.

""It couldn't have worked out any better,"" Rucker told me. ""I'm happy here."""
'He was not dying and that was that' - Woman saved husband's life by performing CPR for 30 minutes at home,https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/he-was-not-dying-and-that-was-that-woman-saved-husbands-life-by-performing-cpr-for-30-minutes-at-home-36636715.html,"Geraldine O'Reilly Bolger, a nurse at St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, saved her husband Derek's life last summer after he took ill at home

A woman who saved her husband's life by performing CPR on him non-stop for 30 minutes after he suffered cardiac arrest in bed has stressed how important it is for everybody to learn the technique.

Geraldine O'Reilly Bolger, a nurse at St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, saved her husband Derek's life last summer after he took ill at home in bed on the evening last summer in Stillorgan.

Now she is calling for more and more people to learn the skills, especially school children.

Geraldine was asleep in their Stillorgan home in south Dublin on the night of July 5 last year when she noticed some unusual breathing by Derek at around 12.40am.

Geraldine says: ""I gave Derek a dig in the ribs and asked 'Derek are you OK?' I got no response, so I gave him a bigger dig and shouted 'Derek are you OK?' Still no response, so I sat up and turned on my bedside lamp, glanced at Derek, lifted my mobile and dialed 999. I said I need a cardiac ambulance please, my husband is having a cardiac arrest and gave them our address.

""When I had glanced at Derek, he was a purple black colour with dilated black pupils staring up and to the left. The medic on the phone asked me 'is he on a hard surface?'.

""I said 'no he is in the bed'. He said get him on the floor. At this stage I had walked around to Derek's side of the bed. I felt for Derek's pulse and he had a good pulse. So I got him by the ankles and yanked him onto the floor. His body hit the floor with a loud thud. He later developed a large bruise down the left side. His head bounced twice off the floor, I forgot to put a pillow down first. Derek remained unconscious with foaming at the side of the mouth. I said I'm starting CPR.""

The man on the end of the 999 call began to tell Geraldine how to perform CPR but she quickly informed him she was an Intensive Care Unit nurse and knew what to do.

""On my first thrust of compression I heard a crunch,"" Geraldine said. ""I knew I'd broken cartilage, but I thought that's good I'm in the right place and doing it hard enough.""

Geraldine says that the sheer force of her CPR technique probably helped Derek to survive as he was 'under' for so long.

""It made sure that oxygen still made it to the brain. He was not dying and that was that,"" she said.

The medic on the phone continued to encourage Geraldine and when the ambulance was nearby he instructed her to run downstairs, turn off the alarm, open the front door and turn on the lights before running back up the stairs to ""get back on the chest"".

When the ambulance arrived they took over the job of trying to save Derek's life and that is when Geraldine noticed there was ""a river of sweat"" running down her face.

After 20 minutes a doctor came down to the kitchen where Geraldine was.

""He told me they had shocked Derek nine times, given him adrenaline and other drugs and that they had 'done everything'. It dawned on me then that they were stopping.

""So I pointed up the stairs and said 'well get back up there and keep going, keep going, keep going.' The doctor resumed work and about 15 minutes later he returned to say 'he has an output'.

Derek was brought to Geraldine's place of work, St Vincent's, where he was placed in the ICU ward that she knew so well.

""This was the unit I had worked in for years, but this was the wrong face in the bed,"" Geraldine said.

Geraldine's husband was sedated and because he had been under cardiac arrest for so long there were concerns about the levels of oxygen starvation to his brain.

Meanwhile, he had first degree burns from the friction of prolonged CPR, as well as fractured ribs.

His chest was also cut and scraped from trying to get the hair off in order to get a clean contact for the defibrillator pads.

Geraldine then noticed that she too had an injury, friction burns on her knees from the prolonged CPR.

After contacting her two young sons who were both abroad last summer and telling them the news, Geraldine returned to hospital to monitor her husband as family and friends arrived to offer support.

On July 7, a nursing colleague burst in to the waiting room to tell Geraldine that her husband was awake and after he was taken off life support, Geraldine went in to see him.

""I said: 'Derek you look fantastic.' He smiled at me and asked 'am I dead?' I said 'no you are not'. Then he looked around his arm for his watch and asked me 'am I late for work?' I said 'no Derek you have today off. He said 'I don't know what happened to me'. I said 'you were a bit sick last night, so I brought you into the hospital and you are absolutely fantastic now.

""'I don't remember anything' he said. I said 'well I remember everything'.""

After about a week in the Cardiac Care Unit Derek returned home and is now completely fine. Experts in the field have told Geraldine that anyone who is 'under' for more than 20 minutes usually has some serious issues caused by lack of oxygen to the brain. Derek was under in total for around an hour so Geraldine's CPR technique was vital to both his survival and full recovery.

A consultant the couple met in September told Geraldine “you are a hero, only for you, we would not be having this meeting today"" and Geraldine now believes more than ever that CPR at home is vital to save lives.

""It isn't like you see in the movies on TV,"" Geraldine says. ""It is hard and it won't bring them back in 30 seconds but it works and everyone should be given the chance to learn how to do it, starting in schools.""

Serena Williams Donates Prize Money from First Tennis Win in Three Years to Australian Relief Efforts,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a30502484/serena-williams-donates-prize-money-to-australian-relief-efforts/,"Serena Williams donated her $43,000 prize from Sunday's ASB Classic Match to Australian wildfire relief efforts.

Williams's ASB Classic victory marks her first title win in three years.

Serena Williams won her first big tennis championship title in three years and is using her prize money to pay it forward.

After taking the top spot at Sunday’s ASB Classic Match in Auckland, New Zealand, the tennis icon announced her decision to donate her winnings from the competition to Australian wildfire relief efforts. Williams’s title win—the first since the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in 2017—against American player Jessica Pegula resulted in a cash prize equivalent to $43,000.

“I’ve been playing Australia for over 20 years and it’s been really hard for me to watch all the news and everything that’s been happening in Australia with all the fires and over a billion animals and people who have lost their homes,” said Williams. “So I decided that I would donate all my prize money for a great cause.”

Since the start of the tragic wildfires in September, the natural disaster has claimed 25 human lives and depleted almost half a billion mammals, reptiles, and birds.

Williams is scheduled to return to Australia next week for the start of the Australian Open, where she has previously won seven of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles. According to CNN , Australian Open organizers are planning to proceed with the competition even with the ongoing wildfires.

“In the unlikely case of extreme smoke conditions, the roofs will be closed on the 3 stadium courts and play will continue in their air-conditioned, air-filtered environment,” stated the official Australian Open Twitter account.

Williams joins a growing list of celebrities who have brought awareness to the ongoing Australian wildfires and donated money toward relief efforts. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kylie Jenner, Nicole Kidman, and Hilary Duff are all stars who have donated to the Australia Wildfire Fund, and even Queen Elizabeth II and members of the royal family have spoken out in support of Australia.

President Trump ""is spending his time shoring up states he won in 2016,"" and one clip from a Michigan rally ""getting a lot of attention"" involves his ""attempt to appeal to suburban women,"" he said. Yes, ""Donald Trump's gonna get your husbands back to work so you can get all your lady chores done — like voting for Joe Biden.""

Meanwhile, the coronavirus is spreading everywhere, fast, hitting ""500,000 new cases in just the past week,"" Colbert said. ""Clearly, we're a long way from ending the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, yesterday a new White House press released announced that one of Trump's biggest accomplishments is 'ending the COVID-19 pandemic.' Now while that is clearly insane, declaring victory prematurely is a proud Republican tradition.""

Colbert also joined the mockery of Kim Kardashian West's private-island birthday party. ""I'm just worried they're gonna give rich people who do whatever they want on a private island a bad name,"" he deadpanned. ""See you soon, Richard Branson!""

""I wonder if anyone told [Kardashian] she's allowed to have a party and not post pictures of it,"" Jimmy Kimmel mused on Kimmel Live. ""People really went nuts on this one. They're saying this could potentially derail Kanye's presidential campaign."" Meanwhile, ""members of Trump's own coronavirus task force are said to be personally offended by a release from the White House yesterday that claimed, among other things, that the president ended the pandemic,"" he said, adding dryly, ""You won't see that on MSDNC.""

Trump claiming he ended the COVID-19 pandemic is ""like the Tampa Bay Rays listing their biggest accomplishment as '2020 World Series Champions,'"" Jimmy Fallon said at The Tonight Show. ""Keep in mind, though, the White House 'Science' office is just Eric and Don Jr. wearing Bill Nye Halloween costumes,"" he added. ""I was pretty surprised the find out the Trump White House has a science office. That's like finding out The Bachelorette has a science office."""
"Japan has officially recognised a same-sex couple as foster parents, marking a first for the country and signalling a growing recognition of LGBTQ rights in Japan.",http://mashable.com/2017/04/06/lgbtq-japan-osaka/#sjzeJnlh9iq5,"Japan has officially recognised a same-sex couple as foster parents, marking a first for the country and signalling a growing recognition of LGBTQ rights in Japan.

The city of Osaka recognised two men, one in his 40s and one in his 30s, as foster parents on Wednesday.

A teenage boy has been living under their care since February.

""I am happy we became foster parents [and recognised] as a single household, not just as individuals,"" the older of the two men told The Japan Times, who added that the boy was now ""living a comfortable life.""

The couple were certified as foster parents after the city determined that they ""understood the foster care system and had the financial wherewithal to raise a child.""

The couple had submitted their request to be recognised as foster parents in late 2015. They had to undergo lectures, training, scrutiny and a screening by the city's social welfare panel before they were certified.

The legal recognition comes amid what appears to be a society warming toward recognising the rights of LGBTQ people in the country.

Earlier last month, Japan updated its national bullying prevention policy to include protection for LGBTQ students.

In 2015, the Shibuya district in Tokyo was the first in Japan to recognise same-sex marriage, with the ward issuing certificates recognising same-sex unions as ""equivalent to marriage."""

Nancy Armour | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption Armour: If you don't understand Colin Kaepernick's message after George Floyd's death, you never will SportsPulse: Athletes took to social media to voice their anger over George Floyd's death, with many resurfacing photos of Colin Kaepernick's protest over criminal and social injustice. USA TODAY Sports' Nancy Armour reiterates Kaepernick's protest was never the issue in this country.

Colin Kaepernick will provide financial assistance to protesters in Minneapolis who need legal representation.

In posts on Twitter and Instagram on Friday afternoon, Kaepernick said legal assistance will be paid for by his Know Your Rights Camp. The group is devoted to educating and empowering young people of color, and developing a new generation of leaders.

“In fighting for liberation there's always retaliation. We must protect our Freedom Fighters,” Kaepernick said.

Minneapolis has been rocked by protests following the death of George Floyd. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes, ignoring Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe and witnesses’ pleas to stop. A bystander recorded the encounter.

The officer, Derek Chauvin, and three others who did not intervene were fired. Chauvin was arrested Friday.

Police used tear gas and water cannons on what were largely peaceful protests Tuesday in Minneapolis. The demonstrations have become more violent since then, with several buildings burned and looted. On Thursday night, a police station was taken over and set ablaze.

OPINION: After George Floyd's death, do you still think Colin Kaepernick's knee was the problem?

Kaepernick had expressed support for the protesters Thursday.

“When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction,"" he said in posts on Instagram and Twitter. ""The cries for peace will rain down, and when they do, they will land on deaf ears, because your violence has brought this resistance.

“We have the right to fight back!”

Floyd’s death is another example of the police brutality against people of color that prompted Kaepernick, then a quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, to begin protesting in 2016."

STOURBRIDGE, England — A 101-year-old British man has returned home after beating coronavirus, according to the hospital that treated him.

The man spent two weeks battling the virus at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, England, according to Worcestershire Acute Hospitals National Health Service Trust. The BBC identified the man as Keith Watson; the hospital released only the patient's first name.

The hospital shared a photograph of Watson with staff in a post that said: ""Well done to everyone on Ward 12 at the Alexandra Hospital for looking after Keith so well for the past two weeks.""

Health experts and government officials have long warned the virus preys on the elderly, putting a centenarian such as Watson at high risk.

Matthew Hopkins, chief executive of Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: “We are delighted that Keith could be safely discharged home. This is a huge morale boost for our staff who are working day in day out to provide the best possible care for our patients.”

The BBC reports Watson went to the hospital for treatment after a fall but tested positive for COVID-19 after he developed a fever.

The news of Watson's recovery comes on the same day that the condition of Britain's leader continued to improve, according to a statement. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved out of an intensive care unit where he was being treated for coronavirus to a regular hospital ward.

Britain's death toll was nearing 8,000 on Thursday, according to Public Health England, increasing by nearly 900 in a 24-hour period.

Chance the Rapper Hosts Holiday Party to Help the Homeless,http://www.blackenterprise.com/chance-rapper-holiday-party-homeless/,"‘Tis the season for giving, and Chance the Rapper is no Scrooge.

The 24-year-old hip hop star hosted a holiday party at The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago last week to raise money for homeless children. According to an analysis by the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless (CCH), there are over 82,000 homeless people in the Windy City, while more than 18,000 public school students do not have a home.

“Being the city that has one of the worst and coldest winters in America, I think it’s important to take some time to appreciate and work with and work for the homeless population in Chicago,” Chance told the crowd at the event, reports ABC local affiliate WLS.

In addition to hearing from the Chicago rapper, attendees were treated to dancing and a live performance from the Chicago Children’s Choir, all for $15 per ticket. Needy students, however, were free of charge. The proceeds and goods collected at the event will be donated toward Chicago’s homeless.

The party, which was titled “A Night at the Museum,” was organized by Chance’s non-profit, SocialWorks, in collaboration with several other community groups like Bargains in a Box, which donated hundreds of backpacks full of toys for Chicago families. “It takes a little bit of effort from a lot of people to make a huge impact on a family, to change the way their holiday goes and it’s what the season’s about,” said Bargains in a Box VP of Strategy and Development Brad Nardick, according to Fox 32 Chicago.

“We know that a lot of homelessness isn’t seen, it’s hidden. It’s really important for people to recognize when you see someone on the street that’s just a sliver of the problem,” said CCH Executive Director Doug Schenkelberg.

Chance, who often uses his star power to shine a light on Chicago Public School (CPS) children, recently paid a surprise visit to fifth-graders at Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Paideia Academy. During his visit, the Grammy Award-winning artist revealed that SocialWorks received a $1 million donation from Google’s charity arm to help fund CPS."
"""He's an angel"": Atlanta woman says rapper Ludacris paid her $375 grocery bill",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ludacris-atlanta-whole-foods-therra-gwyn-jaramillo-grocery-bill/,"When an Atlanta woman who had fallen on hard times didn't have enough money to pay for her groceries at Whole Foods, she was at her breaking point. But then a kind stranger in front of her in line offered to pay--the whole bill.

She had no idea who the stranger was until a cashier clued her in: It was the rapper Ludacris.

Therra Gwyn-Jaramillo has been ""struggling on and off,"" since her beloved husband died of cancer in the summer of 2014. ""There wasn't a part of my life that wasn't destroyed - emotional, physical, financial,"" Gwyn-Jaramillo told CBS News.

She was left to take care of ""a practical menagerie of rescued animals,"" her disabled brother and her home. While she has been freelance writing to keep her head above water, a recent hit of $4,000 for home repairs and a late check put her in a dire situation in July.

Thankfully, a friend stepped in to help and provided her with a $250 Whole Foods gift card.

So, she went to Whole Foods, but at the checkout counter realized she didn't have enough money on the card to cover her items. That's when the stranger in front of her stepped in.

""I had zero interaction with him before he decided to buy my groceries. I tried to put things back and he said, 'I said I got this. All of this. Don't put anything back!' recounts Gwyn-Jaramillo. ""He started putting the stuff I was going to put back onto the conveyor belt. I was stunned.""

Gwyn-Jaramillo says she responded to the ""nice-looking man,"" by ""crying.""

""I finally managed to say 'What is your name?' and introduce myself. He said, simply, 'Chris,' and shook my hand,"" Gwyn-Jaramillo recounted. She spoke with the stranger after his kind deed, telling CBS News, the man asked her about her rescue dogs after noticing dog food on the conveyor belt.

'I talked to him through my tears and finally asked, 'Who ARE you?' says Gwyn-Jaramillo. ""He looked at me and said 'Just a person. Just a guy.' I kept thinking, 'Does he know? Does he know he's an angel? ""

It turns out the stranger was not, in fact, ""just a guy,"" after all.

Gwyn-Jaramillo said while he looked familiar, and says she is a fan of the Grammy-winning rapper, she didn't place him until a cashier filled her in.

""WHAT I screamed,"" Gwyn-Jaramillo told CBS News. ""People were smiling and laughing (and probably rolling their eyes that I just now 'got it' about who he was).""

Life imitates art as Disney opens STEM center in Oakland with that Black Panther money,https://www.avclub.com/life-imitates-art-as-disney-opens-stem-center-in-oaklan-1823337661,"Photo : Black Panther ( Marvel Studios )

Disney is just shoveling up money thanks to Marvel’s Black Panther, but there are only so many disappointing Toy Story-themed Disney World attractions you can blow your money on at one time. So, in what seems to be an overt nod to Letitia Wright’s teenage genius Shuri, Disney has announced that it’s donating $1 million to the Boys & Girls Club Of America to help expand its STEM programs. That comes from ComingSoon, which says Disney’s money will also be used to establish a STEM Center Of Innovation in Oakland, California.

In a statement, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger noted that Black Panther is a “masterpiece of movie making” that is “sparking discussion, inspiring people young and old, and breaking down age-old industry myths.” To show its appreciation for the positive response to Black Panther, Disney is giving money to STEM programs in “underserved areas” to “give them the knowledge and tools to build the future they want.”

Boys & Girls Club is also planning to establish STEM Centers Of Innovation in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Harlem, New Orleans, and a few other cities."

LEGO launch their first sustainable blocks made from sugarcane – and they hope to roll it out to most products by 2030,https://www.businessinsider.com/lego-go-eco-friendly-with-blocks-made-from-sugarcane-2018-8/?r=AU&IR=T,"On August 1, 2018, LEGO launched their first sustainable building bricks.

LEGO wants the majority of its production to be sustainable by 2030.

The new bricks are made of sugarcane plastic and are shaped like plants.



Danish toymaker LEGO has high ambitions for its sustainability program: by 2030, the company intends to manufacture most of its products and packaging using environmentally friendly materials or recycled sources.

In 2018, the company took its first step towards these goals by introducing plastic blocks made of plant-based materials — in the shape of plants. The company announced the introduction of sustainable LEGO blocks in March this year.

From August 1, they were available to customers in selected countries. Elements of the set will also appear in other sets of blocks over the course of 2018, according to Business Insider Polska .

LEGO's new blocks are 98% polyethylene, made from sugar cane.

The material use of sugarcane plastic is in line with the guidelines of LEGO's partner World Wildlife Fund (WWF) but LEGO blocks are still not biodegradable.

""At the LEGO Group we want to make a positive impact on the world around us, and are working hard to make great play products for children using sustainable materials,"" said Tim Brooks, Vice President of Environmental Responsibility at the LEGO Group in March."
"Spain is getting rid of streets named after fascist leaders, dedicating them to women instead",http://qz.com/850588/spain-streets-named-after-women/,"Though Francisco Franco’s totalitarian Spanish regime was toppled nearly 40 years ago, its legacy is still present in the country. Walk through the cities of Spain, and you’re likely to find streets named after regime members like general José Millán Astray, attorney Adolfo Muñoz Alonso, minister José Enrique Varela, and many more (link in Spanish).

But not for long.

In February, the government—applying a 2007 law that promised to get rid of the marks of autocratic heritage in public spaces—announced it would retire these street names. Now, cities around the country are renaming them after women, answering the complaint that about 90% of streets in Spain’s cities are named after men—and those honoring women usually reference saints (link in Spanish).

Janette Sadik-Khan, former New York City transportation commissioner, once famously said, “if you can change the street, you can change the world.” If she’s right, Spain is on its way to a metaphorical revolution. Since 2005, the city of Cordoba has enforced a mandate that half of new streets be named after women. In Barcelona, the total number of streets named after women went from 7% in 1996 to 27.7% in 2010 (link in Spanish).

To further correct the imbalance, Valencia will now name 80% of its new streets after women, and Bilbao, Oviedo and Cádiz plan to follow that example.

Many of the streets have or will be named after Spanish women targeted during Franco’s regime, including activists, revolutionaries, and civil rights fighters, such as Soledad Cazorla, the first public prosecutor to specialize in gender violence. Others will carry the names of women of remarkable talent, from Spain and the rest of the world, who distinguished themselves in fields such as physics, or equal rights movements. In the city of Léon, where the selection of name is made by popular vote, a recent group of possible street names included American civil rights activist Rosa Parks, Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, English novelist Jane Austen, and Spanish inventor Ángela Ruiz Robles.

Other countries should take note: the lack of streets named after women is far from just a Spanish problem. In Rome, for instance, only 3.5% of streets carry a woman’s name. In 2015, a study of seven world metropolis (London, Paris, San Francisco, Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, and Bangalore) found that only 27.5% streets were named after women."
A billionaire is opening a new mental health center in Colorado to treat veterans and their families,https://www.denverpost.com/2018/05/11/cohen-veterans-network-mental-health-center-greenwood-village/,"About half of U.S. military veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan don’t receive the mental health treatment they need, and the vast Veterans Health Administration system often doesn’t offer care for veterans’ families or for many veterans who were not honorably discharged.

So, on Monday, a new clinic funded by one of the nation’s wealthiest men and linked with the University of Colorado will officially open in Greenwood Village to help meet the need.

“I think we’ll be able to get folks in and get them the help they need when they’re motivated to seek it,” said Anthony Hassan, the CEO of the Cohen Veterans Network.

The Cohen Veterans Network is the charitable project of Steven A. Cohen, a former hedge fund titan who, with an estimated net worth of $11 billion, is ranked by Forbes as the 133rd-richest person in the world. In 2016 — at the urging of his son, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran — Cohen pledged $275 million to build a network of veterans clinics across the country.

Denver’s clinic is among 10 so far spread out in military towns and major cities. The clinics serve all post-9/11 veterans, regardless of whether they were honorably discharged or not. The clinics also provide services to veterans’ family members or other people — such as close friends or girlfriends or boyfriends — whom the veterans identify as caregivers.

“It’s the family that’s the primary support system for the veteran,” said Gillian Kaag, who holds a doctorate in psychology and is the Denver clinic’s director.

The idea is to create a welcoming environment with as many ways as possible for veterans and their families to access mental health services. The clinic’s 10,000-square-foot space on East Orchard Road is decorated with art by local veterans or military families. There are rooms for one-on-one therapy sessions but also family rooms and a community room. Yoga classes are planned.

The clinic’s No. 1 goal, as Kaag put it, is to get veterans and their families, “back to better.”

Services will be provided free of charge to people without insurance. Those with insurance can access care for only the cost of a copay — usually just a few dollars.

The clinic hopes to serve 500 to 1,000 patients in its first year. It also hopes to expand, eventually establishing a satellite clinic in Colorado Springs and offering telehealth services to veterans across Colorado and in neighboring states, Hassan said.

Kaag said all patients calling in for the first time will speak with an intake coordinator on the same day. The clinic plans to offer initial evaluations within a week of a patient’s first contact. Staff will conduct regular patient satisfaction surveys.

The clinic’s partnership with CU — especially with a brain health treatment center for veterans and another center that cares for people with depression — will provide access to a greater array of services while also creating research opportunities, Hassan said.

“We’re not here to do it all,” Hassan said. “We’re here to fill gaps.”

The school district's superintendent, Grant Rivera, decided to donate his first-ever $10,000 bonus to help students applying to college.

Grant Rivera Marietta City Schools

Applying to schools is not only time-consuming, it can also get expensive. Application fees average about $43, according to U.S. News and World Report, but some run between $70 and $90 each. Rivera, who makes a base salary of $190,136, will be giving his bonus money to the Marietta Schools Foundation, which will distribute it to students in need, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.

Rivera told the newspaper he expects 150 to 200 students in the 500-student senior class to apply for college, but that number could go higher. He said he hopes the donation will encourage students to apply to college early, which may give them a better chance of being accepted and receiving financial aid packages.

""My hope is that it's an incentive for kids to do the right thing,"" Rivera told AJC.

Rivera, who became superintendent in 2016, is entitled to a bonus every three years, but said his work alone isn't what earns him the extra cash — it's the work of the entire school system's employees. ""I don't believe that a bonus provided by the board should be earned on the backs of the teachers,"" Rivera said.

The news about Rivera's donation was shared on the school district's Facebook page. Many people thanked him for being so caring toward the students and a true leader."

American honeybee colonies have bounced back after a bad year, the annual beekeeping survey finds.

Beekeepers only lost 22.2% of their colonies this past winter, from Oct. 1 to March 31, which is lower than the average of 28.6%, according to the Bee Informed Partnership’s annual survey of thousands of beekeepers. It was the second smallest winter loss in the 14 years of surveying done by several different U.S. universities.

Last winter’s loss was considerably less than the previous winter of 2018-2019 when a record 37.7% of colonies died off, the scientists found. After that bad winter, the losses continued through the summer of 2019, when beekeepers reported a 32% loss rate. That’s much higher than the average of 21.6% for summer losses. Those summer losses were driven more by hives of commercial beekeepers than backyard hobbyists, said bee partnership scientific coordinator Nathalie Steinhauer.

While the summer losses are bad, winter deaths are “really the test of colony health,” so the results overall are good news, Steinhauer said. “It turned out to be a very good year.”

Populations tend to be cyclical with good years following bad ones, she said. The scientists surveyed 3,377 commercial beekeepers and backyard enthusiasts in the United States.

“One would hope that a lower winter loss means a better 2020 assuming that the weather cooperates and beekeepers don’t end up skimping on colony management,” said University of Montana bee expert Jerry Bromenshenk, who wasn’t part of the study.

Beekeepers in the U.S. also may be taking more of their colonies indoors in the winter, helping them survive, said University of Georgia entomologist Keith Delaplane. New U.S. Department of Agriculture research suggests putting bees in “cold storage” helps them survive the winter.

Full Coverage: Science

For decades scientists have been watching the population of pollinators — crucial to the world’s food supply — shrink. Honeybees, the most easily tracked, are threatened by mites, diseases, pesticides and loss of food.

Loss rates now being seen “are part of the new normal,” Steinhauer said.

Winnie the wombat: Australia's oldest wombat celebrates 31 years,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-16/winnie-the-wombat-celebrates-31-years/9224232,"Winnie may be a common wombat but she certainly isn't typical.

Today marks Winnie's 31st birthday, making her the oldest wombat in Australia and probably the world.

""Common wombats generally live in captivity for between 25 and 26 years, so it's actually quite rare and unusual to have a wombat live over the age of 30,"" Renee Osterloh from the National Zoo and Aquarium said.

Winnie was orphaned as a joey and hand raised at Birdland Animal Park at Bateman's Bay before moving to Canberra's National Zoo in 1992.

""Wombats are a nocturnal species but Winnie loves to get out and explore,"" Ms Osterloh said.

""Visitors often find her digging burrows in the enclosure and playing with a lot of enrichment items like tubs and barrels that keep her entertained and stimulated throughout the day.""

Winnie likes to be active during the day despite being a nocturnal animal. ( ABC Radio Canberra: Penny Travers )

Winnie is also known for curling up into blankets in the middle part of the day.

""It's quite difficult to then see her, but you see this movement under the blankets when you walk past and you know that she's snuggling in deeper into that sleep,"" Ms Osterloh said.

Facebook page follows Winnie's life at the zoo

Winnie is a bit of a celebrity with her own Facebook page and more than 1,000 followers.

Her keepers share photos and post humorous insights into Winnie's life at the zoo.

""It came about when Patrick the wombat from Ballarat Wildlife Park was looking for love and put the call out there for other wombats to see whether or not there was compatibility,"" Ms Osterloh said.

""We set up a Facebook page for Winnie so the two of them could connect.

""It also provides an opportunity for visitors to see the life of a wombat through the wombat's eyes.""

Winnie's favourite foods are grated carrot, sweet corn and sweet potato, and perhaps her healthy diet and active lifestyle have contributed to her long years.

""She's been heavily loved here at the zoo,"" Ms Osterloh said.

""She's definitely been able to live a very long and happy life here and hopefully many more years to come."""
Police identify Missing Husky By Seeing If It Will Sing Along to Its Favorite Tune,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5607759/Police-identify-missing-dog-testing-sings-favourite-tune.html,"This is the heartwarming moment police identified a missing dog by testing to see if it could 'sing' along to its favourite tune.

The Siberian Husky was played a few songs before it burst into a series of ear-splitting howls when his track was played.

When the dog was found the suspected owner was contacted who insisted they would be able to identify him by playing two songs.

The owner said that his husky would sing along to the Israeli sitcom Shemesh theme tune or introduction to the children's programme, Arthur.

He had been reported missing by his owner who lives in the city of Beer Sheva, in the Southern District of Israel.

A dog that matched the description of the missing husky was spotted by police officers when they were out on patrol.

A husky howled to the theme tune of Israeli sitcom Shemesh when police played it for him

The husky was found with a group of teenagers who said that he looked malnourished when they found him in a field.

Suspecting that it might be the missing dog, police contacted the owner - who was not identified - to suggest that he drive over to check.

He said that was not necessary - they would be able to tell if it was his animal when they played the theme music to the programmes.

The video shows the instant, unmistakable reaction when officers played the right songs using the unusual identification method.

After officers passed on the good news, the overjoyed owner and beloved pet were then seen enjoying an emotional reunion."

"Chef José Andrés is transforming eight of his acclaimed restaurants in New York City and Washington, DC, into gourmet soup kitchens for those who are struggling to make ends meet in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic",https://nypost.com/2020/03/16/chef-jose-andres-turns-his-restaurants-into-community-kitchen/,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.

It’s not all dried beans and packaged ramen — a Michelin-starred chef is serving up free lunch in cities ravaged by the coronavirus.

Chef José Andrés is transforming eight of his acclaimed restaurants in New York City and Washington, DC, into gourmet soup kitchens of sorts for those who are struggling to make ends meet in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

While the to-go only meals cost $7 for guests who can afford it, volunteers running the community kitchens will be flexible with patrons who may be out of work or financially constrained due to a near shutdown of daily life. There’s also an option to donate a meal to someone else who might need it.

“Those who cannot afford to pay we will welcome as well,” Andrés said in a statement, adding that many of his restaurants will otherwise be closed.

In New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered all restaurants to offer only take-out or delivery, Andrés’ Little Spain’s Spanish Diner in Hudson Yards will operate as a community kitchen from its glass garage doors. The rest of the mercado will remain closed. Some of Andrés’ other restaurants in Washington, DC, will also be serving to-go food.

The community kitchen will be open from noon to 5 p.m. daily beginning Tuesday, March 17, offering only takeout service. Also, all his employees are getting paid leave for at least the first two weeks.

It’s among the measures restaurants around the world are forced to take to address the pandemic. In New York City, restaurants such as Osteria 57 in Greenwich Village are offering discounted menus with to-go service.

But many say they may not be able to weather the financial impact. Jeremy Merrin, who operates the city’s Havana Central chain of Cuban eateries, told The Post last week that his business has dropped 50 percent in recent weeks.

“I’ve lost over $100,000 in catering and events through August, business that I won’t make up again,” Merrin told The Post. “The biggest question right now is whether I stay open or close to preserve my cash.”"

Toyota collaborated with four children's hospitals to reduce a certain type of blood infection by 75%. They used production principles.,http://toyotadriverseat.com/community/tssc-childrens-hospitals.htm,"TSSC Advisor Scott Dickson joined forces with Amy Taylor, clinical manager of Gastroenterology, and other members of the staff at Children's Health in Dallas to find a solution to the problem of central line-associated blood stream infections.

Children's Health staff meet daily to review and tweak their processes, in keeping with the principles of the Toyota Production System.

The hospital employs quantitiave methods to track their progress and identify opportunities for further improvement.

Scott Dickson has enjoyed a very rewarding career over his 15 years with Toyota, including the past five as a senior advisor in the Toyota Production System Support Center (TSSC).But he’s happy to admit that his collaboration with four children’s hospitals in 2016 was especially meaningful.“When you see a sick child at a hospital, it gets pretty emotional,” says Dickson. “If there’s any way we can do something to help them, we’re going to do it. I felt very blessed to get to do this.”In this instance, Dickson’s work put him in partnership with Children’s Health in Dallas, Cook Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, Children’s Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Children’s Hospital of Kings Daughter in Norfolk, Virginia. All shared a similar challenge: Far too often, young patients fitted with a central line – a plastic tube placed in a large vein that routes to the heart – were contracting infections. In medical speak, such events are referred to as Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infections or CLABSIs.According to a study published in the, approximately 250,000 CLABSIs occur annually at hospitals across the country. These infections are serious but often can be treated successfully. However, such countermeasures cost more than $6 billion annually, according to a study published in theAll four of the institutions in the TSSC project were baffled and frustrated by this persistent issue. After all, doctors and nurses at each hospital were following strict hygiene protocols. Yet, somehow, harmful bacteria as well as other germs were getting past their defenses.In keeping with the TPS principle of(or “go and see”), Dickson spent time at each hospital observing and taking notes. That unbiased perspective proved to be the turning point. In each case, healthcare practitioners were following the proper steps to ensure they were germ free. But the rooms in which the children were being treated? That was a very different story.So, for example, while a nurse might don sterile gloves to operate a medical device, he or she might inadvertently place that device on a counter or blanket that was not sterile.“What they thought was the problem and what was actually the problem turned out to be very different things,” says Dickson. “There’s no way we would have figured it out if we hadn’t spent time at each site and talked with the nurses on the floor.”Once they’d identified the culprit, Dickson said the next step was to apply Toyota’s problem solving methodology to come up with a solution. Then it applied TPS standardization principles so that everyone who might come in contact with patients knew exactly what steps to follow.That included the use of sterile pads to serve as a barrier between a potentially contaminated surface and the medical devices being used to treat the children — such as the chest hubs that are often used in such circumstances.“The way we systemically break down a problem was completely foreign to the people at the hospitals,” says Dickson. “In the end, their reaction was: ‘Oh, my gosh. We never thought of that.’”Through the first six months of full implementation, the objective was to reduce the number of CLABSIs by 50 percent at the four hospitals.“It’s now been more than a year and infections are down 75 percent,” says Dickson. “They’re absolutely thrilled with the progress we’ve made and, if at all possible, looking to eliminate these infections all together.”In keeping with TSSC’s mission, Dickson says he’s helped the hospital partners integrate TPS principles into their ongoing operations so that they can isolate and solve other problems on their own, without Toyota’s help.“They’ve standardized the process,” he says. “Every floor has a visual board where they track their progress. They do audits. And they have a huddle meeting every morning to discuss any events that might have occurred the day before. They problem solve them immediately. Before, they depended on monthly reports.“It all comes back to how we observe and think and then teaching them how to observe and think,” he adds. “TPS works, and not just in manufacturing. I’ve been very fortunate to be involved in many of these projects. But when you can do something to help children, it does make it even more special.”"
Ex-NFL Player Who Made $25 Million Quit Football At Age 29 To Become A Farmer to Donate to Food Pantry,http://www.businessinsider.com/jason-brown-quit-football-farmer-2014-11,"In 2009, Jason Brown signed a five-year, $37.5 million contract with the St. Louis Rams that made him the highest-paid center in the NFL.

Five years later, after earning more than $25 million of that contract, Brown is a farmer who is helping to feed the hungry.

CBS News caught up with Brown in Louisburg, North Carolina, where he runs a 1,000-acre farm after learning how to grow crops on YouTube.

Brown was drafted 124th overall in 2005 and played nine seasons in the NFL before getting cut by the Rams in the spring of 2012.

At age 29, he still had plenty of NFL years ahead of him. He wasn't playing at the level he was in 2009, but his career was far from over. He had interest from numerous teams, including an offer from the Baltimore Ravens.

But he walked away from the game. The NFL world was surprised, and ESPN ran a story with the headline, ""The Curious Case Of Jason Brown.""

""My agent, he told me, 'You're making the biggest mistake of your life,'"" Brown told CBS. ""And I looked right back at him and I said, 'No I am not.'""

Brown is doing this to help the less fortunate. He grows sweet potatoes and other vegetables and donates his harvest to food pantries. According to the New & Observer, he has given away 46,000 pounds of sweet potatoes and 10,000 pounds of cucumbers this fall.

""When you see them pop up out of the ground, man it's the most beautiful thing you could ever see,"" he said of harvesting the sweet potatoes.

It does look pretty fun:

Brown went to school at the University of North Carolina. He had no idea how to farm back in 2012. He learned on YouTube.

It's a great story about life after football. Watch the entire CBS report here:

Jeff Seidel | Detroit Free Press

Show Caption Hide Caption Detroit Tigers pitcher Matthew Boyd is on a mission to end sex slavery Detroit Tigers pitcher Matthew Boyd and wife, Ashley, weren't looking for this cause. But ending sex slavery in Uganda has become their mission.

These are the children of Detroit Tigers pitcher Matthew Boyd:

One of the girls was working as a sex worker at a bar when she was saved. Another was sold into marriage when she was 9 and her husband forced her into prostitution.

And a third girl was abandoned by her mother after delivery and left on a road.

Matt and his wife, Ashley, have essentially adopted 36 girls in Uganda, trying to protect them from the sex slave industry. The Boyds buy the girls food and clothing, and rent for their home, and get them sandals, and pray for them, and worry about them, and make sure they are safe.

The mission is massive and jaw-dropping in its scope and goal. This isn’t just another professional athlete slapping his name on a charity. The Boyds have created their own nonprofit, Kingdom Home, completing the process a few weeks ago. It was exhausting, time-consuming work.

The Boyds are raising money to buy land to expand in Uganda. Over the next three years, they want to build four new homes, so they can bring in more girls because the need is so great.

“You know what?” Matt says. “We can end child sex trafficking in Uganda. The bad guys aren’t smarter than us. We can end this. We can outsmart them. We can beat them to the kids. We can protect them.”

To do that, they have to raise money. Because this mission has grown bigger than they ever imagined.

And that is why Matt is here, strolling through the concourse at Joker Marchant Stadium, still wearing his cleats, looking out of place in his uniform, mingling with the fans, like he got lost on his way to the dugout before the start of an exhibition game in Lakeland, Florida, the spring training home of the Tigers.

Heads turn. Is that Matt Boyd? What’s he doing up here?

“Are you allowed to do this?” Ashley asks.

“I asked Gardy and he said I could,” Matt says, of Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire.

The Tigers organization has been extremely supportive of the Boyds’ passion to help these girls, giving them support, advice and assistance.

“OK,” she says. “If Gardy says so, then you are good.”

It is early March and a crowd begins to swell, as the Boyds start selling tickets to a March 16 fundraiser at Topgolf in Tampa, trying to raise money for Kingdom Home. They will hold another fundraiser May 20 at Topgolf in Auburn Hills.

“We are hoping to raise $50,000 at this event (in Tampa) — we are shooting for the stars here,” Ashley says. “The whole (Tigers) team is coming.”

The Boyds have jumped headfirst into a complicated, global issue that made headlines recently when a sex trafficking ring was discovered in Jupiter, Florida, that allegedly had been servicing high-profile names like Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots. Kraft pleaded not guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution.

An estimated 3.6 million adults and 1 million children were victims of forced sexual exploitation in 2016, according to a study from the United Nations' International Labor Organization.

But the Boyds are trying to fight this issue from the other side, trying to protect the kids who are most vulnerable.

'What are we supposed to do?'

It started one year ago during spring training.

Ashley and Matt were sitting shoulder to shoulder on a couch, in a rented house in Lakeland, talking to Carl Ralston, the director of Remember Nhu, a nonprofit that works to prevent child sex slavery around the world by sponsoring 108 homes in 16 countries.

“We were on Skype, or maybe, it was FaceTime,” Ashley Boyd said.

Ralston told the Boyds about Dorothy Stella Alue, a woman in Uganda, who was giving shelter to 36 girls but she fell into a financial crisis after her husband died. She lost her home and desperately needed help. Ralston gets requests like this constantly. Upon further screening, nine times out of 10, red flags pop up and Ralston declines to help.

But Ralston said that Dorothy’s situation checked out perfectly.

“He just laid out her story,” Ashley said. “We didn’t know where he was going with it. Maybe, he’s just going to ask for money, I don’t know. But then he actually asked if we would wanted to start our own organization to support them. We were shocked. It wasn’t something we expected.”

There was something appealing about it — Matt and Ashley have a deep Christian faith and were searching for a way to serve.

But it was tantalizing, confusing and frightening.

“We said we want to think about it, pray about it,” Ashley said. “We are trying to figure out how to run our own lives, let alone a nonprofit organization. We didn’t immediately jump on it. It was also very daunting. We just brought our first child into the world and now, here, we are going to be responsible for 36 children in Uganda?”

At the time, Matt was entering his third season with the Tigers, a team on the rebuild. He is not a superstar but he’s got a massive heart and wanted to use his platform for something good.

[ Family, faith helped Matthew Boyd raise his game for the Tigers ]

Ashley had always felt a calling to help others, like there was a fire burning deep inside her. She had worked for Remember Nhu out of college.

But they just had a girl, Meira, who is now 1½.

“Ashley and Matt are a great young couple,” Ralston said. “When they heard that Dorothy's husband unexpectedly passed away and that the children literally were struggling to have food to eat, their hearts went out to the children and Dorothy. Ashley and Matt listened very intently and asked great questions about the situation and how they could help.”

The more the Boyds thought about it, the more they prayed about it, they came to a realization. “This is what we were supposed to do,” Ashley said. “That was the start of something way bigger than we ever would have known.”

That started a whirlwind of phone calls, emails and conference calls. Who exactly was Dorothy? Who were these girls? How much danger were they in? What do they need?

And how does somebody set up a nonprofit?

“How does this even work?” Ashley Boyd said. “It was so quick.”

Life in Uganda

Dorothy, a 29-year-old mother of three children, said she started the home seven years ago with her husband after they rescued 25 girls who were being ferried to a city to work as commercial sex workers.

“She kept finding all of these girls, who had been rescued out of situations, who had nowhere to go,” Ashley said. “So she and her husband took them in. Just decided to let this be their mission.” Some of the girls were rescued from the sex trade, others from female genital mutilation and forced early marriages. Others were abandoned or orphaned.

Dorothy had lost her house after her husband died in July 2017.

“My in-laws became wild and turned against me,” Dorothy wrote in an email to the Free Press. “I just lost everything including my academic credentials. They burnt down my house with everything that belonged to me, even my ID card, I just had to apply for a new one. This was because they knew I would inherit my husband's portion of land which they did not want. I moved to a nearby small town and rented a house where I was staying with the girls.”

The rented house didn’t have running water. The girls had to walk 2 kilometers, or about 1.25 miles, every day to a river to get fresh water. Dorothy had no source of income to feed, clothe, pay school fees or pay for medical bills for the girls. She was thinking about abandoning the girls until she reached out in desperation to Remember Nhu and passed the screening process.

“Dorothy is amazing,” Ashley said. “She has a heart for rescuing girls. It kind of stems back to her personal history. She was going to be sold as a childhood bride to her neighbor. She was a little girl.”

Dorothy was a victim of female genital mutilation when she was 10. Before she had healed from the process, her parents received cows and goats from a 55-year-old man. “Which were meant to be my bride price,” Dorothy said.

She ran away from home and found refuge at a Catholic church. “At the church I found a kindhearted and loving nun who upon hearing my story had compassion over me,” Dorothy said. “She took me to live with her friend in Kampala (Uganda’s capital city).”

Dorothy has made it her life mission to help children. And her mission became the Boyds’ mission.

“They loved the girls from the first time they read our story,” Dorothy said. “They devoted themselves to helping us by offering us shelter, food, education by paying the girls' school fees and even spiritual nurture.”

Ashley has a methodical brain like a lawyer but a heart for social issues. She went into hyper-speed, working to create an organization, raising money, going on conference calls, doing research and getting supplies, trying to help in the short term while creating a long-term plan.

“Matt and Ashley have brought a very big difference to me and the girls too,” Dorothy said. “Initially we didn't have a good home, but now we have a home, though rented, but it's a good place. I could not afford buying clothes for the girls but through these wonderful couple, the girls have clothes and even sandals under their feet.

""We now have three meals every day because of Matt and Ashley. We have water running on our tap, we no longer walk the long journey we used to walk in search for water. The girls have good beds and beddings to sleep on. They have balls to play with, which were brought by Matt and Ashley. They go to school in uniform just like the other children. We just feel at home all courtesy of Matt and Ashley. There is a lot Matt and Ashley are planning to do for us and we just thank them so much and pray for them.”

Dorothy calls Matt and Ashley “God sent.”

Ashley calls Dorothy “amazing.”

“She has devoted her life to helping others,” Ashley said. “She chooses joy for the children. She knows she must be a mother to them all and show them the love every child deserves. Being a mother myself I know this can be exhausting to give so much of yourself. But she does it with a constant smile. She is also a beacon of light to her community. People come to her daily to take on more children or for help in other ways because they know what kind of person she is.""

The Boyds' visit

After the Tigers’ 2018 season, Ashley and Matt traveled to Uganda to visit the girls.

But Matt wasn’t exactly comfortable.

“You are going through areas where it looks like a Jason Bourne movie,” he said. “That’s the best way to describe it. It’s scary. For the safety of the girls, we don’t want to say where the home is. It’s special. You come back and it puts things in perspective.”

Ashley laughed when she heard Matt’s description of Uganda.

“It’s so funny,” Ashley said. “He was on edge the whole time. He was Jason Bourne the whole time. Meanwhile, I feel at home. It was wonderful. I felt at peace. Uganda is beautiful. It’s very lush, green rolling hills, super fertile ground, lots of beautiful wild flowers, nothing you would see anywhere else. It’s just incredible.”

The L-shaped house is surrounded by a security fence. Several bedrooms have bunk beds.

When Matt and Ashley arrived, the girls burst out singing.

“It was a long-awaited visit that the girls really yearned for,” Dorothy said. “They were so happy to see them. Some of them could not control their tears as they burst into songs of prayer and thanksgiving. To the girls, Matt and Ashley are their dad and mom.”

The Boyds gave every girl a backpack, a new pair of shoes and school supplies. A church donated homemade dresses for every girl.

“It was Christmas on steroids,” Ashley said. “It was so fun. But they were so respectful. We would hand it to them and they would like, curtsy. Like, thank you. They would walk away and show their friends, all giddy — ah! You know? It was really cute. We came the next day and they were in their new dresses and shoes and they made a song for us.”

The Boyds also brought along letters from the girls’ sponsors. Anyone can sponsor a girl with a $120-a-month donation. About a quarter of the girls are fully sponsored, half are partially sponsored.

“The girls loved the letters,” Ashley said. “They loved seeing the pictures and reading about their families that are supporting them.”

And yes, Matt gave out some baseballs.

“It was amazing being there, seeing the girls be so happy, just like any other kid should,” Matt said.

Every day that the Boyds visited the home, the girls would sing and dance.

“Like we were their honored guest, which is so humbling,” Ashley said. “But just to get to know the girls. I knew their stories and I felt like I knew them, but to meet them and spend time with them and talk to them and see them interact with each other, it was really cool to see each of their different personalities. They live a world away and they have been through things that I could never relate to. But at the end of the day, we are all human. There are the girls who are the natural leaders. There are the girls who are the natural caregivers, who looked after the younger ones. The girls who loved sports. The other ones who love crafts. It was cool to see their different personalities.

“We care for them like they are our own. They are part of our family.”

'We love them ... like our own family'

Ashley, as Matt says, is the “brains” of the operation.

“Dorothy and I are constantly talking back and forth on emails — we’ll talk about everything,” Ashley said.

“We sent the wire today.”

“How are the girls doing on their winter vacation?”

“Hey, is so and so feeling better? I remember she had the flu.”

“Will you fill out the budget?”

“We hold her accountable to fill out spreadsheets, how she uses the funds,” Ashley said.

“We are pretty involved in knowing what is going on in their day-to-day lives. You gotta be thankful for technology in that regard.”

They plan to go back to Uganda next fall after the Tigers’ season.

“We are hoping to bring a group this time, whether it’s sponsors or donors,” Ashley said.

The Boyds are giving these girls more than a safe place to live. They

are trying to prepare them for life. The girls do chores, washing clothes or washing dishes.

The Boyds plan to implement a vocational training program and will pay for each child to attend a university, if they choose that route.

“Our goal is for them to no longer be at risk for child sex slavery,” Ashley said. “If we give them a skill and a value beyond selling their bodies, they will be successful and we will reach our goal.”

But the Boyds, as well as Dorothy, worry about other girls in Uganda who are being married off at a young age.

“Many of the marriages don't work out and so the girls run away to brothels to work as sex workers in order to earn a living and also provide for the children they got from the broken marriages,” Dorothy said. “Some have contracted sexual-related diseases like HIV/AIDS and have died. Their lives are miserable. They cannot afford the basic needs. They don't go to school. Sometimes, I just wish I got a big place and resources, too, to accommodate and reach out to many whom I have personally met and shared their stories with me.

""Some want to go to school but they cannot afford it. They have nowhere to stay especially those who are orphaned. Some have turned to the streets. They have no shelter, no food, no clothes and no one to listen to them. Some have turned into thieves, snatching people's property. Due to this, they are beaten even to death.”

The Boyds' home in Uganda is filled to capacity, so they want to expand.

“We will need new Dorothys and new aunties, but we are turning people away at this point. We are hoping that won’t be the case for too long,” Ashley said.

And it’s only going to get more complicated. The Boyds recently announced that Ashley is now expecting her second child, a boy.

And the Boyds now carry a mixture of emotions — the joy of helping others and the stress of such a massive responsibility, worrying about 36 girls on the other side of the world.

“We love them all like our own family,” Ashley said.

This is such a remarkable, young couple, doing such a remarkable thing. They feel responsibility to care for the children and protect them and to set them on the right path.

“We can end child sex trafficking in Uganda,” Matt repeats.

His eyes tighten and he has such a determined look, no different than when he’s on the mound.

But they can’t do it on their own.

Walgreens manager saved a shopper from a sex attack when he heard her screaming in the bathroom and rushed to the rescue,http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/08/11/bronx-walgreens-attempted-sex-assault/,"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A Walgreens worker stopped a man who was trying to sexually assault a woman inside the store’s bathroom in the Bronx, police said.

The 50-year-old victim was getting out of the bathroom at a Walgreens on White Plains Road just before 3:45 p.m. Thursday when police said the suspect pushed her back inside.

He knocked her to the ground, covered her mouth and tried to take off her pants, according to police.

The worker heard the victim screaming for help and pulled the suspect off of her, police said. The suspect ran off on White Plains Road towards East 239th Street.

“I was shocked because it could have been me right, could have been anybody,” Sheneca Nelson told CBS2’s Jessica Layton.

“That’s incredible, it happened here in Walgreens in the middle of the day — just shows how sometimes unsafe we are,” Randy Kearse added.

The unsuspecting woman was over powered and violently shoved back into the restroom. Thankfully a store manager heard the screams as the suspect tried to pull down the victim’s pants. He burst in and pulled the bad guy away.

A sign posted Friday said the restroom is out of order. The door appeared to have been dusted for the perpetrator’s prints.

Police sources said they have the suspect on video running out of the store 9 minutes after he walked in.

Walgreens wouldn’t answer CBS2’s questions, or allow an interview with the courageous employee, but customers couldn’t stop singing his praises.

“He’s a hero indeed,” Allie Berry said.

“He’s an angel and thank god he was around,” Tracey Cooper added.

The victim was treated at Jacobi Hospital. She described the suspect as having a foul odor.

Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577. All calls are strictly confidential."

Women in a village near the Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre in the northern city of Mathura reportedly began producing the colourful, pyjama-like garments after staff at the centre warned temperatures were approaching sub-zero at night.

The conservation centre takes in rescued elephants who have previously suffered chronic neglect and beatings from cruel handlers.

Photographs show female elephants wearing the carefully embroidered outfits, which cover their legs, back and neck, as centre staff and villagers stand among them.

Kartick Satyanarayan, founder of the centre, said it was important to protect the formerly abused elephants from the cold.

“It is important to keep our elephants protected from the bitter cold during this extreme winter, as they are weak and vulnerable having suffered so much abuse making them susceptible to ailments such as pneumonia,"" she told the Times of India.

""The cold also aggravates their arthritis which is a common issue that our rescued elephants have to deal with.”

The centre currently houses 20 elephants that have been rescued from illegal captivity, trafficking mafia, exploited for street begging and circuses where they were abused and subjected to extreme cruelty.

Cook said many students at West Side faced humiliation because they didn't have anything clean to wear.

So when school starts September 4, there will be a new facility in the building: a free laundromat.

Students pick out their favorite detergent in the new laundry room.

Shame keeps students away

Kids who could not afford to wash their clothes faced intense teasing when they showed up in dirty outfits. Classmates sometimes snapped photos and tagged the students on social media.

""I've seen a few kids in the back of the class talk about one of the people in front of the class and how they smelled and how their clothes looked dirty,"" student Nasirr Cameron told CNN affiliate WCBS.

Cook heard the students talking, too. He saw the posts and quickly suspected that the bullying was a top reason why 85% of his students chronically missed school.

""These are kids, good kids who want to learn, that are missing three to five days a month because they were being bullied because they were dirty,"" Cook explained to CNN. ""I even changed the school uniform to darker colors so they could go more days without cleaning them, but even with that, students were struggling to have them look clean enough to attend.""

So two years ago, the principal applied for a grant from a foundation associated with one of Newark's main utility companies, PSE&G. He received $20,000 to turn an old football locker room into a school laundromat.

A clean start to the school year

The renovations are now complete. The room has five washers, five dryers and a growing stock of detergent donated from around the country.

Student Rah-Asia Marrow stocks the shelves with donated laundry detergent for the student laundromat at West Side High School.

""As the story has spread, we have been receiving packages of detergent at the school and through our Amazon wish list page,"" Nicole Daniel, the school's operating assistant, told CNN.

School social worker Jamila Hammond told WCBS it feels good to know that they can help students who wanted to go to school but felt disgraced by their clothing.

""Many times the students may come in because they're embarrassed, they don't look the same, somebody's complaining about a body odor. I would say, 'OK, baby, then we're going to have to do it the old way.' We have soap, we have water. But now with this laundry room we don't have to do that,"" Daniel said.

The room is open to students free of charge between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. An adult supervisor keeps an eye out during those hours and helps pass on the important life skill of being self-reliant; one scoop of detergent and one measure of dignity at a time.

Principal Akbar Cook poses with a few of the graduating students of the West Side High School class of 2018.

""We are trying to teach them to navigate their pride,"" Cook said. ""My kids are fighters -- they just need good ways to fight for themselves, and then take pride in what they can do."""
Children's Hospitals convert MRI and CT Scanners to interactive adventures to avoid frightening children.,http://archive.jsonline.com/business/by-turning-medical-scans-into-adventures-ge-eases-childrens-fears-b99647870z1-366161191.html/,"An MRI system at the University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital features a cable car theme.

SHARE GE Healthcare industrial designers Erik Kemper (left) and Doug Dietz helped develop the idea of transforming the often-frightening process of MRI and CT scans into an adventure for children. Mark Hoffman

By of the

Waukesha — The sight of a terrified little girl about to have an MRI scan gave Doug Dietz a different perspective on his work as an industrial designer at GE Healthcare — and led to a project that has turned imaging departments at 27 children's hospitals into small theme parks.

The idea that eventually emerged from a mix of brainstorming and research — with some persistence thrown in — was to transform a frightening medical test into a voyage on a spaceship, a visit to a pirate island and other adventures.

Imaging departments became elaborate sets. Technicians became amateur actors with scripts. And children were given starring roles.

""Children would cling to their mom's leg and start crying, and you would have to pry them off,"" said Kathleen Kapsin, radiology director of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ""Now they walk in and they are excited.""

Imagine being a 6-year-old child about to be fed into the bore of a large, noisy machine and then being told not to move for 10 minutes, 30 minutes or longer.

That's what computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography — commonly known as CT, MRI and PET scans — entail.

Even some adults panic in MRIs with small bores, or openings.

Children often told the designers at GE Healthcare that the bore of the machine was the scariest part of the room.

""One of our designers said it looks like everything your mother told you stay away from,"" said Erik Kemper, also a designer.

Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh had to sedate almost every child younger than 9 who needed an MRI scan, Kapsin said, and more than 80% of the children who needed a CT scan.

An MRI scan typically lasts more than 30 minutes, a CT scan about 10 minutes.

Sedating a child meant calling an anesthesiologist and administering medication through an intravenous line.

Children would be terrified. Parents would be worried. And the hospital's expensive imaging equipment could do far fewer scans each day.

That was before the hospital worked with GE Healthcare to come up with what is now known as the Adventure Series.

Fewer than 27% of the children who needed MRIs and fewer than 3% of the children who needed CT scans had to be sedated in the fiscal year ended June, Kapsin said.

The genesis of the idea for the Adventure Series came from Dietz's visiting a children's hospital to see an MRI machine that he had helped design. During the visit, he saw a terrified girl clinging to her parents before a scan.

""It just broke my heart,"" Dietz said. ""It was just an awful experience.""

He remembers her parents catching each other's eyes.

""You could tell they didn't know what to do to help their daughter get through this experience,"" he said.

Dietz realized that he and the other industrial designers in Waukesha needed to use their skills to improve the patient's experience during imaging tests.

Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh — which had learned that finding ways to distract children lessened the need for sedation — was intrigued.

""There is nothing like one of your main customers telling you this is a great idea,"" Dietz said. ""Their timing was just perfect.""

Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh would become a key partner, with its interest making the project a priority.

The designers in Waukesha — one of GE Healthcare's five design studios worldwide — work in a large, open, somewhat disheveled room. It is a place where people still use pencils and occasionally even crayons.

The first brainstorming session took place at a day care center. Dietz made bag lunches for the designers. They then talked to doctors, staff at the Betty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee and more children.

There was no one moment when someone came up with the idea for the Adventure Series. Instead, the idea gradually took shape.

Variety of themes

The series consists of a variety of themes for the different tests. For an MRI, it is a space voyage, with technicians telling children that the spaceship is about to go into hyper-drive when the machine becomes loud. For a PET scan, it is Camp Cozy, because children need to be calm and the test takes about 45 minutes.

GE Healthcare also has developed themes for specific hospitals. For a children's hospital in San Francisco, for example, it designed a theme around cable cars.

JWD-Creative, a Milwaukee ad agency, helped write the scripts and develop the artwork for the Adventure Series.

Part of the process is preparing kids for the scan, such as giving them coloring books tied to the theme the day before the test.

""We used the children's imagination to our advantage,"" said Kapsin of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. ""Instead going to the CT scanner, you are going to Pirate Island. And when you go in, we have a monkey on a swing, so they can play with the monkey.""

GE Healthcare estimates that the Adventure Series costs $50,000 to $100,000 for each ""room"" with imaging equipment.

The biggest expense can be goggles without any metal parts that can work inside an MRI machine. The goggles, which cost about $40,000, enable a child to watch a DVD tied to the theme or one of his or her choice.

The cost can be more than offset, however, if a hospital can do more scans a day and doesn't have to buy another MRI or CT-PET scanner.

""The best way to keep a child motionless is to keep them engaged and entertained,"" Kapsin said.

The technicians at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh initially were skeptical of the idea. That quickly passed.

""We saw children excited and children happy instead of crying and upset,"" Kapsin said.

The technicians soon started getting into the role-playing, wearing scrubs that matched the theme and suggesting toys tied to the theme to give the children at the end of the scan.

The project now is cited as a model of innovation. Dietz has given TED talks on creativity and been featured in a book by Tom and David Kelley of IDEO, an international design firm in Palo Alto, Calif.

He also can tell a story about hearing a child asking her parents after a scan if they could do it again tomorrow.

""That probably was the biggest reward I could ever have,"" he said."

"SCJ Ruth B. Ginsburg out of hospital and ""doing great""",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-film-ruth-bader-ginsburg/justice-ginsburg-up-and-working-after-breaking-ribs-nephew-says-idUSKCN1NE0XO,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is “up and working” and making jokes after being hospitalized with rib fractures, her nephew said on Thursday at the premiere of a new movie about her early career fighting for women’s equality.

Daniel Stiepleman, who wrote the script for the film “On the Basis of Sex” about his aunt’s work as a young lawyer, with input from the justice herself, told Reuters the 85-year-old Ginsburg was “doing great.”

“The last I heard she was up and working, of course, because what else would she be doing, and cracking jokes,” he said. “I can’t promise they were good jokes but they were jokes.”

Ginsburg was hospitalized in Washington after suffering three fractured ribs from a fall. Hours later, Hollywood got its first look at the new film about her pioneering work.

“On the Basis of Sex” stars Felicity Jones as a young Ginsburg and Armie Hammer as her tax attorney husband Martin, in a story about a landmark discrimination case the pair argued in 1972. Director Mimi Leder described the movie as the “origin story” of the justice, who became a hero among U.S. liberals.

“She is a woman who, like countless generations of women before her and since, withstood the subtle slights and overt discrimination of the culture around her,” Leder told the audience at the movie’s world premiere. “She is a woman who changed that culture with her.”

The film, which will debut in U.S. theaters in December on Christmas, depicts Ginsburg as one of just nine women at Harvard Law School in the 1950s, and later struggling to find a firm that will hire a Jewish woman as a lawyer.

“I wanted to show someone who, when they’re younger, didn’t have all the answers,” Jones told Reuters on the red carpet. “She was making mistakes, finding out who she was, had a very young family, her husband wasn’t very well.

“She was juggling a lot of difficult things at the same time,” Jones added, “but always (had) this absolute commitment to the law.”

The film chronicles a case involving Charles Moritz, a single man who was denied a $296 tax deduction because he was a male caregiver. Ginsburg and her husband successfully argued that the denial represented gender-based discrimination.

The real-life Ginsburg made a brief, surprise appearance in the film, drawing applause from the crowd."
"Whale populations in New York Harbor are booming! A few cetaceans appeared in 2011, but now they're in the hundreds, surprising scientists and tourists alike. As water quality improved and pollution levels fell, tiny oceanic life-forms such as algae and zooplankton bounced back, attracting whales.",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/09/whale-populations-new-york-city-booming/?,"“There’s a spout!” naturalist Celia Ackerman calls excitedly to the captain. “Behind the green buoy!”

It’s half an hour into a whale-watching cruise aboard the 95-foot American Princess, and we’re not in Hawaii or Alaska—we’re in New York Harbor, within sight of Coney Island and the Brooklyn shoreline.

About 30 tourists rush to the rail, and moments later, the distinctive outline of a humpback whale surfaces. Cries of delight echo round the boat. “I’ve never seen a whale,” says Milo Bartolotta, 15, who’s on holiday with his family from Florence, Italy. “So I am really excited.”

Such a sighting would have been almost unimaginable 20 years ago, when the waters around New York City were some of the most polluted in the world—a toxic stew of chemicals and garbage. Yet thanks to successful environmental policies—such as the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act—whales are back in the Big Apple.

Since 2011, when the nonprofit Gotham Whale recorded just five humpbacks, the number of cetaceans spotted off New York City has increased dramatically. By 2018, sightings had jumped to 272. This year promises to break that record, with 377 whales of different species already recorded in the waters around New York, most of them humpbacks.

So why the rebound? “I figured they were coming to see me,” jokes Paul Sieswerda, founder of Gotham Whale, which partners with American Princess Cruises, a commercial whale-watching company, to offer tourists a chance to see the behemoths from a safe distance.

In reality, as water quality improved and pollution levels fell, tiny oceanic life-forms such as algae and zooplankton bounced back, providing a crucial food base for a resurgence in menhaden, a schooling fish favored by whales.

You won’t find menhaden, colloquially called bunker, on a restaurant menu—they are oily and smell terrible—but they’re like caviar for whales, which gorge on them during the summer to build up their fat reserves before returning to the tropics in the winter to mate.

Peering over the side of the boat, we can see vast shoals of menhaden swirling around, bunched to protect themselves from predators into what fishermen call “bait balls.”

Another reason for return of the whales is laws protecting the marine mammals from hunting and other human activities—centuries of whaling, for instance, had brought the humpback almost to the brink. (Learn how humpbacks have made a stunning comeback in South Africa.)

It’s unknown how many and what types of whales historically plied the waters off New York City, but scientists believe they were an important top predator—and that their return to the biggest city on the Atlantic bodes well for the ocean’s long-term health.

Urban challenges

Of course, life near NYC isn’t always smooth sailing.

For one, whales have some competition for their favorite food: Commercial fishing operations along the eastern seaboard are now targeting menhaden on an industrial scale, turning the fish into animal feed and human supplements. Virginia-based Omega Protein, for instance, deploys spotter pilots along U.S. waters of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts to locate big schools of bunker.

Sieswerda is concerned that Omega Protein is fishing menhaden just outside New York City’s three-mile restriction zone, where the whales often congregate to feed; he’s mounted a petition to extend the zone to 200 miles. Omega Protein did not respond to a National Geographic request for comment about this petition.

In addition, New York City is now the busiest port on the eastern seaboard, with as many as 20 or more ships lining up to drop anchor and unload their cargo at any given time. This means collisions with whales—sometimes fatal—do happen. (Learn more about how ship strikes affect whales.)

“According to [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], there have been 103 known humpback whale deaths since 2016,” says Howard Rosenbaum, senior scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s New York Aquarium.

“About 50 percent of these showed signs of human-related trauma, like ship strike or entanglement. Twenty-eight occurred in New York and New Jersey.”

Sounds of the sea

To counter this threat, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the New York Aquarium teamed up to deploy a high-tech acoustic buoy named Melville, 22 miles south of Fire Island. Whales communicate mostly via sound, and each species has distinct calls (and even dialects).

When deployed in 2016, Melville immediately began to detect whale calls, data that is analysed and posted online with the hope that ship captains will take note of where the marine mammals are swimming and slow down accordingly.

“The buoy records what we call pitch tracks,” says Mark Baumgartner of the Woods Hole institution, who studies the data in his Massachusetts laboratory. “It’s a bit like having a magical device on your piano, so that as you play, it spits out sheet music. You could then take that sheet music to a musician, who will be able to tell you what you are playing.”

Curious Baby Humpback Whale 'Dances' With Mom and Divers This humpback whale and its calf were found playing off the coast of Tonga.

Melville—named for the author of Moby Dick, of course—has captured vocalizations of the little-seen, 65-foot-long sei whale, as well as one of the world’s most endangered whales, the North Atlantic right whale—so named because it was the “right” whale to hunt. With only about 400 of the animals remaining on Earth, this species is particularly vulnerable to any threat, including ship strikes. (Read about the recent deaths of four of North Atlantic right whales.)

In December, the Wildlife Conservation Society and Woods Hole will add two new buoys, to be funded by the energy company Equinor, which is developing a wind farm in the area. Baumgartner is concerned the wind farm’s construction could create noise, which can disturb whales by disrupting their communication.

""So we hope the real-time monitoring we can get from the buoys will help mitigate these effects,"" he adds.

'An amazing thing'

As the boat chugs back to where we started, in Far Rockaway, we take stock of the day.

Two whales. No breaching. And no lunge feeding, when a whale explodes upward out of the water, jaws apart, to gobble up thousands of bunker in one gulp."

The Oscar-winning actor announced the news at a climate change conference at Yale University on Tuesday.

The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation on Tuesday announced its largest-ever portfolio of environmental grants, bringing its total amount of financial impact to over $80 million since its formation in 1998.

The new grants will offer $20 million to more than 100 organizations supporting such causes as wildlife and habitat conservation and climate programs.

DiCaprio announced the grants at a climate change conference at Yale University hosted by John Kerry. “We are proud to support the work of over 100 organizations at home and abroad,"" DiCaprio said. ""These grantees are active on the ground, protecting our oceans, forests and endangered species for future generations — and tackling the urgent, existential challenges of climate change.”

The Oscar-winning actor went on to push for urgent action to shift from fossil fuel reliance to renewable energy. “There exist today many proven technologies in renewable energy, clean transportation and sustainable agriculture, that we can begin to build a brighter future for all of us,"" he said. ""Our challenge is to find new ways to power our lives, employ millions of people and turn every individual into an advocate for clean air and drinkable water. We must demand that politicians accept climate science and make bold commitments before it is too late.”

Said Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation: “This round of grants comes at a critical time. With a lack of political leadership and continued evidence that climate change is growing worse with record-breaking heatwaves and storms, we believe we need to do as much as we can now, before it is too late.”

The grants announced covered six areas: climate change, wildlife and landscape conservation, marine life and ocean conservation, innovative solutions, indigenous rights and the California program."
Alex Trebek is done with chemotherapy and back at work on 'Jeopardy!',https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/29/media/alex-trebek-chemo-jeopardy/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Alex Trebek is back at work taping the new season of ""Jeopardy!,"" five months after being diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

In a new video for ""Jeopardy!"" viewers, Trebek said his chemotherapy treatments are ""over"" and he's ""on the mend.""

A spokeswoman for the show confirmed that production of season 36 began on July 22.

The new episodes are slated to begin airing on local TV stations on September 9.

""We had something exciting things coming up and I can't wait to share them with all of you,"" Trebek said in a web video that was released on Thursday. ""Let me tell you, it's going to be a good year.""

Trebek initially announced his cancer diagnosis in a video message in March.

""I'm going to fight this,"" he said at the time. ""And I'm going to keep working, and with the love and support of my family and friends, and with the help of your prayers, also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease.""

He continued to tape episodes for season 35 -- featuring James Holzhauer's remarkable winning streak -- while undergoing treatment in the spring.

At the time, he quipped that ""I have to"" beat the disease ""because under the terms of my contract, I have to host 'Jeopardy!' for three more years.""

In May, Trebek told People magazine that his doctors were thrilled about his body's response to treatment. He said he was in ""near remission"" at that time.

On Thursday a spokesperson declined to share any further details about Trebek's health.

But in the video, Trebek said, ""I've gone through a lot of chemotherapy and thankfully that is now over.""

He added, ""I'm on the mend and that's all I can hope for right now."""

We’ve officially annihilated a second strain of polio. Only one remains,https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/were-closer-to-eradicating-polio-from-the-planet-2-of-3-strains-now-wiped-out/,"A crippling strain of polio virus is no more. Officials confirmed Thursday that global health efforts have wiped it out, moving humanity one step closer to completely eradicating the highly infectious virus from the planet.

The obliterated strain—wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3)—is one of only three wild strains of polio. It is the second to be globally eradicated. Health officials declared WPV2 eradicated in 2015. That leaves only one wild strain remaining: WPV1.

This “historic” announcement falls on World Polio Day and is based on the recent conclusion of the independent Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication, set up in part by the World Health Organization. The announcement comes after years of careful and painstaking global surveillance to certify that WPV3 no longer exists anywhere in the world, apart from specimens preserved in secure containment. The last known case of WPV3 occurred in northern Nigeria in 2012.

“Wild poliovirus type 3 is globally eradicated,” commission chair and vaccine expert David Salisbury declared at a celebration at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. “This is a significant achievement that should reinvigorate the eradication process and provides motivation for the final step—the eradication of wild poliovirus type 1.”

That final step is not expected to be an easy one. Currently, WPV1 only circulates in two countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan. But vaccination efforts to stop it are plagued by vaccine misinformation and harmful rumors, armed conflicts and insecurity, and fears and misinformation about vaccine-derived polio infections, which are rare but a considerable threat.

Endgame

Polio viruses in general spread via the fecal-oral route, therefore thriving in areas with poor sanitation and low, to no, vaccination. The virus typically affects young children and can cause permanent paralysis and even death in a small number of those infected. Some people infected will have no symptoms, though, making surveillance particularly difficult.

Oral polio vaccines use weakened versions of the virus to train the immune system to fight the devastating disease. Thus, those vaccinated can harbor these weakened viruses in their guts for a short period of time, excreting them in waste. In under-immunized populations with poor sanitation, the weakened viruses can circulate and spread just like the three wild strains.

In rare instances when the weakened strains are able to circulate for extended periods of time (at least 12 months), they can mutate and collect dangerous traits from other circulating viruses, creating hybrid viruses that can, once again, cause paralysis. These cases are called circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). In well-immunized populations, cVDPVs are not an issue.

In past years, there have been over two-dozen outbreaks of cVDPV in at least 21 countries. So far in 2019, there have been 94 cases of WPV1 (in Afghanistan and Pakistan) and 102 cases of cVDPV worldwide. Most cases of cVDPV occurred in Angola, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nigeria.

The endgame for polio eradication is to continue supporting immunization programs worldwide and to switch to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is given by an injection.

In a statement Thursday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, “The achievement of polio eradication will be a milestone for global health... We remain fully committed to ensuring that all necessary resources are made available to eradicate all poliovirus strains. We urge all our other stakeholders and partners to also stay the course until final success is achieved.”

So far, only two infectious diseases have been globally eradicated: smallpox and rinderpest, a viral disease that affects cattle."

He found them where he never would have expected. E:60 by Sarah Spain Illustration by Jonathan Bartlett for ESPN 09/02/18

Carol Briggs placed her newborn son on the bed and removed all of his clothes. She tried to find herself in his face, searching his mouth, his nose, his eyes. ""Not yet,"" she thought. She saw only his father. She looked him up and down, making a mental note of each of his 10 tiny toes, chubby legs, puffy belly and two little arms reaching up at her. ""In my mind,"" Briggs says, ""that was probably going to be the last time I ever saw him."" It was Dec. 1, 1972, and a big snowstorm had hit the greater Pittsburgh area that week. Briggs had gone sledding with some of the other girls the night before, dragging a cardboard box up and down a big hill that emptied out right at the Zoar Home for Mothers, Babies and Convalescents in Allison Park, Pennsylvania. She woke up in labor around 2 a.m., and just 32 minutes later, she was a mother. She named her baby Jon Kenneth Briggs. Her parents and older brother drove the hour from her hometown of Youngstown, Ohio, to be with her at the hospital. After cleaning out her room at the maternity home and signing some papers, she was back in Ohio the next day, ready to resume her life as a 16-year-old high schooler and National Honor Society member. No one outside of her immediate family and her cousin Robin knew about the baby. Only when she was preparing to sign the adoption papers did Briggs consider sharing the news with the father, a teenage fling who had gone off to college before she discovered she was pregnant. She ultimately decided against it. ""He was a kid too,"" she says. ""He was off at college on a scholarship. I think I may have felt that I kind of got myself in this, I'm gonna do what I need to do to work my way through it."" With her parents' blessing, Briggs had decided that when the child was born, she would put him up for adoption. ""My mother was still cleaning up my room for me once a week,"" she says. ""I wasn't in a position to be anybody's mother. I thought this was best for him, that I allow him to be placed with some family that would be able to give him all the great things that I had coming up because I had a mother and a father. I just didn't want him to get cheated out of anything."" In her last interaction with the adoption agency, Briggs was told that baby Jon had been placed with a doctor and his wife in Columbus, Ohio. IN EARLY 2017, now-Kansas City Chiefs running backs coach Deland McCullough signed on to coach the running backs at USC, having spent the previous six years in the same position at Indiana University. A few months before making the move to southern California, he and his wife, Darnell, welcomed their fourth son into the world. For the fourth time, the couple provided doctors with Darnell's medical history but couldn't do the same for Deland's side of the family. At 44 years old, McCullough knew nothing about where he came from. Growing up in Youngstown, his adoptive mother, Adelle Comer, could tell him only that he was adopted at a very young age and that she had no information about his birth parents. For a long time, that was enough. McCullough wasn't interested in finding them anyway. There was enough trouble in Youngstown those days, and he didn't want to burden anyone who might have bigger things to worry about. Things changed when he had his first child, and as his family grew, so too did his desire to know of his past. He wanted to know who gave him his deep voice and his muscular build and to whom he owed his pensive nature and quiet intensity. He wondered where son Dason got his height and which grandfather or uncle his bespectacled son, Daeh, might favor. He was so hungry for information that he never questioned whether the search might lead him to answers he couldn't handle. ""I didn't know what was going to happen,"" McCullough says. ""I didn't know how people would receive things one way or another. I didn't have a plan. I just knew I wanted to find out."" New laws in Ohio and Pennsylvania had called for the unsealing of adoption records, giving McCullough new hope that he might find his birth parents. In November 2017, more than a year after filling out the requisite paperwork and years after his search began, he finally received his adoption files in the mail. For the first time, he saw his original birth certificate, complete with his name, Jon Kenneth Briggs, and the name of his mother, Carol Denise Briggs. There was no information about his father. ADELLE COMER WAS living in a three-bedroom house on a cul-de-sac in Youngstown with her husband, popular local radio host A.C. McCullough, and their young son, Damon, when she got the call. It was a social worker reaching out to see whether she and A.C. would come see an infant at an adoption agency in Pennsylvania. Not long after the tragic death of their second son, Alex, who died of an intestinal birth defect after just 28 days, the young couple had started serving as foster parents, and they were looking to adopt. In January 1973, they met 6-week-old baby Jon. ""He was asleep in a bassinet,"" Comer says. ""And she put him in my arms, and when he woke up, his eyes were looking straight at me. It was instant connection. Love. Mother-son."" By March of that year, Jon Kenneth Briggs had been renamed Deland Scott McCullough, and he was living at home with his new parents, Adelle and A.C. ""We were still in love, a good couple,"" Comer says. ""We went to church, partied, went to cookouts. We were working together and doing this together and wanting to make a home for our children. We knew that God's hand was in it. Deland came so fast to us. We knew that it was meant to be. Both of us."" But things changed quickly. Comer's father had a stroke, and though A.C. wanted to put him in a nursing home, Comer brought her dad to live with the family in Youngstown. Their marriage deteriorated, and when Deland was just 2 years old, A.C. moved out. ""They went through a lot of hurt and disappointment, but they took it,"" Comer says of her sons. ""I said, 'God gives you an example of what to be and what not to be. You have to make the choice.' And that's all I had to say, and they got it."" When Deland was in elementary school, Comer came home to find that he had cut three gashes into the couch for which she had just finished two years of layaway payments. Kids at school had been teasing him about being adopted, and he accused Comer of loving him less than her birth son, Damon. She explained that she loved the two boys differently, one because he had been in her belly and the other because she had chosen him. After that, Deland McCullough rarely spoke of his adoption. He got good at pretending to be whole. ""The void was there,"" he says. ""I wish that it wasn't, but I think I did a good job of hiding it."" After the divorce, Comer had relationships with a few other men, some of whom were combative and abusive. ""Some men don't understand what respect is,"" she says. ""I've got two sons, and I'm not gonna allow my children to grow up with this type of lifestyle, this drama."" Damon sometimes tried to physically defend her, but then he left for college, and Deland felt too small, physically and emotionally, to step in. His response to the violence was to try to tune it out, become emotionless, put blinders on and dream of a way out of the house and out of Youngstown. Comer acknowledges that she contributed to the chaos in her own way as well. ""Biggest drama queen in the world, OK?"" she says. ""They called me Ma Barker because I'd shoot you and ask questions later."" Comer took Deland with her to therapy for a while, hoping to make things at home a little less turbulent. New boyfriends came and went, but she mostly settled into life as a single mom, taking on multiple jobs to support her sons, including as a switchboard operator at the Cuyahoga County Department of Human Services, a waitress, a social worker and a short-order cook at the local bowling alley. She did her best to rear the boys on her own, but they moved a lot, and she struggled to pay the bills, sometimes having to choose between electricity and a working phone. But Comer stressed the importance of an education, insisting that she see the boys' homework to make sure they were taking it seriously. She taught them the value of a dollar and the importance of faith, demanding that they use a portion of their monthly child support for Sunday school and tithes at church. And she was always shuttling them to activities, from the theater program at the Youngstown Playhouse to football, basketball and track practices. Deland was a bit of a late bloomer in terms of talent, but the passion for football was always there. Early on in pee wee, he heard his name over the loudspeaker and a light went off in his head. He fell in love with the game and started carrying a football with him everywhere he went, even to bed. ""It was an escape,"" he says. ""When I was out there practicing, you didn't think about the electric is off, you know? You didn't even think about anything like that. You were just out there balling, doing your thing and competing and bonding with your friends."" Comer was a one-woman cheer squad, bringing multiple signs to Deland's games and running up and down the sideline rooting him on. One night when her ride didn't show up, she took her son's moped to the game. He looked up in the stands and saw her, still wearing his moped helmet, hollering and screaming for him: ""D-MACK! D-MACK!"" As a junior defensive back, Deland saw himself playing football at a small school or enlisting in the Navy, but an opportunity to show his talent at the running back position his senior year drew the eye of college recruiters. Suddenly, he was being pursued by the likes of Jim Tressel, then the head coach at Youngstown State; Bob Stoops, then the defensive backs coach at Kansas State; and Sherman Smith, then the running backs coach at Miami of Ohio. DELAND MCCULLOUGH LOOKED out the window of his third-period English class at Campbell Memorial High School and saw a tall man emerge from a candy apple red Mercedes-Benz with tan interior and tricked-out gold rims. A few minutes later, he got a pink slip message to leave class and go to the office, where the tall man stuck out his hand and said, with a firm handshake, ""I'm Sherman Smith, the running backs coach at Miami University."" A former star quarterback at Miami, Smith was a second-round draft pick at running back for the Seahawks and went on to play eight years in the NFL. He had a booming voice, thick arms and broad, square shoulders. He walked and talked and carried himself like a former pro; McCullough was immediately drawn to him. ""It was just something about his personality,"" McCullough says. ""The way he presented himself. He had things that I hadn't seen out of a man or mentor. He was on top of his details. He was successful. He had played in the NFL. He got his degree. I wasn't around that type of person. ""The Mercedes was nice, too, you know?"" he laughed. ""That was slick."" As a Youngstown native himself, Smith thought guys from the area were tough, but the coaches told him McCullough was special -- a thin kid, but when he couldn't run around people, he'd go through them. McCullough was serious that day in the office, offering few smiles and answering with a lot of ""Yes, sir"" and ""No, sir,"" but he was also intelligent and expressive. Smith thought he'd very much like to work with him. The feeling was mutual. Despite interest from other schools, the decision to attend Miami University was easy for McCullough, especially after the home visit, during which Smith charmed Comer as well. ""Well, Coach Smith was hard not to love,"" Comer says, laughing. ""I fell in love with him the first time. He was just a gentleman. And he was very attentive and respectful to me."" Smith drove them to visit the school and was back at Campbell Memorial a few months later for signing day, when McCullough signed his letter of intent to play at Miami. When McCullough arrived on campus, the coaches tried to turn him into a wide receiver, but he pushed for an opportunity to work with Smith and the running backs, accepting a redshirt freshman year to pursue the position he believed he was meant to play. ""I would tell the players, 'You may not be looking for a father, but I'm going to treat you like you're my sons,'"" Smith says. ""And so I just looked at every guy like my son. I just wanted to be a positive role model for Deland and exemplify what I thought my father exemplified for me."" ""He was everything,"" McCullough says. ""If anything was going on, I was going to talk to Coach Smith. Everybody in that room gravitated towards Coach Smith just because that's the type of person he was. What he's about rubs off on you, so I always wanted to be around that."" Smith left Miami University after that season to be the tight ends coach at the University of Illinois, but he and McCullough stayed in touch. He watched from afar as McCullough put together a Hall of Fame career in Oxford, rushing 36 touchdowns and setting a school record with 4,368 rushing yards. McCullough was surprised when his name wasn't called in the 1996 draft, but he was invited to a few workouts and ended up signing with the Bengals. He was leading the NFL in preseason rushing before he suffered a season-ending knee injury in Cincinnati's final exhibition game. After a few more looks in the NFL, a couple of seasons in Canada, several more knee surgeries and a brief flirtation with the XFL, McCullough finally accepted in 2001 that the dream of pro football was over. A few years later, married and the father of one son, McCullough took a job teaching communications and coaching football at Harmony Community School in Cincinnati. Despite rising to the ranks of principal and making a good salary, his first taste of coaching gave him the itch to coach full time, and he reached out to his alma mater about an opportunity to join the staff. Smith had followed a similar path, first teaching and coaching high schoolers, then working his way up the ranks from Miami University to the University of Illinois, the Houston Oilers, the Washington Redskins and, finally, the running backs coach for the Seahawks. He was with Seattle when he got a call from McCullough, asking for advice as he started his new job at Miami University. By 2014, McCullough was coaching at Indiana University, and the two were reunited on the field, as Smith welcomed McCullough to Seattle for a coaching internship. He saw firsthand that his former player had a real future on the sideline. He had no idea that off the field, McCullough was consumed by the search for his family. A FEW DAYS before Thanksgiving 2017, Carol Briggs got home from work, sat down on the couch and opened a Facebook message from an unfamiliar man: ""Did you have a baby in 1972 in Allegheny County that you placed for adoption?"" ""Luckily, I was already sitting,"" she says. Briggs had thought often of baby Jon. Every year, she wished him a ""Happy Birthday"" on her Facebook wall, and she regularly searched adoption websites to see if he might be looking for her. Briggs could still hear her mother's voice, saying more and more often in the years before she died, ""You need to find that boy."" Never married and without any other children, Briggs would joke to her cousin Robin that one day baby Jon might show up at her door and walk in to find her home alone, dancing around the house to Funkadelic. She called her older brother, who warned her that the message might be from someone trying to bribe or extort her. She responded anyway, and after a few short messages, she agreed to speak to McCullough on the phone that night after he got out of practice. In the hours before the call, she Googled his name and read every article she could find. She stared at his pictures and tried to find herself in his face. It wasn't hard to see it now: the mouth, the nose, the eyes. McCullough called Briggs from a hallway at USC as he awaited the start of a football family dinner. They spoke as if they'd known each other for years, an easy back and forth as they shared where life had taken them in the 44 years since she'd laid him down on that bed and let him go. She learned that he had never gone to live with a doctor in Columbus, that in fact they had been just a few miles away from each other in Youngstown for all of McCullough's childhood. She likely shopped at the same grocery store as Adelle Comer, perhaps even passing young McCullough in the aisles. She was certain that her sports-fanatic father, now deceased, had read about McCullough's high school exploits in the paper. McCullough was overjoyed to find his birth mother, though a mother had never been what he was missing. ""Within probably the first five or six minutes, he says, 'Who is my father?'"" Briggs says. She took a breath. She had probably told only three people the man's name. After making the decision to not tell the father all those years ago, she had been determined to never let him learn of the baby years later because of careless gossip. She hesitated but decided McCullough had a right to know. ""Your father's name is Sherman Smith,"" Briggs told him. McCullough, leaning against a wall in the hallway, felt as though he might pass out. He started flashing back to all of his memories with Smith and all the times people had joked about him being a carbon copy of his coach. Throughout college, when he returned to coach at Miami University, during his internship with the Seahawks. ""'Man, you and Coach Smith look alike.' 'Man, you all walk alike.' 'Y'all this, y'all this,'"" McCullough says. ""There's no reason to connect those dots because you weren't even thinking about them. A sense of pride that went through me, like, 'Wow, that explains these things.' And then I also start thinking about all the similarities of our path. That just blew me away."" Not only had he known his father for 28 years, but Smith was also his mentor, the man he had looked up to since he was 16 years old. McCullough thought of a photo of him and Smith at Campbell Memorial High, both beaming as he signed his letter of intent to play at Miami University. The same photo he had pinned to the corkboard that hung in his college dorm room. The same photo that was at that moment sitting in a Ziploc bag in the drawer of his nightside table, a bag that had traveled with him through every job and every move. ""If you would have told me to pick who my father was, there's no way I would have picked him because I might have thought I wasn't worthy for him to be my father,"" McCullough says. ""I felt like my blessings came full circle because I'd always wanted to be somebody like him."" ""I could hear him take a big breath,"" Briggs says. ""And I could kind of hear him choke up a little. And finally he says, 'Well, I've known Sherman my whole life.'"" THE NEXT MORNING, McCullough texted Smith asking if they could talk about something important. It was November, and Smith assumed that McCullough had gotten a coaching opportunity he wanted to discuss. Instead, McCullough began by talking about his search for his birth parents, how he had found his biological mother, and she was from Youngstown, just like them. ""Praise the Lord!"" Smith recalls saying. ""What a blessing!"" ""And then he said, 'I asked her who my biological father was, and she said you.'"" Smith was quiet. Sixty-three years old, he had been married to his college sweetheart for 42 years and had reared a grown son and a daughter. He hadn't heard the name Carol Briggs in more than four decades. He never knew she was pregnant, never knew there was a baby. He knew he couldn't deny the possibility that he was McCullough's father, but he wanted proof. Even more, he wanted time to think. He asked McCullough if he could call him back later. Stunned and a little hurt, McCullough agreed. Smith sat in his office. Guilt washed over him. Even though he hadn't been told about the baby, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had let Briggs and McCullough down. He felt awful that he had left Briggs in such a difficult position and regretted all the years he had missed out on being a father to McCullough. He had built a life making a difference in young men's lives. He had spoken to his athletes and his kids about being responsible, being accountable. ""Being irresponsible is not neutral,"" Smith says. ""When you're irresponsible, someone becomes responsible for what you've been irresponsible for."" He thought about what this would say about him as a man and found himself hoping that a paternity test would show that he wasn't McCullough's father. It was a thought that brought him only more guilt. He asked to speak to Briggs. Briggs cried her way through work the day she was set to talk to Smith. ""I hadn't talked to Sherman in 45 years. And after 45 years, this is probably not the icebreaker conversation that you want to have with the guy that you used to fool around with. 'Hey, we've got a 45-year-old son. And how are you?' So, no, I wasn't looking forward to that at all. Not at all."" There was no need to worry. Smith was calm and kind, and the two settled into a nice conversation, catching up for a long time before they even got to talking about McCullough. Smith apologized to her for her having to make such a difficult decision at such a young age, and Briggs explained why she had felt it was best to not tell Smith about the baby. She said that over the years, she just wanted to know that McCullough was OK, and Smith reassured her that her son was a good man. Briggs hung up full of emotion but relieved that Smith wasn't angry with her. Smith hung up feeling much more certain that McCullough was his son. Smith talked to his wife, Sharon, and his brother, Vincent. He talked to his children, Sherman and Shavonne. He thought about McCullough's coaching internship a few years earlier, how Seahawks assistant offensive line coach Pat Ruel hadn't stopped cracking jokes about Smith and his protege acting like a father-son duo. McCullough sent Smith an old article from his days in the CFL, and Smith couldn't believe his eyes. ""I'm looking at this thing and thinking, 'I don't remember taking this picture. I don't remember doing this article,'"" Smith says. ""I'm looking at Deland, and I'm thinking it's me. That got me. ""I called my aunt in Youngstown, and I told her about it. And she'd went on YouTube and pulled up some pictures of Deland, and she called me back. She said, 'Nephew, I can save you the money on the DNA tests.'"" The more Smith thought about it, the more he realized the story wasn't about him and his guilt. It was about McCullough and what he had been through. It was about a life without a father, about the years McCullough had spent looking for his birth parents, hoping to fill a void, wanting to know where he'd come from. ""It was said that humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less,"" Smith says. ""I started thinking about Deland."" Sometime in the weeks between that first phone call and the test results, Smith realized that he was hoping he was McCullough's father. That, in fact, he would be devastated if the results came back otherwise. When the test came in, it showed a 99.99 percent chance that Smith was, indeed, McCullough's father. Both were elated. ""I look at it, and I just say it's a God thing,"" Smith says. ""It's grace. It's undeserved. And that's what's made it great for Deland and for all of us, how everyone has embraced this and is excited about our new family."" McCullough understood why Smith had been so curt at first. McCullough had spent his whole life wondering about his birth parents. Briggs had spent her whole life wondering about her child. Smith had gone from zero to a 45-year-old son in one phone call; he needed time. Deland McCullough gathered with his biological parents, his adoptive mother and his extended family at a reunion in July. Ruddy Roye for ESPN A few weeks after the paternity test came back, McCullough had a recruiting trip near Nashville, where Smith and his wife had relocated after his retirement. McCullough made a special trip to see the man he now knew as his father. ""I'm pretty sure he was nervous,"" Smith says of that day. ""I laugh because I'm looking out the window because I know he's supposed to be coming. I'm standing there, and I see he parks at the corner down there. And he's parked there for five minutes. I said, 'What's he doing?' He finally pulls up and gets out the car."" As McCullough walked up the steps to the house, Smith greeted him with open arms and said, ""My son."" It was the first time in McCullough's life that anyone had called him that. ""For so many years that I was around him, the embrace was, 'Hey, Coach, how you doing?'"" Smith says. ""But this is, 'Man, my son.' Maybe I was doing it for me, to help me really, fully understand."" ""I know he was saying it from a place of 'I'm proud. This is my son,'"" McCullough says. ""I'd never heard that. I'd never been referred to like that before -- period. It really hit me hard emotionally. When I sit here at this point, and I'm looking at the things that I've done, I'm happy that I'm able to be somebody that he's proud of."" At first, McCullough was concerned that his adoptive mother might be upset by his relationships with his birth parents. But as soon as he heard that Briggs and Comer had hit it off in their first phone call, he knew everything would be fine. ""All I can say is, 'Are you serious?' Over and over again. 'Are you serious?'"" Comer says of McCullough's journey leading to Smith. ""It's just a miracle that his birth father's been in his life since he was 16, 17 years old. That's my son, and I want nothing but 100 percent best for him. He needed that, and God gave it to him, and it's in God's time."" Both Smith and Briggs are endlessly grateful to Comer for raising McCullough with the wisdom they didn't yet have. ""She did what I couldn't do,"" Briggs says of Comer. ""She was an adult, she was married at the time, so you know she brought him into a family structure. That was what I wanted for him. I wanted him to have what I had, and she gave him that. She gave him all the tools that he needed in growing up to be the successful man that he is right now."" THIS PAST JUNE, the two Miami University Hall of Famers, Smith and McCullough, were back on campus to witness the verbal commitment of McCullough's son, Deland McCullough II, to the RedHawks football team. The younger McCullough is a defensive back, just like Smith's son, Sherman, who played the position at Miami as well. In July, a huge family reunion in Youngstown brought McCullough, Briggs, Smith and Comer together for the first time. All of McCullough's parents in one place, reflecting on nurture versus nature, what is inherited versus what is taught and the many different forms of parenthood. It was both the culmination of a journey and the start of something new for the families that the journey had introduced. A man found his parents, a mother found her child, and a father discovered a son he never knew he was missing. There is no jealousy, no resentment and no regret. There is just gratitude for the winding paths that brought them all together. ""When I look at Deland, the type of guy he is, it was a gift to us,"" Smith says. ""And to think -- Deland felt we were a gift to him."" ""Now I know who I am and where I'm from,"" McCullough says. ""I got all of the pieces to the story. I got them all now.""

Robyn Fenty a.k.a. Rihanna is truly the gift that keeps on giving. First, her Clara Lionel Foundation donates $5 million to myriad charities to fight COVID-19 relief on March 22. She then follows that up by donating PPE to the city of New York, receiving a personal thank you from half of the nation’s favorite sibling vaudeville act, governor of New York Andrew Cuomo. Just last week, CLF and Jay-Z’s Shawn Carter Foundation joined forces to offer $2 million in grants to support COVID-19 response efforts to support undocumented workers, the children of frontline health workers and first responders, and incarcerated, elderly, and homeless populations in New York City and Los Angeles. And now, CLF has teamed up with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey to donate $2.1 million each to the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles to assist victims of domestic violence affected by the COVID-19 “stay at home” order in the greater Los Angeles area.

The $4.2 million donation will support ten weeks of support including shelter, meals, and counseling for individuals and their children suffering from domestic violence at a time when shelters are full and incidents are on the rise. In a statement, Rihanna, a domestic-abuse survivor, and Dorsey note that while they are starting in Los Angeles they understand that “victims of domestic violence exist all over the world, so this is just the beginning.” Major props to Dorsey; Rihanna; Rihanna’s father, Ronald Fenty, who is currently recovering from COVID-19; and Rihanna’s mother, Monica Braithewaite, for raising such a genuinely good individual."

Taco truck operators showed up some schools to provide teachers with food.

“It’s L.A. What else are you going to bring?” Victor Fernandez said. “It’s tacos. Nobody hates tacos.”

About 50 people picketed outside the Ramon C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts.

Among them were husband and wife Tirsa and Steve Farah, who had a cart offering free coffee and conchas to picketers.

Tirsa said her mother has been a teacher at Garfield High School for 30 years now. They chose this location because it was near her business, Tirsa’s Mexican Café.

“I couldn’t not do it,” Tirsa, 33, said of being out at the protest. “This is history in the making.”

Her family is full of educators. She wore red lipstick, a red bandana and red apron in support of the strike. Tomorrow, she said she plans on joining her mother at Garfield High to offer treats and coffee to the early morning picketers.

But in a quiet transformation , pet euthanasia rates have plummeted in big cities in recent years, falling more than 7 5 percent since 2009 . A r escue, an adoption or a return to an owner or community is now a far likelier outcome, a shift that experts say has happened nationwide.

The New York Times collected data from municipal shelters in the country’s largest 20 cities, including two in the Los Angeles metro area. Many of the shelters do not track outcomes uniformly or make historical data readily available online. Until recently, there has not been a concerted national effort to standardize and compile shelter records."
Zero new cases in New Zealand for a second day in a row,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/416516/watch-live-ashley-bloomfield-and-jacinda-ardern-on-nz-s-covid-19-response,"There have been no new cases of Covid-19 reported in New Zealand today for the second day in a row, the Health Ministry has confirmed.

Watch the latest briefing here:

The total number of confirmed and probable cases remains at 1497, of which 1147 have been confirmed.

Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said 1402 people have now recovered - up 12 on yesterday, and 94 percent of all cases in this country have now recovered.

There are still just two people receiving hospital-level care, neither are in ICU.

He said 5961 were carried out yesterday and there had now been more than 200,000 tests carried out.

""This milestone of 200,000 tests, which is just over 4 percent of the population, is a significant achievement. I want to recognise everybody who has been tested, as well as the many, many people across the system who have facilitated that happening, it is an incredibly important pillar of our response to Covid-19.""

Dr Bloomfield said today's figures did reinforce that New Zealand was ""on the right path"".

""We can't afford to give away the progress we've made. We do need to remain vigilant.""

He confirmed that the Waitematā DHB's review into Waitakere Hospital will be released at 2pm this afternoon.

'NZ is about to enter a very tough winter'

New Zealand is moving into a phased alert level 2 this week, with retail, malls, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and other public spaces including playgrounds and gyms able to reopen tomorrow. Schools will return to normal classes from Monday 18 May, while bars will have to wait until Thursday 21 May to reopen.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said today discussions were underway with church leaders, funeral directors, and iwi leaders to see if they could find a way to satisfy the legitimate health concerns.

She said while there will still be restrictions, she was confident there will be a positive resolution.

Ardern said the Health Minister will have more details before the end of the day.

The prime minister said tomorrow's Budget will be delivered in the most challenging economic conditions faced by any government since the Great Depression.

""The coming months and years will be some of the most challenging our country has faced in a very, very long time.""

She said around the world unemployment will rise significantly, businesses will fail and close, government revenue will decline, and this country will also feel the pain.

""New Zealand is about to enter a very tough winter, but every winter eventually is followed by spring, and if we make the right choices, we can get New Zealanders back to work, and our economy quickly moving again.""

She said the Budget will be the first step in recovery from Covid-19.

""We believe that, when times are hard, you don't cut - you invest.""

She said the government will strengthen the blanket of support it provides and investment will also focus on strengthening schools, hospitals, public houses, roads and railways.

""The notion that, in this time of need, we'd make cuts to essential services so many New Zealanders need more than ever is not only immoral, it's economically wrong.""

Ardern said it will be a ""jobs budget"".

""If anything, the last few months have shown us that, united, we are a formidable force and if we channel that energy into a goal, collectively, we are stronger for it."""
"New Yorkers in poll want mandated vaccines, regardless of family religious beliefs",https://www.syracuse.com/state/2019/03/new-yorkers-in-poll-want-mandated-vaccines-regardless-of-family-religious-beliefs.html,"Nearly 80 percent of New Yorkers in a new poll said vaccinations should be required for kids before they can go to school, regardless of family religious beliefs.

Support for required vaccinations is strong among Democrats, Republicans and independents, according to the latest Siena College poll. Over 75 percent of Republicans, 86 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents were in favor.

The latest poll was conducted earlier in March through telephone calls to 700 registered voters in New York. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

Vaccine exemptions for kids in school have made headlines in recent months as several parts of the country battle measles outbreaks.

Rockland County outside New York City has been dealing with a measles outbreak since last year. So far, the outbreak includes 147 confirmed cases.

The outbreaks have pushed some officials to take a second look at religious exemptions for vaccines. A new bill in the New York Legislature would allow minors to get vaccinated even if their parents object.

Others in states including Texas have been looking to make vaccine exemptions even easier to obtain.

Measles was largely eliminated in the U.S. after the vaccine was introduced in the 1960s, but some health officials are concerned about potential resurgence given growing opposition to vaccines among some.

The Siena poll also found broad support for making New York's property tax cap permanent.

""Making permanent the property tax cap has strong support from every party and every region,"" Siena pollster Steven Greenberg said in a news release.

Sixty percent of Republicans and independents favor a permanent cap as do 58 percent of Democrats, the poll found.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said a permanent tax cap is a must for this year's budget and the state Senate already passed a bill on the issue.

The Assembly has yet to act.

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Canadian offensive lineman Laurent Duvernay-Tardif won’t be helping Kansas City defend their Super Bowl title.

The 29-year-old from Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Que., became the first player to opt out of the upcoming NFL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic Friday. Kansas City’s starting right guard earned a medical degree from McGill University and has been working to fulfil his requirements to become a doctor in the off-season.

He has been on the front lines of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic this summer and said in a social media post that if he is going to take any health risks, it will be to help patients.

“This is one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make in my life but I must follow my convictions and do what I believe is right for me personally,” Duvernay-Tardif said in a message on Twitter. “This is why I have decided to take the Opt Out Option negotiated by the League and the NFLPA and officially opt out of the 2020 NFL season.

“Being on the frontline during this offseason has given me a different perspective on this pandemic and the stress it puts on individuals and our healthcare system. I cannot allow myself to potentially transmit the virus in our communities simply to play the sport that I love.”

The NFL and its players association agreed earlier Friday to an opt-out clause for the upcoming season. Those who choose to voluntarily will reportedly receive a US$150,000 stipend rather than their contractual salary while those with medical opt outs will receive $350,000.

The deadline to opt out is Aug. 3.

Duvernay-Tardif signed a four-year deal in February 2017. He recently renegotiated the contract and was scheduled to receive a base salary of US$2.75 million this season.

Kansas City welcomed rookies to training camp earlier this week, though most of their time was spent undergoing tests for COVID-19 and routine physicals. Veterans such as Duvernay-Tardif were expected to arrive in the coming days.

Kansas City drafted Duvernay-Tardif in the sixth round of the 2014 NFL draft out of McGill. He’s been a starter at right guard since 2015 and helped Kansas City win the Super Bowl last season, their second overall but first in 50 years.

Now, Kansas City will have to find a replacement for Duvernay-Tardif for the upcoming 2020 season."

Why Global Citizens Should Care

Equal rights for all people is vital to achieving the targets set by the UN Global Goals, including ending all forms of discrimination against marginalised and vulnerable groups, including people who are LGBTQ+. Join us here in taking action to support the Global Goals and achieve equality for all.

Botswana's High Court has decriminalised same-sex relationships in a unanimous ruling welcomed by the LGBTQ+ community in the southern African country and beyond.

Same-sex relationships were previously criminalised by the colonial-era section 164 of Botswana's penal code.

According to the code, same-sex relationships are “against the order of nature.” The code stated that homosexuality should be punishable by between two and seven years in prison.

Announcing his ruling on Tuesday, Justice Michael Leburu said discrimination has no place in Botswana.

“A democratic society is one that embraces tolerance, diversity, and open-mindedness,"" he said.

He added that continuing to criminalise sexuality and gender identity holds societies back from reaching their full potential, saying: “Societal inclusion is central to ending poverty and fostering shared prosperity.”

The ruling by Justice Leburu comes after Letsweletse Motshidiemang, a 21-year-old student at the University of Botswana, took on the law by bringing the case to court in March.

“I am in a sexually intimate relationship with a man. I have no doubt that this will be the case for the rest of my life. My friends, roommates at the University of Botswana have accepted me, even at the University of Botswana I feel free and accepted,” he said at the time.

“By virtue of one or more of these provisions of the law, I am prohibited from expressing the greatest emotion of love through the act of enjoying sexual intercourse with another consenting adult male that I am sexually attracted to and who is also sexually attracted to me, as consenting adults,” he said.

In many parts of the world, LGBTQ+ people are rejected, attacked, and discriminated against. In Africa, the discrimination is often fuelled by governments that continue to criminalise same-sex relationships.

At the moment, only 24 out of 54 countries in the continent recognise LGBTQ+ people’s right to exist and thrive. Meanwhile, last month, Milimani high court in Nairobi, Kenya, ruled against decriminalising same-sex relationships.

""This judgement can make a massive change for our lives. This is what excites me the most. The judgement means so much,” said Anna Mmolai-Chalmers, coordinator of at the LGBTQ rights group Legabibo.

Chantal Melanson was enjoying a night out with friends at a country bar when a stranger came over to chat.

It was day two of the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas. She was busy dancing with her girlfriends so she laughed at the man who introduced himself as Austin Monfort and kept enjoying herself.

She had no idea that just 24 hours later, that stranger would help to save her life during one of the worst mass shootings that has ever happened in America.

In the weeks that followed, they supported each other, despite Chantal being based in Canada and Austin in California, and soon fell in love, eventually having their legal wedding last November.

They were planning to return to Las Vegas for a huge wedding celebration this May with friends and family but it has been postponed due to coronavirus.

Chantal tells Metro.co.uk: ‘We’ve dealt with everything by focusing on the positive.

‘There was a reason we met when we did. We needed each other in this chaos.’

Chantal, now 29, only went to the festival because a friend called a few weeks before with a spare ticket.

She was able to get some time off work so travelled from Alberta, Canada to Las Vegas for the three day event from 29 September until 1 October 2017.

Austin, now 24, was at the event with a few of his friends celebrating his friend’s 21st birthday.

Their paths first crossed in Gilley’s – a famous country music bar – on the second night.

After being told off by Chantal for his lack of cowboy boots, Austin kept trying his luck and smiled at her across the dance floor.

Eventually they started chatting and dancing together and realised there was a spark.

Chantal says: ‘It just felt like we knew each other forever. We went to grab a bite after the bar and exchanged numbers.’

The next day, when Chantal’s friends wanted to go shopping, she decided to head to the festival early and messaged him to ask if he wanted to meet up.

Austin was there already. They made their way towards the stage and bumped into his friends so she decided to stay dancing and listening to the music together, even after her friends arrived.

Just after 10pm, Stephen Paddock opened fire on the crowd, shooting from his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel above the crowd, as Chantal and Austin and the rest of the 22,000 attendees watched Jason Aldean on stage.

Chantal says: ‘We thought it was fireworks at the beginning since all big concerts usually have some kind of fireworks, however when it wasn’t stopping, everyone dropped to the ground.

‘We were on the ground across from each other so we both were looking at each other. We stayed on the ground for a while and the shots were not stopping.

‘Austin’s friends parents told everyone to run to safety because the shots were non stop.

‘Everyone ran in different directions but Austin stayed with me and we ran together. We ran across the entire festival grounds stopping a few times to get shelter.’

Austin held onto her tightly and guided her out of the grounds to escape the gun fire.

58 people died in the crowd during the shooting and 869 people were injured. The perpetrator shot himself in his hotel room and was later found by police.

Luckily, Chantal, Austin and their friends escaped unharmed.

Chantal adds: ‘We eventually ran onto a side street and jumped into a taxi with a lady already in the car.

‘We were about to leave, when another lady was running towards us holding her leg and stomach – she had been shot.

‘We were all strangers at that point but tried to help one another and rush to the hospital. We stayed in the hospital overnight due to lockdown and Austin never left my side.

‘He held me throughout the night and kept me safe. After what we had just gone through, he was my safe place.’

The afternoon after the shooting Austin flew home to California but Chantal’s flight was the following day.

When they were both safely at home, they continued to FaceTime everyday and quickly fell in love.

Chantal says: ‘He was the only person I wanted to talk to. It just felt so right and safe talking to him after what we went through. He told me he would come visit me in Canada.

‘Six weeks later he made his promise! And we never spent more than six weeks apart either me going to California or him Canada.’

Being together hasn’t been easy for the pair due to immigration rules.

Chantal explains: ‘We had very important life conversations earlier on since we were from two different countries we had to figure out what life would be like if we stayed together and made this work.’

The proposal (Picture: @Tragedytolove)

Austin proposed on 8 March 2019 after 18 months together in Laguna Beach.

Chantal says: ‘Laguna has been our little getaway since our relationship started. We loved to escape to Laguna for a day or two and just soak all of it in, just me and him.

‘He brought me to our favourite beach and there was no one around. It was perfect.

‘His heart was beating out of his chest when he gave me a hug and he got down on one knee and proposed, followed by a beautiful three course meal.’

Their courthouse wedding day (Picture: @Tragedytolove)

Austin even wore cowboy boots on the beach, in a nod to their first conversation, and he pulled the ring out of one boot to ask the question.

After the proposal, they decided to apply for a K1 Visa, which means that the fiancé of a U.S. citizen can move to be with them but they must marry within 90 days.

After 10 months, in September 2019, the visa was finally granted.

It means that Chantal is unable to work in the U.S. until her green card is granted, but she was excited to get to live with Austin in San Diego.

‘We drove from Alberta Canada to San Diego, California. It was the most exciting road trip ever!’ Chantal says.

‘We had a courthouse wedding for our visa on 1 November as we had to get legally married within 90 days of me entering the country.

‘We made it very small but I still wanted a few pictures taken because it was still a very important day.’

Since then, the couple had been planning a huge wedding for family and friends in Las Vegas for 8 May this year, but sadly it has been postponed due to coronavirus.

‘It’s been a bit stressful as so much planning has gone into it with my whole family living in Canada and his California,’ Chantal adds.

‘However through it all we are just so grateful that we both get to be quarantined together and not in different countries!’

They plan to rearrange their wedding party and celebrate their remarkable love story when lockdown is over.

Fisherman performs C-section on dead shark and releases 98 pups into wild - 'It was a very overwhelming feeling when they started popping out',https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/dead-shark-c-section-pup-sevengill-fisherman-release-wild-a8302501.html,"A fisherman performed a caesarean section on a dead shark he accidentally caught and released 98 pups into the wild.

Mathew Orlov, 46, hooked the sevengill 8ft 8in shark off the coast of Barwon Heads in Victoria, Australia.

He said the female had been attacked by another shark and had died before he captured it, but noticed the stomach of the animal was moving.

Mr Orlov then cut open the dead shark to remove the pups, which took nine minutes.

Whether or not the sharks will survive without the mother is unknown.

“As soon as she was on the boat we saw the seven bite marks from another shark,"" he said.

“I could feel through the line when she was being attacked. As soon as we pulled it up I knew was mauled by another shark.

“When I saw the belly moving, instinct kicked in. I’ve never done anything like this before, but I’ve fishing long enough to know we needed to get the pups out as quickly as possible.

“It was a very overwhelming feeling when they started popping out, I got this adrenaline rush. I was just dumbfounded there was so many, we counted 98.”

Mr Orlov said he cooked and ate the dead shark.

“As a fisherman, I catch fish to eat. The meat from this shark fed lots of my family members,” he said.

“I love the ocean and respect they’re an important part of the ecosystem.

“I think the pups chance of survival are high – they swam off quite healthily.

“Some people online have said I should have just thrown it back, but they don’t understand how sharks work.”

Nearly extinct tigers found breeding in Thai jungle,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/29/nearly-extinct-tigers-found-breeding-in-thai-jungle,"Hopes rise for critically endangered big cats, with only 221 Indochinese tigers thought to remain in Thailand and Myanmar

This article is more than 3 years old

The critically endangered Indochinese tiger has been found to be breeding in a Thai jungle, providing hope for a subspecies whose total population may number only a couple of hundred.

Conservation authorities in Thailand, along with two international wildlife organisations, released photographs of new tiger cubs in the country’s east.

'Sightings' of extinct Tasmanian tiger prompt search in Queensland Read more

The images support a scientific survey that confirmed the existence of the world’s second breeding population. The other breeding ground is in the Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary in western Thailand.

The Department of National Parks of Thailand, the anti-trafficking group Freeland and Panthera, a wildcat conservation organisation, said only 221 Indochinese tigers were estimated to remain in just two Asian countries, Thailand and neighbouring Myanmar.

The group said it had been tracking the tiger population since 1999 and, for the first time last year, camera traps had photographed six cubs from four mothers.

“Poaching for the illegal wildlife trade stands as the gravest threat to the survival of the tiger, whose numbers in the wild have dwindled from 100,000 a century ago to 3,900 today,” the agencies said in a statement.

It noted the tigers’ “remarkable resilience given wildlife poaching and illegal rosewood logging” in the eastern jungle.

Indochinese tigers are smaller than the better-known Siberian or the Bengal subspecies, which is the most numerous with a total population estimated at 3,500.

Tigers, which once ranged across much of the region, are all but extinct in southern China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and much of Myanmar. Although there is no evidence of their medicinal effect, tiger bones are used in traditional Asian remedies such as “health tonics”.

Alan Rabinowitz, the chief executive officer of Panthera, said in a video call from New York that Thailand had “one of the best-protected and best tiger areas left in the world”.



“Thailand has shown that you can protect tigers and bring them back. They can do this now in the eastern forest complex as they have done in the western forest complex,” he added.

Panthera said on its website that only 8% of tiger sites had a confirmed breeding population, meaning the photos were “a huge – and rare – win”.

It said: “A breeding population here means that the future of this subspecies is less precarious and could potentially even expand – tigers here could disperse and repopulate Cambodia and Laos, where no breeding populations persist.”

India saying it will ban all single use plastics by 2022,https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/india-plastic-ban-single-use-2022-modi-pollution-w/,"First comes the leak, then comes the flood.

2018 will be remembered as the year the world waged war on plastic waste — and the revolution has just got serious.

India announced it will ban all single-use plastics by 2022 in the most important leap forward against plastic pollution to date.

Take Action: Call on Governments to Say 'No' to Single-Use Plastics

Prime Minister Modi delivered the bold plan on Tuesday, described by the Guardian as the “most ambitious” move yet against global plastic pollution.

India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, and home to 1.3 billion people. Approximately 15,342 tonnes of plastic waste are wasted by Indians every single day, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and about 60% of that is recycled — far higher than the global average of 14%.

The quest for material prosperity cant lead to environmental degradation. We must remember that an unclean environment hurts the poor and vulnerable the most. pic.twitter.com/yBX7q6IfQn — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 5, 2018

It comes just days after Tamil Nadu, a southern Indian state home to 72 million people, announced it will ban single-use plastics like polythene bags and bottles. That ban will come into force from next year, and will exclude some essential goods like milk, medicines, and oil, according to The Hindu.

It’s part of a wide series of reforms announced for World Environment Day on Tuesday, which India is hosting in 2018.

“The choices that we make today will define our collective future,” said Modi. “The choices may not be easy. But through awareness, technology, and a genuine global partnership, I am sure we can make the right choices. Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live.”

“Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable the most,” he continued. “It is the duty of each one of us to ensure that material prosperity does not compromise our environment.”

India also announced a campaign on marine litter, and a move to measure plastic in coastal waters, according to the Guardian. Prime Minister Modi also pledged to make 100 national monuments, including the Taj Mahal, litter-free.

If Modi can deliver on this promise to ""abolish all single-use plastics in India by 2022"", it will be a huge step forwards. It also makes @theresa_may's ""ambition"" to ""end avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042"" look ditheringly, dangerously slow. https://t.co/WVe8xXvqp3 — Robert Macfarlane (@RobGMacfarlane) June 6, 2018

On Tuesday the UN released their biggest ever report on plastic pollution. It confirmed that over 50 states were taking action on the issue, including total bans on plastic bags in Kenya and Rwanda. The report also revealed that the Galapagos is set to ban single-use plastics, Sri Lanka will ban styrofoam, and China will insist on biodegradable bags only.

However, the report concluded that far more still must be done to stop plastic entering oceans and rivers.

Approximately 380 million tonnes of plastic are created globally every year — and 8 million tonnes enter the ocean, putting sea life at risk. Remember the whale that died in Thailand after eating 80 plastic bags just last week? It’s the rule, not the exception.

The average plastic bag can take up to 1,000 years to break down — but Modi’s announcement proves that momentum towards tangible change can happen overnight. All it takes is political will — and as Al Gore once told Global Citizen, that is in itself a renewable resource.

Global Citizen campaigns to achieve the UN’s Global Goals, which include action on improving life on land and life below water, and on creating sustainable cities and communities. You can join us by taking action on these issues here."
"Lost apple found: 'Elusive' Colorado Orange apple, thought to be extinct, resurrected",https://nationalpost.com/life/food/lost-apple-found-elusive-colorado-orange-apple-thought-to-be-extinct-resurrected,"Article content continued

“After comparing the possible Colorado Orange apples to the watercolours, including cutting them open and comparing the insides, we had an added degree of confidence of having found what we were looking for,” the couple wrote in their newsletter. “If only we could match it to a known horticultural specimen. But how to do that if all were lost?”

They needed more proof, which ultimately came in the form of a wax apple collection from the early 1900s “sitting in boxes at a retiring professor’s office” at Colorado State University. Among the 83 replicas of ribbon-winning apples from horticultural fairs past — each logged and indexed — was the Colorado Orange. The shape and colour were a match. “We cannot taste or smell or cut it open for comparison, of course, but this may be as close as we get,” the couple wrote. “Now we are 98 per cent sure give or take three per cent we have found the elusive Colorado Orange apple.”

In order to reestablish the once-lost apple, the Schuenemeyers have since started growing their own trees, which they’ve given to several farmers in the state. “We are the beneficiaries of the gift given to us from 150 years ago,” Jude told CNN. “But, it does us no good to be the only persons growing (it). Our steps now are to get it out to the people.”

They’ve received such an extraordinary number of requests for the Colorado Orange, they recently announced they’re placing five trees up for auction. The first auction will end on Oct. 3 and the minimum bid is $100, including shipping within the U.S.; proceeds will fund MORP’s preservation work."

San Jose: Homeless people will be paid $15 an hour to pick up trash in ‘hotspots’,https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/10/25/san-jose-homeless-people-will-be-paid-15-an-hour-to-pick-up-trash/,"San Jose is home to some beautiful architecture and brilliant art, but also to freeway on-ramps and creek embankments that are littered with ugly trash and debris.

Now, the city is launching a new effort to clean up dirty parts of town, and it’ll help dozens of homeless people get back on their feet at the same time.

Starting in November, San Jose will pay more than 25 homeless residents at least $15 an hour to pick up trash at more than 40 “hotspots” around the city.

“We are working to transform lives,” Mayor Sam Liccardo said during a press conference at Downtown Streets Team’s San Jose office Thursday morning to announce the new program.

The organization, which works to end homelessness, and Goodwill will hire and manage the workers. Normandin Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram offered steep discounts on two trucks to support the effort. The ultimate goal is to help participants transition into full-time employment.

The litter hotspots identified stretch across the city, from Senter Road near Capitol Expressway to Willow Street under Highway 87 and Mabury Road near Interstate 680.

One of the hotspots that crews will patrol is around the Tully ballfields on Tully Road near Galveston Avenue, where Little League families have complained recently about an increasingly unsafe environment. A number of homeless people live near Coyote Creek, which runs alongside the ballfields, and the area is often strewn with litter.

Jonathan Fleming, president of the nearby Senter Monterey Neighborhood Association, said he’s “extremely excited” about the new program.

Fleming, who proposed a similar idea earlier this year as part of an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the City Council, said he thinks the program will give participants a sense of purpose. And he’s hopeful workers who clear debris from the area can talk with residents of the nearby encampments and encourage them to help keep the area clean by gathering their trash together rather than allowing it to litter the ground.

“I’m very optimistic and hopeful that it will help,” Fleming said.

In addition to helping beautify San Jose and giving the city’s homeless residents an opportunity to work, Liccardo said the program is an effort to “change the narrative.”

Too often, people see trash on roadsides or creek embankments and place blame solely on homeless people, the mayor said, when “the fact is, it comes from many sources.”

Christine Gonzalez, a domestic violence victim who lost her home after battling a drug addiction and spending years couch surfing, completed an application to participate in the program. Gonzalez said she’s been volunteering with Downtown Streets Team for several years — and receiving gift cards for basic necessities in return — but appreciates the opportunity to earn a paycheck.

Related Articles Map: San Jose’s 40 trash ‘hot spots’ “You don’t realize how hard it is to get back on your feet,” Gonzalez said. “It will give back confidence and self-esteem.”

The program will initially be funded through a $200,000 litter abatement grant approved by the City Council earlier this year, but there’s no set end date and officials would like to see the program continue.

“We want to see this pilot be successful,” said Chris Richardson, of Downtown Streets Team.

Trish Dorsey, vice president of mission services at Goodwill of Silicon Valley, said the program will create a supportive environment to help people transition back into working.

“Goodwill’s mission aligns perfectly with the mayor’s initiative by giving people a hand up versus a hand out,” Dorsey said.

Gerald Caison, who has also experienced homelessness, thinks the new program will help people build up a sense of integrity.

“What’s happening now,” Caison said, “it gives you hope.”"
The end of plastic? New plant-based bottles will degrade in a year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/16/the-end-of-plastic-new-plant-based-bottles-will-degrade-in-a-year?,"Beer and soft drinks could soon be sipped from “all-plant” bottles under new plans to turn sustainably grown crops into plastic in partnership with major beverage makers.

A biochemicals company in the Netherlands hopes to kickstart investment in a pioneering project that hopes to make plastics from plant sugars rather than fossil fuels.

The plans, devised by renewable chemicals company Avantium, have already won the support of beer-maker Carlsberg, which hopes to sell its pilsner in a cardboard bottle lined with an inner layer of plant plastic.

Avantium’s chief executive, Tom van Aken, says he hopes to greenlight a major investment in the world-leading bioplastics plant in the Netherlands by the end of the year. The project, which remains on track despite the coronavirus lockdown, is set to reveal partnerships with other food and drink companies later in the summer.

The project has the backing of Coca-Cola and Danone, which hope to secure the future of their bottled products by tackling the environmental damage caused by plastic pollution and a reliance on fossil fuels.

Globally around 300 million tonnes of plastic is made from fossil fuels every year, which is a major contributor to the climate crisis. Most of this is not recycled and contributes to the scourge of microplastics in the world’s oceans. Microplastics can take hundreds of years to decompose completely.

“This plastic has very attractive sustainability credentials because it uses no fossil fuels, and can be recycled – but would also degrade in nature much faster than normal plastics do,” says Van Aken.

Avantium’s plant plastic is designed to be resilient enough to contain carbonate drinks. Trials have shown that the plant plastic would decompose in one year using a composter, and a few years longer if left in normal outdoor conditions. But ideally, it should be recycled, said Van Aken.

The bio-refinery plans to break down sustainable plant sugars into simple chemical structures that can then be rearranged to form a new plant-based plastic – which could appear on supermarket shelves by 2023.

The path-finder project will initially make a modest 5,000 tonnes of plastic every year using sugars from corn, wheat or beets. However, Avantium expects its production to grow as demand for renewable plastics climbs.

In time, Avantium plans to use plant sugars from sustainable sourced biowaste so that the rise of plant plastic does not affect the global food supply chain."

Ex-Royal Marine and Iraq war hero is selling his medals to pay for four-year-old’s £200k treatment for rare cancer,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4287301/ex-royal-marine-selling-medals-to-pay-for-child-rare-cancer-treatment/,"A FORMER Royal Marine who served in the 2003 Iraq War is selling his war medals to help fund a four-year-old’s £200,000 cancer treatment.

Veteran Matthew Goodman, 35, read about little Lottie Woods-John's battle with neuroblastoma and decided to step in and help the family.

Despite never meeting Lottie, the married father-of-one, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, felt touched by her fight and listed his three service medals on eBay.

Matthew, a duty manager at a leisure centre, said: “When I came across Lottie’s campaign, I was heartbroken to read her battle against childhood cancer.

“Her prognosis means she has 85 per cent chance of relapse.

“As a father myself, I couldn’t imagine seeing my baby daughter, Freya, suffering like that and I knew I had to help in some way.

“My medals were just sitting in the drawer doing nothing, and I thought they could be used for something worthwhile.

“They were awarded for the sacrifices I made, but I’m happy to forgo that honour if it means helping a little girl in desperate need.”

Matthew, who served in the Royal Marines for five years, hopes to fetch the maximum amount for his medals to contribute towards Lottie’s fund for further treatment in the US.

In June 2016, Lottie's parents, Charlotte Woods, 36 and David John, 44, an events manager, received the crushing news that their little girl had cancer.

Initially they thought their daughter was suffering from a tummy bug after persistent vomiting.

But when her stomach started to swell, Lottie was rushed to A&E at St Peter’s Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey.

Sadly, doctors discovered a melon-sized tumour in her stomach and she was diagnosed with rare childhood cancer: neuroblastoma.

Less than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year, with most sufferers aged under five years old.

It recently claimed the life of Bradley Lowery who melted hearts during his five-year battle with the rare cancer.

Lottie’s parents were told their daughter had aggressive stage 4 cancer which had spread to her bones and bone marrow.

The youngster immediately underwent chemotherapy and, in October last year, had a 13-hour operation to remove 95 per cent of the 12cm tumour.

Now the tot is undergoing immunotherapy to zap the rest of the cancerous cells in her body, but desperately needs an innovative vaccine treatment available in America.

Charlotte, Lottie’s full time carer, who lives in Addlestone, Surrey, said: “Lottie has been given 20 per cent chance of surviving the next five years and there's an 85 per cent chance of the cancer returning.

“At the moment Lottie’s health is up and down. One minute she’ll be happily playing in the garden and the next, her temperature will spike and she’ll be rushed to hospital in an ambulance.

“We are living day to day and don’t know what the future holds.

“The vaccine treatment prevents the cancer from returning, so Lottie needs the cutting-edge treatment straight away, meaning we need the £200,000 imminently.

Charlotte, who has two other children, Georgia, 18 and Jack, 16, added: “When Matt contacted me to tell me he wanted to sell his medals to help towards treatment costs I was speechless.

“He risked his life for those medals and the fact that he’s not even met Lottie, but wants to help keep her alive is mind-blowing.

“I can’t thank him enough.”

Matthew, who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland, said: “Raising that amount of money is a monumental task.

""If people stand up and support families like Lottie’s then it makes all the difference.

“I hope to set a really nice example to my daughter when she grows up.

Canadian teen who pressured law-makers to create a more comprehensive suicide prevention plan awarded with a national award.,https://www.guelphtoday.com/local-news/noah-irvine-receives-national-award-for-his-effort-to-create-a-national-suicide-prevention-plan-785832,"Irvine accepted the Samara Canada Everyday Political Citizen Award Tuesday in Toronto

Noah Irvine didn’t intend on becoming the poster boy for mental illness and suicide prevention, but the Guelph teenager is promising to use his new-found notoriety to continue to press for change from all levels of government.

For Irvine, winning the Samara Canada Everyday Political Citizen Award is one more opportunity for him to push for the creation of a national suicide prevention plan and to advance the discussion on mental illness.

“I never wanted to use my parents’ deaths to get something in terms of recognition, I used it so people could understand what the actual face of mental illness and suicide is in Canada,” said Irvine.

He accepted the award Thursday in Toronto.

Irvine’s story went national this summer when he expressed his displeasure with the lack of response he received after writing letters to every member of parliament in Canada, challenging them to take action and address the country’s suicide crisis.

Since then, he has received a personal phone call from the Prime Minister of Canada, met with the federal Health Minister and received a standing ovation from the Ontario Legislature, to name just a few of his achievements.

Irvine doesn’t plan on going away or giving any of them a break.

“Out of all of this, what I have learned is, as much as the government will promise a lot, it’s up to us as Canadians to hold them accountable,” he said.

Irvine said his experience in engaging the conversation at the political level is an example of how democracy should work.

“Many politicians promise lots of things and then say they will get back to us, but it’s up to us to hold them accountable. I think I’ve done a pretty good job of that,” he said.

Last year, Jill Goodreau was teaching Irvine in her Grade 11 intro to Psychology, Sociology and Anthropology at GCVI in Guelph.

Knowing the history of his family, Goodreau suggested Irvine write a letter about his experiences.

In the letter, Irvine explained how he lost his mother to suicide when he was just five years old and about the loss of his father in 2015 to mental illness.

His father was 40 when he died and his mother was just 24 years of age at the time of her suicide.

“At the time the plan wasn’t to necessarily send it to anybody, but to write it and get a mark. He did his research and the letter came back well written and articulate,” said Goodreau.

She challenged him to actually send the letter off. It was Irvine’s idea to send it to every member of parliament across the country.

“I think by channelling his frustration into the letters, he took it beyond what my expectation was,” said Goodreau.

“It was just a pebble that he grew into a mountain,” she added.

Goodreau said the change she has witnessed in Irvine since has been incredible.

“He’s gone to speak at other schools about his experience. He was the kid that wouldn’t do any presentations in class. The confidence that it has built and the honouring of his parents has been truly remarkable,” she said.

Irvine said the experience of writing the letters has given him the encouragement to pursue a university education.

“I had never really considered post-secondary at all. I have a learning disability and it really affects every facet of how I learn and how I do in school.”

“It’s only because of this that I realize you may be labelled with something, but you can become more than that. I think I have proven it,” he said.

No final decision has been made, but Irvine is considering applying for a Political Science program or History.

“I am doing a lot more than I ever though I could without a high school diploma. How much could I do with one and with a university degree?” he said.

Irvine now lives with his grandparents and credits his entire family with supporting him while he has been dealing with the national spotlight.

“Obviously it’s not easy to see your brother or your sister on national television and knowing they are not around anymore, but some family have told me it’s good to know they didn’t die for nothing. Their deaths actually contributed to some form of change, some sort of conversation was started because of their deaths,” said Irvine.

Stories like Irvine’s — of students meeting and exceeding their expectations — is one of the reasons Goodreau said became a teacher and she said she is so proud of his decision to pursue a higher education.

“He has to go into politics. I have told him he has to be a political advocate for mental health. He has the skills to be able to do that,” she said.

Irvine was one of four winners in the under-30 category of the Samara Canada Everyday Political Citizen Award and, at age 17, this year’s youngest recipient.

Samara Canada is a charitable organization dedicated to reconnecting citizens to politics.

Kendall Anderson, managing director of Samara Canada, said Irvine is a prime example of an everyday political citizen.

“He took that personal issue and raised it to the political level. Not everybody who is going to be experiencing the things he experienced will be able to do that, so he is really giving a voice to the people who would be otherwise unheard,” said Anderson.

Irvine said it was an honour to have been nominated with such a group of politically-engaged young people.

“To be nominated and then to be picked among other people who are doing amazing things for this country — moving forward with issues they care about and wanting to do more in their communities — I think it’s excellent,” said Irvine.

He said the ceremony will give him an opportunity to meet other young people engaged in the political process.

Irvine also sees the ceremony as an opportunity to get his foot in the door in having face-to-face conversations with the senators expected to be in attendance.

Irvine has spoken with many members of parliament, but so far has met with very few members of the Red Chamber.

“When you’re unelected it’s hard to find you. They’re a little harder to get a hold of,” said Irvine.

A federal mental health secretariat would provide a spotlight focusing on mental health at the highest levels of government, said Irvine, and he would like to see mental health ministries created within provincial governments.

Goodreau said the fact Irvine sees the ceremony as an opportunity to continue to advance the conversation instead of simply accepting praise is one of the things that makes his story so compelling.

“He did not do this to pad a resume or get a course credit. This is very real for him,” she said."
Surgeons repair spina bifida in fetus for 1st time in Canada,http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/spina-bifida-repaired-in-utero-canada-1.4400782,"For the first time in Canada, a team of surgeons has successfully performed in-utero surgery to repair a form of spina bifida, two Toronto hospitals say.

On Tuesday morning, Mount Sinai Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) introduced Eiko Crisostomo, now almost three months old, and her parents at a news conference in Toronto.

Eiko, seen here in Mount Sinai Hospital's neonatal ICU, was delivered by caesarean section on Aug. 19 — more than two months after having surgery inside her mother's uterus. (Mount Sinai Hospital)

Eiko's parents, Romeo Crisostomo and Romeila Son, learned their baby had spina bifida at their 20-week ultrasound.

""Usually that's that time when you find out the gender,"" Son told reporters. ""We were very excited to finally have a girl after having four boys.""

But they were ""devastated"" to find out that their daughter would be born with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele, and would likely suffer brain damage and be in a wheelchair, she said. Son was especially worried her daughter would be in pain and exposed to repeated surgeries during her life.

Myelomeningocele affects about 120 to 150 babies in Canada every year, and occurs when the spinal column fails to close during fetal development.

The spinal cord comes out and is exposed to amniotic fluid, which becomes acidic, said Dr. Greg Ryan, head of Mount Sinai Hospital's neurosurgery team and one of two doctors who led Eiko's surgery.

Eiko was diagnosed with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele. Her spinal cord came out of the spinal column. This diagram shows what it looks like before and after in-utero surgery. (Mount Sinai Hospital )

The resulting damage to the spinal cord nervous system causes various degrees of paralysis. Many children need a permanent shunt to relieve pressure on their brains. According to Mount Sinai Hospital, fewer than half of children with spina bifida live independently when they become adults.

Son was determined to do whatever she could to help her baby and upon learning the in-utero procedure is performed in the U.S., was prepared to go.

But she met with doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital who had done in-utero surgeries before for other conditions, and they said they were prepared to offer it to her there.

""I wasn't scared,"" Son said on Tuesday. ""I had zero doubt and 100 per cent confidence.""

On June 4, a joint team of doctors and nurses from Mount Sinai and SickKids performed the surgery, when Eiko was at 25 weeks gestation. Her mother was given a general anesthetic, and the team inserted a needle through her abdomen to temporarily anesthetize and paralyze the fetus.

They then made incisions into the uterus to reach the fetus and close the skin over the spinal defect. The team also replaced amniotic fluid lost from the uterus during the procedure through a catheter — a critical step to keeping the fetus healthy.

More than two months later, on Aug. 19., Eiko was born by caesarean section.

Now almost three months old, Eiko's parents are hopeful about her future, as she smiled and wriggled in her father's arms while her mother spoke on Tuesday. At home, Eiko is ""doing very normal baby things,"" Son said.

""Right now, her brain is stable, her legs are moving and kicking as you can see,"" Son said. ""All of our prayers were answered. She's our little miracle.""

The in-utero surgery does not guarantee Eiko will not be affected by spina bifida, but research done in the U.S. shows it improves her chances.

According to a U.S. study published in 2011, provided by Mount Sinai Hospital, brain malformations were reduced by one-third; children were half as likely to need walking aids or wheelchairs, and the need for brain shunts was reduced by half.

Since Eiko's surgery in June, the hospitals said Tuesday they had done the procedure three more times.

Son said she is happy that the in-utero procedure is now available to parents ""on Canadian soil."""
98 yo WW2 veteran who contracted both Malaria and Cholera during forced labour at a Japanese POW Camp beats COVID19.,https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/war-veterans-amazing-recovery-coronavirus-18096499,"From sunrise to sunset, get the big stories in the Echo newsletter Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email

A 98-year-old war veteran who came down with coronavirus amazed hospital staff with the speed of his recovery from the potentially deadly disease.

The family of George Boag-Munroe feared the worst when he tested positive for Covid-19 while being treated for pneumonia at Aintree Hospital.

If that wasn't enough, only a few days before he had suffered a significant fall at home, injuring his head and splitting his elbow open.

But after two weeks in hospital, George, who was a Far Eastern prisoner-of-war during World War Two, was declared well enough to return home by doctors.

Proud grand-daughter Alison said: ""The nursing staff were amazed he recovered so quickly.

""Even before he was discharged, he was dressed and up and about. At one point he was mistaken for a visitor who had made it to the ward!

""He is still suffering slightly from his head injury and doesn't understand the full impact of the virus that he has recovered from.

""He is unsure what the fuss is about and I don't think he realises the severity of it.""

George, who will be 99 in November, grew up in Anfield and worked as a bike messenger around Liverpool before being conscripted into the Royal Army Ordinance Corps in 1939.

His amazing wartime record includes being taken prisoner by the Japanese in February 1942 after travelling to Singapore, and being held in prisoner of war camps both there and in Thailand.

He worked on the infamous Burma Railway, and suffered from many tropical diseases including malaria, beri beri, tropical ulcers and cholera.

George only narrowly avoided being in Nagasaki when the US dropped the atomic bomb on the city because the boat that was taking him there was torpedoed and sunk. He was taken back to Thailand instead.

Because of his long captivity, he'd been feared dead by his family back home in Liverpool. Once he returned home, he said he had no desire to travel again and only wanted to see Liverpool win the Northern League Cup that year.

George is typically modest about his wartime experiences and still attends St George's Hall Service of Remembrance every year on Remembrance Sunday. He was the front page image for the ECHO's coverage of the ceremony last year."

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban loaned the team plane to Mavs guard J.J. Barea so he could bring supplies to his native Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.

Tim MacMahon of ESPN passed along the news and noted Barea is scheduled to return Tuesday night with his mother and grandmother.

The 33-year-old Puerto Rican national team standout started a YouCaring crowdfunding effort after Hurricane Maria, which has already raised over $140,000 from 850 donors.

On Monday, Barea confirmed he finally reached his parents Sunday to confirm they were safe after an extended wait following the storm, per Eddie Sefko of the Dallas Morning News.

""They're OK,"" he said. ""But it's still rough there.""

Chandrika Narayan of CNN reported Maria left ""apocalyptic"" devastation in its wake, including ""flooding, crippled communications, decimated buildings"" and ongoing threats, led by the potential collapse of the Guajataca Dam.

Nicole Friedman of the Wall Street Journal noted the hurricane caused ""estimated $40 billion to $85 billion in insured losses,"" most of which occurred in Puerto Rico.

Barea, who was born in the municipality of Mayaguez, has helped lead the country to several medals during international competition, highlighted by a gold medal in the 2011 Pan American Games."
Denmark rids itself of foreign debt for first time in 183 years [X-post from /r/Europe],http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/denmark-rids-itself-of-foreign-debt-for-first-time-in-183-years-1.3017088,"A debt milestone for Denmark.

The country will pay off its last foreign currency loan worth $1.5 billion (€1.4 billion) on Monday – ridding itself of any FX debt obligations for the first time in at least 183 years.

Data from the Danish central bank shows the last time the central government was near paying off all its foreign currency loans was back in 1894 – when FX debt totalled less than 1 per cent of GDP.

The country first raised its foreign debt in 1757 when it issued a loan worth half a million rigsdaler from Germany and the Netherlands. Historically, Denmark has raised foreign currency debt to bulk up its FX reserves but vast amounts of currency intervention in recent years – designed to keep a lid on its krone peg with the euro – led Danish FX reserves to hit an all-time record back in 2015.

Swelled

“The central government has not needed to raise any loans in foreign currency, and the loans have been gradually repaid”, the central bank said on Monday.

The country’s foreign debt bill first swelled to finance the wars of the 19th century and later as the Danes embarked on deficit-financed spending in the 1980s but obligations have been steadily shrinking since the financial crisis.

Still, Denmark’s last FX repayment also does not mean the country is without any central government debt, only that it is all now denominated in krone.

Denmark’s overall debt-to-GDP ratio is one of the lowest among Europe’s major economies, standing at 38 per cent and is expected to fall to around 36 per cent in 2018 according to the European Commission.

By Jill Barshay

The Hechinger Report

Literacy experts have long known that reading to toddlers, even babies, can make a big difference in children’s reading abilities later in elementary school. But does simply giving away free books to low-income families with young children help with early reading? An analysis of 44 studies of book giveaway programs concludes that free stuff does work.

Three researchers from the Netherlands and Australia looked for all the high-quality studies they could find on book giveaway programs, which reach millions of children under 5 in North America and Europe, and focused on the ones that compared the early literacy of children who received books with those who didn’t. Despite the large number of studies that made the cut (44), only three giveaway programs were analyzed by all of them: Bookstart, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library and Reach Out and Read. (Multiple studies of the same program tested how the program worked with different kids and in different places.)

The three programs are quite different. Bookstart, a program that originated in the United Kingdom, gives only one or two free books on one or two occasions. Imagination Library, launched by American country music star Dolly Parton, mails a new book a month from birth to age 5. Reach Out and Read uses health professionals instead of the postal service; pediatricians and nurses hand out books out during regular checkups and are trained to tell parents that reading is important for cognitive development. At some health clinics, volunteers model effective book reading strategies for parents. Some of the programs give books to all families who want them regardless of income, but the studies mostly focused on low-income children — the intended target audience.

All three programs worked when measured by how much parents read to children and by how much kids’ early literacy skills improved. But the program that used healthcare professionals to give out the books and personally tell parents to read them achieved the largest literacy gains.

“Participation in any book giveaway program yielded a positive effect,” said Ingrid Willenberg, one of the researchers, by email. “[But] we found that programs like Reach Out and Read, that involve interaction with parents and provide guidance on how to read, showed a greater effect.”

Willenberg, a senior lecturer at Australian Catholic University, was one of the three authors of the meta-analysis, “Do Book Giveaway Programs Promote the Home Literacy Environment and Children’s Literacy-Related Behavior and Skills?” published in the journal Review of Educational Research in May 2020.

The number of free books, it turned out, didn’t matter. Bookstart, which gives away only a few, was just as effective as Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library which gives out 60 books to each child over five years. (Reach Out and Read distributes about 10 books to each child over the same period.) What this means is that the giveaway programs don’t need to build an entire library for each child to be successful. This compilation of research supports the theory that an age-appropriate book or two laying around the living room can be an effective nudge for the parent to read. “The book gift may entice caregivers to try shared book reading, which may then lead to the development of a regular book reading routine, especially when these incidental attempts are positive experiences for both the caregiver and the child,” the authors wrote.

Harvard education professor James Kim, a reading specialist, cautions against mailing out books without some sort of parent interaction.

“I would say that the most cost-effective and effective approach is not simply to give books to kids/families but to ensure that there is some form of support via contacts, tips on shared reading, and providing ongoing nudges/supports,” Kim told me via email. “Books are not a causal mechanism. Reading books and shared reading is the mechanism that leads to better skills. Books are just the resource that facilitates these literacy processes.”

And yet the authors of the book giveaway meta-analysis characterized the literacy benefits of simply giving away books as “impressive.” They noted that in a 2011 meta-analysis, more expensive family programs that involved parent guidance and training had a smaller literacy benefit than what they calculated for book giveaways. Eliminating human intermediaries also keeps costs low. Dolly Parton’s 60-book giveaway can cost as little as $126 per child over five years, the authors noted. A doctor’s or an educator’s time is much more expensive.

Given the cost-effectiveness of the hands-off approach, the researchers suggest expanding book giveaways to more countries, especially places like sub-Saharan Africa and Middle Eastern refugee camps where many children don’t have access to books. As Dolly Parton herself once wrote, “True love, so hard to find, it knows no boundaries.” The same might be said for reading.

5th grader saves choking classmate. He knew what to do by remembering a documentary he watched years ago. At first his parents said they thought he meant he saved a life when playing a video game.,http://wtvr.com/2018/02/19/thought-she-might-not-make-it-henrico-5th-grader-saves-choking-friend/,"HENRICO COUNTY, Va. – A fifth grader in Henrico has been hailed a hero for jumping into action when he saw a classmate choking at lunch; she was starting to turn colors and gasping for breath.

“I wasn`t really calm, my heart was racing I just knew I had to help her,” said Benjamin Ford.

Though he was nervous, school officials said the fifth grader had all the right moves. Benjamin said he knew what to do because he relied on information that he learned in a documentary a few years ago, which he watched with his mom.

Ben was recognized by Greenwood Elementary school administrators, who shared the story of his heroic intervention with the entire school.

His parents said they were super proud of how quickly he acted and are thankful he remembered the documentary.

“I felt like I had to hurry up and get to her,” Benjamin said. “…I thought in a couple more seconds she might not make it.”

“I got a lot of claps and I had a lot of fist bumps and they were really supportive when I walked down the hall,” Benjamin said.

At first his parents said they thought he meant he saved a life when playing a video game.

“Then we found out it was a real person we were shocked....it was awesome,” his mom said.

Benjamin got a big thank you and hug from his friend. He said his parents also picked him up the next day and let him pick out a video game and go to the Black Panther movie."

Woman tells police she had been beaten and held captive

(CNN) A UPS driver who spotted ""call 911"" scrawled on a package helped police free a woman who had been held captive in her own home and sexually assaulted, authorities said.

""He was a huge help,"" Franklin County Sheriff's Department Sgt. T.J. Wild told CNN affiliate KMOV

The driver called police after making a scheduled stop to pick up the package at a home in Robertsville, Missouri, on Tuesday. A SWAT team sent to the house in response to his call took 33-year-old James Tyler Jordan into custody, police said.

Jordan's wife told authorities that her husband had refused to let her leave, punched and slapped her, forced her to strip and sexually assaulted her, court documents state. She said he was holding a gun to her head and threatening to kill her, then himself, when the UPS driver arrived.

But once word of his sacking spread, he received an outpouring of support – including a flood of new job offers.

Lamar Austin worked for Salerno Protective Services, a private security group for college campuses and retail stores. He was in the middle of his 90-day trial period and was expected to be on call night and day.

But Mr Austin could not attend his weekend shift once his wife, Lindsay, went into labour – which lasted from Friday evening through Sunday morning, when Mr Austin received a text informing him he was “terminated”.

“Sometimes you lose something and you get something even better,” Mr Austin told the Concord Monitor, while with his wife and new son, Cainin – the first baby born in the state of New Hampshire in 2017.

When the local newspaper first reported the story of Mr Austin’s job loss, former town board member and paid family leave advocate Sara Persechino, launched a GoFundMe campaign for the family.

“I don’t think they should have to be worrying about financial issues right now; it should be a joyful time for them,” she said. “I don’t think anyone should ever have to choose between their family and their job.”

In addition to the public support, Mr Austin said he had received three job offers, as well as an apprenticeship from the local business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and from the labour union, AFL-CIO."

Little Grey and Little White will be released into the world’s first beluga whale sanctuary — a remote bay in Iceland — in early April after being flown 6,000 miles from captivity at Changfeng Ocean World in Shanghai. “This will be the world’s first sanctuary created to rehabilitate captive cetaceans such as whales and dolphins,” said a spokesman for Britain’s Sea Life Trust, which is behind the project.

It hopes that the sanctuary, on the island of Heimaey, will eventually become home to dozens more whales released from captivity.

Microsoft Japan's experiment with 3-day weekend boosts worker productivity by 40 percent,https://soranews24.com/2019/11/03/microsoft-japans-experiment-with-3-day-weekend-boosts-worker-productivity-by-40-percent/,"As it turns out, not squeezing employees dry like a sponge is maybe a good thing.

Japan has a reputation for not being so great when it comes to work-life balance. And it’s a reputation that makes sense, considering the country routinely scores toward the bottom when it comes to employee satisfaction around the developed world.

For decades this has been a known problem, usually resulting in companies having after-hours meetings to try and figure out how to reduce after-hours meetings, or just shrugging and declaring that “it can’t be helped.”

But some businesses are finally taking actual steps to address the problem. And one of them is probably the last company that many would expect: Microsoft Japan.

▼ A company that big might not seem like it would need to change anything, since people will always want to work there, so hearing they’re trying changes is exciting.

Last August, Microsoft Japan carried out a “Working Reform Project” called the Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019. For one month last August, the company implemented a three-day weekend every week, giving 2,300 employees every Friday off during the month. This “special paid vacation” did not come at the expense of any other vacation time.

And the results were pretty incredible!

First off, the reductions. Employees took 25.4 percent fewer days off during the month, printed 58.7 percent fewer pages, and used 23.1 percent less electricity in the office (since it was closed an extra day). All of these saved the company quite a bit of money.

Next, the increases. Productivity went up by a staggering 39.9 percent. That means even though the employees were at work for less time, more work was actually getting done!

▼ A chart showing the changes. The tweet reads: “It’s been proven! Let’s implement the three-day weekend everywhere right now!”

A lot of the increase in productivity is attributed to the changing of meetings. With only four days to get everything done for the week, many meetings were cut, shortened, or changed to virtual meetings instead of in-person.

And even though it should seem obvious, it’s also important to note that 92.1 percent of employees said that they liked the four day workweek at the end of the trial. Due to its success this year, Microsoft is planning on repeating it again next summer or perhaps at other times as well.

Here’s how Japanese netizens reacted:

“Here’s to hoping my boss reads about this.”

“So I guess me feeling like I’m ready to be done for the week by Wednesday is pretty natural.”

“Unfortunately, us Japanese people value ignoring efficiency and wasting time at work over actually being productive.”

“I mean, the people working at Microsoft are first-class employees. I bet they could get everything done in three days.”

“I’d love for this to be implemented more, but I feel like making it work at companies open all week could be difficult. They’d have to hire more workers to rotate through the days.”

“Yeah, Microsoft is different from regular businesses, so I don’t think this would work everywhere.”

While some of the commentors have a point that this kind of policy wouldn’t work for every type of job, one thing is for certain: humans are only capable of doing so much work in a week. Beyond a certain threshold, no matter the job, work isn’t going to be work anymore, it’s just going to be time-padding.

And considering that Japan’s overwork culture can be physically seen from the city streets, taking a chance on something like this and seeing how it goes seems like a far better idea than just sticking with the status quo.

"N.J. woman uses couponing to feed 30,000 people in need",http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2016/09/how_extreme_couponing_can_feed_30000_people_in_nee.html,"When she first learned about couponing, her eyes lit up.

Not because of the potential deals on her groceries. For New Jersey native Lauren Puryear, she realized that couponing was the tool she'd been looking for to bring thousands of meals to people in need.

She has set a goal of delivering 30,000 meals to people who are food insecure by her 30th birthday.

Puryear, 29, currently a Woodbridge, Virg. resident who is a mental health clinician, has been spending years of her time helping to feed the hungry.

It all began four years ago after the death of her grandmother, who had strongly instilled the importance of helping others.

To continue her grandmother's legacy, in 2012, she started an organization, For The Love of Others, which aims to assist people of all backgrounds ""through providing opportunities to enable them to live a purposeful life,"" according to its website.

Though she had been buying food in bulk from stores like Cosco and BJ's, or from online stores like eBay and Amazon, it wasn't enough. She wanted to reach more people.

So, when someone told her about couponing, she quickly realized she could use this old pastime to reach not hundreds, but tens of thousands of hungry people.

""I started couponing for food items like spaghetti, meatballs, and I was (often) able to get the items for free or for little to no money,"" she explained.

If done correctly, she said she can feed as many as 150 people on just $20, depending on the items.

""There are coupons in the Sunday paper, or online that you can print ... so I collect as many as I can, match them to the store and that is how I am able to get the items for free,"" she said.

Though it appears to be a meticulous process, she said once you get the hang of it, it is fairly easy, just requiring a bit of persistence and willingness.

But for Puryear, bringing meals to those in need remains her passion.

When she's not working at her job, the single mother of a five-year-old son toils at bringing meals to people in New Jersey, in Washington, D.C., in Baltimore, and beyond.

So far, she has delivered 5,000 meals. She's confident she will reach her goal by next year.

""It's probably the most exhilarating thing I could ever do in life,"" she said.

Puryear holds four degrees, including a bachelor's, two masters, and a Ph.D. in psychology.

But beyond those accomplishments, she said, ""The joy of helping other people does not compare to any other accomplishment in my life.""

But she also does not forget to pass along to her son what her grandmother had passed along to the rest of her family.

""It is very important to teach him to help other people,"" she said. ""The little things we take for granted, the food we throw away every day ... and if we just spread a little more love around, the world would be such a better place.""

For more information on For The Love Of Others, or to learn how to get involved, visit www.fortheloveofothers.net.

This story has been updated to correct Puryear's current hometown. She is a resident of Woodbridge, Virg.

"Syrian refugee opens restaurant in Tennessee, wins title of 'Nicest Place in America'",https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/inside-nicest-place-america-refugee-owned-falafel-shop/story?id=58414615,"Inside the 'Nicest Place in America,' a refugee-owned falafel shop in Tennessee ""We need to keep building bridges, we need to keep the American dream.""

A falafel restaurant opened by a Syrian refugee in Tennessee has become a pillar in his community, and a gathering place for people from all backgrounds and walks of life to come together over food.

Yassin's Falafel House in Knoxville was the winner of this year's Reader's Digest Nicest Place in America accolade.

""America is the winner. Knoxville is the winner. Tennessee is the winner,"" the restaurant's owner, Yassin Terou, told ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts after learning he won. ""It's not me.""

He continued, ""I think this is what makes us the winner, is the people in this country, not us.""

The sign posted at the entrance to Terou's restaurant reads: ""All sizes, all colors, all ages, all sexes, all cultures, all religions, all types, all beliefs, all people, safe here at Yassin’s Falafel House.""

Roberts paid a visit to the restaurant earlier this year, where she met with Terou, a refugee who fled war in his home country of Syria seven years ago.

Now the owner of two wildly popular falafel restaurants in Tennessee, Terou has become a local symbol of the American dream

He said he feels he ""had a second chance of life to be in United States.""

“I just want to tell the American people, you are a great people,"" Terou said on ""GMA."" ""Everybody loves you and we know you love everybody. We are going to keep this country great and we’re going to build it together.""

Terou recalls it was not always smooth sailing when he first arrived in America, though, in part because he wasn't able to speak English very well.

He said he learned how to ""handle hate with love.""

""When you love and give your love to people, you are stronger than one who gives hate,"" he added.

'When you love and give your love to people, you are stronger than one who give hate.'

Terou put Roberts to work in his kitchen, saying, ""today we are making heart-shaped falafel,"" and showing her how to properly make the mix and fry them.

His restaurant is more than just about food, Terou added.

""Yassin's Falafel House is about family, about love, about building community,"" he said. ""So we make sure when you get your food, you smile and feel love with it.""

Many of the employees in his shop are also refugees, Terou added.

""I want to say thank you to Yassin,"" employee Hunar Muhammed told ""GMA."" ""He give me a job ... he helped me a lot.""

Knoxville mayor Madeline Rogero said she feels the city has changed a lot in recent years, saying, ""New businesses like Yassin's have come in.""

""But also as a community, I think we're more welcoming,"" Rogero added.

Rogero said she believes Terou has ""really torn down people's perceptions"" of ""refugees, of Muslims,"" in the ""heart of Appalachia.""

Terou said his final message for those who hear his story is: ""We need to keep building bridges, we need to keep the American dream.""

'We need to keep building bridges, we need to keep the American dream.'

""This is in our hands,"" he added. ""And we need to transfer it in a better situation for the next generation."""

Tyler Perry To Pay Funeral Expenses For 8-Year-Old Girl Fatally Shot In Atlanta,https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/07/08/tyler-perry-pay-funeral-expenses-girl-shot-atlanta/5402326002/,"Tyler Perry to pay funeral expenses for 8-year-old girl fatally shot in Atlanta

Cydney Henderson | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption 8-year-old killed near Atlanta Wendy's where Rayshard Brooks was killed Police say 8-year-old Secoriea Turner was shot while in a car with her mom and an adult friend near the Wendy's where Rayshard Brooks was killed.

ATLANTA — Tyler Perry has offered to pay the funeral expenses for an 8-year-old girl who was fatally shot in Atlanta over the weekend, a representative for the actor and filmmaker confirmed Wednesday.

“I’m outraged today because I’d rather be paying for 8-year-old Secoriea Turner’s college than her funeral,” Perry said in a statement to People magazine. “When does this end?”

Secoriea was riding in a Jeep Cherokee with her mother and another adult on Saturday night when they encountered “a makeshift roadblock that was manned by numerous armed individuals,” Atlanta police Lt. Pete Malecki said. When the driver tried to go around the roadblock, shots were fired and the girl was hit, Malecki told reporters at a news conference Tuesday.

Police released a short video Tuesday of an armed man who they described as a person of interest in the girl’s shooting. Malecki said the video comes from a surveillance camera near where Secoriea was shot. It shows a Black man in a white shirt and dark pants carrying an AR-15 rifle with a tan stock and grip.

A reward of up to $20,000 has been offered for information leading to the arrest and indictment of a suspect in the case.

The girl was shot near the Wendy’s restaurant where a Black man, Rayshard Brooks, was killed by a white police officer June 12. The fast food outlet was later burned, and the area has since become a site for frequent demonstrations against police brutality.

Perry also paid for Brooks’ funeral last month.

"Football star DeAngelo Williams buys 53 mammograms for women to honor mom, who died of breast cancer",http://www.today.com/health/deangelo-williams-pays-53-mammograms-honor-mom-who-died-breast-t50306,"Former Pittsburgh Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams is still dedicated to fighting breast cancer.

The star running back, who played college football at the University of Memphis, started covering the cost of mammogram screening for women in 2015 through his nonprofit organization, The DeAngelo Williams Foundation.

Since then, the foundation has covered the cost of over 500 mammograms at hospitals located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Williams is a staunch supporter of breast cancer awareness. In 2014, his mother Sandra Hill died from breast cancer when she was just 53 years old. Williams also lost his four aunts to the disease, all before the age of 50.

This is dedicated to my mom, my aunts & women everywhere affected by Breast Cancer. I love you. #WeAreInThisTogetherhttps://t.co/bAwaanlfzV — DeAngelo Williams (@DeAngeloRB) October 11, 2015

Williams began sponsoring the free mammogram screening in honor of his mother through the ""53 Strong for Sandra"" program. At each event, the foundation sponsors mammograms for 53 women. The foundation eventually hopes to host a free mammogram screening event in every state.

""To be able to help all these women is amazing. This can be life-changing for these women,"" Williams said in a statement to TODAY recently. ""We are enabling them to get this care that no one should ever be denied or not have access to.""

""DeAngelo wants to ensure that no woman (or man) fights breast cancer alone,"" Risalyn Williams, his wife and executive director of The DeAngelo Williams Foundation, told TODAY via email.

Williams was key in leading a push in 2009 to allow NFL players to wear pink cleats throughout October, Breast Cancer Awareness month. At the time football fans were treated to fields of pink — pink headphones, pink cleats and pink pom poms — during October breast cancer awareness month. In 2015, Williams asked the NFL to allow him to wear pink on his uniform all year, but the league declined.

In recent years, the NFL's partnership with the American Cancer Society has broadened its focus to prevention and early detection of several cancers, including breast cancer, with the ""Crucial Catch"" program."
"While out for a jog, she discovered a baby buried alive. Twenty years later, they reunite",http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-baby-christian-20180516-story.html,"In 1998, a jogger found a newborn baby buried alive in the foothills of Altadena, his umbilical cord still attached. The baby, not more than a few hours old, hovered near death.

For decades, Azita Milanian would wonder what happened to the boy after he recovered at a Pasadena hospital and was put up for adoption. This week, 20 years to the date of when she found him, the two were reunited.

“I was waiting for you for 20 years,” a tearful Milanian said as she hugged Matthew Whitaker.

It was a reunion that came about in an unlikely way. The mother of one of Whitaker’s friends wrote into the KIIS FM radio station explaining Whitaker’s story and asking for a 23andMe DNA kit so he could learn more about his ancestry.

Whitaker agreed to take the test and have the results revealed during the “On Air with Ryan Seacrest” program. When one of the show’s producers, Patty Rodriguez, read a 1998 Los Angeles Times story of Milanian finding him, she decided to try to reunite them.

Ahead of the program’s taping Wednesday morning, Milanian waited anxiously in a nearby room, with a bag filled with clothes that she had brought for Whitaker. In the bag was a card, with an envelope reading, “Happy Birthday! Baby Christian Mountain Angel Mathew.”

When Milanian walked into the studio and saw Whitaker, she began to cry, sobbing into his shirt as he hugged her and called her an angel.

“Finally, all my dreams came true,” Milanian said. Many in the studio cried.

On the program, Milanian shared the story of how she found Whitaker on a Saturday night when she had been invited to go dancing, but decided instead to go running.

One of her dogs, Tango, had stopped to smell and scratch at the dirt on the trail. Milanian went to investigate and saw two feet coming out of the ground. At first she thought it was an animal, but then she heard the infant cry.

When she started digging, she found a baby wrapped in a blue towel. She lifted him onto her arm and began digging the dirt from his nose and mouth.

“Please don’t die,” she said to the baby. “I will never leave you. I love you.”

After she found him, Milanian called 911 but was disconnected several times before she finally flagged down a motorist, who contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

While she waited, Milanian said, she tried to comfort him.

“He grabbed my wrist and stopped crying,” Milanian said in a 1998 interview. “It was very emotional. What kind of sick human would do something like that? He still had his umbilical cord hanging from his stomach.”

When two sheriff’s deputies, Darren Harris and Joel Nebel, arrived, they found Milanian on her knees holding the boy. They checked the baby’s vital signs and immediately requested paramedics.

“They took the infant from me. They didn’t wait,” Harris said.

Whitaker’s body temperature had fallen to 80 degrees, and when he arrived at the hospital, he was immediately treated for severe hypothermia. Doctors think the baby’s size — he weighed 7 pounds, 12 ounces — enabled him to survive.

The baby made a remarkable recovery, and at the time, the neonatal medical director at Huntington Memorial Hospital called it “really almost a miracle.” Hospital nurses named him “Baby Christian” and people from around the state, and as far as Florida, sent in toys, gifts, clothes and monetary donations.

A few days later, Milanian went to see the baby, gazing with tears in her eyes as the infant lay sleeping on his belly in an incubator. She did not adopt him herself because she had been on the news and worried someone could easily find him.

Still, Milanian had hoped to maintain contact, and after her visit said she repeatedly reached out to child services to see Whitaker. Finally, after a year of attempts, she was told he had been adopted and she would not be able to see him.

“It was the most frustrating experience,” said Milanian, an Iranian-born American citizen.

After finding Whitaker, she was inspired to start Children of One Planet, a nonprofit organization that helps orphan children around the world. And as the years passed, she waited.

“I was hoping that he would find me, the same way we found each other that day,” Milanian said.

Authorities tried in vain to find the boy’s mother, combing the area with scent dogs and knocking on doors around the neighborhood looking for witnesses, according to a 1998 report from the Sheriff’s Department.

“We believe the mother may be a scared teenager or young adult that simply did not know what to do,” the Altadena Station stated in a flier requesting information on the mother’s identity.

Later that month, detectives received a call from a woman claiming to be the mother. She asked about the charges she might be facing before hanging up. Shortly after, the same woman called the hospital asking about the baby’s welfare, according to the report.

The L.A. County Board of Supervisors put forth a motion to offer a $5,000 reward for anyone who could identify the person who buried the baby.

“Fortunately, there is a happy ending to such a tragic beginning,” the board said in the motion. “A couple has committed to adopting Baby Christian and will care for him and love him as every child deserves to be loved.”

Whitaker grew up in the South Bay, never knowing the story of how he had been found. The only commemoration of that time lay in his middle name: Christian.

His father, who died a few years ago, was in the military and later worked in law enforcement. Whitaker’s mother worked in education and law and has always been fiercely protective of her son.

At volleyball games, the sport Whitaker has played most of his life, his mother was his greatest cheerleader.

Azita Milanian and Matthew Whitaker were reunited on Whitaker’s birthday — and 20 years from the day he was found: May 16, 1998. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times )

It was not until Whitaker was 17 that he learned from a family member that he had been adopted. A year ago, his godmother told the story of how he was found.

Though it surprised him, none of it changed the way he felt about his upbringing.

“I’m here today. I’ve lived a great life. I was adopted into a great family,” Whitaker said. “I couldn’t ask my parents for any more.”

Whitaker studied at Santa Monica and El Camino colleges and plans to study journalism at the University of Arizona. He dreams of becoming an entertainment lawyer or maybe an actor, and now he hopes to help Milanian with her nonprofit.

He doesn’t dwell on the person who left him.

Advertisement

“If this was your best idea, to leave me here, then thanks,” he said, “because you weren’t mentally fit to raise a child.”

The day they reunited, Milanian drove Whitaker to the hiking trail where she found him. As she walked with him, she called him by the name she knows best: Christian.

Whitaker stared through a chain-link fence at the spot. He grew quiet, serious — a change from the jokester he had been all day.

Back in the car, Milanian asked if he was OK.

“This could have been my grave,” Whitaker said.

Milanian sat next to him in the car and said softly, “You were wanted.”

Netherlands opens world's first plastic-free supermarket aisle as UK urged to follow example: 'For decades shoppers have been sold the lie that we can’t live without plastic in food and drink'.,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/plastic-planet-packaging-free-supermarket-ekoplaza-amsterdam-netherlands-recycling-pollution-a8232101.html,"A “world first” plastic-free supermarket aisle is being unveiled in Amsterdam, prompting calls from campaigners for retailers to roll them out in the UK.

More than 700 products will be available without plastic packaging in the aisle which is being set up in a new metro-sized pilot store of supermarket chain Ekoplaza in the Dutch city, including meat, rice, sauces, dairy, chocolate, cereals, fruit and vegetables.

Environmental campaign group A Plastic Planet, which came up with the idea, said the introduction of the world’s first plastic-free aisle was a “landmark moment” for the global fight against plastic pollution.

A Plastic Planet co-founder Sian Sutherland called for British supermarkets to follow Ekoplaza’s lead and introduce aisles without plastic packaging at the earliest opportunity.

The issue of plastics polluting the oceans, where they can harm and kill wildlife, has shot up the agenda after it was highlighted in the BBC’s flagship nature documentary series Blue Planet II.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Theresa May outlined measures to tackle plastic waste in her Government’s 25-year environment plan, including encouraging plastic-free supermarket aisles.

Iceland has pledged to go plastic-free on all its own-brand packaging by 2023.

And a survey for A Plastic Planet revealed last year that more than nine out of 10 British shoppers support the introduction of an aisle in supermarkets that has products free of plastic packaging.

In the Netherlands, Ekoplaza will roll out plastic-free aisles across its 74 branches by the end of this year.

The aisle will be used to test out new compostable bio-materials, as well as using traditional materials including glass, metal and cardboard, the scheme’s backers said.

And goods within the aisle will carry the Plastic Free Mark, a label introduced by A Plastic Planet to help shoppers easily identify products that are completely free of plastic packaging.

Ms Sutherland said: “The introduction of the world’s first plastic-free aisle represents a landmark moment for the global fight against plastic pollution.

“For decades shoppers have been sold the lie that we can’t live without plastic in food and drink. A plastic-free aisle dispels all that.

“There is absolutely no logic in wrapping something as fleeting as food in something as indestructible as plastic.

“Plastic food and drink packaging remains useful for a matter of days yet remains a destructive presence on the earth for centuries afterwards.

Toyota will replace burnt Tundra as a thank you to brave nurse,https://tiremeetsroad.com/2018/11/12/toyota-will-replace-burnt-tundra-as-a-thank-you-to-brave-nurse/,"Toyota certainly didn’t have to gift Nurse Allyn Pierce a new truck for his bravery but they’re doing it anyway.

If you’re a Californian, the past few days have been an absolute nightmare as people have been uprooted out of their homes as fires ravage their communities from all sides. But, with all tragedies, heroes are born and Nurse Allyn Pierce was definitely one of them. Even though his Toyota Tundra was literally burnt on all sides, Nurse Pierce drove his Tundra through the fire, back to his post where he and countless numbers of nurses, doctors, and medical professionals assisted those that were left behind in Paradise, Calif.

Nurse Allyn Pierce is OK, but, he lost his home and although his Toyota Tundra still runs and drives, the exterior suffered some serious fire damage.

To say thank you, Toyota USA is gifting him a new Toyota Tundra to replace the one he lost. Check out the amazing story on Twitter below!

Here’s the crazy story of just one of the many heroes in Paradise, the town destroyed by California’s deadliest fire ever. His name is Allyn Pierce, and he’s the badass nurse who drove this truck through the flames. pic.twitter.com/xAL7zRf34H — Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) November 13, 2018

Suddenly a bulldozer appeared & knocked a burning truck next to him out of the way. There was some room to maneuver. But instead of going forward toward safety, he turned around & drove back into the heart of Paradise. Here’s the aftermath of his Tacoma.

Some good news for Allyn: Looks like @Toyota is getting him a new truck. pic.twitter.com/r0gauofHuZ — Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) November 13, 2018

I can only imagine how Nurse Allyn Pierce felt as he thought his life was going to end, and then when he had the opportunity to save himself, decided to help others.

Reading dozens of stories of bravery these past few days I know most of these amazing people say, “I was just doing my job, I’m no hero, it’s what we do.” But on the contrary, they all are heroes the moment they risk their own life to save someone else. If that’s not the definition of a hero, I don’t know what is.

And to Toyota, thanks for being an outstanding example of a way to spread that little bit of good cheer in some truly depressing times. I know some people will say this is a publicity stunt and all but I say it’s setting an example of how other corporations can think of helping in their own way if they can.

If you’re inspired by this story and do want to give, the Pierce family did lose their house and are accepting donations through their GoFundMe below.

Hats off to you, Toyota."
Chelsea football club to send racist fans on Auschwitz trips instead of banning them,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/11/chelsea-to-send-racist-fans-auschwitz-instead-banning-orders-antisemitism,"• Roman Abramovich behind new approach to antisemitism • Fans will get chance to attend courses at concentration camp

Chelsea want to send racist supporters on trips to the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz instead of imposing banning orders.

The club’s owner, Roman Abramovich, who is Jewish, is at the forefront of the initiative, designed to tackle antisemitism among fans. Chelsea want to offer supporters caught being racist the chance to attend education courses at the second world war concentration camp in Poland instead of being banned from attending matches at the Premier League club.

“If you just ban people, you will never change their behaviour,” the Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, told the Sun. “This policy gives them the chance to realise what they have done, to make them want to behave better.

We thought antisemitism in football was long gone. How wrong we were | Anthony Clavane Read more

“In the past we would take them from the crowd and ban them, for up to three years. Now we say: ‘You did something wrong. You have the option. We can ban you or you can spend some time with our diversity officers, understanding what you did wrong.’”

Chelsea publicly criticised a number of their own fans for antisemitic chanting against rivals Tottenham in September 2017.

Buck said: “It is hard to act when a group of 50 or 100 people are chanting. That’s virtually impossible to deal with or try to drag them out of the stadium. But if we have individuals that we can identify, we can act.”

The club sent a delegation to Auschwitz for the annual March of the Living in April, while 150 staff and supporters went on a day trip in June to the site which once housed Nazi death camps while Poland was under German occupation.

Buck said: “The trips to Auschwitz were really important and effective and we will consider more as well as other things that will affect people.”

The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust is in favour of the plan, while the Football Supporters Federation’ also lent support. The campaigns and diversity manager, Anwar Uddin said: “The FSF have long advocated and promoted educational sessions with supporters found to have used discriminatory language. We completely agree with Bruce Buck that simply banning people doesn’t change behaviour or attitudes and applaud Chelsea for being one of the first Premier League clubs to so publicly advocate this approach and hope others follow their example.”

On Wednesday Chelsea previewed a new film at the Houses of Parliament aimed at raising awareness of the consequences of antisemitism, interspersing images of offensive chants and social media posts alongside images from the Holocaust. Buck told the club’s website: “We are just trying to make a dent in the antisemitism in this world. Over time we hope to make a real contribution for good to society.”

World's last male northern white rhino on the mend after infection threatened the species,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-08/worlds-last-male-northern-white-rhino-sudan-could-be-on-the-mend/9526632,"The world's last male northern white rhino is recovering from an infected leg that raised fears over the past week he might have to be put down, a veterinarian at a conservancy in Kenya says.

Sudan lives with the last two females of the same species in Ol Pejeta Conservancy, about 250 kilometres north of Nairobi.

After all attempts at getting him to mate naturally failed, conservationists last year put Sudan on dating app Tinder, hoping to raise enough money to pay for a $11.5 million fertility treatment.

The 45-year-old had spent most of the past two weeks lying in his pen due to discomfort from a deep wound on his right hind leg.

His keepers had wondered whether it might be time to put him down.

But Stephen Ngulu, Ol Pejeta's veterinarian, said they had managed to bring the infection under control with painkillers and antibiotics and Sudan had regained his healthy appetite.

""He is an animal that is showing the will to live,"" Mr Ngulu told Reuters at the conservancy, as he struggled to walk in his pen while his companions Najin, 27, Fatu, 17, played in the mud a short distance away.

While there are thousands of southern white rhinos still roaming the plains of sub-Saharan Africa, decades of rampant poaching have drastically cut numbers of northern whites.

Poachers can sell northern white rhino horns for $50,000 per kilo, making them more valuable than gold or cocaine.

Kenya, whose tourism sector is a huge source of foreign exchange, had 20,000 rhinos in the 1970s, falling to 400 in the 1990s.

It now has 650, almost all of which are black.

Scientists are now working to help Sudan reproduce via in-vitro fertilisation using eggs taken from Najin.

The embryo would be implanted in a surrogate southern white, Mr Ngulu said.

Reproductive experts from Kenya, Europe and South Africa hope to have designed a means of extracting the eggs from Najin by the end of this year, he said.

With the old male nearing the end of his life, Zachary Mutai, who has cared for him at Ol Pejeta for the past eight years, said the ravages of age were a source of sadness.

""Sudan is my great friend,"" he said.

""He's a very gentle rhino, people used to stroke him, people used to come very close to him, he's a very gentle one.""

"In the last five years, Kenya's poaching rates have dropped by 85% for rhinos and 78% for elephants",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/poachers-kenya-wildlife-death-penalty-capital-punishment-najib-balala-a8349966.html?utm_source=The+Crunch&utm_campaign=b053427571-THE_CRUNCH_55_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_aa18ea5b4e-b053427571-408697765,"This article has been updated, see note below.*

Wildlife poachers in Kenya will face the death penalty, the country’s tourism and wildlife minister has reportedly announced.

Najib Balala warned the tough new measure would be fast-tracked into law.

Existing deterrents against killing wild animals in the east African nation are insufficient, Mr Balala said, according to China’s Xinhua news agency.

So in an effort to conserve Kenya’s wildlife populations, poachers will reportedly face capital punishment once the new law is passed.

Kenya is home to a wide variety of treasured species in national parks and reserves, including lions, black rhinos, ostriches, hippos, buffalos, giraffe and zebra.

Last year in the country 69 elephants – out of a population of 34,000 - and nine rhinos – from a population of under 1,000 - were killed.

“We have in place the Wildlife Conservation Act that was enacted in 2013 and which fetches offenders a life sentence or a fine of US$200,000,” Mr Balala reportedly said. “However, this has not been deterrence enough to curb poaching, hence the proposed stiffer sentence.""

The move could put Kenya in conflict with the UN, which opposes the death penalty for all crimes worldwide.

UN General Assembly resolutions have called for a phasing-out of capital punishment, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights advocates its universal abolition.

Kenya’s tourism chiefs say poaching has been on a downward trend largely thanks to enhanced wildlife law-enforcement efforts and investment in conservation.

“These efforts led to an 85 per cent reduction in rhino poaching and a 78 per cent reduction in elephant poaching, respectively, in 2017 compared to when poaching was at its peak in 2013 and 2012 respectively,” the ministry said.

Nevertheless, earlier this month two black rhinos and a calf were poached at Meru national park.

And the losses are still extremely high, virtually cancelling out the overall population’s growth rate, according to the Save the Rhino organisation. The charity points out many other African nations also suffer high rates of poaching.

The report of plans for capital punishment prompted sharply diverging reactions, with some social-media users applauding Kenya and calling it “fantastic news”, and others insisting it should never happen.

Some said authorities should go after kingpin traffickers rather than the “smallest animals in the criminal food chain”.

For years, many people angry at high levels of poaching, linked with lucrative organised crime, have called for the death sentence as a deterrent.

Gangs sell elephant tusks for ivory in the far East, where it is turned into trinkets; rhino horn is believed by some wealthy buyers there to serve as a medicine – even though it is made of keratin, the same substance as human fingernails, so has no health-giving properties.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, reposted the Xinhua report, saying “#SeriousAboutWildlifeCrime”.

The Independent has contacted the Kenya Wildlife Service to confirm Mr Balala’s plans and is awaiting a response.

Richard Vigne, head of Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy that was home to Sudan, the world’s last male northern rhino which was put down in March, said the animal would be remembered for ever as a signal to the world. While Kenya was a global leader in conservation, there are still many species across the planet that faced a similar plight, he said."
Dolly Parton donates 100 millionth book to children,https://mashable.com/2018/02/27/dolly-parton-100-million-books-donation/,"Between rebuilding Tennessee and making my Spotify playlists so damn good, Dolly Parton has become the unofficial Queen of Good Works.

Today, the country music star heads to Washington to deliver her 100 millionth book donation from her Imagination Library to the Library of Congress. Founded by Parton, the Imagination Library sends free books to children from birth until their start of school, regardless of their parents' income.

Parton started the program in 1995. Less than 10 years later, Parton had donated a million books. After the singer launched operations in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, donations started running into the tens of millions.

Parton says her father's illiteracy initially inspired her to take action.

The singer, whose fan base is a mix of Republicans and Democrats, has studiously avoided politics. Parton has nonetheless gained notoriety for her extensive philanthropic efforts.

After fires destroyed homes in Tennessee in 2016, Dolly Parton's My People foundation gave more than $8 million to people affected. Survivors received an average of $10,000 from the charity Participants reported feeling grateful to receive money from the foundation without any stigma or strings attached.

"L.A. County to stop collecting old juvenile detention fees, erasing nearly $90 million of families' debt",http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-juvenile-fees-20181010-story.html,"Los Angeles County supervisors voted Tuesday to stop collecting fees once charged to families of juvenile delinquents for their incarceration, ending a practice decried by criminal justice advocates as an unfair tax on minorities and an ineffective means of rehabilitating young people who commit crimes.

The motion, sponsored by Supervisors Hilda Solis and Janice Hahn, directs the county’s Probation Department to stop accepting payment and cancel nearly $90 million in juvenile detention fees assessed before 2009, when the department suspended new fees but continued to collect payment of old ones.

The vote also follows a statewide ban, which took effect Jan. 1, on a range of court costs and fees charged to parents and guardians of children in the juvenile justice system.

Almost every state in the country allows youth or their families to be charged for costs of the youths’ detention, supervision or care while in custody, according to an analysis by the Juvenile Law Center, a public-interest law firm in Philadelphia.

Even after California’s ban, many counties are still collecting payment of previously assessed fees.

“The [state] legislation helps youth and families who haven’t yet experienced fines and fees, but without this kind of move at the county level, children and their families will still be struggling,” said Jessica Feierman, associate director of the Juvenile Law Center.

L.A. County’s move comes amid a national shift in thinking about criminal justice with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

“This is in the context of the post-Ferguson era where there’s a lot more attention to fines and fees in the criminal justice system in general,” Jeffrey Selbin, director of the Policy Advocacy Clinic at UC Berkeley School of Law, said in an interview ahead of the vote. The clinic has extensively studied the use of juvenile fees in California.

Supervisors said Tuesday that collection of the fees no longer makes sense.

“It is simply not worth the cost and effort to the county — and more importantly, not worth the cost to families — to continue with these collection payments,” Solis said.

Before 2009, L.A. County’s Probation Department regularly charged parents and guardians of juvenile delinquents fees for some of the costs associated with their child’s detention. At the time, the fee was $23.63 a day for juvenile halls and $11.94 a day for probation camps. Collection efforts included intercepting state tax refunds, putting liens on property and, in some cases, garnishing wages.

In 2009, in response to pressure from the Youth Justice Coalition and a Times investigation, the Probation Department placed a moratorium on the fees, though it continued to accept payments on pre-2009 bills.

Those payments amounted to just $120,000 in 2017, out of a total of $89 million in outstanding debt across 52,000 accounts, according to the department.

Research shows that juvenile detention fees impose financial hardships and strain on low-income families and weigh disproportionately on black and Latino youth who are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and are often sentenced to longer terms than white youth.

Alberto Penuelas, who served time as a juvenile, recalled the toll his detention fee took on his mother, a single parent who worked in the fields.

“They would call her every Saturday collecting these debts.… She could barely afford to feed us,” he told the board. “I’m hoping that this passes and this doesn’t happen to other families.”

Research also suggests the fees may increase recidivism. A study of more than 1,000 youth in Pennsylvania found that the total amount of fines, fees and/or restitution significantly increased the likelihood of recidivism within two years, even after controlling for demographics and case characteristics.

“The two main purposes of the juvenile justice system are to rehabilitate kids and to protect public safety, and it turns out these fees undermine both of those,” said Selbin of UC Berkeley.

Selbin said L.A. County’s action Tuesday is the largest discharge of such debt anywhere.

“We hope this will be a signal to other counties,” he said.

"Prison inmates are teaching testy dogs civility. There may be no better place for bite-prone animals to receive the constant care they need to break out of their own prisons. The men who train the animals learn responsibility, and acquire a skill they can use outside the prison walls.",http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/9/clallam-bay-inmates-reunite-with-reformed-dogs/,"CLALLAM BAY, Wash. (AP) - Prison inmates are teaching testy dogs civility at the Clallam Bay Corrections Center.

The dogs bounded into the visit room at the mixed-custody prison for a reunion with their inmate handlers.

It was the first reunion in the five years that the Sequim-based Welfare for Animals Guild has sponsored the dog-training program, which has given more than 200 canines a new leash on life, reported the Peninsula Daily News (https://bit.ly/2dK4KVE).

There may be no better place for bite-prone animals to receive the constant care they need to break out of their own prisons, say inmates, prison officials and WAG organizers.

It’s the perfect setting for dogs that need care 24/7 to let go of their fear and anger, Guild President Barbara Brabant of Sequim said.

The animals stay for weeks or months in the program - however long it takes for them to become whole, she said.

The men who train the animals learn responsibility, acquire a skill they can use outside the prison walls and see their loving touch take hold, said Clallam Bay resident Tanja Cain, prison offender program coordinator, and Correctional Unit Supervisor Michelle Klepps, who grew up in Clallam Bay and lives in Forks.

“This not only changes the dog, it changes the offenders in a positive way,” Klepps said.

Brabant said the animals that lit up the visit room were among the 156 adult dogs and 73 puppies whose lives were turned around by the men who call the mixed-custody facility home.

The inmates, about a dozen among the 900 at Clallam Bay, have trained daily over weeks or months - however long it takes - until the dogs pass an American Kennel Club obedience test.

The AKC will not certify inmates as dog trainers, but WAG is putting together a course under which they would be certified under WAG’s auspices upon leaving prison.

The animals sleep in the inmates’ cells and get taken on regular walks in a special prison yard where men hardened by circumstances and their own bad decisions dutifully scoop up their animals’ poop.

While in the training program, the dogs are tethered by leashes colored red for “don’t touch the animal,” yellow for “ask the handler first before petting” and green for “give the dog all the love you’ve got.”

Participants at the reunion included a dozen inmates who earned participation in the program through good behavior.

About 50 people attended, including about 35 WAG board and group members, and dog owners.

They were on the verge of giving up on their animals before the dogs adopted the inmates as their constant companions.

The dogs, accompanied by their owners, included Sky the Great Pyrenees Husky, Connor the boxer-husky and Skeeter the Chihuahua.

Skeeter was trained by Seattle resident Douglas Gallagher, 56, serving life in prison as a three-strike offender.

After Gallagher, whose third offense was robbery, took in Skeeter, he watched the tiny pup go through two days of seizures before the dog lost its fear, Gallagher said in an interview before testimonials from inmates and dog owners.

“Watching this dog reminded me of how helpless my victims were,” said Gallagher, who has rehabilitated 19 animals.

Gallagher trained another animal who was afraid of that dog toy of all dog toys - a Frisbee.

“Being in a correctional facility is unlike anything in the world,” Gallagher said.

“This has helped a lot in dealing with people, dealing with staff.”

William Friedrichs, 33, of Olympia, is serving 28 years for armed robbery, he said in an interview.

For him, the dog-training program is a path to a plateau he invoked more than once: redemption.

“I feel that through this program, I am being able to top the scales by doing so much more good,” Friedrichs said

“I’m finally creating positive stuff instead of just negative, destructive things.”

“It’s helped with my ability to communicate with others, and I’ve become more compassionate,” Friedrichs said.

“There are not a lot of jobs in here that have that.

“This is a very rewarding job in that sense.”

Most other prison jobs pay 30 cents to 42 cents an hour except for textiles-related correctional industries, where uniforms are made and inmates can earn up to $1.70 an hour.

Inmates in the dog-training program are paid 42 cents an hour, but the wages are capped at $55 a month for taking care of the dogs 24 hours a day.

Connor was an aggressive dog that Friedrichs said he identified with and who Brabant said “was totally not adoptable.”

It took Friedrichs three to four months to train the 85-pound animal.

“Not a bad dog, just an aggressive dog,” Friedrichs said.

“He didn’t want to fight, but it turned into a fight because he didn’t have a better way.

“I spent a lot of time to socially interact, and now he lives a full and happy life.”

Inmates can receive photos of the dogs they’ve trained after they have been returned to their owners.

Friedrichs has since seen photos of Connor playing on a beach, chasing birds, but the pictures inmates receive lack people for safety reasons, Brabant said.

Inmates don’t know where the dogs live, either.

That doesn’t faze Friedrichs, who is proud when he sees dogs he has trained living happy lives.

“You think, ‘Yeah, I did that,’” he said.

During testimonials, Friedrichs sat next to Connor’s owner, Kathy Schock of Sequim.

After Friedrichs’ tutelage, Connor “was a totally different dog,” Schock told the group.

“That’s all because of this guy here.”

Inmate Charles Graves, who trained Sky, has been in the program longer than any other inmate.

The dogs have been abandoned “just like a lot of other people,” he told the gathering.

“The dogs have taught me how to rediscover bonding again.

“I spend more time with these dogs than any person I have in my life.”

Graves recalled having a leashed dog at his side while talking to a friend over a prison phone.

Graves had to tell the dog to stop annoying him.

His friend asked who he was talking to.

“He said, ‘You got a dog? They let you have dogs in prison?’

“He said, ‘What kind of prison you in?’”

Inmate Alan Nord told the group that watching inmates and dogs interact has a positive effect on those observing their give-and-take.

“To see the dudes in this prison that are killers and whatever, they have a puppy, you see the tension in the day room drop dramatically,” he said.

Other state prisons also have dog-training programs, Brabant said, adding that Clallam Bay’s is more rigorous than others.

Cain said WAG volunteers visit every week, conduct training sessions and talk to the handlers.

Prison Superintendent Ronald Haynes said the program has a transformative impact on Clallam Bay’s inmates.

“It kind of takes them away from the prison life and gives them a purpose,” he said.

At the end of the presentation, WAG members, inmates and dog owners were urged to mingle - with a reminder that the setting for all this good cheer was a prison.

“No hugging, just handshakes,” Brabant told the gathering.

After the event the inmates, dressed in neat khaki pants and white T-shirts, returned to their daily lives while visitors waited for the locked visit-room door to open so they could collect keys and wallets secured in the waiting area near the entrance door.

The walkway outside led to an exit gate, past stacked, tubular bales of razor wire several feet away and a closer row of small signs that warned any inmates who could read the signs that if they strayed, lethal force awaited them.

Brabant said WAG and Center Valley Animal Rescue in Quilcene are starting a training program for cats that need to be socialized that’s modeled after the one for dogs.

She said three felines are already being leash- and clicker-trained at Clallam Bay by inmates in the prison’s restrictive closed-custody unit.

“There’s cat guys out there,” Brabant joked.

The UK has been powered without coal for three days in a row, setting a new record and underlining the polluting fuel’s rapid decline.

Coal has historically been at the cornerstone of the UK’s electricity mix, but last year saw the first 24-hour period that the the country ran without the fuel since the 19th century.

New records were broken last week when zero power came from coal for nearly 55 consecutive hours.

Scottish Power raises energy bills for nearly 1m households Read more

That milestone in turn was smashed on Monday afternoon and the UK passed the 72-hour mark at 10am on Tuesday. The coal-free run came to an end after 76 hours.

Without the fossil fuel, nearly a third of Britain’s electricity was supplied by gas, followed by windfarms and nuclear on around a quarter each.

The rest came from biomass burned at Drax power station in North Yorkshire, imports from France and the Netherlands, and solar power. Drax said it expected to go without coal on Tuesday.

The coal-free records are a reversal from the recent highs that coal plant owners experienced during the so-called “beast from the east” cold snap.

During cold weather in February and early March, demand for gas to use in heating pushed up the price of gas for power, which brought coal power stations online.

However, overall power demand is now much lower following the recent warm weather, making it easier for gas, renewables and nuclear to cover much of the UK’s needs.

National Grid has forecast electricity demand this summer will be lower than last year, with minimum demand at 17GW and peak at 33.7GW. Demand on Tuesday is expected to peak at about 35GW.

Experts said to expect more milestones this year. “Ever rising renewable capacity in the UK will see these records fall more and more frequently, clearly showing progress made over the past decade or two,” said Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.

However, one observer cautioned that the shift away from coal could be a “false dawn” if it was just replaced by gas.

Andrew Crossland, who tracks electricity generation on the MyGridGB site, said: “Shifting to gas is likely to make our electricity market more volatile as our energy price becomes increasingly locked to international gas markets. That will only hurt consumers.”

A carbon tax, the cheaper price of gas and the rise of renewables have all hit coal operators. The government has set a deadline of October 2025 for phasing out coal entirely.

Two coal plant owners have said they will shut this year, which will leave the UK with six coal power stations including Drax, which has hinted it will cease burning coal before the 2025 target."

Rapper 2 Chainz turns 'drugs den' into HIV clinic,http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/40518875/rapper-2-chainz-turns-drugs-den-into-hiv-clinic,"Rapper 2 Chainz turned his pink trap house into an HIV testing clinic over Independence Day weekend.

The Atlanta rapper took to Instagram to tell people about the the pop-up clinic and to ""come get tested and know your status"".

The house was originally used to promote his new album Pretty Girls like Trap Music, which was released in June.

It has since been used as a church and community centre, and has been welcomed by residents as a tourist attraction.

A trap house is a term for somewhere you go to buy drugs from a dealer - similar to a drugs den.

The HIV clinic was supported by the Fulton County Board of Health, and charities Atlanta AIDS and Test Atlanta.

In a caption on Instagram, 2 Chainz said: ""Inside the 'pink traphouse' something seldom shown, art, kids, music, good vibes, inspiration etc. The word trap is and was associated with a negative connotation.

""We will see after we get thru injected some cultural ideas the move the needle inch by inch"".

The pink house has also been used as a ""trap church,"" which involved many local groups coming together and urging the public to support organisations to help residents of the poorest neighbourhoods.

Portraits of famous musicians, like Tupac and the Weeknd, can also be bought at the house, and it also functions as a salon, offering nail and hair appointments to local residents.

(Photo: Coeo Labs/Twitter)

An Indian engineer whose low-cost neonatal breathing device has saved the lives of newborn babies across small towns of India, has won the 2019 Commonwealth Secretary-General's Innovation for Sustainable Development Award in London.

Nitesh Kumar Jangir, who created Saans as a breathing support device to tackle avoidable deaths of premature babies from respiratory distress syndrome due to a lack of immediate access to complex medical equipment, received his award in the People category alongside 14 other innovators from across the 53 member-countries of the Commonwealth.

""Our mission is to try and ensure that babies don't lose their lives due to the lack of access to a piece of technology,"" said Jangir, who was presented the award at a ceremony in London last week by Prince Harry the Youth Ambassador of the Commonwealth, and Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland.

""In countries like India, with erratic electricity supply and limited resources at public hospitals, this neonatal breathing support equipment can be used without any complex training. So, anyone, anywhere can use this device and deliver crucial support to premature babies,"" he explained.

""This award will go a long way in upscaling this device across the Commonwealth countries, for use in similar conditions in regions like Africa,"" he said.

It's a wonderful feeling when a doctor writes to you and tells you that your device saved the life of a neonate. Thank you, everyone, who is supporting our cause. @BIRAC_2012 @gatesfoundation @CCAMP_Bangalore @ficci_india @OlsonKristian1 @CAMTechMGH @AbhaySinghKr @MADevImpac pic.twitter.com/aXjJcytZIu Coeo Labs (@CoeoLabs) November 14, 2018

Who is Nitesh Kumar Jangir?

The Bangalore-based electronics engineer is the co-founder of Coeo Labs, a medical device company with a vision to prevent preventable deaths in the field of emergency and critical care.

Saans, which has been in circulation for the past three months across district hospitals of India that lack neonatal ICU facilities as well as at medical colleges, has been in development for four years.

It is the world's first neonatal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device that can be powered in multiple ways through direct source electricity, including a vehicle's electrical supply, a rechargeable battery, compressed gas, or even manual air pumping.

While this device is low-cost, at least three times cheaper than any other such machine, we had to ensure that it was of high quality.

About the Commonwealth Innovation Awards

""The response from every part of the Commonwealth has been phenomenal,"" said Abhik Sen, Head of Innovation and Partnerships at the Commonwealth Secretariat.

""By showcasing the contribution their innovations are making towards building a better world, these awards will help our hitherto unsung heroes win that crucial next round of support, mentoring and investment they need to scale up and fulfil their dreams,"" he said.

""Equally, these awards are intended to inspire the incredibly youthful population of Commonwealth countries to dream big and believe that no problem is too big to solve through innovation,"" he added.

India unveils $2.5 billion plan to electrify all households by end 2018,https://in.reuters.com/article/india-power/india-unveils-2-5-billion-plan-to-electrify-all-households-by-end-2018-idINKCN1C029S,"Men walk past electric pylons in Little Rann of Kutch in Gujarat March 2, 2014. REUTERS/Ahmad Masood/Files

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched a $2.5 billion project to electrify all of the country’s households by the end of 2018.

More than 40 million households - about a quarter of all in the country - are yet to be electrified and about 300 million of India’s 1.3 billion people are still not hooked up to the grid.

The states will need to complete the electrification by December 2018 and the government will identify those eligible for free electricity connections across the country.

“No fee will be charged for electricity connection in households of poor citizens,” Modi said at an event where he launched the project.

The project, which will be mostly funded by the federal government and run by the state-run Rural Electrification Corp Ltd, also aims to cut use of kerosene, the government said.

The pledge to provide power could face challenges as it remains difficult to provide electricity in remote towns and villages. The government said it would distribute solar power packs with a battery bank to un-electrified households in such areas.

Another challenge will be to fix finances of debt-laden power distribution companies in states that struggle to buy and supply electricity to consumers.

Ashok Khurana, director general of industry body Association of Power Producers, said the government must take steps to improve the financial health of such companies if the new programme is to be a success."

By News Staff

PALM CITY, Fla. — A retired firefighter-paramedic is giving away free naloxone to help fight the opioid epidemic.

WPTV reported that Luis Garcia is using his own savings to buy naloxone doses and hand them out to employees of local businesses that could potentially encounter a drug overdose.

According to the Daytona Beach News-Journal, Garcia has purchased 800 doses of naloxone to distribute across the state as part of his South Florida Opioid Crisis Mortality Reduction Project.

Not only does Garcia hand out the doses, he also gives a 90-minute CPR, AED and naloxone class to instruct the employees on how to respond to an overdose situation.

“I witnessed the AIDS crisis and the cocaine crisis. We’re going to find that the opioid pandemic in the USA will far exceed the number of deaths from all of that combined,” Garcia said. “Virtually all these deaths are preventable. Many would live to go into recovery if only someone was there to give them Narcan.”

Garcia also works to change the way addicts are viewed.

“I really believe every human life is worth saving,” he said. “Misconceptions and negative thinking about others makes it harder to fight this crisis.”

"'Miracle mum' donates 5,000 pints of breast milk to help premature babies and gay dads feed newborns",http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/miracle-mum-donates-5000-pints-10880072,"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbiz Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email

A miracle mum has donated 5,000 pints of her own breast milk to help premature babies and gay dads feed their newborns.

Elisabeth Anderson-Sierra, 29, spends an incredible 10 hours a day pumping around 1.75 gallons of milk - ten times the average woman.

Selfless Elizabeth has been diagnosed with hyperlactation syndrome, which means she produces masses more milk than what is considered a 'normal' amount.

But she still manages to squeeze in feeding time for her own six-month-old daughter Sophia, before generously giving the rest to those more needy than herself.

After donating the precious liquid to mums who struggle to breast feed, premature babies and gay dads, Elizabeth says she has fed thousands of babies.

Her milk is packaged, labelled and stored in four huge freezers in the house where she lives with the girls and her husband, public safety officer David Sierra, 52.

The former U.S. Coast Guard, of Beaverton, Oregon, says producing the ""liquid gold"" is her ""labor of love"".

Elizabeth, also mum to two-year-old Isabella, said: ""I realised I was an overproducer when I was pregnant with my first child, but when I had my second baby my supply ramped up.

""Now Sophia is six months old I pump five times a day - as soon as I wake up, after breakfast, after lunch, after dinner and again at midnight.

""I produce 70 to 80oz of milk during my first pump alone.

""In total I will spend around five hours a day just pumping and then with storing, labelling, sterilizing etcetera, I easily spent eight to ten hours.

""Pumping is not fun - it is uncomfortable and it hurts - but it is my labor of love.

""I've not had a day off in two-and-a-half years. It's more than a full-time job.

""It is instant gratification when I donate locally because I see the babies and I see them thriving.

""It will have helped thousands of children. The milk at the milk bank goes to micro pre-emies, so 1oz can feed three or four babies.

""I don't discriminate - I have donated to gay couples and to mothers who are on medication or had their breast removed due to breast cancer.

""It's an amazing feeling.""

Elisabeth usually breastfeeds at home but will also pump discretely in restaurants, while driving and in other public spaces.

Around half of her milk is picked up from her house by local moms or couples who often choose to compensate her for her time.

The other half is donated to California milk bank Prolacta Bioscience.

Elisabeth is paid $1, around 76p, an ounce by the company to cover her time but does not profit.

She spends the money on the equipment, storage and extra food she needs to produce.

The devoted mom said: ""Donating has been a massive part of my life for the past few years.

""When I first started it was very very hard, mostly because there is really no price on it and all the blood sweat and tears that go into making it.

""It was like giving away a portion of the paintings on the Sistine Chapel... priceless and hours of work.

""There was also fear. What if I gave away all my milk and something happened to me to where I then dried up and couldn't feed my own baby?

""I'd hear horror stories about that happening to mothers all the time! I'd then be the one in the position that I'd be desperate to find donor milk.

""I eventually got over it, and kept donating everything I had on hand.

""It makes me feel like I am giving back to my community and I'm participating in humanity.

""I would encourage other mums to reach out to their own community and consider donating.

""Breastmilk is like liquid gold - it should never be thrown away. And there is a high need for it out there."""

Vijender Singh beat Zulpikar Maimaitiali on points on Saturday to retain his WBO Asia Pacific super middleweight title and take his opponent’s WBO Oriental super middleweight belt.

Chinese and Indian troops face off in Bhutan border dispute Read more

After the unanimous verdict in Mumbai, Singh hugged Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan and other celebrities before returning to the ring, taking the microphone and saying: “I don’t want this title. I will give it back to Zulpikar.”

He added: “I don’t want tension on the border. It’s a message of peace. That’s important.”

The gesture follows a stand-off in a remote frontier region beside the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan that has become increasingly tense. On Thursday, China demanded India immediately remove troops from the border, accusing it of building up troops and repairing roads along its side of the border next to the Indian state of Sikkim.

The neighbours share a 3,500km frontier, large parts of which are disputed. Indian officials say about 300 soldiers from either side are facing each other about 150 metres (yards) apart on the plateau.

The current standoff began on 16 June when a column of Chinese troops accompanied by construction vehicles and road-building equipment began moving south into what Bhutan considers its territory.

Bhutan, a small kingdom with close military and economic ties to India, requested assistance from Delhi, which sent forces to resist the Chinese advance.

To avoid escalation, frontline troops in the area do not generally carry weapons, and the Chinese and Indian troops reportedly clashed by “jostling”: bumping chests, without punching or kicking, in order to force the other side backwards.

At the heart of the dispute are different interpretations of where the “trijunction” – the point where the three countries’ borders meet – precisely lies. China argues its territory extends south to an area called Gamochen, while India says Chinese control ends at Batanga La, further to the north.

About 3,000 troops from both countries are reportedly stationed near Doka La , an area initial media reports said was about 15km from Gamochen, but which satellite imagery shows could be as close as two to three kilometres away.

"San Francisco 49ers' Richard Sherman clears over $27,000 in schools' cafeteria debt",https://abcnews.go.com/US/super-bowl-champion-richard-sherman-clears-27000-schools/story?id=67370302,"San Francisco 49ers' Richard Sherman clears over $27,000 in schools' cafeteria debt Super Bowl champion Richard Sherman pays off the lunch debt for schools.

The day after the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) named Sherman as the Week 11 Community MVP, he handed the principal of Cabrillo Middle School in Santa Clara, California, a ""personal check"" for $7,491.27 to clear the cafeteria's outstanding bill.

Sherman was given the honor by the NFLPA on Nov. 22 for his charity work through his two organizations -- Richard Sherman Family Foundation and Blanket Coverage Foundation.

Principal Stan Garber posted the news on the school's website on Tuesday along with a photograph he took posing with Sherman. ""Richard’s gesture created such goodwill for the 49ers that they went on to sack Aaron Roger’s and the Green Bay Packers the next day on national TV by a score of 37-8,"" wrote Garber. ""Go 49ers, Go Richard Sherman.""

""It's the most generous thing to happen for these kids, there's plenty in need and he didn't neglect them, it was the perfect way to give back and help them,"" Garber told ABC News on Thursday about the 60 students that will benefit from Sherman's contribution. ""It was the kindest most generous gesture.""

Garber said the middle school is the closest to Levi's Stadium and praises the 49ers organization for continuing to give back to the community since their arrival to town five years ago.

This wasn't the only school that had their debt cleared by Sherman.

Last month, Sherman wrote a check for over $20,000 to the Tacoma Public Schools in Tacoma, Washington, to relieve their student's lunch debt, according to a press release issued by NFLPA.

Since 2013, Sherman has raised $1.5 million and ""helped more than 70,000 people in carrying out their mission of providing students in low-income communities with school supplies and clothing so they can more adequately achieve their goals,"" wrote Brandon Parker, NFLPA's communications manager.

Request for comment from Sherman's representatives were not immediately returned."

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (WPVI) -- A Good Samaritan was honored in Atlantic City for helping to make peace between two teenagers, who were literally in the middle of a street fight.The video of Ibn Ali Miller encouraging the young men to talk and shake hands has been seen around the world on social media, and Wednesday it got the attention of city council members.While many people were praising him for breaking up a fight, he used his moment in the spotlight to honor someone else - his mother.""People get 15 minutes of fame a lot, and I would like to use every second of the 15 minutes to send gratitude to my mother,"" said Miller.Choking back tears, he gave credit to his mother during Wednesday night's council meeting.The actions of the 26-year-old, caught on camera, were seen more than 28 million times on Facebook.Actions he says are a reflection of how his mom, Sabrina Winters, raised him.""When we were young, she'd put pretzel sticks across the table. She said those pretzel sticks are the right path, and the rest of the table is the wrong path, and that it's very, very difficult to stay on the right path,"" said Miller.""One thing I always told them in making decisions is think about the best thing that can happen and worst thing that can happen, because either side has consequences,"" said Winters.Praise also came from basketball superstar Lebron James and new Philadelphia Eagle Torrey Smith.The two teens in the video - Sheldon Ward and Jamar Mobley - also thanked Miller for stopping their brawl.""A couple days ago,I was thinking it was cool to fight in front of my friends or I need this fame, but it really doesn't mean nothing at all, so I want to say thank you again,"" said Mobley.""I hope that this is something that will influence people to do more character building, because that's what these young kids need, they need character building,"" said Miller.------"

Saudi Women Are One Step Closer To Getting Their Passports

Female members from the Saudi royal family were also on hand to take part in panel discussions, with Princess Al-Jawhara bint Fahad Al-Saud hosting a discussion on women’s roles in education.

Princess Adila bint Abdullah Al-Saud, a known advocate of women’s right to drive, women’s health awareness and women’s legal rights, held a talk about the kingdom’s heritage.

Princess Reema bint Bandar bin Sultan, the president’s undersecretary for the female section at the General Authority for Sports, spoke on the importance of sports in the lives of Saudi women.

The event saw activities for women only, but families were welcome to attend outdoor activities for the younger ones.

Mohammed Al Saif, general supervisor of the King Fahd Cultural Centre, told Arab News that Saudi Arabia wants to “celebrate the Saudi woman and her successful role, and remind people of her achievements in education, culture, medicine, literature and other areas”.

While women’s rights are a controversial topic in Saudi Arabia, Al Saif mentioned that there were no attempts to stop the event by any party.

Al Saif expressed his gratitude for the “heartwarming support and encouragement”.

Changes are already being made

The conservative nation looks set to undergo several reforms as part of Vision 2030, its post-oil economy plans.

Indeed, some changes have already been made in the field of women’s rights, with a ban on women voting or taking part in elections lifted in 2015, and in 2016 the strict religious police were stripped of their power to stop, question, pursue or arrest people.

The hope is to make the region a more modern, tourist-friendly destination by 2030, and subsequently there have been several calls from prominent figures to lift the controversial driving ban.

There have also been requests to lift strict labour laws, along with a landmark petition asking the government to do away with the male guardianship law.

The government also have plans to increase the percentage of women in the nation’s workforce from 23 per cent to 28 per cent by 2020.

Stray dog who visited car dealership every day gets adopted and lands dream job as a greeter at the dealership,https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/stray-dog-who-visited-car-22504347,"Sign up to FREE email alerts from Daily Star - Weekly #TeamDog Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Invalid Email

Persistence has paid off for a stray dog who refused to stop turning up to a car dealership – after he was adopted and simultaneously landed his dream job.

The lonely pooch kept going to a Hyundai Prime branch in Brazil, and after staff fell in love with him they decided to adopt him and put him to work.

Newly-named Tucson Prime is now in charge of meeting and greeting customers to the dealership, and he couldn't be happier.

According to Bored Panda, one night when it was particularly rainy, manager Emerson Mariano invited the pooch inside and let him have some food and water.

But he kept coming back after that, so staff at the dealership adopted him.

Tucson Prime's 'very caring and docile nature' gave managers an idea and now he's a fully-fledged employee.

Emerson Mariano told media outlet Top Motors Brazil: ""After all, the company has always been pet friendly, so now, we decided to embrace this idea in practice too, having our own pet precisely at a more complicated time like this with so many abandoned animals.""

Tucson Prime has also become a star on Instagram, and already has more than 108,000 followers.

A recent post on the account said: ""Today my day started early, but it was not in sales, I am trying to read and answer the thousands, I swear, miles of messages I received in the last few days.

""But where I came from, I didn't have this technology. Me and my humans are still trying to find a way to deal with so much love and affection like that. If I didn't open your message or answered, I wanted to apologise, but we are trying our best to open all messages to try to thank you all, I am very happy with all this!"""

German company Bosch produces 95% accurate test with testing time under 2.5 hours and no laboratory required,https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/digitec/coronavirus-pandemie-bosch-erfindet-eigenen-covid-19-schnelltest-16697237.html,"Schneller und sicherer auf das Virus testen – der deutsche Traditionskonzern Bosch will mit einem neuen, vielversprechenden Angebot auf den Markt.

Der Autozulieferer Bosch hat auch eine kleine Sparte Medizintechnik, und von dort kommt eine überraschende Nachricht: Bosch hat einen Schnelltest für Corona-Infektionen entwickelt. Innerhalb von zweieinhalb Stunden kann damit eine Infektion festgestellt werden, und zwar direkt vor Ort, ohne Transportwege, die Zeit und Geld kosten.

„Mit dem Covid-19-Schnelltest wollen wir einen Beitrag zur möglichst raschen Eindämmung der Corona-Pandemie leisten. Infizierte Patienten können schneller identifiziert und isoliert werden“, sagt der Bosch-Vorstandsvorsitzende Volkmar Denner: „Im Kampf gegen das Virus ist Zeit einer der entscheidenden Faktoren. Eine zuverlässige, schnelle Diagnose direkt vor Ort ohne Umwege – das ist der große Vorteil unserer Lösung.“ (Lesen Sie hier ein exklusives Interview mit dem Bosch-Vorstandsvorsitzenden zum neuen Schnelltest.)

Während Schnelltests auf Corona-Infektionen bisher im Ruf stehen, sehr ungenau zu sein, ist bei Bosch davon die Rede, dass in diversen Labortests Ergebnisse mit einer Genauigkeit von mehr als 95 Prozent erzielt worden seien. „Der Schnelltest erfüllt die Qualitätsstandards der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO“, heißt es in einer Mitteilung von Bosch.

Die Probe wird mittels Abstrich-Tupfer aus Nase oder Rachen entnommen und in eine Kartusche gegeben, die schon alle für den Test erforderlichen Reagenzien enthält. Diese Kartusche wird sofort in das Analyse-Gerät eingeführt, das nach Bosch-Angaben so anwenderfreundlich gestaltet ist, dass kein besonders geschultes Personal notwendig ist.

Innerhalb von 24 Stunden könnten bis zu zehn Tests pro Gerät durchführt werden. Von den Analysegeräten gibt es bisher einige Dutzend in verschiedenen Laboren und im Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus in Stuttgart. Für die Produktion der Geräte stehen Kapazitäten bei Bosch am Medizintechnik-Standort in Waiblingen zur Verfügung, heißt es.

Der neue Test wird ab April zunächst in Deutschland erhältlich sein. Bosch prüfe aktuell, wie es Ärzte und Pflegepersonal in medizinischen Einrichtungen unterstützen kann, damit diese sich zeitnah testen lassen können, um möglichst lange einsatzfähig zu bleiben, heißt es in der Mitteilung des Stuttgarter Konzerns.

Das Besondere des Tests ist, dass mit derselben Probe neben Covid-19 auch noch neun weitere Atemwegserkrankungen wie Influenza A und B untersucht werden. „Durch die Differenzial-Diagnostik ersparen sich die Ärzte zusätzlich die Zeit für weitere Tests, erhalten rasch eine fundierte Diagnose und können daraus schneller eine geeignete Therapie einleiten“, wird Marc Meier, Geschäftsführer der Bosch Healthcare Solutions GmbH in der Mitteilung zitiert. Bosch hat bei der Entwicklung des Schnelltests mit dem nordirischen Medizintechnik-Unternehmen Randox Laboratories Ltd. kooperiert.

Bei den Kosten für Geräte und Tests sieht sich Bosch in etwa auf dem Niveau anderer Tests. Demnach kostet jede Kartusche (und damit jeder Test) einen hohen zweistelligen Eurobetrag, jedes Analysegerät einen niedrigen fünfstelligen Betrag."
People are quitting their boring day jobs and finding success hosting podcasts with zero broadcast experience.,http://tampabay.com/arts-entertainment/want-to-quit-your-job-and-start-a-true-crime-podcast-obscuras-host-did-it-20190703/,"VALRICO — It was a Monday afternoon in the Tampa suburbs, all cul-de-sacs and overturned tricycles baking in the sun. In the two-car garage of the three-bedroom house with the tree swing, there was talk of murder.

Justin Drown, host of Obscura: A True Crime Podcast, keeps it cold as a morgue in there. The garage is a converted family room with a couch, a TV and scattered kids toys. It's where Drown, 30, records and edits each episode of his show, looking back at an often grisly, real-life crime.

Drown has recounted infamous cases such as the murder of Ennis Cosby, and Gary Ridgeway, the ""Green River Killer,"" but focuses mostly on the obscure. A recent episode told the tale of Gertrude Baniszewski, the ""skeleton lady"" who took in a teenager in 1960s Indianapolis before enlisting her own children and some neighborhood kids in the girl's torture.

Sitting on Drown's desk was a microphone and an autopsy report for Iana Kasian, a lawyer and model scalped by her graphic novelist fiance (Episode 37, the West Hollywood Vampire). There was a book titled Profitable Podcasting and stickers featuring Obscura's logo, a yawning skull with crime scene tape threaded through its teeth. Drown sends the stickers, and occasionally one of those autopsy reports, as thank-you gifts to the more than 500 fans signed up to donate $5 a month via Patreon, a crowd-funding site.

Whatever Drown is doing seems to be working. Obscura had 45,000 downloads in the final week of May and, a year in, his audience keeps growing. The podcast earns him around $5,000 to $6,000 a month, partly from donations but mostly from traditional advertising. If things continue to snowball, Drown could have a bona fide hit on his hands.

A year ago he was a dropout from nursing school, creatively unfulfilled, working as an overnight security guard at Port Tampa Bay. He'd sit alone in the dark guarding some desolate warehouse ""where nobody ever came, but they were required to have a security guard there because it was in some contract or something."" He listened to true crime podcasts to pass the time.

Now his email in-box is so flooded with messages from fans that he can't respond to them all. And the side effects of constantly being exposed to depravity? The freedom and creativity outweigh that stuff, at least for now.

Despite his grave vocal delivery on the show and a promotional photo in which his face is hidden in shadows, Drown does not seem to be a dark soul, maybe just a little serious. In person, he comes off as a warmhearted, thoughtful homebody, who gets joy from hanging out with his family, including a stepdaughter and 2-year-old step-grandson who live with them. He is fond of labeling himself with the hashtag #younggrandpa.

He listens to jazz while he works. He watches live video games and movies with his wife, Rebecca, but not too many horror flicks.

He consumes no true crime when he's not working, but work is always waiting.

Obscura is part of a vast and fast-growing constellation of true crime audio, ranging from prestige journalism by some of the nation's top news organizations to homegrown fare from amateurs taking advantage of podcasting's low barriers to entry.

For every slickly produced Serial or Dirty John or Peabody Award-winning In the Dark, there are indie shows created by bedroom upstarts like Drown with zero journalism or broadcast experience.

Among them are shows such as Killafornia Dreaming, Murderous Minors, Criminology and Southern Fried True Crime, started by a preschool teacher, a baker, a salesman and an accountant, respectively.

Jami Rice, who worked in commercial real estate, started Murderish as a way to share her experience as a juror. Stephen Pacheco left a job in logistics for a large retail chain a year and a half after launching Trace Evidence. The host of Swindled, known only as ""A Concerned Citizen,"" was searching for a particular type of true crime show. Realizing he could make it himself, he eventually left a ""cushy"" government job as a financial analyst with benefits for a significant, and mostly fan-supported, podcast income.

The indie hosts share a community, gathering online and at events such as the True Crime Podcast Festival in Chicago, and in many cases share an audience. Many recall a childhood spent watching Unsolved Mysteries and Forensic Files or perusing used bookstores for true crime paperbacks.

All say their shows, with weekly downloads numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands, make money. Most have been able to leave their day jobs. Becoming rich is suddenly a real possibility.

Indianapolis Crime Stoppers volunteer Ashley Flowers started recording Crime Junkie in her home office with a childhood friend producing and her brother editing. It recently jumped into the top 10 podcasts on iTunes, and now gets more than 8 million downloads a month. It could generate millions of dollars.

It's tough to say how many of the hundreds of thousands of active podcasts in existence are devoted to true crime, but it's definitely an outsized amount, said Nicholas Quah, who writes about the podcast industry for New York magazine and his newsletter Hot Pod. He calls true crime the ""bloody, beating heart of podcasting.""

This week, for example, 12 of the top 20 shows on Apple's Podcasts app are true crime, including Man in the Window, Crime Junkie, The Shrink Next Door, Monster Presents: Insomniac and My Favorite Murder.

There are many theories on why people like true crime, which is most popular with women. Drown said more than 80 percent of his listeners are women.

Perhaps it's because women are much more likely to be the victim of crime perpetrated by an intimate partner, a common theme in true crime shows.

Perhaps it allows people to experience powerful emotions of fear and horror in a controlled environment.

Perhaps listening releases adrenaline, and it becomes addictive. Perhaps it's natural human fascination with taboo subjects. Perhaps we can't look away because we evolved to pay attention to what might harm us. Perhaps it provides a sense of control in a chaotic world. Perhaps it's a comfort for people who have survived abuse or violence — a way of feeling heard.

""A lot of fans are people with a history of abuse,"" Drown said. ""I've had people reach out and say listening makes them feel better, like a coping mechanism. I had a lot of abuse growing up. That's probably why I'm interested in it.""

That abuse, he said, came at the hands of a family member who heard voices that said young Drown was the Antichrist, which led to beatings and sexual molestation.

""Some people, they see true crime, and they would think, like, why would anybody be into that?"" he said. ""But surprisingly, for some of us that are into it, it's a comfort. You know, it's, you're not going through this life alone kind of thing.""

The genre has always been extremely popular in all forms of media, from sober news reporting to sensational tabloids to big-budget docuseries on HBO and Netflix.

The anyone-can-do-it nature of podcasting, Quah said, has been the big difference. Often it is those ""shaggy"" indie types that garner highly engaged fan communities.

""There's a real conspiratorial power that podcasts can bring, when it's a guy in their basement. It feels like a very intimate form of the internet.""

But they can be problematic. While there are many ""thoroughly reported, ethically minded investigations, such as In the Dark,"" there are also ""these smaller shops"" where amateurs and hobbyists come in.

Quah points to the extremely popular Up and Vanished, which started as an investigation of a 12-year-old cold case of a missing Georgia beauty queen and ended with two arrests last year. It was created by ""an aspiring documentarian, and he arguably, accidentally, helped solve that case, but in doing so he handled facts in ways that are slightly unethical or dubious at best.""

Drown mostly stays away from unsolved mysteries due to such complications. Early on, he did an episode about a California desert city where people go missing.

""I have a pretty good feeling for who did it,"" he said, ""but I can't say.""

He also has strong feelings about the type of people who should be making true crime content. He has sparred publicly and privately with South Florida's Mike Boudet, the controversial former host of the hit series Sword and Scale, which has a similar format to Obscura.

Drown was a fan who was inspired by Sword and Scale and even moderated the show's Reddit page at one time. Now he says he recognizes the nuance ""and certain level of decorum and empathy a person should have"" if they're going to cover such sensitive topics.

Prominent podcast company Wondery cut ties with Sword and Scale recently, a day after Boudet was called out for posting a misogynistic and violent joke on International Women's Day. Some fans of Obscura have pointed to the show as the antidote for Sword and Scale listeners seeking an alternative.

Debates over true crime usually come back to this core question: Is it okay to be entertained by the worst thing that ever happened to someone?

In an essay for Vulture that doesn't answer that question definitively, writer Alice Bolin said that, in the end, she prefers obviously lowbrow fare like Dateline and the Investigation Discovery network over prestige true crime like Serial and Making a Murderer. While both can cause harm, prestige true crime is less enjoyable, she wrote, and ""in its dignified guise, has maybe only perfected a method of making us feel less gross about consuming real people's pain for fun.""

Drown doesn't skimp on graphic details culled from interviews, court documents and archive audio. Episode 34, about a young man who detailed his dark fetishes in horribly candid online videos, is literally gag-inducing. Audio from those videos is part of the episode. People thought the man's stories were just attention-grabbing exaggerations. Then the man was convicted of molesting his stepsister and sentenced to 40 years.

Drown has his own code of ethics. He finds a lot of true crime stuff too sensational. In the garage, he played a clip of Dr. Phil interviewing a murderer about what sound a hammer made on a skull as an example. But what he dislikes even more is when criminals are made more palatable for entertainment, sometimes to the point where they look ""cool.""

""So many podcasts and TV shows are made in awe of these killers,"" he said. ""So many movies are made that reduce what these people did. Probably the most accurate serial killer movie I've ever seen is Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, but even then they just took the edge off the blade. By the end you almost feel sympathetic for him.

""Unintentionally, a lot of people have created antiheroes out of some of these serial killers over time. You know, Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, they sell them on shirts and shot glasses, which grosses me out. And that's because people don't really understand what's happening in these cases. And so I actually think those details are important.""

He said he takes care to tell the victims' stories. To celebrate Obscura's one-year anniversary, Episode 50 was a remake of Episode 1, about Mona Biddy, a disabled child found dead in a Jackson, Miss., reservoir in the early 1970s and the case against her stepmother. The original didn't ""honor the memory of the victim."" In the end, he said, he just wants to ""expose terrible realities, that exist.""

Fans who donate get special access to Obscura's ""black label"" content, which Drown feels the need make without the help of the freelance writers or researchers who work on Obscura. Those are the episodes so dark he's afraid to ask anyone else to work on them, or even upload them to iTunes, where people might stumble on them for free.

""I'm really not a fan of creating them. I actually spend a lot of time telling people not to listen to those,"" Drown said. ""But I think I've covered some really important subjects nobody is talking about.""

He has done black label episodes on rape on porn sets and the industry around fetish videos that involve extreme animal cruelty.

Drown, a man who spent most of the year immersed in the worst side of humanity, said it has been the best year of his life since he was a teenager. But he sometimes feels the effects.

""I'm fine though,"" he said. ""If or when I feel like I can't handle it anymore, then I'll take a break.""

He has has occasionally had sleepless nights and haunting images he can't get out of his mind. For all the gory details he does include, he's also the filter for everything that gets edited out. He sees the crime scene photos, whether you hear about them or not.

UPDATE: The puppy that was stolen has been returned home safely.,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2018/10/09/watch-dognappers-grab-puppy-mesquite-yard-speed-cadillac,"Updated at 9:25 a.m. Friday: Revised to reflect details about the puppy's return.

Police say a mastiff puppy that two men took from a Mesquite yard has been returned to its owner — after a man who later purchased the dog realized it was stolen.

The theft happened Saturday afternoon and was captured on surveillance video, which has been viewed online hundreds of thousands of times.

Chipper the French mastiff (Facebook)

Officials said Wednesday night that the investigation into the theft suspects was ongoing. But Chipper, a 10-week-old French mastiff, is home, the dog's owner wrote on Facebook.

Bryan Vazquez told KXAS-TV (NBC5) that he paid $300 for the puppy and had no idea it was the subject of a police search until his wife saw the video online.

""It feels good to have returned the dog and to have everything for the dog to be back where it belongs,"" Vazquez said, according to NBC5.

Police said the dog was stolen around 2:20 p.m. Saturday in the 5100 block of Milam Road, near Lawson Road and Interstate 20.

Dogue de Bordeaux puppy theft Here is the video of the theft of my puppy. He is a 10 week old, red, dogue de bordeaux named ""Chipper"". This happened in Mesquite, TX. Thieves might have possible ties to Lubbock or Amarillo. $500 reward for information leading to safe return of ""Chipper"". UPDATE**** Chipper has been found and is doing wonderful, still waiting on if they have caught thieves. Posted by Ivy Bordeaux on Monday, October 8, 2018

Two men are seen in the footage pulling up to the home in a black Cadillac SUV.

They get out and walk to the fenced front yard. One appears to be talking on a cellphone while the second walks to where Chipper is standing.

The man reaches over the fence and grabs Chipper by the scruff as the puppy squeals and one of the adult dogs in the yard starts barking.

The pair then jump into the Cadillac and speed off.

Matt Ivy, a Dallas firefighter who breeds the dogs at his home, told KDFW-TV (Channel 4) that he fell in love with the breed when he was a kid.

""It's my life outside the fire department,"" he told the station, adding that he learned about the dog, also known as a Dogue de Bordeaux, in the movie Turner & Hooch. ""They told me, 'That's just a mutt, you'll never find one.' Flipped through a dog book 15 years ago and found them. Did my research and got them. Been in love with them ever since.""

Ivy said Chipper was the last of his litter and is microchipped. On his Facebook page shortly after Chipper's return, Ivy said a family from Dripping Springs had adopted the puppy Thursday.

Mesquite police did not provide detailed descriptions of the dognappers. Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Investigator J. Halbert at 972-216-6794.

"30,000 Pounds of Leftover Super Bowl Food Saved From Landfill and Donated to Charity",https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/30000-lbs-of-leftover-super-bowl-food-was-donated-to-local-shelters-for-the-first-time/ar-BBZLKW2,"© Maddie Meyer/Getty This is the first major food recovery at the Super Bowl

Ever wonder what happens to all of the leftover food from the Super Bowl? In past years almost all of the food was just disposed of, but this year Food Rescue US, Centerplate Hospitality and the NFL Green Initiative collected and distributed over 30,000 pounds of food to local Miami shelters with the help of countless volunteers.

The effort started Monday morning following the Kansas City Chiefs’ victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Volunteers took to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami to collect, pack and ship massive amounts of food that remained from concession stands, VIP catered sections, suites and other areas.

Beef tenderloins, barbecue chicken, wings, ribs and charcuterie plates are just some of the food that were rescued, ESPN reported.

“It’s a full volunteer job. We just want to help people in need,” Ellen Bowen, the director of Food Rescue US-Miami, told ESPN. “It’s amazing to see how much food there is that otherwise would have been thrown in the trash that can now feed so many people.”

The rescued food is being donated to the Broward Outreach Center, Broward Partnership for the Homeless, Camillus House, Lotus House Shelter and the Miami Rescue Mission. Bowen said that enough food was collected to feed around 20,000 people in need.

The NFL has been working to make a better impact on the environment through its green initiatives at the Super Bowl and regular season games, from adding recycling to using renewable energy at venues."

Geathers just finished her sophomore year at MIT and is majoring in mechanical engineering. She served as the diversity officer last year.

""In terms of coming from that diversity space and being focused on promoting equity across MIT, it would kind of be important to have someone in the President's role who's focused on that,"" she said.

Stroble was able to evacuate all of the students ""in under a minute,"" he added on Twitter Tuesday afternoon. ""So grateful for her quick action.""

A local resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said he witnessed the school bus explosion and could feel the heat from the flames as he drove past the scene on West Main Street in Duncan.

""I was driving and saw a large black cloud ahead of me and as I got closer I saw the bus on fire in the car wash parking lot,"" he told CBS News. ""As I continued to drive by the heat was so intense I could feel it from inside my truck.""

The school district later notified all parents of students on the bus, reporting that there had been no injuries.

Officials from the South Carolina Department of Education were working with local fire officials to determine the cause of the blaze.

""As all of our school buses are owned by the state of South Carolina, the investigation into what caused the fire is ongoing, and will be completed by staff at the state level,"" the school district said.

Duncan Fire Chief Barry Frost told WSPA they are looking in the passenger area of the bus where there is heater mounted under a seat.

The school district thanked the firefighters, school officials and Stroble for their help.

Since the parade, Dittman has gone viral with a Facebook post addressed to parents, which has garnered over 231,000 shares. ""Imagine that your child feels so lost from you that they sink into the arms of a complete stranger,"" wrote Dittman. ""Try to imagine how deep those cuts must be.""

Twenty-six percent of LGBT youth say their biggest problems are not feeling accepted by their family; trouble at school and bullying; and a fear to be out and open, while 22 percent of non-LGBT youth say their biggest problems are trouble with class, exams and grades, according to a survey by Human Rights Campaign.

Dittman said he received over 1,500 messages, which varied from praise to distress. He said one individual wrote him on the ""day that they saw the post was going to be their last day on earth."" Dittman said the supportive messages, words of encouragement and Dittman's post helped prevent a tragedy.

LGBT youth who come from highly rejecting families are 8.4 times as likely to have attempted suicide as LGBT peers who reported no or low levels of family rejection, according to The Trevor Project, a non-profit organization focused on suicide prevention for LGBT youth.

The parade was not Dittman's first time volunteering to support people in various communities. He is the founder of Helping Butler County, a local volunteer group with nearly 4,000 members and the goal of helping those in need.

His appearances at the parade was a massive success, but he said he isn't retiring from the ""Free Dad Hug"" business anytime soon. ""If we can just be cool and be good humans and do a good job as humans,"" said Dittman. ""It won't matter if someone identifies themselves as gay or bi."""

A church in Southern California says it raised $50,000 to wipe out more than $5 million in medical debt through the organization RIP Medical Debt.

Christian Assembly Church in Eagle Rock, California, said 5,500 households would benefit from their donation.

The church donated $50,000 to Rip Medical Debt, which helps organizations cover debt from medical providers by buying debt portfolios on a secondary market for pennies on the dollar.

""Because of the generosity of the people at Christian Assembly Church, we are able to give a Christmas gift to the people of Los Angeles, no strings attached,'' Tom Hughes, the church's co-pastor, said in a video about the gift.

Hughes said that his congregation had raised $50,000 over the course of 2019, but the members were unaware of how it would be used until now.

The church said that thanks to RIP Medical Debt, it will pay of $5.2 million in medical debt with the donation. The payoff will help families in low-income communities in Los Angeles County.

Hughes said that the church hopes to also work with credit agencies to repair credit scores for families who were affected by unpaid bills.

Families who are affected are expected to receive letters this week about their debt being wiped out.

Hughes said that only the billing companies will know exactly whose debt was paid off, but the each of the 28 neighborhoods where debt was paid off is home to more than 15 active church members.

""As they recover from their illness, it will help them get back on their feet and avoid homelessness,"" Hughes said."

Alberta woman 1st adult in Canada to be 'cured' of sickle cell anemia through stem cell transplant,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-sickle-cell-stem-cell-transplant-adult-cure-1.4603731,"An Alberta woman is among the first adults in Canada to be cured of sickle cell anemia with the help of a sister's love — and a stem cell transplant.

Revée Agyepong, 26, of Edmonton was diagnosed with the disease as a toddler and has never known life without it.

""I remember as far back as elementary feeling sickle cell complications and not knowing what it was,"" she said.

""I thought that everyone would go out for recess and play, then come back with a terrible headache and body pain, couldn't breathe … eventually I realized it was just me.""

Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disease in which red blood cells change into a semi-circular shape and block blood vessels. Symptoms vary from patient to patient but it puts every organ in the body at risk.

Agyepong's disease manifested as chronic bone and joint pain, irregular heartbeat, kidney stones and shortness of breath.

Successfully treated in kids

Two years ago, the Alberta Children's Hospital announced it was successfully treating sickle cell disease in pediatric patients using stem cell transplants.

Agyepong said when she found out about the success of the treatment in pediatric patients, she was at a point where her health was declining and she was running out of treatment options, but doctors told her she was too old to undergo the procedure.

She was devastated.

According to Alberta Health Services, the older the patient and donor in bone marrow transplants, the greater the risk of graft versus host disease, which is a type of immune rejection that can have serious health repercussions and can even result in death.

But Stephanie Amoah, Agyepong's older sister, said she could no longer watch her sister struggle in constant pain and started to research which other centres were testing the treatment on adult patients.

""My sister has always been my protector, my guardian, she found a way,"" Agyepong said.

Sister was a 100% match

The sisters approached Agyepong's doctors and told them of the treatment going on in the east coast of the United States. Dr. Andrew Daly, who leads Alberta's bone marrow transplant program and oversaw Agyepong's stem cell transplant, said they had coincidentally been thinking about conducting adult stem cell transplants for sickle cell disease.

""My persistence, my sister's persistence, and they said my dedication to wanting a cure, was enough for them to just say, you know what, she's going to be the person, let's do this,"" Agyepong said.

Stephanie Amoah, Revée Agyepong's older sister, was a 100% donor match. She said she's happy to have been part of a process that will give her sister a new life. (Nelly Alberola/Radio-Canada)

Amoah was tested and was found to be a 100 per cent match for her sister. Daly said the odds of siblings being a perfect match is one in four.

The transplant, which took place at Calgary's Tom Baker Cancer Centre, involved Agyepong taking drugs to suppress her immune system and doing a course of low-dose radiation. Amoah underwent a process called apheresis that collected her sickle-cell-free stem cells, which were then given to Agyepong.

'Do the things she's always wanted'

""Over the past few months, what we've seen is that Revée's sister's bone marrow has taken over the production of Revée's red blood cells,"" Daly said. ""The amount of sickle cell hemoglobin in her bloodstream has decreased almost to zero.""

Today, Agyepong's blood tests don't show any signs of the disease, which makes her essentially cured. Amoah said the change she sees in her sister is amazing.

""It's phenomenal. I'm just so happy to have been part of a process that will give her a new life, a new hope and be able to do the things she's always wanted to do,"" Amoah said.

Agyepong said she is still recovering from the transplant but when she is one year out, she plans to dedicate her time to advocating for the disease, and just live her life like a normal person.

""I want to travel somewhere exotic and somewhere warm and feel dehydration like anyone else would, because I couldn't with sickle cell, I would be dehydrated and end up in the hospital,"" she said.

""It sounds so insignificant but it's really exciting just to be able to be more spontaneous."""
Dad who lunged at Larry Nassar donating GoFundMe earnings to help sexual abuse survivors,http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/02/dad_who_lunged_at_nassar_donat.html,"The man who attempted to attack former Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar during his Eaton County sentencing hearing will be donating earnings from a fundraising account in his name to charity.

Randy Margraves, the father of three victims of Nassar and a member of IBEW 665, lunged at his daughters' former doctor last week after hearing victim impact statements from his daughters in court. He was detained and later released without charges, but a GoFundMe online fundraiser was started in his name.

That fundraiser earned $31,311 before the account was closed, according to a joint statement from Margraves and IBEW 665. Many of the donations came from IBEW members throughout the country.

""While Randy deeply appreciates the outpouring of support, he says it is not needed for him,"" the statement read. ""This situation has demonstrated the strength of the bond among our union brothers and sisters...we're glad to see the money going to organizations that help survivors of abuse.""

Donors can choose to get a refund before March 9, or leave the donation to be given to local charities such as Small Talk, RAVE, and the Firecracker Foundation that help sexual abuse survivors.

""At the time of the incident, I didn't know that the great brotherhood had done this, and I was overcome with gratitude when I found out,"" Margraves said in the statement. ""I appreciate everyone stepping up to support me, but help is not needed for me.""

During Nassar's sentencing hearing last Friday, Margraves was there to to support his two of his daughters, Lauren and Madison, as they gave statements in person in the courtroom Friday.

All three of Randall Margraves' daughters had been sexually abused by Nassar, a prominent sports physician now facing a lifetime in prison for inappropriately touching hundreds of women and girls. All three gave statements in either his Eaton or Ingham county sentencing hearings.

But he didn't know the full extent of what his children were going to say, and after seeing Nassar's reaction, he asked to say a few words.

He called Nassar a son of a bitch, and Judge Janice Cunningham asked him not to swear.

Margraves asked the court to have five minutes alone in a locked room with Nassar, and audience members in the courtroom laughed awkwardly when Cunningham told him she couldn't do that. Then he asked for a minute, and she told him she couldn't let him do that, either.

Without warning, Margraves rushed towards Nassar. Nassar ducked as one of his defense attorneys jumped in front of his client. Margraves was quickly detained, and courtroom proceedings stopped momentarily. He was later released without charges.

Margraves' action sent shockwaves through the courtroom and the country as those who witnessed what happened got a raw glimpse into the devastating pain Nassar's actions had caused the victims and their families.

It sparked the creation of a GoFundMe account in his name, which spread rapidly throughout the day and earned more than $30,000.

He apologized profusely for his actions, noting at a press conference later that day that he was embarrassed.

""I want to make it real clear that I am no hero. My daughters are the heroes and all the victims and the survivors of this terrible atrocity,"" Margraves said on Friday night."

Then the cancer patient took a trip on psilocybin – the active agent in ""magic mushrooms."" Ever since, she says she is perfectly comfortable with her life.



Pappas is one of dozens of cancer patients whose painful anxiety over their illness was commuted to more peaceful acceptance after participating in a study that involved intensive therapy and being given a drug that was once a symbol of the 60's counterculture. She and others, who say the psychedelic experience helped them overcome other problems like depression and addiction, talk to Anderson Cooper for a report on the study of psychedelics inside some of the country's foremost medical research centers. The story will be broadcast on ""60 Minutes,"" Sunday, October 13, at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT on CBS.



Pappas was being treated for lung cancer when she was given the psilocybin. This is what she tells Cooper she saw. ""An ancient, prehistoric, barren land… there's these men with pickaxes, just slamming on the rocks,"" she recalls. ""I was being shown the truth of reality. Life is meaningless. We have no purpose."" And then it hit her she says, ""I look and I'm still like a witness with the eyes, a beautiful, shimmering bright jewel and then it was sound… booming, booming, booming. Right here right now. Yes, you are alive. Right here. Right now. Because that's all you have."" She tells Cooper: ""That is my mantra to this day.""



Cooper speaks with participants and scientists who conduct clinical trials. Roland Griffiths, of Johns Hopkins University, is a pioneer in psychedelic research, which was studied extensively until former President Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Thirty years later, Griffiths received FDA approval for to study psilocybin. The results amazed him. ""The red light started flashing. It's unprecedented – the capacity of the human organism to change. It just was astounding.""



The experiences of the study participants on psychedelics, even under the highly controlled conditions used, are often harrowing but still worth it in the end. Researchers screen out people with psychotic disorders or with close relatives who have schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder. So far, none of the participants reports any serious adverse outcomes.



Griffiths said he is optimistic about the potential therapeutic value of the drugs but acknowledges they can be harmful under different circumstances. ""Let's be really clear on that… We're very aware of the risks and would not recommend people simply go out and do this."""

His mom had invited 30 children to her son's fourth birthday party and not one of them showed up at the Chuck E. Cheese parlor in New Jersey, where she had reserved space for the celebration.

""He was looking at the door. You saw the disappointment on his face,"" Angel Kazanis told InsideEdition.com.

The employees felt heartsick as well.

""I immediately ran to the kitchen and was so upset,"" said worker Taylor Inzinna. The mother ""was handling it so much better than I was. ... She held it together and never let Evan know for a second she was upset, which I think was super awesome.""

But Inzinna wanted to somehow salvage Evan's huge disappointment.

She posted on Facebook her desire to give the child a party with presents. Her colleagues, family members and friends responded, and ""within three to four days, I had about 13 gifts,"" she said.

Inzinna contacted Kazanis and said the store wanted to do something for Evan to make him feel special. Could they come back in? She didn't say a word about the gifts.

So mother and son returned.

""The day he came back in, seeing the smile on his face was everything I wanted,"" Inzinna said. ""I had one goal that day and my goal was to make sure that he left happy. And he left going, 'Oh my God, Mom, this is the best day ever.'''

Evan's mother was again overcome when she saw how delighted her son was when presented with an avalanche of wrapped gifts.

""I was shocked. I had to keep myself from crying. I didn't want him to see how this affected me,"" Kazanis said. ""They made him feel a million dollars, like he was the most important kid in the whole world.

""He is not going to forget it. He remembers everyone and everything.""

SPRINGFIELD -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signed legislation raising teachers' minimum salary to $40,000 over four years to address a statewide shortage of classroom leaders.

The current minimum teacher salary ranges from only $9,000 to $11,000.

"Four skateboarders will receive special recognition after they stepped in when a man was sexually assaulting a drunk woman, scared him off, chased him down, and held him until police arrested him (x-post from r/skateboarding)",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/2016-chief-awards-gala-calgary-1.3611207,"Four skateboarders received special recognition after they stepped in when a man was sexually assaulting a teenage girl, scared him off, chased him down, and held him until police arrested him.

The young men — and 25 other Calgarians — received an award from Chief Const. Roger Chaffin in recognition for their exceptional bravery at the Chief's Awards Gala Thursday night.

The four friends were in an underground parkade at Chinook Mall when they saw a well-dressed man carrying what appeared to be a seriously drunk and distraught young woman.

""She was screaming and yelling. She just wanted to be out of there. She was all scuffed up and dirty,"" said Carsyn Wright, one of the longboarders.

'We needed to be there for her,' says skateboarder Carsyn Wright 0:22 Carsyn Wright and three of his friends stopped a sexual assault and won special recognition for their service. 0:22

They stopped the man and began questioning him to determine whether or not the young woman was safe.

The man answered the group's questions, saying he was trying to phone the girl's father for a ride home.

The group, believing him, let him go and watched the pair enter a nearby stairwell.

""You don't want to really think of the worst in somebody like that. You don't want that situation to be real, so you just brush it off and hope for the best,"" Wright said.

Stopping the assault

The four friends rode off with the intention of returning to check on the girl a few minutes later.

When they returned, they saw the man sexually assaulting the young woman.

""He had her in a stairwell, bent over, and just, it was disgusting,"" Wright said.

Arnaud Nimenya said his initial reaction was one of shock. ""You walk in, and you see something like that, and you freeze. You don't know what to do.""

When they realized what was happening, they immediately moved to stop the attack.

""He was trying to walk out and walk away from us,"" said Nimenya. ""He pushed me aggressively out of the way, kinda like just gives me the smile, like, 'I can do this. You can't do anything about it.'""

Chasing the attacker

Instead of letting him get away, three of the skateboarders chased him down, while one remained behind to stay with the victim.

Following the foot chase, there was a physical confrontation in which the man picked up a longboard and began to attack his three pursuers.

Police arrived moments later, arrested the man and charged him with sexual assault.

Later, when police tried to contact the four friends to recognize them for their bravery and service, Nimenya said he was caught off guard.

""We always thought we were going to be in trouble, because we fought with him. When they called us, we didn't wanna answer.""

In total, 25 citizens were honoured for bravery at the Chief Awards Gala. Read about some of the other recipients and their acts of courage below:

Eddy watched as the car in front of him failed to move, after the red light switched to green. As other cars honked and swerved around them, he watched it slowly creep into the intersection, drive onto the curb, across a sidewalk and crash into a sign.

Noticing that something was very wrong, he ran over to the car, peered inside and realized the driver needed help.

He smashed the window open with a rock to get the driver out, and then provided CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

EMS staff said the driver of that car had suffered a massive heart attack and would have died, if not for Eddy.

They saw the man grab his ex-wife by the throat and pin her down inside her car while her children screamed from the back seat.

Dolph and Simpson ran over to stop the man, called the police and waited with the woman until help arrived.

"Candice Payne, the 34-year-old Chicago realtor who rented hotel rooms for dozens of the city's homeless during the recent polar vortex, said she found her calling through the experience.",https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/2/10/18413042/candice-payne-viral-deed-of-housing-homeless-at-hotel-was-a-no-brainer,"So just who is Candice Payne, the Chicagoan who rented hotel rooms for the homeless during the recent polar vortex?

After her selfless deed went viral, it drew an onslaught of volunteers locally and donations nationally, leading to last week’s appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”

There, she got a $50,000 gift from Walmart, which she turned around and donated to her nonprofit, Action For A Cause Now.

A humble and successful 34-year-old businesswoman, Payne’s life has been forever changed by what began as worry for those outside during a spell predicted to bring the most frigid Chicago temperatures seen in decades.

“Those five days gave me a new purpose,” she said in a recent chat.

“For five days, my life, my heart, was there with the homeless. For them to share their stories with me, to listen to them, cry with them, understand there are so many different reasons for why they’re where they’re at. I realized that was just a temporary fix.”

Payne started Action For A Cause Now two years ago but hadn’t decided what to do with it. Now, she’s decided to focus on helping the homeless. She started a Gofundme page that has brought in about $25,000. Besides building multi-unit housing for the homeless,it also will join a trend by creating night shelters for the homeless out of shipping containers.

“I didn’t do this for any reason other than to help, but I’m glad it’s raised awareness and gives me a platform to help the homeless on a larger scale,” she said.

Chicagoans cocooned during the vortex that brought temperatures under 20 degrees below zero on Jan. 30-31. Then word spread of the efforts of a good Samaritan to shelter the homeless at the Amber Inn on the South Side, the only hotel that would take them.

Payne initially was leery of the spotlight. But when folks started speculating it was some wealthy or famous benefactor renting hotel rooms and driving all over town picking up homeless, she felt it important to let people know it was a regular person, or as she says, “a working black woman.”

“It was going to be way too cold that Wednesday, so I told my employees not to come in to work. I’d planned to stay in bed, watching TV and on my laptop. Then I started thinking, ‘Man, what about the people who don’t have anywhere to go tomorrow night?

“I instantly said, ‘I’m going to put 20 hotel rooms on my American Express card,'” Payne recounts.

Her efforts, applauded by the likes of Hillary Clinton, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Common, potentially saved lives, as experts say such cold spells are most lethal for the homeless — time spent in subzero temperatures can cause death in under 24 hours.

Payne ultimately got 122 homeless people off the street, personally paying for 30 rooms, and raising more than $23,000 through social media pleas. It all covered 72 hotel rooms for five nights. Volunteers and donors joined her to provide meals and toiletries.

“For me, it was a no-brainer,” she said of the feat that triggered requests for TV appearances not only from Ellen DeGeneres, but “Steve Harvey” and “Good Morning America.”

“I chose Ellen over the others, because I love Ellen,” Payne said.

Payne lives in Hazel Crest, but grew up in Auburn Gresham, the youngest of four children and only daughter of her father, a South Side hairstylist, and her late mother, who died in 2013.

A graduate of Chicago Public Schools’ Lindblom Math & Science Academy, she obtained her associate’s degree in business from City Colleges of Chicago, and bought her first building at age 20. It was a bad investment. At 23, she had to file for bankruptcy.

Payne then enrolled in real estate school, got her license and repaired her credit. In 2011, she bought another building and quit her Comcast job of eight years to focus on real estate.

Bill protecting sharks and all rays moves forward,http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2018/03/20/hawaii-news/bill-protecting-sharks-all-rays-moves-forward/,"KAILUA-KONA — Protection for all sharks and rays within state waters has moved another step closer to reality.

Senate Bill 2079 cleared the state House Committee on Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs with amendments on March 13 after securing a 5-0 vote. Rep. Richard Creagan, D-South Kona, portions of North Kona and Ka’u, was among the representatives voting in favor of the bill; two representatives were excused from the vote.

ADVERTISING

The proposal seeks to protect all sharks and rays within state waters for ecological purposes, and their value to Native Hawaiian cultural practices and the ocean recreation industry. The committee on March 13 added an exception for sharks taken outside of state marine waters and possessed on a vessel in state marine waters pursuant to a federally managed fishery for the purpose of landing the catch in the state.

In its current form, the bill would establish fines for “knowingly capture, take, possess, abuse, or entangle any shark, whether alive or dead, or kill any shark, within state marine waters.” It would also expand similar protections afforded to manta rays in 2009 to include all rays — or hihimanu.

Violating the law would be a misdemeanor offense with fines ranging from $500 to $10,000 and an administrative fine up to $10,000 per specimen.

Exceptions are listed for research and educational purposes, as well as traditional and customary rights protected by the Hawaii Constitution.

ADVERTISING

Senate Bill 2079 passed its third reading in the state Senate and was sent to the House earlier this month. The full House passed on it first reading March 8 and referred it for hearings before two committees.

To remain alive, the measure needs to pass a second reading by the House and secure a hearing before the Committee on Judiciary."
"Man throws away winning $100,000 lottery ticket, realizes mistake just in time",https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-throws-winning-100000-lottery-ticket-realizes-mistake/story?id=68903747,"Man throws away winning $100,000 lottery ticket, realizes mistake just in time “I checked the results for the day before,” the man told the lottery.

A South Carolina man is counting his lucky stars after almost making a very expensive mistake when he threw away his winning $100,000 lottery ticket before realizing he had actually won.

The incident happened when the unnamed man purchased a Palmetto Cash 5 ticket from a BP gas station in Newberry, South Carolina, and, when checking the numbers of the lottery results, saw that he had lost and threw his ticket in the trash.

The only problem is that he had actually won $100,000.

“I checked the results for the day before,” the man told the South Carolina Education Lottery according to a statement.

His Palmetto Cash 5 ticket had actually matched all five numbers drawn on Friday, Jan. 24 and he only realized it when he was sipping his coffee and happened to look over the results again when he realized the horrific mistake.

“I couldn’t believe it,” he said to the South Carolina Education Lottery.

He managed to retrieve the ticket and turn it in to collect his winnings.

The winner said that he now plans to give the money to charity and set up a college fund for his grandchildren.

The BP gas station that sold the ticket received a commission of $1,000 for selling the winning ticket.

The odds of winning $100,000 playing Palmetto Cash 5 are 1 in 501,942, which, according to the Independent, is slightly more likely than you winning a gold medal in the Olympics or being crushed to death by a meteor.

In fact, you are actually an estimated 50 times more likely to win an Oscar, statistically, than you are hitting the $100,000 jackpot."

Corruption in medicine and the constant fear of being fleeced by doctors and hospitals makes one doubt the profession. With several cases of medical malpractice and fraud doing the rounds, it's easy to lose faith in doctors. But here is one woman who, even at the age of 91, is living up to the Hippocratic oath.

Dr Bhakti Yadav holds the proud distinction of being the first MBBS-degree holder in the city of Indore. And since 1948, one year after India gained independence, Dr Yadav has been treating patients for free.









A gynaecologist, Dr Bhakti Yadav has delivered thousands of babies and never charged a fee. She has formed a reputation of being a caring doctor who doesn't let her patients feel ignored. Even though her age has affected her work since she can't see too many patients now, many women across Madhya Pradesh and from Uttar Pradesh consult her. And she doesn't dismiss them. Even if she can't examine a patient herself, her medical advice is valued.

So the next time you dismiss someone as useless based on their age, think again. You may be sitting across someone as strong as Dr Bhakti Yadav.

"Former President Jimmy Carter lives in a $167,000 house and shops at the Dollar General",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/22/jimmy-carter-lives-in-an-inexpensive-house.html,"Former President Jimmy Carter might have once called the white mansion at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue his home, but now, he lives in a much, much more modest abode. Carter, the nation's 39th president and oldest-living former president in U.S. history at 96 years old, lives a fairly normal — and frugal — life, The Washington Post reported in 2018. In fact, Carter still lives in the ranch house he built himself in 1961. The home, in rural Plains, Georgia (about a 2½-hour drive south of Atlanta) is a two-bedroom ranch assessed at just $167,000, which is ""less than the value of the armored Secret Service vehicles parked outside,"" the Post reports. It's also less than the median home price in Georgia, which is $213,026, according to real estate site Zillow.

In addition to his affordable home, Carter's frugal tendencies include spending weekends dining with neighbors on paper plates with bargain-brand wine, the Post says. In addition, it says he and wife Rosalynn make their own yogurt. Carter has also been known to buy his clothes at his local Dollar General store, according to a 2011 Rolling Stone story (he showed up for the store's opening in Plains in 2004), and he often flies commercial.

In recent years, Carter has made much of his income from writing books, the Post repored; he has published at least 33, including a children's book and reflections on his presidency. (Thriftbooks.com lists 46 books.) Carter also receives a $210,700 annual pension, as do all former presidents, plus the federal government gives all ex-presidents an allowance for things like travel and office space. In 2017, Carter got more than $230,000 in such allowances, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a conservative advocacy group.

Carter's modest lifestyle is sharply different from those of other living former presidents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama purchased an $8.1 million mansion in Washington, and is well known for his family's tradition of taking a summer vacation to the picturesque (and pricey) Martha's Vineyard."
J.J. Watt to pay for funerals of victims in Santa Fe High School shooting,http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23542105/jj-watt-houston-texans-pay-funerals-santa-fe-high-school-shooting-victims,"Chris Paul sends his prayers to the victims of the Santa Fe shooting and says it's scary that this is becoming a norm. (0:49)

HOUSTON -- Texans defensive end J.J. Watt will pay for the funerals of those killed in the shooting at Santa Fe High School, the team confirmed.

Ten people were killed Friday morning and 10 more were wounded when a 17-year-old carrying a shotgun and revolver opened fire at the high school about 30 miles from downtown Houston.

According to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, nine of those killed were students. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the shooting ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools.""

According to police officials, the 17-year-old is in custody and has been charged with capital murder, and a second person has been detained.

Shortly after the shooting, Watt tweeted:

Absolutely horrific. — JJ Watt (@JJWatt) May 18, 2018

Watt has been active in the surrounding community since he was drafted by Houston in 2011. Most notably, he started a fundraiser in August that raised more than $37 million for those affected by the flooding from Hurricane Harvey.

The Texans also released a statement.

""On behalf of the Texans organization, we are saddened by the tragic events at Sante Fe High School this morning and extend our thoughts and heartfelt condolences to the victims, their families and all those affected. We are grateful for the brave first responders, law enforcement officials and medical personnel. The Texans family will continue to pray for our neighbors."""
New Zealand company offers employees $10 a day to cycle to work: Christchurch advertising firm says workers could feel energised by the exercise – and the money.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/new-zealand-cycle-cash-10-a-day-employees-work-company,"Christchurch advertising firm says workers could feel energised by the exercise – and the money

A Christchurch company is offering hard cash to employees who bike to work everyday in a bid to energise staff and move the city away from a reliance on cars.

Employees who cycle to and from work will receive $5 a day and if they keep it up for more than half a year that amount will double to $10 a day, paid out as a bonus at the end of year.

Work four days, get paid for five: New Zealand company's new shorter week Read more

“For a while I had been thinking it would be great to incentivise cycling in some way. I’m a really keen cyclist [and] cash is clearly the most obvious incentive,” Tim Chesney from advertising agency Make Collective told Stuff.

“My gut instinct is that it could be something really good for the workplace. I know for myself I show up feeling a lot more energised, my blood is already flowing.”

Chesney said some employees were initially reluctant because the office had no shower facilities, but the offer of potentially hundreds of extra dollars a year was too good to refuse and five of his six employees had joined the scheme.

“The extra money is coming straight out of the businesses profits, but I really believe there will be numerous tangible benefits as a result of people cycling to and from work.”

Developer Elliot Gilmore told Stuff that recovering from his ride to work was “the hardest part”, but the pay-off for his health was better than a gym membership.

“It’s been great so far, I mean, I get to ride through Hagley Park and see people feeding the ducks, reading books and stuff, which is quite different to just waiting for the lights to change while driving.”

According to the council, Christchurch has more cyclists than any other New Zealand city, with 13 major cycle routes running through the wreckage and reconstruction of the city centre.

Associate transport minister Julie Anne Genter said investment in cycleways were a key feature of the ongoing rebuild, with the urban cycleways programme costingNZ$150m.

“Safe cycleways are a key part of making Christchurch a healthy, happy and vibrant city full of people, rather than traffic,” said Genter."

"2,000-year-old redwoods survive wildfire at California park",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/2-000-year-old-redwoods-survive-wildfire-california-s-oldest-n1237949,"BOULDER CREEK, Calif. — When a massive wildfire swept through California’s oldest state park last week it was feared many trees in a grove of old-growth redwoods, some of them 2,000 years old and among the tallest living things on Earth, may finally have succumbed.

But an Associated Press reporter and photographer hiked the renowned Redwood Trail at Big Basin Redwoods State Park on Monday and confirmed most of the ancient redwoods had withstood the blaze. Among the survivors is one dubbed Mother of the Forest.

“That is such good news, I can’t tell you how much that gives me peace of mind,” said Laura McLendon, conservation director for the Sempervirens Fund, an environmental group dedicated to the protection of redwoods and their habitats.

Redwood forests are meant to burn, she said, so reports earlier this week that the state park was “gone” were misleading.

The historic park headquarters is gone, as are many small buildings and campground infrastructure that went up in flames as fire swept through the park about 45 miles south of San Francisco.

“But the forest is not gone,” McLendon said. “It will regrow. Every old growth redwood I’ve ever seen, in Big Basin and other parks, has fire scars on them. They’ve been through multiple fires, possibly worse than this.”

When forest fires, windstorms and lightning hit redwood trees, those that don’t topple can resprout. Mother of the Forest, for example, used to be 329 feet tall, the tallest tree in the park. After the top broke off in a storm, a new trunk sprouted where the old growth had been.

Trees that fall feed the forest floor and become nurse trees from which new redwoods grow. Forest critters, from banana slugs to insects, thrive under logs.

On Monday, Steller’s jays searched for insects around the park’s partially burned outdoor amphitheater and woodpeckers could be heard hammering on trees. Occasionally a thundering crash echoed through the valley as large branches or burning trees fell.

When Big Basin opened in 1902 it marked the genesis of redwood conservation. The park now receives about 250,000 visitors a year from around the world, and millions have walked the Redwood Trail.

The park only recently reopened after COVID-19-related closures and now is closed because of the fire. The road in is blocked by several large trees that fell across it, some waist-high, some still on fire.

While there is a great deal of work to be done rebuilding campgrounds, clearing trails and managing damaged madrones, oaks and firs, Big Basin will recover, McLendon said.

“The forest, in some ways, is resetting,” she said.

State Parks District Superintendent Chris Spohrer said he was pleased to know the redwoods had survived. He said an assessment team had only been able to check buildings so far, and that he hopes they can inspect the trees in the coming days.

“The reason those trees are so old is because they are really resilient,” he said."
Canada is considering a change to the Criminal Code to ban the practice of conversion therapy across the country.,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conversion-therapy-what-you-need-to-know-1.5209598,"In an about-face, the federal government is considering a change to the Criminal Code to ban the practice of conversion therapy across the country.

In March this year, the Liberal government rejected a petition with more than 18,000 signatures calling for a national ban. It said that, ""conversion therapies are immoral, painful, and do not reflect the values of our government or those of Canadians,"" but added that it felt conversion therapy was largely a provincial and territorial issue.

However, according to a letter signed by two Liberal cabinet ministers and an Alberta MP, and sent to the provinces in June , the federal government is now looking at ways to reform the Criminal Code in order to ""combat conversion therapy.""

News of the possible national ban comes as St. Albert, Alta., has become the second Canadian city after Vancouver to make it illegal for businesses to offer conversion therapy.

Other regions are also considering whether to follow suit.

WATCH: The National's story about St. Albert's conversion therapy ban

Alberta city moves to ban anti-gay conversion therapy 2:10 Alberta's United Conservative government says it does not condone conversion therapy. In fact, only a handful of provinces have banned it outright. But the frustration that Alberta hasn't done so has prompted one Alberta city to take its own stand. 2:10

What is it?

Conversion therapy is a practice that aims to change an individual's sexual orientation to heterosexual or gender identity to cisgender, which means identifying with the sex assigned to them at birth.

It employs various approaches, from talk therapy and medication, to aversion therapy that attempts to condition a person's behaviour by causing them discomfort through things like electric shocks when they're exposed to specific stimuli.

It is believed conversion therapy has existed for more than a century, with German psychiatrist Albert von Schrenck-Notzing being one of the first to use the practice on patients.

Peter Gajdics, author of the book The Inheritance of Shame, spent six years in conversion therapy with a licensed psychiatrist in Victoria, B.C. At first, he says the psychiatrist prescribed several antidepressants and a sedative so that Gajdics' ""innate heterosexuality would resurface.""

When that didn't happen, Gajdics says his psychiatrist began using aversion therapy.

""It's not so much that I wanted to kill myself as I thought I was already dead,"" says Gajdics, describing how he felt after he stopped seeing his psychiatrist.

He is the Canada Research Chair for the Public Understanding of Sexual & Gender Minority Youth and describes the dangers of the controversial therapy. 1:36

Where is conversion therapy offered in Canada?

These days, it's uncommon to find medical professionals offering conversion therapy to patients.

""You won't be able to walk into a licensed counsellor's office and ask them to engage in this practice, because it would be deemed to be unethical and unprofessional,"" says Dr. Kristopher Wells, Canada Research Chair for the Public Understanding of Sexual And Gender Minority Youth.

As a result, Wells warns, the practice has gone underground in faith-based communities, ""which makes it harder to detect, but also more dangerous.""

The painful toll of going through conversion therapy 3:44 Those who've experienced conversion therapy often describe it as difficult and painful. The National reached out to two Canadians who have gone through it and they agreed to share their stories. 3:44

Does conversion therapy work?

The science says no.

Researchers at Cornell University looked at 47 peer-reviewed studies from 1992 through 2015 about the effects of conversion therapy. They found only 13 studies made an empirical determination about whether conversion therapy works.

Of the 13 studies, 12 concluded conversion therapy is ineffective and/or harmful.

The lone study that suggested conversion therapy could be successful had notable limitations, as it was entirely based on self-reporting, according to researchers.

""[Conversion therapy] can lead to depression, self-loathing … self-harming behaviours such as cutting or drug and alcohol abuse … all the way up to people taking their own lives,"" Wells says.

The World Health Organization issued a statement in 2012 saying this type of therapy poses a ""severe threat to the health and human rights of the affected persons.""

The Canadian Psychological Association, which represents psychologists, warned in a 2015 statement that, ""Conversion or reparative therapy can result in negative outcomes, such as distress, anxiety, depression, negative self-image, a feeling of personal failure, difficulty sustaining relationships, and sexual dysfunction.""

The CPA added that it "" opposes any therapy with the goal of repairing or converting an individual's sexual orientation , regardless of age,"" including conversion therapy.

What are governments doing about it?

""The provincial, territorial, municipal and federal governments all have roles to play to protect Canadians from the harms associated with the practice,"" reads a letter sent by the federal government to the provinces last month.

The Liberal government says it plans to examine the issue with an eye to a Criminal Code ban.

Several provinces have already enacted laws to restrict conversion therapy:

Ontario has made the practice illegal for minors by initiating an outright ban.

has made the practice illegal for minors by initiating an outright ban. Manitoba has outlawed health professionals from offering conversion therapy.

has outlawed health professionals from offering conversion therapy. Nova Scotia has made it illegal for health professionals to provide conversion therapy for minors.

However, the only two jurisdictions with a complete ban on conversion therapy are Vancouver and St. Albert, Alta .

""We need to keep making sure that we're making youth safe,"" says St. Albert City Councillor Natalie Joly, who brought forth the motion to ban conversion therapy to council in May.

""If it means that one kid feels safe, then that risk is absolutely worth it."""

Noon

The head of the Massachusetts lottery says the winner of the $758.7 million Powerball jackpot has come forward to claim the prize.

Michael Sweeney, the lottery's executive director, says the winner will be introduced at 1 p.m. at lottery headquarters. All he would say about the winner is that it is an individual woman.

A store in Chicopee, Massachusetts, sold the only ticket that won the jackpot. It's the largest grand prize won by a single lottery ticket in U.S. history.

Sweeney also apologized for the lottery's erroneous announcement early Thursday that the winning ticket had been sold at a store in Watertown. He blamed it on human error.

The owner of the store that sold the lone winning Powerball ticket says he's donating the store's $50,000 prize to several local charities.

Bob Bolduc owns the Pride store chain. One of its stores, in Chicopee, Massachusetts, sold the only ticket that won the $758.7 million jackpot. It's the largest grand prize won by a single lottery ticket in U.S. history.

He says once they heard that the winning ticket was sold Wednesday afternoon, store workers looked it up on the surveillance video and believe the winner was a middle-aged woman.

Bolduc says they're happy for the customer, and happy for the charities.

The lottery says the winner still had not come forward as of midmorning Thursday.

___

10 a.m.

The head of the Massachusetts State Lottery says a transcription error led the organization to wrongly identify the store that sold the lone winning Powerball ticket.

In a statement issued Thursday morning, lottery Executive Director Michael Sweeney says officials were manually recording the names of the retailers that sold the winning ticket for the $758.7 million jackpot, as well as two tickets that won $1 million prizes. He says they transcribed it incorrectly.

Sweeney issued an apology for the confusion created by the error, but said lottery staff remained thrilled that a jackpot winning ticket and two $1 million winning tickets were sold in Massachusetts.

___

9 a.m.

The Massachusetts store that sold the winning Powerball ticket was initially told it sold a $1 million ticket, not the only ticket that won the $758.7 million jackpot.

Mike Donatelli, a spokesman for the Pride Station & Store in Chicopee, Massachusetts, says they were told shortly before 8 a.m. that the store had actually sold that ticket. The jackpot is the largest grand prize won by a single lottery ticket in U.S. history.

Donatelli says the founder of the chain, Bob Bolduc, plans to hold news conferences at 10 a.m. and at noon. The store is part of a chain that operates in western Massachusetts and northern Connecticut.

The Chicopee store will receive $50,000 for selling the winning ticket.

Lottery officials had initially said a different store, near Boston, had sold the winning ticket. That store actually sold a ticket that won $1 million.

___

8: 30 a.m.

The error by the Massachusetts State Lottery over which store sold the lone winning Powerball ticket is being blamed on nerves.

Michael Sweeney, the lottery's executive director, tells WBZ-AM they had a ""couple of excited people at 1 o'clock in the morning"" but said if there's any blame to be placed, the buck stops with him.

The lottery initially said a convenience store in Watertown had sold the winning ticket. A few hours later, it announced it had made a mistake, and that the winning ticket was sold across the state at the Pride Station & Store in Chicopee, in Western Massachusetts.

Sweeney says the lottery had not yet heard from the winner.

He said the Chicopee store will receive $50,000 for selling the winning ticket, he said.

He said the store in Watertown did sell a ticket that won a $1 million prize.

___

8 a.m.

Massachusetts State Lottery officials have corrected the site where the single winning ticket for the Powerball $758.7 million jackpot was sold to Chicopee, not Watertown.

The Massachusetts State Lottery had announced around 2:30 a.m. Thursday that a convenience store in Watertown, near Boston, had sold the winning ticket.

But shortly before 8 a.m., the lottery said it had made a mistake, and that the winning ticket was sold across the state at the Pride Station & Store in Chicopee, in Western Massachusetts.

While not much is known about Backbeat Barbeque just yet, Grohl first announced his plans to launch the BBQ-focused project while speaking to GQ in May.

""I have spent far too long lost down a YouTube wormhole, watching videos on how to make the best spice rub for the perfect brisket,"" he said at the time. ""When I get back to L.A. I’m taking a butchery course.""

Another celebrity who fed responders was Guy Fieri. The Auburn Police Department's Twitter shared a photo of the chef with an officer on Sunday, after he stopped by to cook a pulled pork dinner for everyone.

""Guy Fieri is in this photo with Officer Joe Almeida up in Butte County #CampFire Guy is cooking pulled pork dinner for everyone this evening,"" the tweet read. ""He had also thanked everyone that is helping out for their hard work! Thank you Guy for your time, support and great food! #ButteCounty.""

"The Turkish town where the poor never go hungry. Restaurants in a small eastern Anatolian town are offering free meals to those in need, a tradition that has carried on for decade",http://www.middleeasteye.net/in-depth/features/safeguarding-poor-restaurants-turkish-town-feeding-needy-decades-1183080726,"KARAKOCAN, Turkey - Under the glaring sun of a Saturday afternoon in August, a restaurant in a small eastern Turkish town welcomes its “most valuable customers”.

It is only one of the many establishments across the town where those in need are invited to eat free of charge. This well-preserved tradition has been carried down from generation to generation for decades.

Karakocan, a 70-minute drive north of the centre of Elazıg province, has attracted attention in recent years for its tradition of offering free food to those in need. For locals, the custom is a way of fulfilling their responsibility to assist the less fortunate.

A group of locals of gathered for a tea in front of the Merkez restaurant in Karakoçan, Turkey (MEE/Zeyneb Varol) Mehmet Ozturk, 55, the owner and manager of one of Karakocan’s busiest restaurants, Merkez, for nearly 35 years, says he always keeps at least three tables reserved for those in need, even during rush hour when his eatery is cramped. According to Ozturk, ""the poor never fail to come"".

On any given day, Ozturk says at least 15 people come to his restaurant to receive a free meal. According to residents, around 100 people eat for free each day across the whole town, which is home to around 28,000 people, according to official statistics.

Galip, one of the regulars, says he visits the Merkez Restaurant at least two times a day (MEE/Zeyneb Varol) Galip is one of the familiar faces at the restaurant who has eaten there every day for the last 10 years. “He was here for breakfast and he will probably come for dinner as well,” a young waiter says.

Suffering from mental illness, Galip doesn’t share much.

“The Merkez is my favourite place in town, because the food is great,"" he says.

The restaurants offer Galip and others their pick from a variety of choices listed on their menus including kebabs, chicken, soup, rice and salads.

Ozturk says: “The tradition has always been here, even 70 years ago. For us it was a natural thing to do, something we learned from our elders.”

For us it was a natural thing to do, something we learned from our elders - Mehmet Ozturk, restaurant manager

According to residents, the tradition first started in the 1940s at the Merkez restaurant, one of the first eateries in town, when the former owners started offering free meals to those in need every day. The practice was quickly picked up by other restaurants in the area.

“I remember Hacı Huseyin, the former owner of the restaurant, and witnessed his enthusiasm when I was waiting tables at a very young age. He used to look for needy people to feed on the streets, bring them in groups to the restaurant sometimes three, sometimes five times a day,” Ozturk says.

In 1982, Ozturk’s older brothers returned from Germany where they worked and made a decent living. They bought the Merkez restaurant from the former owner to start a family business. Ozturk eventually became the sole owner of the eatery.

'Altı boluk'

There are about five large restaurants in the quaint but surprisingly vibrant town centre, and each one honours the philanthropic tradition. Individuals receiving free food tend to be regulars, familiar faces who visit the restaurant to have at least two meals a day.

Ozturk says that a large margin of the regular diners suffer from disabilities, such as mental illness. But for the restaurant owner, hosting new faces, including those visiting the town from neighbouring Bingol and Tunceli, is a gratifying part of the experience.

Hasan Gulbasan (C) poses with the customers of Saray restaurant in Karakoçan, Turkey (MEE/Zeyneb Varol) Karakocan’s restaurants have even invented a special name for patrons who eat free of charge to avoid using the word “poor”. Any customer who says that they are among the altı boluk (six divisions), a sub-division of an army regiment, can leave the restaurant without any further explanation when the cheque comes.

According to residents, the name alti boluk has an Ottoman link, referring to the Kapıkulu Suvarileri (also known as the six divisions), who were the Sultan’s household cavalry and were not allowed to have families, run businesses or build any emotional bonds to anyone other than the Sultan himself.

The generosity goes beyond feeding the six divisions, as restaurants also offer feasts for free for the whole town on Islamic holidays including Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and throughout the holy month of Ramadan.

Blessings

Hasan Gulbasan, whose family has deep roots to the town dating back many generations, started working as a dishwasher when he was 14. He has since managed five different restaurants in Karakocan and now serves as the owner of the restaurant Saray Lokantasi.

Hasan Gulbasan poses inside his restaurant Saray Lokantası in Karakoçan, Turkey (MEE/Zeyneb Varol) Gulbasan says he started to receive calls from strangers across Turkey who wanted to thank him after learning of the tradition. “I tell them what we do is not unique. Inviting the poor does not have a slight effect on my earnings, if anything it brings barakah (blessings).""

Inviting the poor does not have a slight effect on my earnings, if anything it brings barakah (blessings) - Hasan Gulbasan, restaurant owner

Locals say that the Muslim-majority town cultivates the belief that helping those in need will bring barakah, an Islamic principle of reciprocity that suggests the more blessings you give, the more you will receive.

The 65-year-old veteran says the practice is only one example of the town’s long history of giving. He talks proudly about how Karakocan launched large-scale campaigns to send aid to Syria’s Aleppo last year, as well as to the victims of the Van earthquake in southeast Turkey in 2011 that killed over 500 and left tens of thousands homeless.

“No matter who you ask in Elazig, they will tell you about Karakocan’s generosity,” Gulbasan says.

The rich feel responsible

A significantly more affluent town than the rest of Elazig, Karakocan has become home to wealthy business owners. Most of them fund their work with remittances from expat relatives living in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Austria.

We recently asked a restaurant to provide food for a poor family and place it on the governorate’s account. They declined - Celal Kaya, district official

“People here all have at least one relative in Europe who sends remittances regularly. You can easily recognise the prosperity in the town after visiting the central districts of Elazıg for a comparison,” says Celal Kaya, a district official and the head of the Union of Providing Services to Villages.

Kaya, whose job requires visits to the 89 residential areas of Karakocan to ensure that essential services are being delivered, says the rich feel the responsibility to support the less fortunate, and that the town has established a welfare social system on its own.

“We recently asked a restaurant to provide food for a poor family and place it on the governorate’s account. They declined and assumed all the expenses for the family,” Kaya said.

Changing dynamics

Karakocan continues to maintain its famous hospitality and generosity thanks to the flow of foreign currency coming from migrant relatives. The locals even jokingly claim that they were the only ones who were not affected by the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey.

However, worried locals say the town’s dynamics are undergoing a change. The second and the third generations of those who left Karakocan for a better future in Europe in the 70s and 80s do not visit the town like their parents. Instead, they are opting to spend summer holidays in the Turkish resort cities of Antalya and İzmir.

“As these strong ties are slowly vanishing, the workers’ remittances will cease eventually,” Kaya says.

“That side of the story is a little concerning,” Kaya asserts. “There is not a single family here who does not receive remittances from Europe and they are heavily dependent on their relatives.""

Kaya explains that many of the relatives living in Europe have become partners in businesses in Karakocan but they also send a lot of money to help their families, as well as for investment purposes.

The economic resources that secure the level of prosperity in Karakocan might be precarious, but the culture of extending a helping hand has deep roots in society to the extent that locals refuse to label helping others as charity, but as “one’s religious and human duty""."

Twin Cities Doctor Creates $50 EpiPen Alternative,http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/09/13/epipen-alternative/,"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Dr. Douglas McMahon, with the Allergy and Asthma Center of Minnesota in Eagan, has created an Epinephrine (EpiPen) alternative that he is trying to get on the market.

“I’ve been working on this for many years,” McMahon said. “I actually have severe food allergies myself, so I’ve need to carry an Epinephrine device for many years. Throughout that process I’ve realized the current device is really big and cumbersome, to the point where I hardly ever carried it.”

He says you never know when you are going to have a severe reaction, so it is important to keep the medicine with you at all times.

He says he started tinkering around his lab several years ago and created a smaller device, which he calls AllergyStop.

“By chance I came to realize how inexpensive the parts were, including the medicine, and I realized we can sell it to patients for a very reasonable cost,” McMahon said.

A double pack of EpiPens is currently being sold for $600 by the device maker Mylan. They were sold for $57 in 2007.

MacMahon is in the process of raising millions of dollars to get AllergyStop to patients.

“It cost an incredible amount of money and time and effort,” McMahon said. “I have a patent on my device and one of these advisors says, ‘It probably doesn’t even matter because it’s so hard to take a product to market, you really won’t have any competitors.'”

McMahon needs to take AllergyStop through “human factor” studies to pass FDA standards. The tests will make sure the medicine inside his device stays sterile and potent for a certain period of time.

It is also exposed to heat, cold and sunlight. He says the testing will cost around $2 million. He is taking bids right now from manufactures to produce AllergyStop.

McMahon says companies like Mylan may have lost sight of patient needs and are catering to investors. He believes that is why we are seeing these skyrocketing prices for EpiPens.

“I’m a patient that uses this device and I would prescribe this device, so I know both sides of the field,” McMahon said.

He started a fundraising campaign one month ago using Indiegogo.com. Funding has been slow.

He says he plans to open up AllergyStop to investors, but hopes he does not run into issues, like investors looking to jack up the price from $50."

"Forests are spreading in the rich world. ""In 1990 28% of Spain was forested; now the proportion is 37%.""",https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/12/12/why-forests-are-spreading-in-the-rich-world?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/whyforestsarespreadingintherichworldtheeconomistexplains,"FORESTS in countries like Brazil and Congo get a lot of attention from conservationists, and it is easy to see why. South America and sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing deforestation on an enormous scale: every year almost 5m hectares are lost, net. But forests are also changing in rich Western countries. They are growing larger, both in the sense that they occupy more land and that the trees in them are bigger. What is going on?

Forests are spreading in almost all Western countries, with the fastest growth in places that historically had rather few trees. In 1990 28% of Spain was forested; now the proportion is 37%. In both Greece and Italy, the growth was from 26% to 32% over the same period. Forests are gradually taking more land in America and Australia. Perhaps most astonishing is the trend in Ireland. Roughly 1% of that country was forested when it became independent in 1922. Now forests cover 11% of the land, and the government wants to push the proportion to 18% by the 2040s.

Two things are fertilising this growth. The first is the abandonment of farmland, especially in high, parched places where nothing grows terribly well. When farmers give up trying to eke out a living from olives or sheep, trees simply move in. The second is government policy and subsidy. Governments have protected and promoted forests for diverse reasons, ranging from the need for wooden warships to a desire to promote suburban house-building. Increasingly they welcome forests because they are carbon sinks. The justifications change; the desire for more trees remains constant.

The greening of the West does not delight everyone. Farmers complain that land is being taken out of use by generously subsidised tree plantations. (They get subsidies, too, but the ones for tree-planting are especially generous.) Parts of Spain and Portugal are afflicted by terrible forest fires. These burn especially hot in areas with lots of eucalyptus trees—an Australian import that was planted for its pulp but has spread of its own accord. Others simply dislike the appearance of conifer forests planted in neat rows. They will have to get used to the trees, however. The growth of Western forests seems almost as inexorable as deforestation elsewhere."

"Michigan girls escape kidnap attempt by fighting, throwing hot coffee on suspect",https://abcnews.go.com/US/michigan-girls-escape-kidnap-attempt-fighting-throwing-hot/story?id=57163812,"Michigan girls escape kidnap attempt by fighting, throwing hot coffee on suspect The girls were leaving a convenience store when they were attacked.

Police in Michigan say four girls managed to fight off a man who assaulted them over the weekend by throwing hot coffee on him.

The girls, ages 11 to 14, were leaving a gas station convenience store in Millington, Michigan, last week when a man grabbed one of the girls by the hair and attempted to kidnap her, according to police.

Officers with the Millington Police Department said the suspect, identified as 22-year-old Bruce Hipkins, followed the girls last Friday night and eventually grabbed one them “around the head and told her she was coming with him.”

“The other three girls kicked, hit, and threw their hot coffee on him,” the department said in a statement Saturday. “The suspect let the young girl go and grabbed another one of the girls by her hair. The suspect was again kicked and hit by the girls until he let her go and fled on foot.”

Two of the girls, sisters Allison, 11, and Lauren Eickhoff, 13, described the scary ordeal in an interview with Flint ABC affiliate WJRT on Monday.

""He said, 'You're coming with me.' And like, he grabbed my face,"" Allison added. ""This cannot be happening; I thought it was a test at first, but then I'm like, 'This is real.'""

Lauren said she screamed and immediately jumped into action. She said their father told them to fight back whenever they felt they might be in danger.

""I grabbed my drink and chucked it at his head. I tried, I punched him in the head,"" Lauren said. “Seeing that your little sister was going to get taken is very scary.""

The girls escaped to a nearby hotel and called for help. There were no injuries reported.

Officers caught up with Hipkins later on and arrested him on charges of unlawful imprisonment, assault and battery and two counts of criminal sexual conduct, police said.

Hipkins is being held at the Tuscola County Jail on a $250,000 bond. It was unclear if he had obtained an attorney as of early Tuesday."
single Dad takes in the terminally ill foster kids no one else will,http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-foster-father-sick-children-2017-story.html,"The children were going to die.

Mohamed Bzeek knew that. But in his more than two decades as a foster father, he took them in anyway — the sickest of the sick in Los Angeles County’s sprawling foster care system.

He has buried about 10 children. Some died in his arms.

Now, Bzeek spends long days and sleepless nights caring for a bedridden 6-year-old foster girl with a rare brain defect. She’s blind and deaf. She has daily seizures. Her arms and legs are paralyzed.

Bzeek, a quiet, devout Libyan-born Muslim who lives in Azusa, just wants her to know she’s not alone in this life.

“I know she can’t hear, can’t see, but I always talk to her,” he said. “I’m always holding her, playing with her, touching her. … She has feelings. She has a soul. She’s a human being.”

He’s the only one that would take a child who would possibly not make it. Melissa Testerman, Department of Children and Family Services intake coordinator

Of the 35,000 children monitored by the county’s Department of Children and Family Services, there are about 600 children at any given time who fall under the care of the department’s Medical Case Management Services, which serves those with the most severe medical needs, said Rosella Yousef, an assistant regional administrator for the unit.

There is a dire need for foster parents to care for such children.

And there is only one person like Bzeek.

“If anyone ever calls us and says, ‘This kid needs to go home on hospice,’ there’s only one name we think of,” said Melissa Testerman, a DCFS intake coordinator who finds placements for sick children. “He’s the only one that would take a child who would possibly not make it.”

Typically, she said, children with complex conditions are placed in medical facilities or with nurses who have opted to become foster parents.

But Bzeek is the only foster parent in the county known to take in terminally ill children, Yousef said. Though she knows the single father is stretched thin caring for the girl, who requires around-the-clock care, Yousef still approached him at a department Christmas party in December and asked if he could possibly take in another sick child.

This time, Bzeek politely declined.

The girl sits propped up with pillows in the corner of Bzeek’s living room couch. She has long, thin brown hair pulled into a ponytail and perfectly arched eyebrows over unseeing gray eyes.

Because of confidentiality laws, the girl is not being identified. But a special court order allowed The Times to spend time at Bzeek’s home and to interview people involved in his foster daughter’s case.

The girl’s head is too small for her 34-pound body, which is too small for her age. She was born with an encephalocele, a rare malformation in which part of her brain protruded through an opening in her skull, according to Dr. Suzanne Roberts, the girl’s pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Neurosurgeons removed the protruding brain tissue shortly after her birth, but much of her brain remains undeveloped.

She has been in Bzeek’s care since she was a month old. Before her, he cared for three other children with the same condition.

“These kids, it’s a life sentence for them,” he said.

Bzeek, 62, is a portly man with a long, dark beard and a soft voice. The oldest of 10 children, he came to this country from Libya as a college student in 1978.

Years later, through a mutual friend, he met a woman named Dawn, who would become his wife. She had become a foster parent in the early 1980s, before she met Bzeek. Her grandparents had been foster parents, and she was inspired by them, Bzeek said. Before she met Bzeek, she opened her home as an emergency shelter for foster children who needed immediate placement or who were placed in protective custody.

The key is, you have to love them like your own. Mohamed Bzeek

Dawn Bzeek fell in love with every child she took in. She took them to professional holiday photo sessions, and she organized Christmas gift donation drives for foster children.

She was funny, Bzeek said during a recent drive home from the hospital. She was absolutely terrified of spiders and bugs, so much that even Halloween decorations creeped her out — but she was never scared by the children’s illnesses or the possibility that she would die, Bzeek said.

The Bzeeks opened their Azusa home to dozens of children. They taught classes on foster parenting — and how to handle a child’s illness and death — at community colleges. Dawn Bzeek was such a highly regarded foster mother that her name appeared on statewide task forces for improving foster care alongside doctors and policymakers.

Bzeek started caring for foster children with Dawn in 1989, he said. Often, the children were ill.

Mohamed Bzeek first experienced the death of a foster child in 1991. She was the child of a farm worker who was pregnant when she breathed in toxic pesticides sprayed by crop dusters. She was born with a spinal disorder, wore a full body cast and wasn’t yet a year old when she died on July 4, 1991, as the Bzeeks prepared dinner.

“This one hurt me so badly when she died,” Bzeek said, glancing at a photograph of a tiny girl in a frilly white dress, lying in a coffin surrounded by yellow flowers.

By the mid-1990s, the Bzeeks decided to specifically care for terminally ill children who had do-not-resuscitate orders because no one else would take them in.

There was the boy with short-gut syndrome who was admitted to the hospital 167 times in his eight-year life. He could never eat solid food, but the Bzeeks would sit him at the dinner table, with his own empty plate and spoon, so he could sit with them as a family.

There was the girl with the same brain condition as Bzeek’s current foster daughter, who lived for eight days after they brought her home. She was so tiny that when she died a doll maker made an outfit for her funeral. Bzeek carried her coffin in his hands like a shoe box.

“The key is, you have to love them like your own,” Bzeek said recently. “I know they are sick. I know they are going to die. I do my best as a human being and leave the rest to God.”

“I know she can’t hear, can’t see, but I always talk to her,” Mohamed Bzeek says. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)

Bzeek’s only biological son, Adam, was born in 1997 — with brittle bone disease and dwarfism. He was a child so fragile that changing his diaper or his socks could break his bones.

Bzeek said he was never angry about his own son’s disabilities. He loved him all the same.

“That’s the way God created him,” Bzeek said.

Now 19, Adam weighs about 65 pounds and has big brown eyes and a shy grin. When at home, he gets around the house on a body skateboard that his father made for him out of a miniature ironing board, zooming across the wood floor, steering with his hands.

Adam studies computer science at Citrus College, driving his electric wheelchair to class. He’s the smallest student in class, Bzeek said, “but he’s a fighter.”

Advertisement

Adam’s parents never glossed over how sick his foster siblings were, and they told him the children were going to eventually die, Bzeek said. They accepted death as part of life — something that made the small joys of living all the more meaningful.

“I love my sister,” the shy teenager said of the foster girl. “Nobody should have to go through so much pain.”

About 2000, Dawn Bzeek, once such an active advocate for foster children, became ill. She suffered from powerful seizures that would leave her weak for days. She could hardly leave the house because she didn’t want to collapse in public.

The frustrations of her illness wore on her, Bzeek said. There was stress in the marriage, and she and Bzeek split in 2013. She died a little over a year later.

Advertisement

Bzeek chokes up when he talks about her. When it came to facing the difficulties of the children’s illnesses, the knowledge that they would die, she was always the stronger one, he said.

:::

On a chilly November morning, Bzeek pushed the girl’s wheelchair and the IV pole that carries her feeding formula into Children’s Hospital on Sunset Boulevard. She was wrapped in a soft pink blanket, her head resting on a pillow with the stitched words: “Dad is like duct tape holding our home together.”

The temperatures had been bouncing up and down that week, and the girl had a cold. Her brain cannot fully regulate her body temperature, so one leg was hot while the other was cold.

On the elevator, her face glowed bright red as she coughed, her throat filled with phlegm, screaming for air. People in the elevator looked away.

Bzeek rubbed her cheek playfully and held her hand, waving it playfully. “Heeeey, mama,” he cooed in her ear, calming her down.

For Bzeek, the hospital has become a second home. When he’s not here, he’s often on the phone with her many doctors, the insurers who fight over who’s paying for it all, the lawyers who represent her and her social workers. Any time they leave the house together, he carries a thick black binder filled with her medical records and pages of medications.

Still, Bzeek — who had to be licensed through the county to care for medically fragile children and receives about $1,700 a month for her care — is not able to make medical decisions for her.

Roberts entered the exam room, smiling at the girl’s frilly socks and brown dress with fall-colored leaves.

“There’s our princess,” the doctor said. “She’s in her pretty dress, as always.”

Roberts has known Bzeek for years and has seen many of his foster children. By the time this girl was age 2, Roberts said, doctors said there were no more interventions to improve her condition.

“Nobody ever wants to give up,” she said. “But we had run through the options.”

Advertisement

But the girl, who is hooked to feeding and medication tubes at least 22 hours a day, has lived as long as she has because of Bzeek, the doctor said.

“When she’s not sick and in a good mood, she’ll cry to be held,” Roberts said. “She’s not verbal, but she can make her needs known. … Her life is not complete suffering. She has moments where she’s enjoying herself and she’s pretty content, and it’s all because of Mohamed.”

Other than trips to the hospital and Friday prayers at the mosque — when the day nurse watches her — Bzeek rarely leaves the house.

To avoid choking, the girl sleeps sitting up. Bzeek sleeps on a second couch next to hers. He doesn’t sleep much.

:::

On a Saturday in early December, Bzeek, Adam and the girl’s nurse, Marilou Terry, had a celebratory lunch for the child’s sixth birthday. He invited her biological parents. They didn’t come.

Bzeek crouched in front of the girl — wearing a long, red-and-white dress and matching socks — and held her hands, clapping them together.

“Yay!” he said, cheerfully. “You are 6! 6! 6!”

Bzeek lit six birthday candles in a cheesecake and sat the girl on the kitchen table, holding the cake near her face so she could feel the warmth of the flames.

As they sang “Happy Birthday,” Bzeek leaned over her left shoulder, his beard gently brushing the side of her face. She smelled the smoke, and a small smile crossed her face.

During a routine check-up last year, Dr. Harlyn Susarla, ordered a panoramic X-ray for Hunter Rose Jones, then 4, when she noticed the child had several loose teeth, which was unusual for her age, ABC affiliate KOMO News reported. The Washington-based dentist then discovered a tumor growing in the child’s jaw.

“I was freaked out,” the girl’s mother, Kara Jones, told the outlet. “I was at the dentist. You don’t — tumor? No.”

That September, Hunter began treatment at Seattle Children’s Hospital, where she was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer that often starts in the abdominal area, according to the Everett Herald.

Hunter’s father told KOMO News that doctors also found a tumor in their daughter’s abdomen, where the cancer had originated, and that it had “spread to her hip as well.”

Over the next 140 days, Hunter underwent a variety of treatments at the hospital, including two tumor removals, five rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants, according to KOMO News.

Although the aggressive treatment has caused Hunter hearing loss, she is now cancer-free.

“The fact that this was something that was found in the dental chair – I’m grateful that I saw this and that she was able to get the care and the treatment that she needed,” Dr. Susarla told KOMO News. “Honestly, I probably think about her every day.”

Although Hunter is currently in remission, her family has created a GoFundMe to help raise funds for her continuing treatment, which could include a possible 12-month trial in New York City.

Eighteen months after her life-changing visit to the dentist, Hunter and her family returned to thank Dr. Susarla, who presented Hunter with her own certificate, naming the child as an honorary member of the “cavity-free club.”"
Member of India's lowest caste expected to be elected president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/17/india-ram-nath-kovind-dalit-caste-presidential-election,"Ram Nath Kovind, nominee of Narendra Modi’s party, is from dalit (Untouchable) community, the country’s most oppressed

A member of India’s poorest and most oppressed caste is expected to be elected president.

Ram Nath Kovind, the governor of Bihar until last month, was announced as the nominee of Narendra Modi’s government in June, in what was widely seen as part of a decades-long strategy by Hindu nationalists to win over members of the dalit (Untouchable) community.

Nearly 5,000 Indian state and federal members of parliament took part in a secret nationwide ballot on Monday to decide the next president using specially designed violet ink pens with unique serial numbers.

The five-year post has significant responsibility under India’s constitution, but similar to other Westminster-style governments, it is largely ceremonial in practice.

India's caste system: ‘They are trying to erase dalit history. This is a martyrdom, a sacrifice’ Read more

The result of the collective parliamentary votes will not be known until Thursday, but Kovind, 71, has secured wide cross-party support and is expected to comfortably beat Meira Kumar, the former diplomat and MP nominated by the opposition Congress party and its allies.

Kovind and Kumar are dalits, highlighting the community’s symbolic and electoral significance.

Dalits, officially known as scheduled castes, were traditionally thought to fall outside the four castes that determined the shape of Hindu lives, from jobs and diets to marriage prospects.

As a result, they were considered “impure” and banished to the periphery of Indian society, suffering thousands of years of exclusion and extreme poverty that affirmative action programmes in the past 70 years have done little to address.

In historical examples popularised by the dalit leader BR Ambedkar, members of the caste in one village were forced to wear spittoons around their necks to collect their impure saliva, while in another, they had to tie branches to their waists “so as not to leave any unclean footprints”.

Badri Raina, a Delhi University professor for four decades, said winning dalit support had become essential to the vision of Hindu unity promoted by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party.

The BJP argues that India’s culture and institutions are inherently Hindu in nature, a premise that dalits have traditionally eyed with suspicion, seeing in the party’s platform the priorities of the same upper-caste Hindus who oppressed them.

Propelled by canny politics and Modi’s charisma, the BJP has recently made inroads into segments of the dalit community, but faces significant hurdles, especially when it comes to the key party priority of cow protection.

“Dalit livelihoods have been predominantly dependent on the cattle industry, both for nutrition and the leather market, yet there, the BJP has made no concessions,” Raina said.



In Gujarat last year, seven young dalit men who skinned a dead cow, an “unclean” role traditionally carried out by members of the caste, were filmed being publicly flogged by self-styled cow vigilantes, triggering significant protests.

Meat industry regulations introduced in May banning the market sale of cows and other livestock for slaughter are also thought to have hit dalits hardest, along with Muslims, another of India’s poorest social groups.

In May, an advance team for the BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, reportedly gave dalit villagers soap and asked them to clean themselves before an official visit.

If elected, Kovind would be the second dalit president after KR Narayan, who held the post for five years from 1997."
Australia slashes plastic bag use by 80 percent in just 3 months,https://nypost.com/2018/12/05/australia-slashes-plastic-bag-use-by-80-percent-in-just-3-months/,"Down Under is overcoming plastic pollution.

In only three months, Australia has cut its plastic bag usage by 80 percent, according to the country’s National Retail Association.

Over the summer, two of Australia’s largest supermarket chains — Woolworths and Coles — announced the ban of single-use plastics in their stores in the Australian states of Queensland and Western Australian.

Australia has approached the phase-out of lightweight plastic bags on a regional level, rather than national. Tasmania and South Australia have previously banned plastic bags and Victoria is expected to enact a ban sometime in 2019. New South Wales – the country’s most populated state – is the only region without any pending plans.

The chains said the ban was initially met with such outrage that Woolworths experienced flailing sales. And one Coles shopper was reportedly so frustrated he couldn’t get a free plastic bag that he threatened an employee and grabbed him by the throat. This led to Coles sporadically backtracking on the 11-cent tax for a reusable plastic bag and handing them out for free, citing customers’ struggle to adjust. (They’ve since reinstated the tax.)

But, customers have since adjusted and the ban has proven successful — preventing as many as 1.5 billion bags from polluting the environment.

“Retailers deserve an enormous amount of kudos for leading the way on one of the most significant changes to consumer behavior in generations and we also applaud shoppers for embracing this environmental initiative,” David Stout, manager of industry policy at the National Retail Association, said in a statement.

Throughout the world, at least 32 countries — 18 in Africa — have plastic bag bans in place, according to ReuseThisBag. In June, Chile became the first country in the Americas to ban plastic bags. California and Hawaii are the only US states with a plastic bag ban. However, a handful of states have a mandatory recycling or reuse program.

A Girl Scout troop in Narberth, Pennsylvania recently helped pass legislation to ban straws and tax plastic bags, making the small town the first in the state to ban single-use plastics.

“Everyone delivering things in a package needs to take responsibility for what they deliver it in,” Stout said. “I think there’s going to be a lot more pressure on all of us to be more aware of what we consume.”"

Sweden to reach its 2030 renewable energy target this year,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/sweden-to-reach-its-2030-renewable-energy-target-this-year,"Image: Swedish Energy Agency

Sweden is on target to meet one of its renewable energy targets years ahead of schedule, and it’s thanks in part to wind turbines.



In 2012, Norway and Sweden reached a joint agreement to increase their production of electricity from renewable energy sources by 28.4 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2020.

Sweden then increased its target, with the aim of adding another 18 TWh by 2030.

Taking into account the number of wind turbines already built, plus planned wind turbine investments for the remainder of the year, Sweden is on track to hit its 2030 target - possibly by the end of the year.

Sweden’s energy target

By the end of 2018, Sweden will have installed 3,681 turbines, with a capacity of 7,506 MW and an estimated annual production of 19.8 TWh.

“After the decision on the increase in ambition was reached, a lot of investment decisions have been taken and many wind turbines are set to be completed in the upcoming years,” Markus​ Selin, analyst at the Swedish Energy Agency, told the World Economic Forum.

According to the Agency, the ambitious targets set for renewables production are now well within reach.

“15.2 TWh of renewable energy projects are in construction today, of which 11.6 TWh is wind power,” he added.

“The joint goal of 28.4 TWh will be exceeded by about 10 TWh. This leaves about 8.7 TWh of the Swedish ambition increase of 18 TWh.”

Energy goals

Sweden has ambitious goals for energy and climate adaptation. It has set a target of 50% more efficient energy use by 2030, and 100% renewable energy production by 2040.

It also has a target of net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2045.

As part of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the EU set a renewable energy directive that sets a binding target of 20% final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020.

The vast majority of EU countries are well on track to reach their 2020 binding targets for renewable energy.

The global picture



Since 2010, global installed renewables capacity has been increasing steadily at about 8 to 9% annually, which is more than double the average growth for non-renewables.

In 2017 alone, an additional 167 GW of renewable capacity was installed globally. That is enough to power a country the size of Brazil. The biggest increases were seen in wind and solar."
End of fillings in sight as scientists find Alzheimer's medicine makes teeth grow back,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/01/09/end-fillings-sight-scientists-find-alzheimers-drug-makes-teeth/,"Fillings could be consigned to history after scientists discovered that a drug already trialled in Alzheimer's patients can encourage tooth regrowth and repair cavities.

Researchers at King's College London found that the drug Tideglusib stimulates the stem cells contained in the pulp of teeth so that they generate new dentine – the mineralised material under the enamel.

Teeth already have the capability of regenerating dentine if the pulp inside the tooth becomes exposed through a trauma or infection, but can only naturally make a very thin layer, and not enough to fill the deep cavities caused by tooth decay."
Guy Fieri Raises More Than $20 Million for Restaurant Workers Affected by Coronavirus,https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/guy-fieri-raises-more-than-20-million-for-restaurant-workers-affected-by-coronavirus-1234602930/,"The Mayor of Flavortown is giving back to restaurant workers around the country.

Guy Fieri has helped raise more than $20 million by partnering with the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, he announced in an interview with TMZ. He and the organization have been sending restaurant workers $500 grants through the newly created Restaurant Employee Relief Fund.

After less than two months, Fieri has awarded more than 40,000 grants. During the interview on Thursday, he said the total amount they have raised is $21.5 million.

“I started thinking about my brothers and sisters in the restaurant business, and a bunch of restaurants that I was closing — we gotta do something,” he said.

The “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” star said he personally reached out to several food service companies, like Pepsi, Coke and Uber Eats, to donate money to the charitable cause.

“I started sending personal video invitations to all the heavy-hitter CEOs that are involved in the restaurant business,” he said. “As long as the money comes in, we’re going to continue to give these grants.”

Most restaurants and bars around the country have been closed in the wake of the shelter-in-place rules during the coronavirus pandemic. Certain locations have been able to stay in business with curbside pickup and delivery, and more seek to reopen as the restrictions relax. Fieri urged people to order from small, mom-and-pop restaurants and show their support.

“They need your takeout, they need your delivery so if they’re available, please go give them some biz,” he said. “It helps pay the electricity and the insurance.”"
"France wants to ban sale of gas and diesel cars by 2040, end coal by 2022",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/07/france-wants-to-ban-sale-of-gas-and-diesel-cars-by-2040-end-coal-by-2022/,"In an address on Thursday, France’s environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, said that the country would aim to phase out electricity from coal-fired plants by 2022 and end the sale of gas and diesel internal combustion cars by 2040.

This first goal should be relatively easy to attain. France relies heavily on nuclear energy—more than 70 percent of the country’s energy mix is nuclear—and coal-fired plants only contribute to around four percent of France’s electric production. Hulot also said that he hoped to reduce the amount of nuclear energy in the country’s energy mix down to 50 percent by 2025, although, according to Le Monde, the environment minister admitted he does “not have all the answers.”

In addition, Hulot noted a law would be proposed later this year to potentially end any new operating licenses for oil, gas, and coal mining.

The automotive goal is more of a stretch. Although details on how the French government would do this are scarce, Le Monde reports that part of the plan will involve offering money to qualifying households to replace their pre-1997 gasoline or pre-2001 diesel cars.

Hulot called the end of the sale of gas and diesel cars “a public health agenda” and mentioned Volvo’s recent commitment to only sell electric or hybrid vehicles by 2019. Engadget notes that the French government owns a considerable stake in PSA, owner of Peugeot and Citroen, as well as Renault. Regulators could potentially affect auto manufacturer operations through internal pressure. Hulot didn’t say whether plug-in hybrid electric vehicles would be factored into the ban or not. The minister admitted that achieving the goal would likely burden automakers.

Recent numbers from Germany reflect how daunting moving a country’s transportation sector away from fossil fuels can be. And an International Energy Agency report from June noted that, without government incentives, getting people to buy electric vehicles is especially challenging.

On the other hand, a report from Bloomberg Energy Finance released this week suggests that electric vehicles will outsell internal combustion vehicles in 20 years, due to falling battery prices. “The Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast says adoption of emission-free vehicles will happen more quickly than previously estimated because the cost of building cars is falling so fast,” Bloomberg wrote. “The seismic shift will see cars with a plug account for a third of the global auto fleet by 2040 and displace about eight million barrels a day of oil production—more than the seven million barrels Saudi Arabia exports today.”"
"Australian man finds 624g gold nugget worth $37,000 while walking dog",https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12230581,"An Australian family have literally struck gold after finding a valuable gold nugget during a Mother's Day outing.

The family from Bendigo in Victoria, who asked to remain anonymous, were walking their dog — fittingly named Lucky — on the outskirts of town on Sunday morning when the daughter kicked something hard lying on the ground.

At first, the father and his two daughters were unsure of what they had found — but it has since been confirmed by experts as a 624 gram gold nugget with an estimated value of at least $35,000 ($37,000).

""I actually walked right past it but my daughter pretty much kicked it as she was walking. She then goes — dad, is this gold? I said, I think it might be,"" the father told the Bendigo Advertiser.

The stunned family first took their find to an IGA supermarket to weigh it, with the rock coming in at 624 grams, or 20 ounces.

The father said he had been informed the nugget would likely be worth more than the A$35,000 estimate if it was sold whole, and that he did plan to sell it eventually.

He said the unexpected windfall had come at a crucial time.

""We've come on some tough times so it's really good because we've been struggling financially. It couldn't be better timing really,"" he told the Bendigo Advertiser.

""Just having it at home, I've been like where do we store it? I haven't been sleeping very well and we think it's best just to sell it.""

He said the ""really random find"" had inspired the family to return to the site and look for more gold lying beneath the surface.

""Usually when you find a nugget that big, there will be more gold around so hopefully that's the case,"" he told the publication.

However, it's not the first time an Aussie has struck it rich.

Last September, a huge gold nugget worth at least A$110,000 was uncovered by a retired prospector in remote Western Australia.

That find weighed in at a hefty 3.23 kilograms and was dubbed ""Duck's Foot"" because of its unique shape.

And in 2017, Surfers Paradise gold digger Greg Cooke made headlines after finding several gold nuggets on a northern Gold Coast beach over several visits.

In fact, Australia is famous for its treasure trove of gold nuggets, with eight of the world's 10 largest found in the country over the years.

The ""Welcome Stranger"" nugget, pictured below, weighing between 2380 and 2284 ounces, is the biggest ever found on the planet and was discovered at Moliagul, near Dunolly in Victoria, in 1869."
"People are reporting sightings of the Tasmanian tiger, thought to be extinct",https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/10/16/australia/tasmanian-tiger-intl-hnk-scli/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=fbCNN&utm_content=2019-10-16T12%3A30%3A14&fbclid=IwAR3cUPdnDYJaXkfd85_4zhM14BzU9OIoiUi07CzNN8aBvk61qehbdKW9qqs&fbclid=IwAR3o95UnId_2H5w6TtxGKXDrqFX0pdfNxCRBeZtcsmSZgpqA0ExbR-1MUAg&r=http%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com&rm=1,"(CNN) The Tasmanian tiger, a large striped carnivore, is believed to have gone extinct over 80 years ago -- but newly released Australian government documents show sightings have been reported as recently as two months ago.

Tasmania's Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) recently released a document detailing eight reported sightings of the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, in the last three years.

The thylacine, a marsupial that looked like a cross between a wolf, a fox, and a large cat, is believed to have gone extinct after the last known live animal died in captivity in 1936. It had yellowish brown fur, with powerful jaws and a pouch for its young, according to the Australian Museum

While stories abound that some continue to live in the remote wilds of Tasmania, an island state off Australia's south coast, there has been no hard evidence to support this -- only claims of sightings, like the ones newly released.

One report last February said that two people, visiting Tasmania from Australia, were driving when an animal with a stiff tail and striped back walked onto the road.

"Iranian Maryam Mirzakhani Becomes the first woman in history to win the Fields Medal (Often considered the ""Nobel Prize of Mathematics"")",http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/08/maryam-mirzakhani-first-woman-fields-medal-mathematics,"For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis, the election, and more, subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter.





On Wednesday, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first woman in 78 years to be awarded the prestigious Fields Medal, considered the highest honor in mathematics. She was selected for “stunning advances in the theory of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.”

The Fields Medal is awarded every four years by the International Mathematical Union to outstanding mathematicians under 40 who show promise of future achievement. With the announcement of Mirzakhani and this year’s other awardees—Arthur Avila, Manjul Bhargava, and Martin Hairer—there now have been 54 male and 1 female medalists.

Many hope Mirzakhani’s Fields medal is a sign of change to come. “I will be happy if it encourages young female scientists and mathematicians,” she said in a press release. Christiane Rousseau, vice president of the International Mathematics Union, told the Guardian this is “an extraordinary moment” and “a celebration for women,” comparable to Marie Curie’s barrier-breaking Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry in the early 20th century.

And as Canadian math professor Izabella Laba wrote: “Mirzakhani’s selection does exactly nothing to convince me that women are capable of doing mathematical research at the same level as men. I have never had any doubt about that in the first place…What I take from it instead is that we as a society, men and women alike, are becoming better at encouraging and nurturing mathematical talent in women, and more capable of recognizing excellence in women’s work.”

Mirzakhani’s accomplishment is all the more groundbreaking in light of the well-documented disadvantages and biases women face in math and science. According to the National Academy of Sciences, there are no significant biological differences that could explain women’s low representation in STEM academic faculty and leadership positions (although that doesn’t stop prominent people from making claims otherwise.) Instead, NAS says we can thank bias and academia’s “outmoded institutional structures.”

For example, in a 2008 Yale study, professors were asked to rate fictional applicants for a lab manager position. When given an application with a male name at the top, professors rated the candidate more competent and hirable than when given an otherwise identical form with a female name. This bias was found in both male and female faculty members.

And that’s not all women in STEM fields have to contend with: A July report found that a full 64 percent of women in various scientific fields were sexually harassed while doing fieldwork.

These disadvantages—along with a history of men getting the credit for discoveries and inventions made by women—help explain why only 9 to 16 percent of tenure-track positions in math-intensive fields at the top 100 US universities are held by women. According to the American Mathematical Society, the share of women earning Ph.D.s in math has remained stagnant for decades:

(Additional AMS data used in the above chart found here.)

Mirzakhani, who grew up in Iran before earning her Ph.D. at Harvard and becoming a professor at Stanford, told the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2008 that she did not initially realize her strength in math: “I don’t think that everyone should become a mathematician, but I do believe that many students don’t give mathematics a real chance. I did poorly in math for a couple of years in middle school; I was just not interested in thinking about it. I can see that without being excited mathematics can look pointless and cold.”"

Academic writes 270 Wikipedia pages in a year to get female scientists noticed,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jul/24/academic-writes-270-wikipedia-pages-year-female-scientists-noticed,"Jess Wade is a scientist on a mission. She wants every woman who has achieved something impressive in science to get the prominence and recognition they deserve – starting with a Wikipedia entry.

“I’ve done about 270 in the past year,” says Wade, a postdoctoral researcher in the field of plastic electronics at Imperial College London’s Blackett Laboratory. “I had a target for doing one a day, but sometimes I get too excited and do three.”

That science doesn’t attract enough girls and has ground to make up in supporting and celebrating its women can feel like a tired refrain in academia. But Wade’s approach is refreshing and infectious.

“I kind of realised we can only really change things from the inside,” she says. “Wikipedia is a really great way to engage people in this mission because the more you read about these sensational women, the more you get so motivated and inspired by their personal stories.”

Ever since Darwin’s time women have been fighting back. I suddenly realised I can do this: I can change it

Wade went to an all-girls school and, with both her parents being doctors, science was a backdrop to her childhood. She does not recall encountering barriers on her way to gaining a place to study physics as an undergraduate at Imperial. When she started, the course was so tough and she was so focused on doing well, it barely registered that there weren’t many girls around.

It was only as a PhD student that she was struck by how being in a minority can shape day-to-day experiences. “Being isolated is hard – this goes for all underrepresented groups,” she says. “Then there are all those challenges during your PhD that amplify that isolation. If you don’t have anyone you can really get on with around you it’s so, so hard.”

Wade started giving talks at schools and became engaged in outreach to encourage girls to take up science, but quickly became frustrated with much of the work going on under the “women in science” banner.

The projected messages often felt fundamentally negative, such as the “9% is not enough” tagline of a 2016 campaign by the Institution of Engineering and Technology.

“If I heard something was only 9% of girls when I was at school I would’ve been, ‘Like, no’,” says Wade. Worse still was the European commission’s bungled attempt to give science a sexy, feminine makeover in its Science: it’s a girl thing! video, in which three young women prance around on a catwalk while decoding the chemical composition of lipsticks and nail varnish.

“It infuriates me that even for a blink of an eyelid they think that kind of thing will change anything,” Wade tells me through gritted teeth.

Many of the initiatives are backed by a significant amount of funding – Wade estimates £4m to £5m is spent annually on women in science outreach, with big contributions from banks and engineering firms as well as the government. “It’s not just a few academics going out and doing talks in schools, it’s huge investments of money,” she says. Yet there appeared to be little or no evaluation as to whether the projects had achieved their aims – and the evidence was not encouraging.

In the UK, the percentage of female A-level physics students has stagnated at about 21% for the past decade and for computing the proportion of A-level students who are female is just 10%”. In Britain, fewer than 9% of professional engineers are women – a figure that is among the worst globally and which has not increased in the past decade. A recent study suggests it would take 258 years to close the gender gap in physics, based on current rates of progress.

“There’s so much energy, enthusiasm and money going into all these initiatives to get girls into science,” she says. “Absolutely none of them is evidence-based and none of them work. It’s so unscientific, that’s what really surprises me.”

Wade began to look into what had been shown to work best: speaking to parents and teachers, for instance, rather than just focusing solely on pupils.

After seeing the reach achieved by uploading scientific images on to Wikimedia Commons, the free photo-sharing site, she decided to do the same for scientists themselves.

Professor Kim Cobb, a US climate scientist, was her first subject. “She’s super interesting, she does really cool research on corals and she goes diving to collect samples,” she says. Soon after, Wade went to a talk by Susan Goldberg, editor of National Geographic (the first woman to hold this post), who noticed she too lacked a Wikipedia entry. “I thought ‘That’s outrageous’, so I did her page,” she says. Since then she has done hundreds more.

As we weave our way through a labyrinthine intersection between Imperial’s physics and maths buildings, Wade greets a colleague before turning to me to say: “That’s Emma McCoy, the first woman to be a professor of maths here. I made her page.”

There are inevitable critics of the project. Last week she received a message on Twitter from an Oxford PhD student accusing her of using Wikipedia to self-promote and publicise friends. “This is not what Wikipedia is about!” he wrote. “Think about the ... damage you’re causing to the Wiki community!”

She says she “knew he was wrong” but still had a wobble. However, she was met with a surge of online support. And Wade’s subjects, none of whom she had met personally before writing their entry, have been almost universally thrilled. “Professors feel really empowered when they’ve got one,” she says.

Wade’s activism is not limited to online. After reading Angela Saini’s 2017 book, Inferior, which applies scientific scrutiny to claims of sex differences and gender stereotypes, Wade started distributing copies. “I realised that this kind of bias has been penetrating through society for so long,” she says. “Ever since Darwin’s time women have been fighting back. I suddenly realised I can do this: I can change it and I can make sure other people read this too.”

She estimates she has bought and handed out 60 or 70 copies of the book, to friends, family and fellow scientists at international conferences. “About a week ago, Angela said, You’ve got to stop buying them’, and sent me 10 signed copies,” she says, before insisting I leave with a copy.

She relentlessly nominates other women for prizes, including Emma Chapman, an astrophysicist at Imperial, who was awarded the Royal Society’s Athena prize last week, and when I meet her she is surrounded by a huddle of girls on work experience who are shadowing her that day.

What does she ultimately hope to achieve? “I guess it’s to make science a better place for everyone working in it, which happens when we recognise the contributions of these awesome women,” she says. “Then the girls who do come – because they will! – will come to a much more empowering environment.”

"Saudi teen who fled family 'very, very happy to be in her new home' after landing in Toronto, Canada",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/saudi-runaway-woman-1.4976076,"A Saudi teen who was granted asylum in Canada after fleeing from her allegedly abusive family has arrived in Canada.

Her flight from Seoul, South Korea, landed in Toronto a day after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his government would accept 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun as a refugee.

Al-Qunun, wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the word Canada, waved to reporters as she walked through Toronto's Pearson International Airport.

She was accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, who said al-Qunun will be going to her unspecified ""new home.""

""She is obviously very tired after a long journey. And she preferred to go and get settled,"" Freeland said of al-Qunun, who declined to speak to reporters.

Al-Qunun did, however, take some time to pose for photographs with Freeland.

""She wanted Canadians to see that she's here, that she's well and that she is very, very happy to be in her new home,"" Freeland explained.

Social media campaign to #SaveRahaf

The young woman fled her family while visiting Kuwait and flew to Bangkok, where she barricaded herself in an airport hotel and launched a Twitter campaign that drew global attention to her case.

Al-Qunun says her father physically abused her and tried to force her into an arranged marriage.

Her father, who arrived in Bangkok not long before she left, has denied those allegations.

""I'm the girl who ran away to Thailand. I'm now in real danger because the Saudi Embassy is trying to force me to return,"" said an English translation of one of her first posts to Twitter. The teen also wrote that she was afraid and that her family would kill her if she were returned home.

The Twitter hashtag #SaveRahaf ensued, and a photo of her behind a door barricaded with a mattress was seen around the world.

Trudeau announced Friday that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees asked Canada to take al-Qunun as a refugee, and Canada agreed.

""That is something that we are pleased to do because Canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights, to stand up for women's rights around the world,"" Trudeau said.

UNHCR spokeswoman Lauren La Rose praised Canada's willingness to step up and assist in this case, but noted that al-Qunun's situation highlights a need for more interventions around the world.

""Canada has been a great ally and leader in this area, but there needs to be more spaces so that women and girls or anyone that is vulnerable can find a safe third country to resettle in,"" La Rose said.

Starting a life in Canada

COSTI, a Toronto-based non-profit that helps newly arrived immigrants and refugees, will assist al-Qunun as she adjusts to a new life. As a government-sponsored refugee, she will have access to government assistance for up to 12 months.

""This is a young woman who is determined to make a future,"" said Mario Calla, executive director of COSTI.

""It's not going to be all smooth sailing for her, when one considers the fact that she has had to leave her family, to leave a familiar culture and social connections. It's not going to be an easy process for her,"" he added.

According to Calla, al-Qunun has some contacts in the city and has reached out to them. On Saturday afternoon, she went shopping to buy winter clothes.

'A single woman to be in a dangerous situation is one too many' 1:32 Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says Canada believes 'very strongly' that women's rights are human rights 1:32

In the coming days, representatives from COSTI will help her open a bank account, apply for a social insurance number and obtain a health card, Calla explained. Then they will try to find her permanent housing. Calla said he's not sure if she intends to stay in Toronto in the long term.

For now, al-Qunun is staying at a facility that has security guards present at all times.

""We have advised her to be careful about disclosing her location. She's taken a position in terms of leaving Saudi Arabia where some may disagree with her and may have strong opinions about that. We're being careful to protect her from that,"" Calla said.

He added that there may be an increase in asylum seekers using social media as a tool to reach out to governments and agencies to make their case for being granted asylum.

""There are many, many people in desperate situations — desperate in the sense that their lives are in danger. They will do anything to get out of those situations to safety so it may be a tool that some will use,"" he said.

Tensions with Saudi Arabia

The move to accept al-Qunun could serve to heighten tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia.

In August, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman expelled Canada's ambassador and withdrew his own envoy after Freeland used Twitter to call for the release of women's rights activists who had been arrested in the country.

The Saudis also sold Canadian investments and recalled their students from universities in Canada.

But Trudeau appeared unfazed by the possibility that the move could have ill effects, repeating that Canada stands up for human rights regardless of diplomatic consequences.

Freeland echoed that sentiment in comments to reporters Saturday.

""It is absolutely the case that there are many women, far, far too many women, who are in dangerous situations both in Canada and around the world,"" she said.

""But rather than cursing the darkness ... I believe in lighting a single candle and, where we can save a single person, where we can save a single woman, that is a good thing to do.""

A 'dangerous precedent'

However one former diplomat questioned the Canadian government's actions in this instance, saying it sets a ""very dangerous precedent"" for future cases.

David Chatterson served as Canada's ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 2009 to 2011.

""What happens the next time a teenage girl or adult woman from Saudi Arabia that flees her family and declares herself to no longer be a Muslim, does that mean automatic sanctuary? One would almost conclude so from the actions taken in this case,"" he said in an interview with CBC News Network.

He added that the normal process of assessing a refugee claim can take several years in Canada.

""All of that was sort of set aside"" in this case, Chatterson said."

Oregon high school student is making clear face masks so the hearing-impaired can be safe during coronavirus crisis,https://www.oregonlive.com/teamoregon/2020/04/oregon-high-school-student-is-making-clear-face-masks-so-the-hearing-impaired-can-be-safe-during-coronavirus-crisis.html,"Medical experts recommend wearing face masks in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but Sunset High School junior Eric Kim could see a problem.

For those who are hearing impaired and rely on lip-reading, a mask becomes a barrier to communication.

“Everyone knows masks are in a real shortage right now,” Kim said. “Even when I go to the store, I can’t buy a regular mask because they are sold out everywhere.”

Try finding one made out of clear fabric.

Kim, who had a sudden and unexplained loss of hearing in his left ear as a sixth grader, has been a volunteer at the Tucker Maxon School. Tucker Maxon serves hearing-impaired students through the fifth grade.

“I wondered how those kids there would even be able to get masks and communicate so they could live life normally,” Kim said.

At about the same time, Kim saw a CNN report about 21-year-old Ashley Lawrence, who was hand-making clear masks in Kentucky. If she could it, Kim decided, he could too.

Kim contacted Lawrence to get the basics, found some clear fabric at a local Dollar Tree store and, with the aid of his mom’s sewing machine, went to work.

He had no background in sewing but didn’t let that stop him.

“It was a lot harder than I thought,” he said. “It took like three or four hours. The hardest part is outlining the fabric and making room for the clear, fabric square in the middle so people can read lips.

“Also, we had to insert pipe cleaners on the top and bottom to adjust for the noses, so the mask doesn’t fog up.”

He had some early help from his mom, but essentially this was a learn-as-you-go operation.

“It took a lot of mistakes with the materials before I got used to it,” Kim said.

The Dollar Tree only had so much clear fabric. Lately Kim has been going online to replenish.

Kim doesn’t charge for masks and ships them free of charge to anyone who asks. He has sent up a GoFundMe account to pay for materials and shipping.

“We’ve had a lot of small donations from people in the community,” he said.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Kim had sent out 13 completed masks, some to places as far away as New Jersey and San Antonio. The requests haven’t stopped coming.

“As long as people keep requesting, I’ll be making masks whenever I have time,” he said.

Iowa woman honored for fostering more than 600 children,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/11/us/iowa-woman-fostered-600-children-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Linda Herring always wanted a big family. But she never imagined that she would foster more than 600 children and turn her home into a safe haven where every child was given shelter, food, clothing, and most importantly, endless amounts of love.

Now 75 years old, Herring has been fostering children for nearly five decades in Johnson County, Iowa.

Herring and her husband, Bob, began fostering when they lived in Oxford, Iowa, and continued to do so after they moved to Tiffin.

""My best friend was doing foster care for teenage girls and I thought, 'Well, that would be nice to do the same,' but I wanted little kids,"" Herring told CNN. ""So, I talked to the Department of Human Services and agreed to take kids with medical needs.""

As a foster mom, Herring ran a home daycare for local families and worked as a night custodian in a nearby high school. If that wasn't enough, she also volunteered as a first responder for nearly 50 years

Herring was known by everyone in Johnson County for never turning away a child, no matter their age, gender, or special needs, and would regularly travel to pick up foster children who needed a home.

Fostering turned into adopting

Herring is not just a foster mom. For her eight children, three of which were foster children she and Bob adopted, she was just ""Mom.""

One of those children is 39-year-old Anthony Herring. He was 6 months old when he was placed in the Herring household. When he was 3 years old, the Herring family officially adopted him.

""I appreciate being adopted even more today as a parent then I did when I was a child,"" Anthony Herring told CNN. ""I'm forever grateful for the life I was given. She and Dad have both taught me that family isn't determined by blood, it's who you have in your life to love.""

He said that his mom taught him how to appreciate and understand children with special needs.

Linda Herring holds the resolution from the Johnson County Board of Supervisors honoring her for fostering more than 600 children.

Two of Herring's adopted foster children have severe medical and special needs. One of them, Dani, is fully dependent on others for care. While Dani wasn't expected to live long after her birth, she is now 29 years old.

Herring passed on what she likes to call her ""foster care trait."" Four of her biological children have fostered children, and three of them followed their parents' footsteps and adopted kids of their own. Three of her grandchildren fostered children as well.

""It's hard to say in words her impact. She was always available and ready for a child in need. These kids were usually taken from a traumatic situation and she'd take them in, provide a warm bed, clean clothes, warm meals, and love,"" Anthony said.

""She also worked hard to keep families together. Keeping siblings together. Helping biological parents make the changes needed to be able to keep their children. She always makes sure a new child in her home was given a professional photograph that was placed on the wall in the living room. That seems like a small thing, but it helps them feel like they're at home.""

Everything comes from love

When it comes to Herring's inspiration to foster children, she had one explanation: love.

""I would just love (my foster kids) just like they were my own, probably more than I should,"" Herring said.

""I cried when the kids would leave my home, no matter how long they had been there. It was so hard for me to say goodbye to them. I always questioned, 'Why do I keep doing this?' because it was never easy to say goodbye to a child. But I kept doing it because I had so much love to give to these children in need.""

Herring carries with her memories of each child that she has protected and loved. Once, she said, she was called in by DHS in the middle of the night to pick up three young children who had been abandoned.

Another memory is the look on the face of a young girl she fostered when she saw her brand-new clothes, the first new clothes the little girl said she was ever given.

While Herring's time as a foster parent is over, she enjoys the photos and cards she receives from the children she fostered after they've been adopted. Her favorite part is when her foster children come back to visit after they've grown up.

Herring's impact as a foster mom went beyond the children she took in. Tonya Stratton, whose mother was one of Herring's foster children, grew up calling Herring ""Grama Linda"" and spending her childhood making friends with Herring's foster kids.

""Grama Linda, it's now your time to relax, but first you must learn the definition of that and then learn to sit without rocking, learn to appreciate quiet, no more piles and piles of laundry to fold, groceries to buy, diapers to change,"" Stratton said in a Facebook tribute to Herring

""It's your time now to rest, go through your memories, put your feet up or take a nap and try to understand how incredibly worthy you are to do whatever the hell you want.""

'She would meet anywhere to get a child'

In October 2019, Herring chose to stop fostering children due to health concerns, her granddaughter, Amber Herring, told CNN.

After announcing her decision to stop, Herring was honored by the Johnson County Board of Supervisors, with a resolution of appreciation on Thursday.

""The Department of Human Services would call Linda in the middle of the night to take a child, and she would meet anywhere to get a child,"" the resolution said in recognition of Herring's efforts.

""Linda mostly fostered young children with special medical needs and kept bins of clothes in her garage, stacked to the ceiling, labeled by size and gender. No one had to worry about a child going without clothes at Linda's, even if they arrived with nothing but what they're wearing."""

Rather than mope after the trip's cancellation, the students chose to make a major impact on the lives of others by using the money to help the Navajo Nation, which is struggling amid the pandemic.

The students used their $2,800 fund to purchase supplies, which were then delivered to members of Navajo Nation.

It borders Batéké Plateau National Park in neighboring Gabon, and together the two parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than 5,500 square kilometers (2,120 square miles).

The official designation of Ogooué-Leketi National Park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down.

All of the rights-holding communities that live close to the Ogooué-Leketi National Park were involved in the process of creating the protected area, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Congo program.

The Republic of Congo has officially created its fifth national park, lending protection to great apes, forest elephants and other threatened wildlife.

The new Ogooué-Leketi National Park spans 3,500 square kilometers (1,350 square miles), and borders Batéké Plateau National Park in neighboring Gabon. Together, the two national parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than 5,500 square kilometers (2,120 square miles).

Ogooué-Leketi is also part of the Batéké Plateau landscape, a unique patchwork of large rolling savannas on sandy hills, interrupted by long strips of dense forests and turquoise-blue river valleys. This savanna-forest complex is home to several threatened species, some found nowhere else in Congo, according to a press release from the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Congo program, which has been surveying the area with the country’s Ministry of Forestry Economy since 2004.

In 2009, the IUCN identified the region in which the park sits today as a priority conservation site for the protection of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the endangered central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), said Mark Gately, country director for WCS-Congo.

The forest sector of the new park is also home to several other species, such as the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), and several species of monkey including the iconic mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx). The savanna part of the national park, too, hosts a wide range of wildlife. The park has at least six species of rare savanna plants that are specialists of the Kalahari Sands, the substrate that forms the Batéké Plateau, and other savanna specialists like the bush duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), and several species of birds. The national park area was in fact identified by BirdLife International as a site of high importance for bird conservation in 2007.

The official designation of Ogooué-Leketi National Park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down. Logging activity had expanded into the proposed protected area since 2013, Gately said, with loggers searching mainly for okoumé trees (Aucoumea klaineana) for use in plywood. All three logging companies, which are still active around the periphery of the park, completed logging within parts of the concessions overlapping the park in December 2016.

“With the support of the Congolese Minister of Forestry Economy, Mrs. Rosalie Matondo, the creation of the park has eliminated logging activity within the protected area boundaries, securing the closed canopy forest habitat that covers roughly a third of the park,” Gately said.

The roads and bridges that the logging companies built into the proposed park area have, however, facilitated commercial bushmeat hunting. Such hunting “is currently the biggest threat to the area’s wildlife and this trade links to cities like Pointe Noire and Brazzaville but also across [the] border towards Gabon,” Gately said.

“Great ape numbers have declined significantly in the area since 2010 and elephants, even if their population seems stable, recently started changing their behaviour — visiting forest clearings more at night than during the day, behaviour that is generally observed in elephant populations that perceive threats from humans in their habitat,” Gately added.

With the logging companies out, the government and WCS-Congo are now working with local communities to draw up a management plan for the national park. While no villages existed inside the area now designated as Ogooué-Leketi National Park, there are five villages very close to the park boundary. The residents of these villages have traditionally used the national park area for their needs, and continue to depend on the forest for their sustenance.

All of the rights-holding communities living near the national park were involved in the process of creating the protected area since the project was launched, Gately said. The boundaries of the protected area were mapped to ensure the villages weren’t incorporated into the national park. The communities also helped identify and map areas of cultural and traditional importance to them.

“The participatory mapping process led the government to … highlight any cultural or natural resource use zones that overlap with critical high ecological value areas, including bais [swampy, mineral-rich meadows], that will be integrated into the park under eco-development zones,” Gately said. “In these identified areas, which will be integrated into the management plan of the park, rights-holding communities will be able to continue traditional and subsistence-based gathering, fishing or hunting. The maps including the limit of the future park and the eco-development zones were validated for each village in order to ensure full consent.”

The central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh set a new World Record after 1.5 million volunteers planted more than 66 million tree saplings in just 12 hours along the Narmada river.

The effort bested the state of Uttar Pradesh’s previous record-breaking feat, when 800,000 participants planted 50 million trees in one day in July 2016.

Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, boasted the achievement: “I am extremely proud to happily share that people of Madhya Pradesh successfully planted 6.63 Crore saplings today.” One crore is 10 million.

According to a press release for the occasion, the aim of the mass-planting event was to raise awareness for the nation’s “make India green again” plan. At the Paris climate conference, India pledged to increase forest cover to 95 million hectares (235 million acres) by year 2030 and is putting $6.2 billion towards the effort.

“I am greatly indebted to all who are planting trees today,” Chouhan also told India.com. “We will be contributing significantly in saving nature. By participating in a plantation, people are contributing their bit to climate change initiatives and saving the environment.”

In news that doesn't sting, a recent study found that Michigan bee populations are up 50% since 2018.New data published by Spring Hill Nursery , which used research from the United States Department of Agriculture , ranked Michigan fourth in states with the highest bee colony growth. Michigan follows Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Maine, which came in first with a 72.86% increase since 2018.The study also identified those states losing the most bee colonies. At the top of the list is California, which reportedly lost 160,600 colonies in just two years. There's a pretty big gap between California and the state with the second-highest bee colony loss, Florida, which has lost 42,800.Despite California's dramatic colony loss, it's still home to the largest number of bees. According to the data, they're the only state in the U.S. to have more than 1 million colonies. Florida, too, has one of the highest hive counts in the country with close to 250,000.This news comes at a time when both wild and managed bee populations are suffering massive declines.Between 2018 and 2019, worldwide managed bee populations decreased by 40.7% , and, last year, researchers discovered a “ dramatic decline ” in at least 14 wild bee populations in the U.S., vital to fruit crops. This includes Michigan, where researchers have found that at least six species have declined by 50% or more in the last 20 years, and one species, the rusty patched bumblebee, has become extinct.Some regions in the world have reported losses as high as 90% in a 15-year span,reports. The leading cause in declining populations is believed to be exposure to pesticides, insecticides, parasites, and pathogens, as well as limited sources of nectar and pollen. For years, colony loss was attributed to a rare phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder, which occurs when worker bees abandon the queen, the hive's food supply, and some nurse bees. A colony's survival often relies on the presence of worker bee populations."
"Ex-Navy officer turned inventor signs a multi-million deal to produce his electric car battery that will take drivers 1,500 miles without needing to charge",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7592485/Father-eight-invents-electric-car-battery-drivers-1-500-miles-without-charging-it.html,"Imagine the satisfaction of driving your environmentally friendly electric car for 1,500 miles without having to stop to recharge the battery – a distance more than four times as far as the best and most expensive model currently on the road.

Under the bonnet is a revolutionary new type of battery which, unlike those used in conventional electric cars, can also power buses, huge lorries and even aircraft. What's more, it's far simpler and cheaper to make than the batteries currently in use in millions of electric vehicles around the world – and, unlike them, it can easily be recycled.

This might sound like a science-fiction fantasy. But it's not. Last Friday, the battery's inventor, British engineer and former Royal Navy officer Trevor Jackson, signed a multi-million-pound deal to start manufacturing the device on a large scale in the UK.

The father-of-eight battery inventor engineer, Trevor Jackson, 58 from Tavistock, Devon, who has signed a multi-million-pound deal to start manufacturing the device on a large scale in the UK

Austin Electric, an engineering firm based in Essex, which now owns the rights to use the old Austin Motor Company logo, will begin putting thousands of them into electric vehicles next year. According to Austin's chief executive, Danny Corcoran, the new technology is a 'game-changer'.

'It can help trigger the next industrial revolution. The advantages over traditional electric vehicle batteries are enormous,' he said.

Few will have heard of Jackson's extraordinary invention. The reason, he says, is that since he and his company Metalectrique Ltd came up with a prototype a decade ago, he has faced determined opposition from the automobile industry establishment.

It has every reason not to give ground to a competitor that may, in time, render its own technology obsolete. Car industry sceptics claim Trevor's technology is unproven, and its benefits exaggerated.

But an independent evaluation by the Government agency UK Trade and Investment said in 2017 that it was a 'very attractive battery' based on 'well established' technology, and that it produced much more energy per kilogram than standard electric vehicle types.

Game-changer: the aluminium-air fuel cell stores far more energy than a conventional battery

Two years ago, Jackson claims, motor manufacturers lobbied the Foreign Office to bar him from a prestigious conference for European businesses and governments at the British embassy in Paris, which was supposed to agree a blueprint for ensuring all new cars are electric by 2040. The bid to exclude him failed. Now, with the signing of the Austin deal, it seems he is finally on the road to success.

He has also secured a £108,000 grant for further research from the Advanced Propulsion Centre, a partner of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. His technology has been validated by two French universities.

He says: 'It has been a tough battle but I'm finally making progress. From every logical standpoint, this is the way to go.'

Jackson began working on new ways of powering electric vehicles after a distinguished engineering career. He worked for Rolls-Royce in Derby, helping to design nuclear reactors, then took a commission in the Royal Navy, where he served as a lieutenant on board nuclear submarines, managing and maintaining their reactors.

Before founding his own firm in 1999, he was working for BAE Systems, where he first started looking at alternative, green ways to power vehicles. By then he and his partner, Kathryn, were married. The couple have eight children, aged 11 to 27, and live in Tavistock, on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon.

In 2001 he began to investigate the potential of a technology first developed in the 1960s. Scientists had discovered that by dipping aluminium into a chemical solution known as an electrolyte, they could trigger a reaction between the metal and air to produce electricity. At that time the method was useless for commercial batteries because the electrolyte was extremely poisonous, and caustic.

After years of experimentation at his workshop in the Cornish village of Callington, Jackson's eureka moment came when he developed a new formula for the electrolyte that was neither poisonous nor caustic.

'I've drunk it when demonstrating it to investors, so I can attest to the fact that it's harmless,' Jackson says. Another problem with the 1960s version was that it worked only with totally pure aluminium, which is very expensive.

But Jackson's electrolyte works with much lower-purity metal – including recycled drinks cans. The formula, which is top secret, is the key to his device.

Technically, it should be described as a fuel cell, not a battery. Either way, it is so light and powerful that it could now be set to revolutionise low-carbon transport, because it supplies so much energy.

Jackson gave me a demonstration. He cut off the top of a can of Coke, drained it, filled it with the electrolyte, and clipped electrodes to it, powering a small propeller. 'The energy in this will keep the propeller spinning for a month,' he said. 'You can see what this technology could do in a vehicle if you scale it up.' Following last week's deal with Austin, that is exactly what is about to happen. Three immediate projects are about to go into production.

The first is to manufacture for the Asian market some 'tuk-tuks' – the three-wheeler taxis used by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last week during their Royal visit to Pakistan. The second is to make electric bikes, which will be cheaper and run for much longer than those made by rivals.

Finally, and most importantly, the firm is to produce kits to convert ordinary petrol and diesel cars into hybrids, by fitting them with aluminium-air cells and electric motors on the rear wheels.

A driver will be able to choose whether to run the car on fossil fuel or electricity. The cost of each conversion, Jackson says, will be about £3,500, and they will be available early next year. This, he adds, will be the stepping-stone to a full-blown electric vehicle powered by aluminium-air fuel cells. The car industry has already poured massive investment into a very different type of battery, lithium-ion.

Also found in devices such as computers and mobile phones, lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable. Almost every electric vehicle on the road uses them. But they have big drawbacks. As well as lithium, they contain rare, poisonous substances such as cobalt. They can explode or catch fire, as seen with the spate of incidents that forced Samsung to recall tens of thousands of Galaxy Note 7 phones in 2016.

With repeated charging, car-sized models eventually become spent. Recycling them to recover the cobalt and lithium is extremely expensive – about five times as much as the cost of disposing them and starting from scratch.

Aluminium, on the other hand, is the planet's most abundant metal. Many of the factories that refine it from ore or recycled junk are powered by green, renewable energy, such as hydro-electric dams.

And once an aluminium-air fuel cell is spent, it can be recycled very cheaply. According to Jackson, the cost of recycling means the running costs of an aluminium-air powered car would work out at 7p per mile. The cost of a small hatchback's petrol comes to around 12p per mile. More important, lithium-ion batteries are heavy.

Accredited tests have shown that, weight for weight, Jackson's fuel cell produces nine times as much energy as lithium-ion: nine times as many kilowatt hours of electricity per kilogram. The luxury electric car maker Tesla says its model S has a range of 370 miles from one charge. Jackson says that if you drove the same car with an aluminium-air cell that weighed the same as the lithium-ion battery, the range would be 2,700 miles. Aluminium-air cells also take up less space.

Jackson claims that if the Tesla were fitted with an aluminium-air fuel cell that was the same size as its current battery, it could run non-stop for 1,500 miles – almost enough to get from Land's End to John O'Groats and back again. An average British family – whose car will travel 7,900 miles annually – would need to change their fuel cell only a handful of times each year.

Scientists call the weight-to- energy ratio 'energy density'. According to Jackson, because aluminium-air fuel cells have a much greater density than lithium-ion batteries, they could be used in buses or big trucks. If powered by lithium-ion, such vehicles would be unfeasibly heavy, with the battery weighing as much as the freight.

He says: 'You could easily stack numerous cells in this type of vehicle – after all, getting rid of their diesel fuel tanks will give you plenty of space.' Jackson adds that aluminium-air cells could also be used in aircraft. 'We are in discussions with two aircraft manufacturers. It's not going to be suitable for jets. But it would work in propeller planes, and be suitable for short-haul passenger and cargo flights.'

Meanwhile, the raw cost of a new aluminium-air cell is much lower.

In a Tesla, Jackson says, the battery costs about £30,000. An aluminium-air fuel cell that would power the same car for longer would cost just £5,000.

Drivers with cars that depend on lithium-ion have to charge their batteries from the mains when they are spent – a process that takes a long time, often overnight. But when an aluminium-air cell became exhausted, the driver would simply exchange it for a new one.

Instead of a vast network of charging points, all that is necessary are stores where cells can be swapped, just as people already swap propane gas bottles.

Swapping a battery, says Jackson, takes about 90 seconds.

He and Corcoran say they are in 'advanced discussions' with two major supermarket chains to provide this facility.

Last week, Sir James Dyson announced he was scrapping his plans to make electric cars because he had come to the conclusion they were not commercially viable, even though he had invested millions.

'The problem is,' says Jackson, 'he was using lithium-ion. If his cars had been based on aluminium-air fuel cells, the outcome might have been different.'

Ironically, Jackson's story so far bears more than a passing resemblance to Dyson's.

Dyson developed his bagless vacuum cleaner at a workshop at his home, supported by his wife.

And just as Jackson has had to battle the vested interests of the big motor companies, it took Dyson ten years to break through commercially, because no distributor or existing manufacturer was prepared to upset the lucrative market for dust bags.

'Everyone knows that if we are really going to hit the Government's target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the hardest nut to crack is transport,' Jackson says. 'We're just not going to do that with lithium-ion. Apart from anything else, it's no use for trucks, which burn vast amounts of fossil fuel.

'I know we are battling ferocious vested interests but the technological and environmental advantages of aluminium-air are overwhelming – and Britain has a chance to become the world leader in it.'

Corcoran adds: 'If you want to do something about the environment, you can. You can do it now, with this product.'"

Elderly woman who lived a quiet life gives away Millions to charity after her death - with even her friends and family not knowing she was rich,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8022397/Elderly-woman-lived-quiet-life-gives-away-MILLIONS-charity-death.html,"Sheila Woodcock, from Newcastle in New South Wales, lived a comfortable and private life before her death in May 2018 at age 87

An elderly woman who rarely spoke of her wealth has left her $14million fortune to 15 charities.

Sheila Woodcock, from Newcastle in New South Wales, lived a comfortable and private life before her death in May 2018 at age 87.

Her second cousin Kent Woodcock said friends and family knew Ms Woodcock was well-off but they didn't know the extent of her multi-million estate until her passing.

On Wednesday, 15 of Ms Woodcock's chosen causes were invited to Broadmeadow's Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service facility where they were told the detail of her generosity.

'The charities were gobsmacked but when they realise it's 14 other charities... it's awe-inspiring,' Mr Woodcock told Newcastle Herald.

Ms Woodcock did not marry or have children and spent her life enjoying close friendships, travelling, horticulture, acting and chocolate during her long life.

Ms Woodcock, who was tight-lipped about her fortune, left her $14million to 15 charities

The charities paid tribute to Ms Woodcock's legacy during Wednesday's gathering, with her second cousin declaring it to be a 'celebration' of her life.

'I don't think anybody [in Newcastle] has ever done something like this and I don't think we'll ever see it again.

'It's not sadness at her passing, it's: ''Look what she's done, look what she's doing''.'

Mr Woodcock said the multi-millionaire was a private and independent person, who did not have a regular career and kept tight-lipped about her earnings.

Tim Crakanthorp, the state member for Newcastle, wrote on Facebook: 'Often people will leave some money to charity when they pass away, but Sheila Woodcock took that to a whole other level.'

'Sheila lived in Bar Beach and passed in 2018, bequesting an amazing $14 million to 15 community organisations.'

He shared a picture with a guide dog puppy which has been named Woody in Ms Woodcock's honour.

On top of her bequest, Ms Woodcock had donated more than $347,000 to Guide Dogs NSW/ACT over more than 30 years.

Many people want to set aside half of Earth as nature,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/09/poll-extinction-public-slow-extinction/,"Famed biologist E.O. Wilson has argued in recent years that humans should set aside half of Earth as nature, an ambitious proposition to stave off mass extinction and safeguard the bulk of our planet’s biodiversity, including its people.

Now, a new poll reveals Wilson isn’t alone in his thinking. On average, the majority of survey respondents across a dozen countries said more than half of the planet’s land and sea should be protected.

Jonathan Baillie, executive vice president and chief scientist of National Geographic Society, notes that this Half-Earth plan is necessary to meet the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degree Celsius) and achieve the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. “People want what is scientifically needed for us to have a secure future,” he says.

Read more about Earth's vanishing species in the current issue of National Geographic, and see stunning photographs of the wildlife that we may lose forever in the new Photo Ark book Vanishing.

The survey, a collaboration between the National Geographic Society and Ipsos, polled 12,000 adults in Australia, Brazil, China, Great Britain, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Researchers sought to understand how people in these countries—all places where NGS works—value nature and biological diversity, information Baillie says is vital for guiding policymakers and measuring the organization’s long-term impact.

In five countries with lower internet access—Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, and China—the online poll's results could be more representative of affluent, urban-dwelling citizens than of the general population—a potential limitation to the survey, researchers warn.

Though people across the globe generally support conservation and saving wildlife, the survey results also revealed a poor understanding about topics such as extinction, in part due to lack of education. (Here's what we lose when species go extinct.)

For instance, respondents in all countries were highly aware of the rapid pace of mass extinction underway, yet “they don’t know exact details or understand the extent of what we could lose,” says Baillie.

A striking majority of respondents weren’t sure how much vertebrate populations have changed since 1970 (decreased by about 60 percent). Australians and Americans were least knowledgeable that a quarter of the world’s mammals could soon go the way of the dodo.

Even with such knowledge gaps, however, one crucial takeaway from the poll is that “regardless of political or cultural backgrounds,” Baillie says, “very few people think extinction is acceptable.""

Overestimating protected areas

Concern about extinction was highest among people in Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa—countries with rich biodiversity and some of the world’s greatest and great numbers of species now at risk of extinction. Mexico has the most, with 665 endangered species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Only a tiny sliver of the population in all countries surveyed, an average of 2 percent, said extinction didn’t concern them. (Read how human activities are accelerating the extinction rate.)

Another intriguing finding was that many people dramatically overestimate the amount of the natural world that is currently protected, notes Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University in Virginia.

Overall, respondents believed roughly 35 percent of the world’s sea is preserved. In reality, just 7 percent is. It’s a similar story for land: Assumptions about how much is conserved (15 percent) varied by country, ranging from Australia, where people thought 26 percent of land is protected for nature, to India, where people thought 45 percent is.

That’s a problem, Baillie says, because it “could make the need to protect the environment seem less urgent.”

But it’s important to note, adds Maibach, that a “majority of people from these nations want to see much more land and sea protected”—and are likely to support their governments taking more actions to better conserve species and ecosystems.

Amphibians face mass extinction as fungus spreads across the world

Video by Katie Garrett and Jonathan Kolby

Baillie and Maibach agree the survey’s results could have significant implications for the future of conservation, for instance by pressuring governments to meet public demand for conservation.

Whether governments will follow the public’s lead remains in question. An important test will be in October 2020, when delegates from nearly 200 countries will converge at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Beijing, China, to develop a new framework for halting biodiversity loss and establish global targets for protected areas, currently set at just 17 percent for land and 10 percent for oceans.

Protecting biodiversity in the long-term and avoiding mass extinction will require an even loftier goal: Setting aside 50 percent of the planet by 2050, with an interim milestone of 30 percent by 2030, Baillie says. (Read how extinction is a complicated issue.)"
New York's one-day coronavirus death toll drops below 100,https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/new-york-coronavirus-death-toll-drops-below-100-cuomo/,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Saturday that the state's single-day death toll from the coronavirus fell below 100, for the first time in weeks. Eighty four people died from the coronavirus in New York on Friday, he said, down from 109 the day before.

""Eighty-four is still a tragedy, no doubt,"" he said. ""But the fact that it's down as low as it is is really, overall, good news.""

At its height, the single-day COVID-19 death toll in New York was close to 800 for several days in a row in April.

New York City, the epicenter of the state's outbreak, hit its peak number of deaths on April 7, when 590 people died in one day.

Death and hospitalizations in the city have consistently fallen since then. The city reported 26 deaths from the coronavirus on Wednesday, its most recent public data.

We lost 84 New Yorkers to COVID-19 yesterday. By any normal standard this is a hideous number. But we are thankful this number has fallen below 100 for the first time since late March. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) May 23, 2020

Cuomo said Saturday that the Long Island and Mid-Hudson regions, which border New York City, are still on track to begin reopening early next week. If deaths continue to decline, Mid-Hudson could reopen on Tuesday and Long Island by Wednesday.

The governor cautioned residents to remain vigilant by wearing masks and practicing social distancing as regions begin to reopen.

""Don't underestimate this virus. We know it can rear its ugly head at any time,"" he said Saturday.

Cuomo held his daily briefing hours after issuing an executive order that allows small non-essential gatherings. The order, which was issued in time for Memorial Day weekend, allows any ""non-essential gathering of ten or fewer individuals, for any lawful purpose or reason,"" CBS New York reported.

According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 28,853 people have died from the coronavirus in New York state since the pandemic started, and over 63,000 people have recovered after contracting the virus. New York has had the most deaths of any state; followed by New Jersey, where 10,985 people have died.

The U.S. as a whole has had the most deaths of any country by far, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. In total, 96,125 people have died from the virus nationwide, followed by 36,475 in the U.K."

The restaurant urged people to share its plan through social media - where the initiative was widely praised.

Vicky Lanfear wrote on Facebook: “This is the most selfless gesture I have ever seen and they should be recognised as a pillar of the community.”

Suzannah Harris added: “What a lovely gesture; a restaurant that gives something back instead of merely seeing Xmas as a time to cash in. Will definitely visit in the new year if ever in the area.”

Linda Leach wrote: “There is still kindness in this world. Amazing people.""

The gesture also received a postive reaction on Twitter, where one user posted: ""A wonderful gesture. Now that's REAL community spirit! God Bless them.""

San Francisco passes law forcing all pet shops to only sell rescue dogs and cats,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/san-francisco-puppies-kittens-law-pet-shops-only-sell-rescue-animals-a7586186.html,"San Francisco officials have voted to ban the sale of non-rescue dogs and cats at pet shops as part of a concerted effort to eradicate “inhumane” puppy breeding operations in the city.

The amendment will not affect licenced breeders however it will aim to tackle the prevalence of large-scale “puppy mills”, while helping to facilitate the adoption of thousands of animals already occupying the city's shelters.

San Francisco will not be the first US city to implement such a measure, which will also ban the sale of animals under eight weeks old. Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Austin all enforce similar legislation.

“Most animal lovers are horrified at the thought of keeping their beloved family pet in a dirty wire cage for a second — let alone a week, month or even years. Yet, that is the fate of many animals at large-scale commercial breeding operations across the nation, including the mothers of many puppies and kittens sold in pet shops,” the San Francisco Board of Supervisors wrote in an op-ed piece.

“In response, more than 200 cities and counties across the nation have banned the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores.”

Mimi Bekhechi, animal cruelty charity PETA’s director of international programmes, praised the decision as “progressive” and example-setting.

“With this vote, San Francisco has proved itself to be the city of love for millions of dogs and cats in desperate need of homes.

""Pet shops' greed fuels the cruel commercial breeding industry that keeps female dogs and cats prisoner inside filthy wire cages – whose only purpose is to churn out litters of inbred puppies and kittens who are then taken away from them, transported hundreds of miles, and sold,” she told The Independent.

“The city has recognised that animals are not commodities and that there's a direct link between the industry and the millions of dogs and cats in shelters around the world who are euthanised each year because there aren't enough good homes for them all.”

District 4 Supervisor Katy Tang, who sponsored the legislation, also called on the US Agriculture Department to reinstate information on its website documenting animal cruelty cases, which was removed earlier in the month.

San Francisco currently has no known pet shops selling dogs and cats, however Ms Tang said the measure would allow the city’s Animal Care and Control Department to prevent future shops opening.

“This ordinance will serve as a deterrent, preventing a business from moving into San Francisco and selling animals from irresponsible mass-producing breeders that churn out puppies and kittens as if they were on an assembly line,” she wrote.

“Beyond protecting consumers and cutting off the supply chain, this ordinance also acknowledges San Francisco businesses for their humane business practices.”"
Metallica Donate a Quarter Million to Build Pediatric Hospital,https://loudwire.com/metallica-pediatric-hospital-donation/,"In keeping with their set practice of supporting a community organization in every locale they visit, Metallica have donated 250,000 euros (about $279,000, or over a quarter-million dollars in U.S. funds) to a Romanian association building the country's first pediatric oncology hospital. It's the latest charitable pledge from the band during their ongoing ""WorldWired Tour,"" which is currently covering Europe with fellow rockers Ghost.

The donation to the Daruieste Viata (""Give Life"") nonprofit was proffered just prior to the band's sold out concert at Bucharest, Romania's Arena Națională on Wednesday (August 14), the association revealed on its Facebook page, as reported by Reuters. Read a statement regarding Metallica's contribution from the president of Daruieste Viata, Carmen Uscatu, down toward the bottom of this post.

""The final leg of the European tour starts with a very special donation,"" a press release stated. ""Together with fans attending the show at Arena Națională in Bucharest, Romania and a generous sponsorship by Mastercard, Metallica presented Daruieste Viata (The Give Life Association) with €250,000 before the concert.""

It continued, ""Inspired by Mastercard’s own €1,000,000 donation towards the Daruieste Viata project earlier this year, Metallica’s gift will contribute to the endowment of the first Pediatric Oncology and Radiotherapy Hospital in Romania with the latest medical technologies and equipment.""

The donation was made via Metallica's All Within My Hands Foundation, which hosted its Second Annual Day of Service earlier this year. Founded in 2017, All Within My Hands helps create ""sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services,"" its website explains.

The current leg of Metallica's ""WorldWired"" European tour continues throughout the month before the group travel to Australia with Slipknot later this year. Get all Metallica ticketing information here.

The donation made by Metallica has a special meaning to our project. On one hand, their music inspires and touches so many Romanians, and at the same time so many Romanians are inspired by and contribute to the establishing of the first Pediatric Oncology and Radiotherapy Hospital in Romania, in order to give children with cancer a chance to live. On the other hand, the contribution of Mastercard, that pledged a sponsorhip worth €1,000,000 to #NoiFacemUnSpital initiative, has been a real drive in inspiring a legend like Metallica to contribute to our cause as well. We are grateful to all who make this project possible. —Carmen Uscatu, President of Daruieste Viata Association"
India: First 3D printed titanium vertebrae implant helps 32-year-old woman walk again,http://www.3ders.org/articles/20170217-india-first-3d-printed-titanium-vertebrae-implant-helps-32-year-old-woman-walk-again.html,"Feb 17, 2017 | By Benedict

Doctors in India have helped a 32-year-old woman back onto her feet by rebuilding part of her spine with 3D printed vertebrae in a first-of-its-kind procedure. The patient had been suffering from spinal tuberculosis.

Dr Gopal Kumar and Dr V Anand Naik created a 3D printed titanium vertebrae implant

It takes a certain degree of backbone to be a doctor, but—incredibly—it took just a 3D printer for these Indian doctors to make a backbone for a 32-year-old spinal tuberculosis patient. Using advanced metal 3D printing technology, a surgical team at Medanta The Medicity hospital in Haryana was able to create 3D printed artificial vertebrae for the woman, the first operation of its kind in India.

Under the guidance of Dr V Anand Naik, a senior consultant for spine surgeries at the hospital, the surgical team was able to replace the damaged vertebrae in the patient’s spine, replacing them with a 3D printed titanium version that bridged the gap between the first and fourth cervical vertebrae. “It was a very complex surgery and the patient’s condition was deteriorating by the day,” said Dr Naik. “It would not have been possible to do it without 3D printing technology.”

The female patient, a teacher by trade, was under the knife for a total of 10 hours, a lengthy spell necessitated by the severe damage suffered by the patient’s first, second, and third cervical vertebrae. The extent of this damage meant that there was no skeletal support available between the skull and lower cervical spine.

“The challenge for our team was to reach high into the neck without altering the position of the patient,” explained Dr Gopal Kumar, a consultant on the operating team. “The anterior approach and small working field, in cases such as these, are a necessity.”

Although such a procedure comes with many risks for the patient, the unnamed 32-year-old had an extra special reason for wanting everything to go smoothly—especially when the surgeons took the scalpel to her neck area: “As the patient is a singer, preservation of laryngeal nerve was of prime importance,” Dr Kumar said. “Swallowing, chewing, and movement of tongue—all were at risk.”

The medical team was able to create 3D printed titanium vertebrae for the patient by first obtaining CT and MRI scans of the damaged spine. 3D design software was then used to transform these scans into printable models, which were then fabricated using an unspecified metal 3D printer. Further testing was then carried out on the 3D printed implant, and help was sought from design teams from India, Sweden, and the US.

Without the 3D printed vertebrae implant, the patient could have lost her singing voice

Twelve days after the surgery, the patient was walking with minimal support and was entirely free of pain. Furthermore, her singing voice has recovered after being threatened with dysphasia, a language disorder brought about by the patient’s tuberculosis.

“This is the first such surgery in India and probably third in the world by using 3D printing technology,” Dr Naik added. “These techniques have opened a new avenue wherein any type of complex reconstruction can be done in the spine with less collateral damages.”

"Ontario new math curriculum to introduce coding, personal finance starting in Grade 1",https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/ontario-s-new-math-curriculum-to-introduce-coding-personal-finance-starting-in-grade-1-1.4995865,"The Ford government’s new elementary math curriculum will introduce coding, computer storage measurements and personal finance terms starting in Grade 1, as part of a bid to improve sliding EQAO math scores.

Starting this September, students in Ontario public schools will begin learning mathematics with more emphasis on a “back to basics” approach, with certain concepts introduced in earlier grades and other concepts pushed into higher ones.

Throughout grades one to eight, children will learn concepts related to coding for the first time.

They will also learn about personal finance in each grade, and they will learn about measurements of data storage, such as a byte, kilobyte, megabyte and gigabyte, alongside the other units of measurement they learned previously.

Ministry of Education officials said teachers will be given professional development time through the summer as well as during the new school year to adapt lesson plans to the changes.

“This is the first new elementary school math curriculum in 15 years – it’s clear that has a lot has changed since 2005, and our math schooling needs to change with it,” Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday.

Ontario’s official opposition said changing the curriculum during a pandemic is “irresponsible.”

“Dropping a new math curriculum during the middle of a pandemic is completely irresponsible,” NDP education critic Marit Stiles said Tuesday. “Not only has the Minister of Education failed to properly consult educators and parents about the new curriculum, he has not bothered to consider the additional burden this will cause for teachers, and for parents who are already struggling to help their children learn from home.”

Education Minister Stephen Lecce said Tuesday that now was as good a time as any to change the curriculum as declining test scores demanded a change be made.

“I appreciate the broader challenge around us but we must move forward with these necessary reforms for students so that when they graduate they can aspire to get a good paying a job, a job related to the future economy, a job that could give them a yield to own a home one day,” he said.

The new curriculum also changes when children will be introduced to some core skills.

For instance, learning to tell time on a round clock with hands will now begin in Grade 3, instead of Grade 1.

Meanwhile, plotting coordinates on a grid will be taught in Grade 4, down from Grade 6, with officials saying the skill is useful to have when learning about coding.

Part of the “return to basics” approach means memorizing multiplication tables will return.

“Yes parents, memorizing multiplication tables is back for our kids,” Lecce said.

Provincial EQAO math scores have been lagging behind reading and writing scores in the elementary grades for years.

In Grade 3, average scores were down to 61 per cent in 2018, from 67 per cent four years earlier.

In Grade 6, the average math score has been stuck at 61 per cent for a decade.

As a part of the rollout of the new curriculum, Lecce said EQAO math tests for grades 3 and 6 would be postponed for the 2020-2021 school year.

He added that in future years the annual tests could be conducted online.

The union representing public English language teachers in elementary schools said Tuesday that it had asked the province to roll out the new curriculum over two schools years and was disappointed they were moving to roll it out in one year instead."
India's supreme court has ordered all coronavirus tests to be made free,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-covid-19-tests-must-be-done-free-orders-supreme-court/article31291873.ece,"Issue necessary directions immediately, it tells govt

Tests relating to COVID-19, whether done in approved government or private laboratories, shall be free of cost, the Supreme Court ordered on Wednesday.

Issue the necessary directions immediately, it told the government.

A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and S. Ravindra Bhat held that tests relating to COVID-19 must be carried out only in NABL accredited Labs or any agencies approved by the WHO or the ICMR.

The order was passed on a petition filed by advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi to implement free COVID-19 testing by private labs. On April 3, the court issued notice to the government on the plea, which challenged the legality of a March 17 advisory capping the price for Coronavirus testing at Rs. 4500 in private labs and hospitals. Mr. Sudhi had argued that the advisory was both discriminatory and a violation of the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.

""We find prima facie substance in the submission of petitioner that at this time of national calamity permitting private labs to charge Rs. 4500 for screening and confirmation test of COVID-19 may not be within means of a large part of population of this country and no person be deprived to undergo the COVID-19 test due to non-payment of capped amount of ₹4500,” the court observed in its order. It pointed to the government laboratories carrying out COVID-19 tests free of cost.

The court said that private hospitals, including laboratories, have an important role to play in containing the scale of the pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis. Reimbursing private labs of their expenses was a matter to be considered later on and not now, it stated.

“We thus are satisfied that the petitioner has made out a case for issuing a direction to the respondents to issue necessary direction to accredited private labs to conduct free of cost COVID-19 test,” it concluded.

The government status report in the court had said that as many as 15,000 tests were conducted a day by 118 labs. The work was outsourced to 47 private labs to enhance the capacity of testing."
Report: Half of McDonald’s Happy Meal customers pass on soda,https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/report-half-mcdonald-s-happy-meal-customers-pass-soda,"McDonald’s is on track to meet its goal of increasing customer access to fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy and water, especially among Happy Meal consumers, in 20 global markets, according to an independent progress report released Tuesday by the company.

In 2013, McDonald’s developed five “balance lifestyle” goals for 2020 in partnership with the not-for-profit Alliance for a Healthier Generation. Two of the commitments included providing customers a choice of a side salad, fruit or vegetable as a substitute for French fries in value meals and promoting only bottled water, milk or juice choices for Happy Meals.

The independent progress report was conducted by Keybridge, a public policy economic consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. The company found that a majority of McDonald’s 20 major markets, including the United States, have met the 2013 commitments two years ahead of schedule. The remaining markets are on track to meet them by the 2020 deadline.

A key milestone from the report: As of September 2018, 48% of Happy Meal customers in the 20 global markets ordered milk, water or juice as their beverage choice compared to 36% as of September 2013.

While soda remains a Happy Meal option, the brand removed carbonated drinks as a choice on menu boards in 2013. That “out of sight, out of mind” move has worked to shift orders to healthier choices, Julia Braun, head of global nutrition at McDonald's Corp., said in a phone interview Monday with Nation’s Restaurant News.

In the U.S., the pivot was even greater. Consumers ordering milk, water or juice increased from 37% in 2013 to 52% in 2018, the report stated. That has translated to McDonald’s domestic restaurants serving more than 3.4 billion fruit, low-fat dairy and water items in Happy Meals since 2013.

“We’ve seen a significant shift in customer ordering patterns,” Braun said.

Other milestones include: McDonald’s has served more than 6.4 billion fruit, vegetable, low-fat dairy and water items in Happy Meals since September 2013 in the 20 global markets.

“We’re making real progress offering and promoting balanced choices in Happy Meals around the world,” Braun said in a statement. “This work measures and demonstrates the positive impact we’re having as we build a better McDonald’s and use our scale as a force for good.”

Specifically, the variety of choices includes 161 types of fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy and water options. Choices vary and are unique to what’s available various global markets. For example, grape tomatoes are offered in Australia, corn cups in Taiwan, and heart-shaped carrots in Austria.

The global markets include the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan and Australia.

Kathy Higgins, CEO for the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, said working with McDonald’s to change “the systems and environments that impact the health of children” is transformational and can have a positive influence on other companies with similar scale.

McDonald’s has about 38,000 locations in more than 100 countries around the world. In the U.S., the Chicago-based chain has about 14,000 units.

Walmart cashier steps in when nail salon refuses wheelchair-bound woman,http://www.abc12.com/content/news/Walmart-cashier-steps-in-when-nail-salon-refuses-wheelchair-bound-woman-490026791.html?utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link&ICID=ref_fark,"(8/3/2018) - A simple act of kindness is making a big impact.

When a Walmart cashier in Burton saw a customer get turned away from the store's nail salon, she took matters into her own hands

""I was like making sandwiches and I was watching her like,"" Tasia Smith said of the scene Thursday that brought her to tears.

She works at the Subway inside the Burton Walmart on Court Street.

That's where she captured a photo, which has since gone viral, of Walmart cashier Ebony Harris skipping her break to paint customer Angela Peters' nails.

""I just wanted to post it for awareness and appreciation, because people needed to know what was going on with the business and Ebony deserved all the appreciation she could get,"" Tasia said.

Harris said she watched the nail salon, located just a few feet over, refuse to do Peters' nails because her hands shake quite a bit due to cerebral palsy. So, she decided to do something about it.

""I just wanted to make her day special. I didn't really want her day to be ruined. That's why I did it. And plus she's a sweetie,"" Harris said.

Together, the two picked out some polish and relaxed in the seating area at Subway for a manicure.

""And you know, she moved her hands a little bit and she kept saying she was sorry. And, I told her don't say that. I said you're fine,"" Harris said.

It was a simple act of patience and kindness that's still making Angela smile.

""I thought that was so nice of her and I already felt comfortable with her because, like I said, I shop at Walmart a lot,"" Peters said.

Harris has no qualms with the nail salon, but she hopes her actions inspire others to treat people with disabilities the way they would want to be treated themselves.

""We're not trying to bash the nail salon. We're not trying to make them lose customers, make them look bad,"" she said. ""But maybe spread awareness that no matter the person, who they are, what color they are, disability, whatever, they're people too. She's a girly girl. She's just like you, me, Tasia, my daughter, anybody. She wants to look pretty, you know, and so why can't she?""

Sitting next to her new friend at her store inside Collette's Vintage and Antique Mall, Peters said she's grateful not only for Harris' help, but a beautiful manicure too.

""I'm like wow. These are amazing!"" she said.

""I told her she's a blessing to us, to anybody, not just me. She makes me look at life and appreciate it much more than, you know, what I have been,"" Harris added.

The three plan to continue their friendship, already scheduling a dinner at Peters' favorite restaurant in town.

To check out Angela's business, stop by Collette's Vintage and Antique Mall on Wednesday through Friday or the Davison Farmer's Market on Saturdays. It's called Heavenly Poems For You."
A soldier whose house was looted during Hurricane Florence gave away the money raised for him instead.,https://people.com/human-interest/luis-ocampo-house-looted-florence-pay-forward/,"Luis Ocampo and Kailey Finch were overwhelmed by the donations they received after their home was looted last month — so, they gave some of the money away

Soldier Whose House Was Looted Gives Away Money Raised for Him: 'I Wanted to Show Kindness'

Army medic Luis Ocampo returned from the front lines of Hurricane Florence in September to find his house looted, and some of his family’s most cherished possessions stolen. Now, after generous well-wishers donated money to replace his losses, Ocampo is giving away most of the money that was raised for him.

“We got more than we expected, and felt that it was our responsibility to show someone that same kindness that so many showed us,” Ocampo, 24, tells PEOPLE.

Ocampo left his home in Charlotte last month when his unit from the North Carolina National Guard was called to help with hurricane relief. Ocampo spent days in New Bern, a riverfront city ravaged by the storm.

With Ocampo gone, his girlfriend Kailey Finch and their infant son also left home.

“I went to Luis’ parents, because I felt safer there,” says Finch, 20. She left the family dog inside the house.

On September 21, Ocampo returned home to find the back door open, and their dog running loose in the yard.

“Someone came in through our son’s bedroom window,” Finch says. “They busted the locks with a shovel, and propped open the window. The house was trashed.”

Clothes and other belongings were flung around the house. Whoever looted the house stole mostly electronics, including a laptop that Ocampo used for school work, and game systems. Other items stolen include a gun, jewelry, two jars full of change, and a box of coins Ocampo’s grandmother had collected from around the world.

The looters even took food from the refrigerator.

The young couple posted about the break-in on Facebook, asking if anyone had information. A friend of the couple, Mary Elise Capron, saw the post and started a fundraiser.

“I have worked closely with Ocampo in the National Guard and he is an amazing soldier and person,” Capron wrote on the GoFundMe page set up for Finch and Ocampo. “I am honored to know him and cannot believe something so terrible could happen to someone so dedicated to the service, his family and school.”

In just 11 days, the fundraiser reached nearly $15,000 — surpassing Capron’s $5,000 goal. Ocampo and Finch said they were astonished to receive so much.

“It was overwhelming,” Finch tells PEOPLE. “It was way more than we needed.”

So, the couple asked Capron to shut down donations, with Finch noting that she and Ocampo didn’t “want to abuse people’s generosity.”

Still, benefactors wanted to keep giving. So Ocampo and Finch decided to pay the generosity forward, and began redirecting the additional donations.

“Other people really need help that they can’t get,” Finch says.

Ocampo and Finch are sending money to the Soldiers and Airmen Assistance Fund. The couple is also giving some of the money to a soldier who began living in a hotel after a tree fell on his house during the hurricane."

An Indianapolis woman reacted quickly to save a 3-year-old boy in danger of drowning in a pool, only to find that his pregnant mother also needed her help.

Apartment manager Jennifer Potter was riding by the pool in a golf cart on Wednesday, when she saw a small child in the deep end, local TV station WTHR reports.

She jumped in the pool to help.

But when she reached the child she saw more: The boy's pregnant mother was submerged under him. The mother had jumped into the pool earlier to try and save her son, according to WXIN.

"Casino starts a restaurant and uses the proceeds to fund an onsite food bank serving 400 families per month, donates additional earnings to local nonprofits",http://www.secondwavemedia.com/southwest-michigan/features/The-Fire-Hub-restaurant-a-casino-spinoff-feeds-customers-and-food-pantry-patrons0123.aspx,"Visitors are greeted with clearly marked directions in the building that is both a restaurant and a food pantry.

A restaurant and food pantry is a unique combination.

As a chef and Vice President of Food and Beverage at FireKeepers Casino Hotel, Michael McFarlen was in a unique position to see the amount of food thrown away on a daily basis.And McFarlen's involvement with the South Central Food Bank of Michigan Inc., where he serves as president of the board, gave him a similarly unique view of the number of people in the community who face food insecurity.Ongoing food waste juxtaposed with a landscape populated with people, many of whom who don’t know where their next meal is coming from, prompted McFarlen and FireKeepers leadership to develop a plan. They decided to renovate an old fire station to accommodate the Fire Hub Restaurant and Kendall Street Food Pantry which share space at Dickman Road and Kendall Street.The restaurant occupies the front of the building and the food pantry is at the back.While community service and outreach are not unique to casinos owned by Native American tribes, combining a restaurant and food pantry is, says Kathy George, Chief Executive Officer of FireKeepers.“It really is unique,” George says. “A number of casinos do outreach, but we’re not aware of anyone who actually created a restaurant and food pantry directly.”Guest feedback about the food and service at the Fire Hub has been overwhelmingly positive. It has earned 4.5 out of 5-star reviews on TripAdvisor with “excellent” and “very good” ratings. While George says the first year of operation was successful, she acknowledges that revenues were not quite what they were expected to be.“Anytime you open a new restaurant, you just have to figure a way through that first year,” George says.However, the Fire Hub and the food pantry exceeded initial expectations for much different reasons – the restaurant for its popularity and sustainability and the food pantry for the numbers of people it has been serving since its doors first opened.McFarlen says projected numbers were between 65 and 70 households when the pantry began operating. That number quickly escalated to 100 on each distribution day – every Monday from 4-6 p.m. – which equates to between 375 to 400 households per month.The money to operate the Fire Hub is a combination of $140,000 that comes from the tribe annually and from food and beverage revenue generated by the restaurant.Proceeds from the Fire Hub have been given to nonprofits, including Safe Place and the Food Bank of South Central Michigan Inc. which recently received a check for $15,000. McFarlen says he’d like to be in a position to make even larger donations to area charities on a more frequent basis.“We’re building a fiscally responsible business that takes profits and gives to nonprofits,” he says. “As we get more and more involved, we will give to many other charities and nonprofits.”Robert Elchert, Community Impact Associate for United Way of the Battle Creek and Kalamazoo Region, says the Fire Hub is a great United Way partner because they apply their strengths and energy in specific ways to impact the community. He cites the Fire Hub’s hosting of United Way Pop Up Giving events and VolunBeer activities for their young leaders group as examples of this partnership.“They support our work addressing food insecurity through the Kendall Street Food Pantry, in concert with the Food Bank of South Central Michigan. Partnerships like this deliver a vital return on community and social responsibility,” Elchert says. “From United Way's perspective, Fire Hub models the kind of collaboration that can address the toughest needs vulnerable individuals and families are facing.”Food pantry clients are limited to one visit per month. They are registered with the program, which gives food pantry volunteers the ability to track their shopping habits and the number of people in their families, in addition to notifying them about special distributions.About 45 percent of people who come through only come through once, McFarlen says.“We have people who need that one-time distribution to get back on track,” he says. “About 20 percent are people who make two or three visits. They’re not all from Battle Creek. Some of them work here, but live in Albion, Marshall, and Kalamazoo.”Even though these people are employed, they continue to struggle, says Heather Mauney, director of Agency Relations for the Food Bank. In addition, she says, there is also a small number of people on a fixed income who are likely to always need their services and the services of others.“We’ve seen a significant increase in households where one or both adults are working and they find themselves in some sort of crisis situation like an illness or car accident and they need our help,” Mauney says. “We get a lot of people who are not used to how the system works. We’re able to cater to people who are working, but still need a little help during the month,” she says. “The need has not decreased. If anything it has increased and shifted.”The Kendall Street Food Pantry is the only one operated by the Food Bank of South Central Michigan which partners with more than 300 agencies in a service area that includes Barry, Branch, Calhoun, Hillsdale, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lenawee, and St. Joseph counties. Heather Mauney, director of Agency Relations for the Food Bank, says it’s not common for food banks to operate food pantries.“We cover a 5,000-square-mile service area and the logistics of overseeing and running a pantry 100 miles away in Lenawee doesn’t make sense,” Mauney says. “The opportunity presented itself with FireKeepers and we just really didn’t have a good reason to say no. It makes sense for us to operate it because it gives us an opportunity to try out and test new things before rolling them out.“It is quite small compared to other pantries. Sometimes space can be a barrier for people who want to start a food pantry and we are able to show off how much we can do in a smaller space.”From the outset, the food pantry was designed to be a “choice pantry” which allows individuals to come in and “shop” for whatever they want. Milk and meat are among the staples people ask for on a regular basis, so the shelves are fairly well-stocked with these items. In addition, there are canned goods, boxed meals, fruits and vegetables and a small selection of gluten-free and vegan items.The pantry has the look and feel of a store with shelves that contain neatly arranged food products and shopping carts. “We wanted to take away the stigma and make it more like they’re going into a bodega or little store,” McFarlen says.Mauney says across the industry more work has been done with to address the stigma of individuals needing food pantries. Her food bank is working with agencies across its service areas to make sure that those who come into a food pantry are treated with kindness.Food to stock the Kendall Street Pantry shelves comes from a number of sources, including the United States Department of Agriculture; the Kellogg and Post companies; several large retail donors and stores; individual donors; and FireKeepers.Remember that food that McFarlen says remains unused or untouched at the Casino and Hotel? Well, that food is packaged up and taken to the food bank which then distributes to its partner agencies.“We purchased the equipment that is necessary to receive the proper licenses to flash-freeze food from the buffet and we make family trays out of them,” George says. “In addition to canned goods and fresh fruits and vegetables, we supplement them with family portions from the buffet.”Last year, more than 14,000 pounds of frozen food from FireKeepers made its way into area food pantries through the Casino/Hotel’s participation in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Food Recovery Challenge. As part of the challenge, organizations pledge to improve their sustainable food management practices and report their results. The Food Recovery Challenge is part of EPA's Sustainable Materials Management Program, which seeks to reduce the environmental impact of materials through their entire life cycle.“We drop off about half a ton of food each month and the food bank decides where it goes,” McFarlen says. “The FRC gives you an idea of where you stand with other people trying to make an impact. For a small community that we’re in to make this kind of impact I could only imagine what they do in Los Angeles and New York.”The prepared meals can be microwaved or boiled. But, McFarlen and his team also work with food pantry clients to show them how to prepare and cook fresh food, including vegetables that are donated by area farmers. This initiative came about after they learned that a lot of highly-nutrient, plant-based foods were being thrown out, particularly vegetables like rutabagas and kale.“We identified a shortcoming where families in need were getting the food but didn’t know how to prepare or create a recipe that their family would eat,” he says.The food bank and representatives with Michigan State University Extension Services partnered with McFarlen and his team to create recipes designed around what was being distributed. He says about 50 of these demonstrations happen each month throughout the Food Bank’s eight-county service area.Another component of FireKeepers efforts to address food insecurity involves a greenhouse program with the goal of establishing free salad bars at area schools. A variety of lettuces, cucumbers, tomatoes, micro-greens, and other salad staples are being grown organically (without pesticides) at a greenhouse on land owned by the tribe under the watchful eye of an agricultural specialist and employees with the Casino/Hotel’s Groundskeepers crew.“We looked at Battle Creek community schools and identified those schools with the highest number of students receiving free- or reduced-lunch. We looked at how we could tackle lunch programs and decided to put together a greenhouse program where we could put free salad bars into those schools,” McFarlen says.The first harvest is expected to happen in about one week. On April 1, the first salad bar will open at Athens Schools.Once the Community Garden is fully operational, McFarlen says he will rely on volunteers to augment the work required to make it sustainable. He anticipates getting support from casino employees, his team members, and individuals from the Food Bank.McFarlen says the majority of the day-to-day work and execution of the plans to broaden the scope and reach of FireKeepers work to address food insecurity in the community is done by his team. “They have done an amazing job,” he says.FireKeepers CEO George says it’s always been a priority of the tribe and FireKeepers to be good stewards of the community.“The Casino and band are phenomenal people,” she says. “They have such a huge heart and want to continue to be great partners in the community.”"

The actor and director revealed on Instagram that he paid off all the items people had on layaway at a pair of Atlanta-area Walmarts as a Christmas surprise.

""I know it's hard times and a lot of people are struggling,"" Perry said in the video. ""I'm just really really grateful to be able to be in a situation to do this. So God bless you. Go get your stuff.""

The ""Madea"" star paid for all items that were registered on layaway through 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, telling people they only had to pay one penny when they went to pick them up.

Perry, 49, covered the layaway costs for about 1,500 people, Walmart Director of Media Relations LeMia Jenkins told TODAY. He spent about $434,000, the Associated Press reported.

""Tyler Perry’s generous donation is making an unbelievable difference for so many families, and we can’t thank him enough for his kindness,'' Walmart said in a statement to TODAY. ""The heartfelt excitement and joy we’re seeing from our customers as a result of his holiday gift has been touching.""

A single mother received the surprise of her life after discovering that the baby girl she was about to adopt shared the same biological mother as her newly adopted son.

""[Hannah] is the opposite of Grayson,"" Katie Page of Parker, Colorado, told ""Good Morning America"" of her kids. ""He loves to chill and she's a wild thing. As soon as I started figuring it out that she was his sibling, I said, 'Absolutely, [I'll adopt her].' Once I took in Grayson and I accepted being his mom, I accepted his family.""

Page divorced in her early 30s before becoming a foster parent in 2016. During her marriage, she experienced issues with infertility but had dreams of being a mom, she said.

""It was on my bucket list and I also always wanted to adopt,"" Page added.

Page cared for four foster children before meeting Grayson — a baby boy who was abandoned at the hospital. On May 25, 2017, Page officially adopted Grayson, who is now 2 years old.

""The minute I saw him in the hospital, I fell in love,"" Page said. ""He's so calm and sweet. He has the biggest challenges of all the kids.""

A month after Page adopted Grayson, she received a call about a newborn girl, named Hannah, who needed a home.

Page said as soon as she met Hannah, now a year old, that she knew she wanted to give her a forever home as well.

But when Page brought Hannah home and saw the name of the biological mother on the hospital bracelet, she noticed a similarity.

""[The caseworkers] told me her story, which was really similar to Grayson's,"" Page recalled. ""I saw her medical bracelet and the first name of her mother was the same name as Grayson's mom. She didn't have a typical name.""

Page said it was unclear whether or not Grayson and Hannah were brother and sister because their mother had lied about her last name and date of birth when she left Grayson at the hospital on the day he was born. Both children had been exposed to methamphetamines in the womb, according to Page.

Page's roommate, Ashley Chapa, was present as she began unfolding the mystery.

""It was as surreal as you could imagine,"" Chapa told ""GMA."" ""Katie got her binder out from her paperwork with Grayson and we realized, same first name — everything. I've always thought she was a superwoman, but I think she is more now.""

On Dec. 28, 2018, Page officially adopted Hannah. Months prior, Page had a DNA test done on the children that confirmed them to be biological siblings, she said.

Michael Kors Commits to Going Fur-Free in 2018,https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/michael-kors-commits-to-go-fur-free-in-2018,"LONDON, United Kingdom — Michael Kors is going fur-free. The American accessible luxury brand announced Friday that it will no longer use animal fur in its products, with production being phased out by the end of December 2018. The policy will apply companywide, including the Jimmy Choo brand, which Kors acquired in July.

The house, which has paraded models down the runway wearing luxurious fur coats in the past, joins a growing number of fashion companies looking at alternatives after coming under pressure from animal rights activists and changing consumer tastes.

“This decision marks a new chapter as our company continues to evolve its use of innovative materials,” said John D. Idol, Michael Kors’ chairman and chief executive, in a statement.

“Due to technological advances in fabrications, we now have the ability to create a luxe aesthetic using non-animal fur,” added designer Michael Kors. “We will showcase these new techniques in our upcoming runway show in February.”

Michael Kors’ move follows a similar initiative by Gucci, which in October pledged to drop fur from its collections, joining brands like Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Armani, which are all fur-free. Retailers including Selfridges and Yoox-Net-a-Porter also do not sell fur items.

Yet despite a number of brands announcing fur-free policies, the use of the material in collections still prevails, said Fur Information Council of America spokesperson Keith Kaplan: ""Nearly 70 percent of major designers included fur in their Autumn/Winter 2017 collections.""

“In the pre-Fall 2018 showings currently underway, fur continues to maintain a major presence, because innovative new techniques in fur processing and production allow designers a breadth of creative possibilities unmatched by any other textile,” said Kaplan. “Designers and consumers also recognise the value of fur as a natural and sustainable product, as well as the artisanal craft skills that make each fur piece unique, [which is] especially important as consumers become more aware of the environmental and social costs of mass-produced fast fashion.""

“Killing animals for fur is archaic and inhumane,” said Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS).

PJ Smith, the HSUS’s senior manager of fashion policy, who worked with the company on its fur-free policy, added: “Today’s consumers want fashionable, luxurious clothing and accessories that also align with their social values and Michael Kors’ fur-free move makes it a leader in that regard.”

The announcement comes after animal rights activists interrupted Kors' speech in June 2017, in a packed theatre at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. Over 20 protestors took the stage and balcony, while chanting and playing the sounds of animals being killed for fur, shutting down the event for approximately ten minutes.

Protestors have also been targeting fashion brands at London Fashion Week over the industry’s continued use of fur in its collections.

Husband walks miles with sign to find a kidney donor for wife withe stage 5 kidney failure,http://people.com/human-interest/husband-who-walked-miles-for-wife-finds-donor/,"The 74-year-old man who walked miles to find his ill wife a kidney finally got his wish

The 74-year-old man who walked miles every day in a bad to find his wife a kidney finally got his wish.

Wayne Winters, of Farr West, Utah, was desperate to find a kidney for his wife of 26 years, Deanne Winters, who has stage 5 kidney failure.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

On Sunday, Winters told KSTU that he got the call they were both waiting for after two years – there was a kidney available.

“I was just so overwhelmed,” he said of the call he received from the hospital. “I didn’t know what to think.”

Finding a donor is no small feat — there are 3,000 new patients added to the kidney donor waiting list each month, and 13 people die every day while waiting for their chance, according to the National Kidney Foundation. It’s hard to know how long someone will remain on the waiting list, but waits of three years or more are not uncommon.

Winters walked miles every day by the side of busy roads wearing a sign asking for anyone to donate a kidney to his wife for weeks. After his story went viral, hundreds contacted him.

“Between seven to 800 [calls], it filled my phone up,” he said. “I’m sitting here with this full phone.”

Despite all the offers, his wife’s kidney actually came from an organ donor who had passed away. The new kidney will give the couple more time together and new memories to add to their two decades together.

“If she can gave a good five years that would be awesome, we can have our life back,” Winters said.

Now that his wife has been given a second chance, Winters plans to continue his daily walks with his sign to help others have the same chance.

“I will spend more of my days walking with my sign to see how many I can get,” he said. “Think about it, we could start a kidney revolution and that would be so great.”"
"Iceland has become the first major retailer to commit to eliminate plastic packaging for all own brand products within five years to help end the ""scourge"" of plastic pollution.

The retailer said it would be replacing plastic with packaging including paper and pulp trays and paper bags which would be recyclable through domestic waste collections or in-store recycling facilities.

Iceland said it was the first major retailer globally to go ""plastic-free"" on its own label products and aimed to complete the move by the end of 2023.

It has already removed plastic disposable straws from its own label range and new food ranges set to hit the shelves in early 2018 will use paper-based rather than plastic food trays.

The move, which has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, comes amid growing concern over plastic pollution in the world's oceans, where it can harm and kill wildlife such as turtles and seabirds."

Un ultracentenario ha vinto la dura battaglia contro il coronavirus. Una storia da raccontare, una piccola notizia che deve dare forza a tutti quella riportata oggi da RiminiToday. ""Questa mattina - racconta il vice sindaco di Rimini, Gloria Lisi - mi è stata data una piccola notizia: il signor P., riminese, positivo al Covid 19, è stato dimesso dall’ospedale Infermi di Rimini ed è tornato a casa. Visto l’incedere del virus, non potrebbe neanche dirsi ‘una storia come tante’ se non fosse per un particolare che rende davvero straordinaria la vita della persona tornata dai suoi cari. Il signor P., riminese, è nato nel 1919, nel pieno di un’altra tragica pandemia mondiale"".

Nato durante la Spagnola, si ammala di Covid-19: guarisce a 101 anni a Rimini

Il riferimento del vice sindaco è all'epidemia di spagnola. L'influenza spagnola, altrimenti conosciuta come la grande influenza o epidemia spagnola, fu una pandemia influenzale, insolitamente mortale, che fra il 1918 e il 1920 uccise decine di milioni di persone nel mondo. Si stima che le vittime italiane furono almeno 600.000.

""101 anni, il secolo breve vissuto quasi per intero e poi questo primo scorcio del nuovo Millennio. Ha visto tutto, il signor P. Guerre, fame, dolore, progresso, crisi e resurrezioni.

La scorsa settimana il signor P. è stato ricoverato al nosocomio di Rimini, essendo positivo al test Covid 19"".

Nel giro di pochi giorni la storia è corsa di bocca in bocca. Ce n'era un disperato bisogno tra i medici, gli infermieri, tutto il personale sanitario.

""Una speranza per il futuro di tutti noi nel corpo di una persona ultracentenaria, quando le cronache tristi di queste settimane raccontano meccanicamente ogni giorno di un virus che si accanisce soprattutto sugli anziani"" commenta Lisi.

"Enamel regeneration breakthrough could end tooth decay agony, scientists say - Researchers say they can trigger the growth of crystals in an ""exciting"" breakthrough that could help protect people's teeth.",https://news.sky.com/story/scientists-claim-they-can-regenerate-tooth-enamel-to-prevent-decay-11392540,"Scientists claim they have developed a material that could help regenerate tooth enamel to prevent decay and sensitivity.

Enamel, the outer coating of the teeth, is the hardest tissue in the body and can resist extreme temperatures and acidic food and drinks.

But unlike other tissues it cannot regrow, leading to pain and tooth loss for roughly 50% of the world's population.

Researchers at Queen Mary University of London say they have developed a way to grow mineralised material, paving the way for regenerating hard tissues such as enamel and bone.

The team found a protein that is able to trigger the growth of crystals, in a similar way to how crystals grow when dental enamel develops in the body.

The experts believe their work, published in science journal Nature Communications, has the potential to be used in a variety of ways in regenerative medicine.

Image: Researchers believe their breakthrough could help treat hypersensitivity

Dr Sherif Elsharkawy, a dentist and co-author of the study, said: ""This is exciting because the simplicity and versatility of the mineralisation platform opens up opportunities to treat and regenerate dental tissues.

""For example, we could develop acid-resistant bandages that can infiltrate, mineralise, and shield exposed dentinal tubules (microscopic channels) in human teeth for the treatment of hypersensitivity.""

Lead author Professor Alvaro Mata said the ""key discovery"" had been finding a way to exploit proteins to control and guide the process of mineralisation.

He added: ""Through this, we have developed a technique to easily grow synthetic materials that emulate such hierarchically organised architecture over large areas and with the capacity to tune their properties.""

The findings come months after it was reported that children and teenagers had almost 43,000 ""completely preventable"" NHS operations to remove rotting teeth in 2017.

Analysis of NHS spending data by the Local Government Association found that £36.2m was spent on 42,911 extractions for under-18s in 2016/17, which equates to 170 operations a day."

Tanaka marked her birthday with a party on Sunday along with staff and friends at the nursing home, television footage from local broadcaster TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting Co showed.

Tanaka, whose birthday was on Jan. 2, took a bite from a slice of her big birthday cake. “Tasty,” she said with a smile. “I want some more.”

Tanaka was last year confirmed as the oldest living person, aged 116 years 66 days old as of March 9, according to Guinness World Records.

Tanaka’s record age is symbolic of Japan’s fast-ageing population, which coupled with its falling birthrate is raising concerns about labor shortages and prospects for future economic growth.

The number of babies born in Japan fell an estimated 5.9% last year to fewer than 900,000 for the first time since the government started compiling data in 1899, according to Japan’s welfare ministry.

Tanaka was born prematurely in 1903 and married Hideo Tanaka in 1922, Guinness World Records said. The couple had four children and adopted a fifth."

Scotland bans companies based in tax havens from accessing coronavirus bailout money,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/scotland-tax-have-ban-coronavirus-bailout-fund-a9526006.html,"Scotland has become the latest country to block companies based in tax havens from accessing coronavirus bailout funds, in a move that will increase pressure on Boris Johnson’s government to introduce similar measures.

MSPs approved new rules on Wednesday night that will mean companies that are registered in tax havens, or are a subsidiary of an offshore company, cannot apply for government grants.

France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Wales and Argentina have applied similar policies to their coronavirus business-support packages.

A second amendment to the Scottish legislation, introduced by the Green Party, would have required companies taking bailout money to commit to country-by-country reporting in their accounts. However, the amendment was voted down.

Country-by-country reporting has long been a central policy request of the tax justice movement because it would open up to public scrutiny any shifting of corporate profits into tax havens.

Campaigners welcomed the Scottish parliament’s move but warned that it would not prevent large firms that avoid billions in tax from accessing bailout funds.

Scotland, like other European countries that have introduced tax-haven clauses, is relying on the EU’s blacklist of tax havens that does not include some notable tax-avoidance hotspots, such as Jersey, the British Virgin Islands, Switzerland and the Netherlands.

The Tax Justice Network’s chief executive, Alex Cobham, said this would leave the door open to companies registered in many of the world’s most dangerous corporate tax havens.

He said: “The EU tax-haven blacklist, which Scotland and other European countries are relying on to stop Covid-19 bailouts from ending up in tax havens, is based on an old-fashioned notion of tax havens as small, palm-fringed islands and ignores the reality of modern-day tax havenry.

“Many of the biggest corporate tax havens are based right here in Europe.”

According to the Tax Justice Network’s research, Luxembourg is responsible for 11 times more corporate tax avoidance risk than the EU-blacklisted Seychelles.

The network estimates that Luxembourg costs EU members over $12bn (£9.8bn) in lost corporate tax per year.

“The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the grave costs of an international tax system programmed to prioritise the interest of corporate giants over the needs of people,” Mr Cobham said.

“For years, corporate tax havens like the Netherlands and Luxembourg have fuelled a race to the bottom, handing over wealth and power to the biggest corporations and taking it away from the nurses and public service workers risking their lives today to protect ours.”

Scotland’s measures, which were backed by the SNP and the Conservatives, cover a £120m fund that provides grants for small- and medium-sized firms, and a £30m bailout fund for creative, tourism and hospitality businesses.

Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green Party co-leader, said: “Any company which avoids its responsibility to contribute to society should not be getting handouts when things go wrong. That’s why many European nations and Wales have already made this commitment."
Scientists make historic breakthrough that could save dying coral reefs from climate change,http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/2019/08/21/scientists-coax-imperiled-florida-coral-to-spawn-in-a-lab-for-the-first-time/,"APOLLO BEACH -- After two years and more than $4.5 million, scientists working with the Florida Aquarium have pulled off something no one else ever has: They coaxed imperiled Atlantic Ocean coral into spawning in a laboratory, aquarium officials announced Wednesday.

The fact that this can be done in a lab, they said, is a hopeful sign for saving the Florida coral reef that stretches along the state’s Atlantic coast from Martin County south to the Keys. The corals there have been suffering from the effects of warming water and acidification due to climate change, as well as a disease that has left them in danger of extinction. Scientists hope to cultivate enough lab-spawned pillar coral to rebuild the reef.

“This is a massive breakthrough,” said Jaime Craggs of the Horniman Museum and Gardens in London, a partner in the rescue effort. Craggs was the first scientist to successfully get Pacific coral to spawn in a lab six years ago.

The historic event occurred at 12:45 p.m. Saturday in a 350-gallon tank. The tank sits in a small, dark room on the second floor of a wooden building next to a Tampa Electric Co. power plant. Scientists used computer-controlled lighting and manipulated water temperatures and flow to fool the pillar coral into believing it was just after sunset, the right time to spawn.

Keri O’Neil, 39, the aquarium’s senior coral scientist, almost missed it. After constantly monitoring the progress of the 30 corals in the tanks, she had stepped out of the room for just a minute. When she stepped back in, an assistant wearing a red headlamp pointed to one of the lumpy brown corals and said, “This one is releasing its sperm.”

[OCTAVIO JONES | Times]. [ OCTAVIO JONES | Times ]

“What?"" O’Neil asked, not believing it. She was shocked to see a cloud of sperm floating in the water. Soon the female coral were pushing out their eggs to mingle with the cloud and become fertilized.

“It just kept going for half an hour,” O’Neil said, still sounding giddy while discussing it Wednesday. “They were spawning right at the time they would have spawned in the wild.”

Before long they had 30,000 coral larvae wiggling around. After reporting the project’s success to aquarium president and CEO Roger Germann, O’Neil said, “our celebration was just to collect the larvae and start raising them.”

The group of scientists and volunteers scooped the larvae out with big plastic cups she said, then poured them — 4,000 at a time — into pitchers to carry to a big greenhouse next door. They walked very carefully down one flight of stairs, across a grass expanse and then back up another set of steps.

“It was the most careful walk ever,” O’Neil said. “We didn’t spill any.”

The center for Conservation utilizes large aquarium holding systems powered by LED technology and computer-controlled systems that mimic its natural environment and signals coral to reproduce. [OCTAVIO JONES | Times] [ OCTAVIO JONES | Times ]

In just one day of observing those larvae, she said, they learned more about raising them than they had ever known before. The larvae swam around and eventually will settle onto small, square tiles with algae on them. That’s where they will begin to grow.

At some point when they mature, perhaps in two years, the scientists will explore replanting them in the Keys as part of an effort to rebuild the declining reef system, O’Neil said.

Getting to this point has taken a lot of work, as well as funding from the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Each summer, the Florida Aquarium sends divers to the Florida Keys for the annual spawning of the coral to collect specimens. The collected spawn is taken to a lab in the Keys to sort out what they have collected. Some may be released back into nature and the rest are raised in the Apollo Beach greenhouses, which the aquarium officials call “arks” after the biblical boat that saved humanity from a flood.

The aquarium scientists use data collected by sensors on a buoy in the Keys to dictate the conditions in the spawning tanks, gradually adjusting the lights and the water to match what’s going on in the wild, O’Neil said. Ping-pong balls with lights stand in for the moon, for instance.

The pillar coral will take a year to spawn again, she said, but they hope to coax another imperiled species, maze coral, into spawning in about three months. They also hope to fill in a lot of the blanks about how the species reproduces.

“We barely know anything about its spawning in the wild,” she said.

Germann said that the federal and state funding helped, as did Tampa Electric parent TECO’s agreement to lease the aquarium 22 acres for $1 a year. But some of the funding also came from the aquarium’s own ticket sales.

“Everyone who bought a ticket to the Florida Aquarium has their fingerprints on the success of this project,” he said.

Plastic bag use down 90% in England since 5p levy,https://economia.icaew.com/news/august-2019/plastic-bag-use-down-90-in-england-since-5p-levy?,"Sales of plastic bags in England’s largest supermarkets have fallen by 90% in the four years since the government introduced a 5p levy

England’s seven largest supermarkets sold 490 million fewer single-use plastic bags in 2018/19 than the year before – a drop of almost half, the department for environment, food and rural affairs (DEFRA) has revealed.

In 2014, more than 7.5 billion bags were sold per year. Five years on, just 1.1 billion were sold.

The 5p charge on plastic bag sales have also contributed to £169m worth of charity donations, with more than £22m raised in 2018/19 alone, according to DEFRA.

Environment secretary Theresa Villiers said, “No one wants to see the devastating impact plastic waste is having on our precious wildlife. Today’s figures are a powerful demonstration that we are collectively calling time on being a throwaway society.”

If marine litter is not tackled, plastic in the sea will treble in a decade, government scientists have warned.

The government has also recently announced a range of measures to eliminate all forms of avoidable plastic waste, including a ban on microbeads. Plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds will also be banned from April 2020.

The Scottish government has already committed to a deposit return scheme for drinks containers, and Westminster has recently consulted on the same.

If a consultation on the idea is approved, the UK government will also introduce a tax on any plastic packaging that is not made of at least 30% recycled content from April 2022.

The ban is part of a larger LGBTQ rights push announced by Cuomo last year, an agenda that includes prohibiting the so-called gay panic defense in court and adding gender identity to state human rights and hate crime laws. (The Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act passed the Legislature today as well.)

Bans on conversion therapy — which seeks to change one’s sexual orientation or gender identity — repeatedly have passed the Democrat-controlled Assembly, only to die in the Republican-dominated Senate. But the GOP ceded its majority in the midterm election, paving the way for today’s victory.

Democrat Brad Hoylman, who authored the Senate bill, called conversion therapy “among the worst frauds in history.”

“We have to consider the message we are sending to LGBT youth today,” Hoylman said Monday after the bill passed committee. “That we have your back and you are perfect just the way you are.”“The State of New York has a responsibility to stop licensed mental health professionals from causing irreparable damage to LGBT youth and their families,” Hoylman said when advocating for the ban in 2014.

Mathew Shurka, a member of the anti-conversion therapy group Born Perfect, told NBC News he ""feel[s] safer” after the bill’s passage, but he stressed that the fight against the discredited practice is still “not over.”

“The next step is testing the law,” he said, “because there are several working conversion therapy practitioners in New York State.”

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, conversion therapy “can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation.” Techniques used to attempt to change sexual orientation and gender identity have included inducing nausea and vomiting, providing electric shocks, psychotropic medication and hypnosis. And according to a 2009 report by the American Psychological Association, the treatment has been associated with depression, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, high-risk sexual behaviors, homelessness and other issues.

The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law recently estimated that 20,000 LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13 and 17 will undergo conversion therapy by a licensed health care professional before they turn 18, and approximately 57,000 will be subjected to the treatment by a religious leader or spiritual adviser. In 2012, California became the first state to prohibit conversion therapy on minors, and since then more than a dozen other states, the District of Columbia and several localities across the U.S. have followed suit. A number of state legislatures are currently considering bans, including Texas, Minnesota and Indiana.

The issue has also entered the multiplex, with two recent films recounting the struggles of young people subjected to conversion therapy: “The Miseducation of Cameron Post,” starring Chloë Grace Moretz, and “Boy Erased,” with Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe.

Jay-Z and Meek Mill sending 10 million surgical masks to U.S. jails and prisons,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jay-z-meek-mill-reform-alliance-face-masks-ppe-prisons-jails-jack-dorsey-coronavirus/,"With a $10 million boost from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Jay-Z and Meek Mill's criminal justice organization REFORM Alliance is sending 10 million surgical masks and other personal protective equipment to correctional facilities across the country.

""This is 2.3 million Americans that don't usually have the loudest voice,"" Bob Pilon, president of the REFORM Alliance, told CBS News. ""That's why we're doing this, to give that population a voice and answer their call to be treated like humans.""

Dorsey's donation was made through his Smart Small relief fund. He's pledged $1 billion to COVID-19 relief efforts. The charity is based on a transparent tracker of public grants, which Dorsey said will shift focus after the pandemic.

""I'm grateful REFORM exists. The criminal justice system needs to change. COVID-19 adds to the injustices, and REFORM is best suited to help,"" Dorsey said in a statement.

REFORM intends to create a similar system to track the equipment. A small team will manage the program's accountability from start to finish, Pilon said.

The donation coincides with the REFORM's new #AnswerTheirCall digital campaign, an effort to highlight mass incarceration through the accounts of inmates.

The Prison Policy Initiative estimates roughly one-third of U.S. jails have cut their populations by 25% since the pandemic began. In the nation's epicenter of the crisis, New York City's jail population now hovers below 4,000, its lowest level in decades.

A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the difficulties prisons and jails are facing when combating the disease, including the critical need for broad-based testing of both inmates and staff.

Correctional facilities with widespread testing show the highest number of positive cases, suggesting the true number of overall cases behind bars is likely significantly underreported, according to an analysis by the UCLA School of Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project.

Last year, Meek Mill and Jay-Z co-founded REFORM alongside Fanatics owner Michael Rubin and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The organization has already sent 100,000 facemasks to several U.S. correctional facilities.

""I don't think the public yet knows that there's no way to end the pandemic outside of prisons if we don't end it inside of prisons,"" Pilon added. ""It's really important that we look at the solutions to ending this holistically. Prisons are eight of the top 10 hotspots, so people need to care about them."""
California drought officially over after more than seven years,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/california-drought/california-drought-officially-over-after-more-seven-years-n983461?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma,"California is officially free of drought after more than seven years, drought monitors said Thursday.

The Golden State has experienced some form of drought for 376 consecutive weeks, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, tweeted. It’s the first time the state has been free of drought since Dec. 20, 2011.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tweeted that weather in 2017 helped matters, but moderate drought persisted. Rainfall this winter further alleviated the drought, although 7 percent of the state remains ""abnormally dry.""

""The storms this year have really helped snowpacks, the reservoirs,"" said Jessica Blunden, a climatologist with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Colder temperatures also helped prevent snow from melting off, she said.

This winter — the meteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and ends at the end of February — has been the wettest in the United States as a whole since records started being kept in 1895, with an average across the nation of 9.01 inches, which is 2.22 inches above the nationwide average, Blunden said.

That precipitation has not just benefited California. ""It’s been a great winter for the West,"" she said.

The U.S. Drought Monitor website, which is an effort by several agencies including NOAA and the national drought mitigation center, says that well-above precipitation in the West helped build snow pack and fill reservoirs, and that normal conditions have returned to the Salton Sea in the southeastern part of the state.

The Los Angeles area experienced cool winter temperatures that brought the fifth-longest streak of 41 consecutive days with a high temperature below 70 degrees since records began in 1877. Rare snowfall was reported in parts of the Los Angeles area in February.

Nearly 18 inches — 17.99 — of rain fell in downtown Los Angeles from Oct. 1 through Thursday, which is over 5 inches above normal, said Kristen Stewart, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.

A ""super bloom"" of poppies has been reported in Lake Elsinore southeast of Los Angeles, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park northeast of San Diego reported ""great displays of wildflowers"" this week that could last into April because of cool weather and moisture.

The National Weather Service’s Sacramento office tweeted Wednesday that a wet February and March has pushed water year numbers ""well above average"" with parts of the northern Sierras at 136 percent of normal, Sacramento at 126 percent of normal and Redding at 120 percent.

Former Gov. Jerry Brown declared an emergency drought declaration in 2014 and in 2015 ordered urban areas to reduce water use by 25 percent. A campaign also urged drivers to ""go dirty for the drought"" and to not wash their vehicles.

Brown lifted the drought emergency in most of California in 2017, warning ""the next drought could be around the corner."" He added that ""conservation must remain a way of life.""

Some parts of Southern California remain ""abnormally dry due to very dry previous years,"" the U.S. Drought Monitor said on its website. Reservoirs in San Diego County are at 65 percent capacity, and Big Bear Lake was down 18 feet in early March, but levels are expected to rise, it said in weekly drought summary.

The areas listed as abnormally dry were in the southern part of the state, including parts of Orange, Riverside, San Diego and Imperial counties, as well as a small portion in the northern part of the state in Siskiyou County along the Oregon border, according to the drought monitor.

In December, 75 percent of California was in ""moderate drought,"" up from 47 percent in March, according to the monitor.

Conditions can change that quickly, and they can change back to dry conditions as well, Blunden said.

""This happened last year: It was a wet winter, there were beautiful blooms in the spring and then it dried out really fast,"" Blunden said, adding, ""Don't be complacent, because it can change pretty quickly.""

And about those ""Go Dirty for the Drought"" decals?

""Keep it handy, because you never know,"" she said."

Canadian woman finally meets her Australian pen pal after nearly 60 years of friendship,https://globalnews.ca/news/5187013/bc-australia-pen-pals-meet/,"Send this page to someone via email

Nearly 60 years after first sending letters to each other across the Pacific Ocean, a B.C. woman has finally met her Australian pen pal in person.

Dolores Baily of Pitt Meadows hopped a plane to Sydney this month to meet Lyn Carpenter, who first corresponded with Baily after getting a Canadian address to write to in 1960.

After taking a bus to Carpenter’s home in Adelaide, the longtime friends shared their first long hug at the bus station Tuesday night.

“It’s just a formality, meeting in person,” Baily said on a patio in Adelaide the next day with Carpenter at her side.

“Don’t you feel like you’ve already known me?” Baily asked Carpenter, who nodded in agreement. “Because that’s how I feel about you.”

The pair became fast friends after starting their correspondence when they were both 10 years old, sharing interests in music and hobbies throughout their adolescence and into adulthood.

“We were both mad Beatles fans,” Carpenter said with a laugh. “We got through those teenage years together.”

Those early packages would sometimes include more than just letters, Baily said.

“We both used to sew, and we would send little fabric samples of things we were sewing at the time in the mail back and forth.”

As the physical letters transformed through the years into emails and text messages, the women continued to share milestones: they’re both married with two children and have both become grandparents.

“When we had children, we did have a bit of a gap where we didn’t write,” Carpenter said. “I can’t remember who got it going again, but one of us must have realized two years was too long.”

The closest the pair got to meeting before was a few phone calls, which only uncovered more similarities, including their love of choir singing.

As Carpenter shows Baily the sights in Adelaide — including a Beatles memorial — they agree this is just one chapter in their continuing friendship, and will still write to each other as they plan their next reunion.

“We’re both committed to keeping this relationship going,” Baily said.

“She’s the friend who I’ve had the longest,” Carpenter said. “Sixty years is pretty special.”"

David vs. Goliath: Small Irish burger joint wins Big Mac trademark battle against McDonald's,https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/david-vs-goliath-supermacs-wins-big-mac-trademark-battle-against-mcdonalds-37713005.html,"Supermac’s has won a long running battle against McDonald’s to have the use of the iconic Big Mac trademark cancelled across Europe.

In April 2017, the Irish firm formally submitted a request to the European Union Property Office (EUIPO) to cancel the use of the Big Mac and Mc trademarks that McDonald’s has registered in certain classes.

Supermac’s had asked the EU regulator that this take effect on the basis that McDonald’s is engaged in ""trademark bullying; registering brand names... which are simply stored away in a war chest to use against future competitors"".

Now, in a landmark Europe-wide judgement, that has immediate effect, EUIPO said that the multinational had not proven genuine use of the Big Mac trademark as a restaurant name - or as a burger.

""It follows from the above that the EUTM proprietor has not proven genuine use of the contested EUTM for any of the goods and services for which it is registered. As a result, the application for revocation is wholly successful and the contested EUTM must be revoked in its entirety. According to Article 62(1) EUTMR, the revocation will take effect from the date of the application for revocation, that is, as of 11/04/2017.""

Speaking to Independent.ie following the decision, Supermac’s MD, Pat McDonagh said that the judgement represents a victory for small businesses all over the world.

""It doesn't matter how big or how small you are, it's great that you can get a hearing from the European office. I'm delighted with the result; I was hopeful for a positive outcome - but not to the extent to which we won,"" he said.

""It's been a long road, nearly four years, but it was worth it to help protect businesses that are trying to compete against faceless multinationals.

""Never mind David versus Goliath, this unique landmark decision is akin to the Connacht team winning against the All Blacks.""

McDonald’s previously hit Supermacs with a 41-page objection against its plans to use the Supermac’s name in Europe stating that it would ""take unfair advantage of the distinctive character and repute"" of trademarks previous won by the global restaurant giant.

The US firm partly based its objection on already secured trademarks for its products such as the ‘Big Mac’ and ‘Chicken McNuggets’, claiming introducing Supermac’s into the market would cause confusion.

This latest EUIPO judgement could mean that the main argument put forward by the US company is now gone.

""The original objective of our application to cancel was to shine a light on the use of trademark bullying by this multinational to stifle competition,"" said Mr McDonagh.

""We had a very good team working behind it and it took a lot of meetings and discussions to bring everything to this point.

""This now opens the door for the decision to be made by the European trademark office to allow us to use our SuperMac's as a burger across Europe. We are going to continue to pursue that.""

Independent.ie contacted McDonald's for comment and a spokesperson for the global enterprise said: ""We are currently considering our position.""

These companies give staff paid time off when they get a new puppy,http://www.independent.ie/business/in-the-workplace/these-companies-give-staff-paid-time-off-when-they-get-a-puppy-35587082.html,"Anyone who has experienced getting a puppy knows it can be hard work. Owners often refer to their pets as ""fur babies,"" which makes a lot of sense considering how much attention puppies require when you first get them.

Puppies need time to settle into their new home and bond with their owners. They've probably just been taken from their mothers and introduced to a brand new environment, so there's likely to be a lot of crying. And that's before you can even think about house-training.

As it turns out, some companies sympathise with this transition and offer what's known as ""pawternity leave."" In fact, research from Petplan found that 5% of owners have been offered paid leave from their job to adjust to their pet owning duties.

These are some of the companies which give you a few days off to bond with your new best friend.

Mars Petcare was one of the first companies to offer pawternity leave. The company offers its employees ten hours of paid leave when they get a new pet, and they can bring them into the office after that.

A tech company based in Manchester called BitSol Solutions offers its employees a full week of paid leave if they get a new pet. According to the Metro, company owner Greg Buchanan said: ""Pets are like babies nowadays, so why shouldn't staff have some time off when they arrive?""

Scottish brewery company BrewDog has just started offering a week of paid leave. The reason given on the BrewDog website is that they just really love dogs. Also, it aims to be ""the best company to work for, ever.""

There's also a growing trend to offer employees time off when their pets die. Losing your furry friend is devastating, and more and more companies are sympathising.

Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants in San Francisco offers three days leave, Mars Inc offers one day and flexible hours, California-based software company VMware and Boston-based Maxwell Health both offer flexible days, and Trupanion, a Seattle-based pet insurance company, offers employees one day. Canadian company Shoppers Drug Mart lets employees take days off if they have a loss in the family, and they say that includes a beloved pet.

Homeless man who found New Jersey bombs is given apartment and job prospects,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/homeless-man-who-found-new-jersey-bombs-is-given-apartment-and-job-prospects-a7329031.html,"Lee Parker needed a backpack for a job interview the next day. He had been homeless for several years and carried his few possessions in a plastic bag.

So when he and a friend came across a new backpack sitting atop a garbage can next to the Elizabeth, New Jersey, train station last Sunday night, it was like divine providence. He picked it up and they walked a bit. It was only when he looked inside that he saw a maze of wires hooked up to makeshift pipe bombs.

Mr Parker and his friend, Ivan White, took the bag to a remote area in case the explosives detonated and went straight to the police.

Since then, they have been hailed as heroes for potentially saving the lives of hundreds on a weekend that saw bombs also planted in Manhattan and Seaside Park, NJ.

One man who was particularly moved was Donald Goncalves, a 52-year-old, lifelong resident of Elizabeth.

“I care a lot about my town,” he said in an interview on Friday. “I used to be a commuter to New York myself. It touched me in a very profound way. How could I take what could have been a devastating moment and turn it into something positive?”

Mr Goncalves turned to online crowdfunding, hoping to raise just a little bit of money as a token of appreciation for the men. He set a goal of $10,000 that would be split three ways between them and the Elizabeth Coalition to House the Homeless, a local non-profit organisation that has already found Parker an apartment, Mr Goncalves said. Mr White lives in subsidised housing on a fixed income.

Within days, the GoFundMe page that Mr Goncalves set up had doubled its goal, and has raised more than $28,000 (£21,600).

Mr Goncalves, who has become a spokesman for Mr Parker and Mr White – he has had inquiries for talk-show appearances and from the National Football League’s New York Jets to honour them at a game – said he is eager to get the money distributed. Some have criticised his decision to give the local homeless organisation a third of the money, but Mr Goncalves felt it was important to give something to the group that will help Mr Parker get back on his feet.

Mr Parker didn’t make it to his job interview on Monday morning – he was going to apply to load trucks – because he was still being interviewed by law enforcement. But Mr Goncalves said a large food company based in Elizabeth has already been in touch about giving Mr Parker a job.

The men were interviewed by ABC7NY this week and downplayed their roles as heroes.

“I’m just glad I was able to realise what the situation was and react in such a way that, thank goodness, no one got hurt,” Mr White told the TV station.

“Hero? No. I wouldn’t go that far. [I was] doing the right thing,” Mr Parker added.

Mr Goncalves said that when he found Mr Parker to tell him he was raising money for him, all Mr Parker said in response was that he was hungry and needed to get food.

(Don Goncalves (Don Goncalves)

“Eight thousand dollars is a lot to him, but it’s nothing for us. From our perspective, it’s chump change for what he did for us. It’s just a token for him to understand how significant his contribution was to society,” Mr Goncalves said. “This is America, and these stories of heroism and celebrity is the type of stuff we thrive upon, but it’s so nice to see common guys like Lee and Ivan be the recipients of it.”

Turtle swims from Africa to Australia on release from 20 years in captivity,http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-07/yoshi-turtle-journey-tracked-37000km-from-cape-town-to-australia/12024088,"An 180 kilogram turtled named Yoshi has excited scientists, who tracked her remarkable journey halfway around the world after she was released from 20 years in captivity.

Key points: Scientists have tracked a loggerhead turtle from South Africa to the West Australian coast over the past two years

Scientists have tracked a loggerhead turtle from South Africa to the West Australian coast over the past two years Scientists think Yoshi may be have been hatched in Australia, and she is returning home

Scientists think Yoshi may be have been hatched in Australia, and she is returning home An aquarium in Cape Town believes it's the first recorded movement of a sea turtle between Africa and Australia

It's believed the loggerhead turtle may be Australian, after she made a determined 37,000-kilometre swim across the Indian Ocean to a turtle nesting site on Western Australia's Pilbara coastline.

Scientists, who began tracking her journey from Cape Town two years ago, believe Yoshi may have wanted to return to her original hatching site to breed and nest.

Sabrina Fossette, a research scientist from WA's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, said it was very exciting.

""This turtle spent 20 years in captivity and still, you put her in the water and she suddenly remembers she probably has something to do on the other side of the ocean and just starts crossing it,"" Dr Fossette said.

WA scientists will next week attempt to locate the turtle, to obtain biopsy samples to determine her origin, check her health, and to replace the satellite tracking device, which is nearing the end of its life.

""This satellite has been working for two years but might stop at any time, particularly when the turtle is close to the shore,"" Dr Fossette said.

'She crept into everybody's hearts'

Yoshi arrived at Cape Town's Two Oceans Aquarium after crew on a Japanese fishing boat found her with a damaged shell.

""They contacted the aquarium to ask if we could please come and fetch this little turtle,"" aquarium chief executive Maryke Musson said.

""At the time, the aquarium had only been open for two years, so we did not really anticipate keeping sea turtles on display.

""We did not know all that much, but she crept into everybody's hearts, and settled down really quickly.

""And she had an enormous personality.""

The aquarium staff learned a lot about caring for injured turtles from Yoshi, but soon also started getting requests to help more and more stranded and injured turtles.

Ms Musson said the aquarium had rehabilitated and released more than 600 sea turtles in the past 10 to 12 years.

A team from Two Oceans Aquarium released Yoshi back into the ocean near Cape Town, South Africa, two years ago. ( Supplied: Olivia Anderson )

The aquarium's rehabilitation program was so successful, attention eventually turned to whether Yoshi herself should be released back into the ocean.

By then, she had grown to 180kg with many decades of life still potentially ahead of her.

""She was coming to an age when she was probably sexually mature and we were wondering whether she would actually adjust back to life in the wild,"" Ms Musson said.

Other large turtles were rehabilitated and released successfully, so the aquarium decided to prepare Yoshi for release — with a strict exercise regime.

'Incredible journey'

Ms Musson said aquarium staff encouraged Yoshi to swim 20m lengths as part of her training.

""Early on, we actually trained her to feed on a target, because she quickly caught on that she was getting food from divers, so she actually started harassing anybody in her big exhibit,"" she said.

""So by training her on a target, it allowed us to do any sort of investigation, have a quick look at her, give her a health check up, and then of course get her to move around in the exhibit, chasing a target.

""We actually called it 'Yoshi tennis'.

""We would have two divers in the exhibit, one on either side, and she would swim these lengths, which was 20m across every day for a little treat.""

The training continued for 18 months, until December 2017 when, after a farewell party, aquarium staff working with South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs fitted Yoshi with a satellite tag and released her 30 nautical miles off Cape Town.

""[We] put her back in the ocean, waved goodbye, and she swam off,"" Ms Musson said.

""Since then we've been following her and it's been an incredible journey.

""We had no idea where she was heading, because of course we had no idea from which loggerhead population she was from.""

Yoshi's big swim

Yoshi spent her first year swimming up the west coast of Africa, to Angola, before turning around and returning to Cape Town. Then she headed across the Indian Ocean for Australia.

""We are thrilled because of course she's protected over there. There are lots of sea turtles, and it seems as though there is a lot of food for her to eat,"" Ms Musson said.

""And what's also incredible is the interest — by everybody.""

The aquarium contacted the WA Government, and its scientists then started watching Yoshi too.

Currently, Yoshi is just off the Pilbara coast near Point Samson.

""It looks like she might actually be foraging,"" Dr Fossette said.

""She's been swimming around in a smallish area for two days now and she's very, very close to the coast.

""Now that she's actually stopped we think we can give it a go and try to jump on a boat and try to find her and maybe even catch her.""

""We think we will give it a go but we need to be a bit lucky to find her. But who knows?""

Dr Fossette said if Yoshi was an Australian turtle, she was in the right place, close to a known turtle nesting site.

""She's a bit late for this nesting season, so she probably won't nest this year, and anyway after swimming 37,000 kilometres, you probably need to feed a little bit and eat a little bit and put on some weight before laying eggs,"" she said.

""Maybe next next year or the year after.""

Yoshi gathers support on her journey

Ms Musson said Yoshi's journey had been followed, and celebrated, around the world.

She said it was believed to be the first recorded movement of a sea turtle between Africa and Australia.

Yoshi also navigated, and survived, hazards such as plastic pollution, fishing gear and vessels, swimming around 50km a day.

""It's a very impressive distance for a turtle her size,"" Ms Musson said.

""When we released her she was 180kg, which is on the bigger side for an adult loggerhead.

""I think it's helped her a lot, it's kept her safe and she's strong.

""We are incredibly proud of what she's done and what she's achieved thus far."""

Vaccination method that wiped out smallpox gets unleashed today on Ebola,https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/vaccination-method-that-wiped-out-smallpox-gets-unleashed-today-on-ebola/,"With more than 7,500 doses of an experimental vaccine against Ebola, health officials today began a vaccination campaign to try to thwart the latest outbreak of the deadly virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

According to the World Health Organization, the campaign will start with healthcare workers operating in areas affected by the outbreak. Then officials will focus on a “ring vaccination” strategy, which targets people who have had contact with someone with a confirmed case of Ebola, as well as people who have had contact with those contacts. (This creates rings of vaccination around each case, hence the name). These defensive social circles ensure that those most vulnerable to contracting the virus are protected while also preventing the spread of the virus from the most likely sources. The same strategy was critical during the campaign in the 1960s and ‘70s to eradicate smallpox—the only human disease that has ever been successfully wiped out.

The Ebola-vaccination campaign will take place in the DRC’s northwestern Equator Province (Province de l’Équateur), where there have been 46 confirmed, probable, or suspected cases, including 26 deaths, as of May 18. Officials have already identified 600 contacts and contacts of contacts of cases. Nearly all cases and contacts have been in the remote town of Bikoro. But officials counted four confirmed cases in Mbandaka, a provincial capital with more than a million residents. This has raised concerns about the potential for the outbreak to explode.

The more than 7,500 doses of vaccine already in the DRC are enough to cover approximately 50 rings of 150 people, the WHO notes. An additional 8,000 doses are on their way to the country, arriving in the next few days.

The experimental vaccine—rVSVΔG-ZEBOV—has not been approved by relevant regulatory authorities, but the WHO has given it the greenlight under an expanded access/compassionate-use protocol. The organization has reason to be optimistic that the vaccine will squash the outbreak.

Trial by fire

The vaccine is a live, chimeric virus capable of replicating in cells. It has the backbone of the relatively harmless vesicular stomatitis virus, which tends to infect cattle and only causes mild disease in humans. This engineered virus also carries the code for Ebola’s glycoprotein. This is a protein that hangs on the outside of Ebola viruses and allows them to invade and infect human cells. On the vaccine virus, the protein can prompt the human immune system to develop protective responses against the real Ebola.

In early work, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV protected mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and non-human primates from Ebola. In 2015, an international team of researchers conducted trials of ring vaccination in Guinea and Sierra Leone, vaccinating nearly 6,000 within 117 rings. The results suggested that the vaccine was generally safe and 100-percent effective at preventing Ebola. None of those vaccinated developed Ebola virus disease, whereas there were 23 cases among contacts in the trial who were either not vaccinated or received a delayed vaccination.

Despite high hopes for the vaccine in this outbreak, the ring campaign won’t be easy to pull off in such a remote area of the DRC. “Implementing the Ebola ring vaccination is a complex procedure,” Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement. “The vaccines need to be stored at a temperature of minus 60 to minus 80 degrees centigrade, and so transporting them to and storing them in affected areas is a major challenge.”

So far, WHO, local health authorities, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF aka Doctors Without Borders), and other partners have established an air bridge and have used helicopters and motorbikes to get around and deliver supplies. They’ve also transported the vaccine in containers that maintain sub-zero conditions for up to a week and have set up freezers in Bikoro and Mbandaka.

As officials scramble, they hope the efforts are enough. “We need to act fast to stop the spread of Ebola by protecting people at risk of being infected with the Ebola virus, identifying and ending all transmission chains, and ensuring that all patients have rapid access to safe, high-quality care,” Dr. Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general for Emergency Preparedness and Response, added in a statement."

Ontario launches basic income pilot for 4,000 in Hamilton, Thunder Bay, Lindsay

The three-year pilot project, which began in the Hamilton and Thunder Bay areas last summer and in Lindsay last fall, is testing whether unconditional cash support can boost health, education and housing for people on social assistance or earning low wages.

Information gleaned from the three test sites will guide future provincial policy on how to better support all Ontarians living in poverty.

The province is among several areas in the world experimenting with the idea of a basic income, including Finland, which began a two-year pilot last January.

After couch-surfing for almost two years, Moore, 60, is using her basic income payment to look for stable housing.

“My biggest focus is getting my own place and giving poor John his apartment back,” said Moore, who has been sleeping on her friend’s living room sofa for about a year.

Before joining the program in October, the single mother of six and grandmother of 12 was “barely surviving” on $330 a month in basic needs allowance from Ontario Works, the province’s welfare program for people without disabilities.

Her total income for 2016 was $4,247.

Because Moore was homeless, she was not eligible for a shelter allowance that would have brought her monthly Ontario Works payment to just over $700.

But under the basic income experiment, Moore receives $1,416 a month, an amount that remains constant no matter where she lives.

“It is giving me back my independence,” she said. “I don’t feel so backed into a corner. If I want to eat, I can afford to buy something instead of going to a food bank or a soup kitchen.”

Moore and the others are among almost 3,000 people enrolled so far in the test sites. The province hopes to recruit 6,000 participants, including 4,000 who will receive a basic income, fill out surveys and participate in focus groups as part of the study.

A further 2,000 won’t get the monthly payments but will be paid to complete surveys and tracked as a control group.

Thunder Bay heating and fireplace installer Taras Harapyuk, who hasn’t worked since 2015 when he fell lifting a ladder out of his truck, signed up for the pilot project last September. He learned last week that his application was randomly selected as part of the control group.

“I was very disappointed to hear I wasn’t chosen to get the extra money,” Harapyuk said. “But I will fill out the surveys. I am happy to help.”

Adults in the three test sites age 18 to 64 with incomes under $34,000 before taxes and deductions, or couples with incomes under $48,000, are eligible. The income cut-off for individuals with disabilities is $46,000.

If participants find employment or get a better job, their basic income payments are reduced by 50 cents for every dollar earned until they are no longer financially eligible. But unlike social assistance, which is adjusted monthly, basic income payments are calculated once a year, based on the participant’s previous year’s income tax return.

Project administrators can make mid-year adjustments if participants lose a job or go back to school, change a living arrangement or become disabled.

After a slow start last summer, enrolment topped 2,544 at the end of January and the project is on track to be fully enrolled by the summer, the government says.

“We are well on our way to reaching full enrolment of participants into the pilot and have the measures in place to ensure this study is conducted with the utmost integrity, rigour and ethical standards,” said Social Services Minister Helena Jaczek and Housing Minister Peter Milczyn, the government’s co-chairs for the pilot project.

“What we learn from this pilot will help inform our longer-term plans to better support people living on low incomes,” they said in a joint statement.

Goold, 60, who has a developmental disability and suffers from severe arthritis, was receiving about $1,400 a month from the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) before her first basic income payment arrived in October.

Since then, her monthly income has increased by 28 per cent to $1,806.

In addition to being able to buy a new walker “with all the bells and whistles” for about $500, the extra money allowed her to take her husband, Don, to the Keg for his 65th birthday this month.

“It’s nice to be able to celebrate a milestone like everybody else,” she said.

Fellow Hamilton resident Alana Baltzer, 28, traded her $722 monthly ODSP benefit for a basic income of $1,915 in October.

It meant Baltzer, who had previously shopped only at thrift stores, was able to take advantage of Black Friday sales in November to buy her first new winter coat.

“It has certainly come in handy with the cold weather,” she said.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

While the cash means the cost of Baltzer’s rent-geared-to-income bachelor apartment will rise to $520 from $200 a month, her spending money has almost tripled.

After growing up on welfare and living in social housing most of her life, Baltzer says basic income could allow her to move into market housing “away from all the fighting and noise.”

“This has already been a huge life-change for me,” she said. “I have a full fridge. I am eating more healthy food.”

And she says she can finally afford a mouth guard to help correct chronic teeth problems caused by years of poor eating.

She has opened a tax-free savings account and hopes to find someone to help manage her finances.

“It still hasn’t sunk in that I can afford things,” she said.

Some participants may squander the money, said Laura Cattari, 48, part-time co-ordinator with the Hamilton Roundtable for Poverty Reduction. But as someone who relied on social assistance for 12 years after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia and other health problems, Cattari believes people in the study are more likely to be reluctant to spend.

For example, Cattari says, it took her more than a year after landing her job at the roundtable in 2016 before she felt comfortable buying something as basic as a new sweater.

“That’s what deprivation does over the long-term. It makes you afraid to change. Basic income will make people healthier and less stressed, for sure. But it takes time,” she said.

“To change attitudes and outlook, people need to feel comfortable and not stressed. And I’m not sure three years is long enough.”

Kwame McKenzie, the province’s special adviser on the initiative, says researchers would love to have 10 years to study the effect of a basic income.

But with automation and the rapidly changing workplace, government needs information quickly to help guide possible changes to social assistance, said McKenzie, CEO of the Wellesley Institute health think-tank and director of health equity at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

The project is being independently assessed by researchers from St. Michael’s Hospital and McMaster University who will track changes in employment, health, education, food security and housing through surveys and focus groups.

“We won’t be comparing one person to another person. We will be looking at groups of people who get the basic income compared to people who don’t,” he said.

In Lindsay, a so-called “saturation site” where about 2,000 residents, or almost everyone living in poverty, will receive the basic income, researchers will also be assessing how the community changes.

“We will be looking at things like the level of unemployment and crime and comparing it to three or four other places that are as close to the GTA as Lindsay with the same size of population,” McKenzie said.

Lindsay resident Kathy Mahood, 53, who joined the pilot project in October, says she has already seen a difference in the community of about 22,000 just north of Peterborough.

“People are relieved and happy for the extra help,” she said. “I really notice it when the cheques start coming out at the end of the month. The stores are much busier. The town is busy, busy. A lot busier than it was before. There are lineups at the grocery store. It’s definitely injecting more money into the community.”

Mahood fell into deep poverty after a work-related back injury and the death of her husband two years ago.

When she joined the pilot project in October, she was living on about $735 a month in federal Canada Pension Plan disability benefits and proceeds from the sale of her house.

“I figured I had a year and a half left before I would lose my apartment and have to rent a room. It was pretty frightening,” she said.

But with $1,200 in basic income every month on top of her disability benefits, Mahood has money for rent and healthy food — and has begun making regular payments to clear her credit card debt.

“If I am careful, I should be debt-free when the program ends in three years,” she said.

Mahood was able to buy modest Christmas gifts for her four grandchildren in December. She could afford to buy ingredients for Christmas baking. She can put gas in her car and has money for repairs.

“I feel healthier and I am not stressed all the time about money,” she said.

Back in Hamilton, Lance Dingman, 56, acknowledges some people may be afraid to switch to basic income, which, unlike social assistance, is not off limits to debt collectors.

But the thought of losing everything didn’t dissuade Dingman, who has been on ODSP for most of his life because of chronic osteomyelitis, a bone disease that cost him his right leg in 1990.

“We’re all fighting for a break,” he said. “Well, the break is here, so let’s make the best of it.”

Plastic bags to be banned in New York state.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/nyregion/plastic-bag-ban-.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

ALBANY — New York State lawmakers have agreed to impose a statewide ban on most types of single-use plastic bags from retail sales, changing a way of life for millions of New Yorkers as legislators seek to curb an unsightly and omnipresent source of litter.

The plan, proposed a year ago by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, would be the second statewide ban, after California, which banned bags in 2016. Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.

New York’s ban, which would begin next March, would forbid stores to provide customers with single-use plastic bags, which are nonbiodegradable and have been blamed for everything from causing gruesome wildlife deaths to thwarting recycling efforts.

The ban, which is expected to be part of the state’s budget bills that are slated to be passed by Monday, would have a number of carveouts, including food takeout bags used by restaurants, bags used to wrap deli or meat counter products and bags for bulk items. Newspaper bags would also be exempted, as would garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags."
Ireland to outlaw sex with people who've fallen asleep drunk,http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/minister-to-outlaw-sex-with-people-whove-fallen-asleep-drunk-35392644.html,"A definition of 'sexual consent' to be approved by Government today will explicitly outlaw engaging in a sexual act with someone who has passed out from intoxication.

Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald will seek Cabinet backing today for the laws which seek to prevent people being ""taken advantage of"".

The legislation will also introduce extra protections for people with disabilities who may not be able to communicate their consent.

The Law Reform Commission was recommending that definition of consent be written into law as far back as the 1980s.

Sources told the Irish Independent that Mrs Fitzgerald's proposed definition will ""make it clear that a person who is incapable of consenting to a sexual act due to, for instance, being asleep or unconscious, as a result of intoxication"" cannot give consent.

Currently, Irish law states that rape occurs if a person has not consented to intercourse and/or if the perpetrator was reckless as to whether the victim did or did not consent.

However, the courts have had to create their own definitions of consent.

There will also be new and strengthened offences to tackle child pornography, along with new provisions to be introduced regarding evidence by victims, particularly children.

Another element of the Bill is to criminalise the purchase of sexual services. ""When enacted, the bill will bring Irish law into line with a number of international legal instruments,"" a source said.

"Los Angeles offers tattoo removal for inmates who regret a tattoo, or no longer wish to be associated with gangs and lifestyle to give them a wider employment opportunity when released from prison.",http://shq.lasdnews.net/pages/PageDetail.aspx?id=1432,"

Tattoo Removal Program Offers Inmates a Clean Slate







Supporting Inmate Accountability



Inmates in the custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department may participate in its Tattoo Removal Service, a joint program of the Inmate Services Bureau's Education Based Incarceration (EBI) unit, the Medical Services Bureau, and Homeboy Industries. Once considered permanent, tattoos are now removable through laser treatments. The highly successful Tattoo Removal Service uses that advanced technology, and benefits inmates who commit to bettering themselves while in custody so they can re-enter our communities truly with ""a clean slate.""



The Tattoo Removal Service incentivizes inmates to engage in structured academic, vocational, life-skills and other learning opportunities offered by EBI, as participation in those courses and activities makes them eligible for tattoo removal treatments.







Matching Inmate Motivations to Community Interests



Inmates regret having gotten tattoos for varying reasons. Some acquired their first tattoo as young as eleven years old, before they could make a wise decision. For others, a tattoo not done by a skilled professional has produced an unsightly or distorted image. And almost all inmates have experienced the negative social stigma attached to any tattoo--compounded when it's offensive or prominently displayed on the face, neck, or hands. An employer's no-tattoo policy, formal or not, limits released inmates' job and advancement opportunities. Finally, many tattoos are gang-related, and inmates may no longer wish to be associated with that lifestyle. No matter the reason, the Tattoo Removal Program gives these inmates a fresh start, and facilitates their re-integration into the community.







Program Process, History and Success



The tattoo removal process uses a medical-grade laser to produce a short pulse of intense light, which passes through the top layers of skin and is selectively absorbed by the tattoo pigment. This light breaks down the tattoo ink, which is then absorbed by the body, and the tattoo fades. Most patients need three to eight sessions, scheduled every eight weeks, to remove a tattoo completely. Many inmates start by getting one or two tattoos lasered to see the results; not uncommonly, they request treatment of other tattoos because removal is so successful If the removal process takes longer than the inmate's sentence, EBI coordinates with Homeboy Industries to complete the removal at no cost to the released inmate.



The Tattoo Removal Service began in February 2012 as a collaborative partnership between the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Medical Services Bureau, its Inmate Services Bureau, and Homeboy Industries. The service is overseen by trained medical personnel and a custody assistant. The program piloted with 25 volunteer inmates and has expanded greatly, as seen in yearly totals of treated inmates:







2012



Male 276



Female 260



Total 536







2013



Male 274



Female 274



Total 548







2014



Male 206



Female 184



Total 390



(Note: The tattoo clinic closed from early August to December 2014 to repair the laser machine.)







2015 (January 6 to September 15)



Male 421



Female 353



Total 774







A Priceless Benefit at No Private or Public Cost



At outside facilities, removal of a single tattoo ranges in price from $200 to $500 per session. If we recall that full removal may require five to twenty sessions, we see that removing one tattoo might run $10,000. The clinic currently owns four tattoo removal machines; the first cost approximately $100,000 while each subsequent machine cost $65,000. An allocation of $300,000 for the Service also covers additional expenses of overtime and security. Yet the Inmate Welfare Fund fully pays for all expenditures connected to the Tattoo Removal Service, incurring no additional outlay from the Sheriff's Department or the public. Recall also that if the removal process takes longer than an inmate's sentence, EBI and Homeboy Industries cooperate to finish the released inmate's treatment for absolutely no fee.







The Tattoo Removal Service gives inmates a visible change for the better and receives overwhelmingly positive feedback from participants. The tattoo clinic, along with EBI's academic, vocational and life-skills training, stands as one of the Department's most powerful means of helping inmates secure employment, gain community acceptance, and thus reduce their likelihood of recidivating.

Dad who went viral after dancing for sick toddler announces son is cancer free.,https://www.today.com/parents/dancing-dad-whose-video-went-viral-announces-son-cancer-free-t145510,"Nearly three million people have viewed a video of dad Kennith Thomas dancing for his toddler son, Kristian. But the New Jersey father says his dance moves were for an audience of one — a way to encourage Kristian as he was being treated for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL).

The support Thomas showed his young son paid off: In November, Thomas and his wife, Josilyne, received the news that Kristian, who was diagnosed with AMKL at just 14 months old, was cancer free.

Kennith Thomas' son, Kristian, was diagnosed with leukemia at 14 months old. Kennith Thomas

""It was the most glorifying thing you could ever feel,"" Thomas told TODAY Parents. ""When your 1 year old is going through a huge battle, as a parent you want to take their place — you don't want them to have to suffer.""

In Thomas' initial viral video, he dances for Kristian to Ciara song ""Level Up,"" while Kristian claps and smiles. (The Thomas' own a dance studio and Josilyne is also a photographer.) Thomas says the video, which was posted in July, was filmed after he learned they would finally be able to take Kristian home from the hospital after staying for more than 30 days for his first round of chemotherapy and treatment.

""He was going home that day,"" Thomas recalled. ""His levels were up and we were going home — it all fell into place, so I put the video out there and it just caught fire.""

During the months Kristian was undergoing treatment, Thomas' Instagram account grew from 5,000 followers to more than 70,000. Ciara herself took notice of the family's story and reached out to Josilyne Thomas about surprising Kennith and Kristian.

""Today I had one of the best times in life,"" the singer tweeted after her visit with the family at their dance studio. ""I got to meet the rock star Kristian... he's surrounded by an abundance of love.""

Ciara isn't the only celebrity who has shown support for Kristian during his treatment. Rapper Common shared Thomas' initial video on Twitter, calling it ""beautiful,"" and Christopher Reid of Kid 'N Play sent his congratulations when Thomas announced that Kristian's cancer was gone.

Thomas says all celebrity support aside, his family has loved connecting with other families who are facing a cancer diagnosis or other challenging situations.

Maryann Rolle, proprietor of the Exuma Point Bar and Grille, near the site of the disastrous Fyre Festival, said she dipped into her life's savings to pay workers who labored around the clock — even though she herself never saw a dime.

""I do catering on a large scale but I have never pushed myself to do a thousand meals a day. It was something new for me and it was challenging. I was being busy for them and not thinking of me and getting my money,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch.

The music event billed as a VIP experience featuring Blink-182 and other musical acts quickly devolved into a barbaric retreat whose ""luxury accommodations"" included unfinished tents and drenched mattresses. Organizer Billy McFarland, 27, is currently serving six years in prison for a fraud estimated to have stolen $27.4 million from investors. His partner, rapper Ja Rule, insists he, too, was ""hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hoodwinked, led astray.""

I too was hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!! — Ja Rule (@Ruleyork) January 20, 2019

Rolle said she catered approximately 1,000 meals a day in April 2017 and also hosted festival organizers at Exuma Point Resort, which she co-owns with her husband.

""I had ten persons working directly with me, just preparing food all day and all night, 24 hours,"" she said in the Netflix documentary, ""Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened.""

She describes the desperation of her current financial situation as a result on her fundraising page.

""As I make this plea it's hard to believe and embarrassing to admit that I was not paid...I was left in a big hole! My life was changed forever, and my credit was ruined by Fyre Fest,"" Rolle and her husband, Elvis, wrote. ""My only resource today is to appeal for help,"" they said. As of Monday more than 4,000 people had contributed a total surpassing $131,000 to the couple's campaign.

Rolle told CBS MoneyWatch she honored her contract in hopes that the company behind the failed festival would bring business to the island later down the line.

""I did it because I wanted the event to be a success. I knew if it was a success they would pay me well. They assured me they would pay me well,"" she said.

But she was duped. ""People would come down and say they were managers and they would wire transfer me the money. I gave them my information and the money was never transferred,"" she said.

"In a significant public health victory, Mexico has succeeded in eliminating a disease which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide.",http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexico-eliminates-disease-which-leading-cause-blindness-n750306,"In a significant public health victory, Mexico has succeeded in eliminating a disease which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Monday that Mexico is the first country in the Americas to eliminate trachoma as a public health issue. The disease, caused by a bacteria, affects the eye and repeated infections can lead to scarring and even loss of vision.

It primarily affects young children, and can be spread by personal contact or by flies that that have been in contact with the discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person.

""This is a historic moment for public health in Mexico and the Americas,"" said Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO regional office for the Americas. ""Eliminating a disease is not achieved every day.""

Trachoma primarily affects poor and isolated populations in 41 countries; in the Americas, the disease is still prevalent in Brazil, Guatemala, and Colombia.

Mexico has become the third country, after Oman and Morocco, to receive WHO validation for eliminating the disease.

In Mexico, trachoma affected over 146,000 people. The country ramped up its actions in 2004 with the creation of the Trachoma Prevention and Control Program of the Ministry of Health of Chiapas and the strengthening of the WHO SAFE strategy. The ""Trachoma Brigades"" focused on cleanliness, antibiotics, environmental improvement and surgery for the advanced stage of the disease.

The program’s slogan was “With water, soap and cleanliness you can prevent trachoma.” Teachers at schools would also meet with parents regularly to promote better hygiene.

The international criteria for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem includes prevalence of less than 5 percent in children aged 1 to 9, and less than one case of trachomatous trichiasis (inverted eyelashes) per 1,000 inhabitants.

US universities honor Saudi students who died trying to rescue kids,http://www.arabnews.com/node/1372306/saudi-arabia,"DiplomaticQuarter: EU envoy wants increased cooperation with Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition

RIYADH: Patrick Simonnet, head of the EU delegation to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman, recently visited the headquarters of the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC) in Riyadh.

IMCTC Secretary-General Maj. Gen. Mohammed bin Saeed Al-Moghedi received the EU diplomat and the accompanying delegation. Al-Moghedi briefed the visiting dignitaries about the coalition’s goals, achievements and the initiatives it has taken to fight terrorism in different forms.

He said the coalition represents an integrated system of intellectual and media initiatives and also aims to fight terror financing to effectively root out this menace. The IMCTC chief said the coalition aims to enhance cooperation and coordination among member states.

Simonnet said the EU looks forward to enhance cooperation with the Islamic military alliance in different fields.

Al-Moghedi also presented the EU ambassador with a memento.

The IMCTC is an alliance of 41 countries that forms a pan-Islamic unified front in the global fight against terrorism and violent extremism.

In coordination with the relevant authorities in the member countries, it promotes best practices, advances legal, regulatory, and operational frameworks, and facilitates information sharing to curb terror financing.

It also aims to assist member countries to enhance their military capabilities to fight terrorism.

The intellectual aspect specializes in preserving the universal message of Islam, promoting the values of moderation, tolerance and the preparation of targeted messages to counter radical ideology.

The media side is based on producing digital, media and other informative content to refute the rhetoric and claims of terrorist organizations and extremists."
"In the third quarter of 2019, the UK’s windfarms, solar panels, biomass and hydro plants generated more electricity than the combined output from power stations fired by coal, oil and gas, for the first time.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-renewables-generate-more-electricity-than-fossil-fuels-for-first-time,"In the third quarter of 2019, the UK’s windfarms, solar panels, biomass and hydro plants generated more electricity than the combined output from power stations fired by coal, oil and gas, Carbon Brief analysis reveals.

During the three months of July, August and September, renewables generated an estimated total of 29.5 terawatt hours (TWh), compared with just 29.1TWh from fossil fuels, the analysis shows.

This is the first-ever quarter where renewables outpaced fossil fuels since the UK’s first public electricity generating station opened in 1882. It is another symbolic milestone in the stunning transformation of the UK’s electricity system over the past decade.

Nevertheless, a lack of progress in other parts of the economy means the UK remains far off track against its upcoming legally-binding carbon targets, let alone the recently adopted goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Transformative decade

At the start of this decade in 2010, the 288TWh generated from fossil fuels accounted for around three-quarters of the UK total. It was also more than 10 times as much electricity as the 26TWh that came from renewables.

Since then, electricity generation from renewable sources has more than quadrupled – and demand has fallen – leaving fossil fuels with a shrinking share of the total.

This shift is shown in the chart below, with the declining quarterly output from power stations burning coal, oil and gas in blue and rising generation from renewables in red.

(The quarterly chart also reflects the seasons, with demand higher in winter and lower in summer. Windfarm output is well matched with this cycle, as it tends to be windier in winter.)

The chart above shows that electricity generation from fossil fuels has halved since 2010, from 288TWh down to 142TWh in the most recent 12-month period.

Gas now contributes the vast majority of that shrinking total, as coal plants close down ahead of a planned phaseout in 2025. These ageing power stations were mostly built in the 1960s and 70s and are increasingly uneconomic to run due to CO2 prices, market forces and pollution rules.

In the third quarter of 2019, some 39% of UK electricity generation was from coal, oil and gas, including 38% from gas and less than 1% from coal and oil combined.

Another 40% came from renewables, including 20% from wind, 12% from biomass and 6% from solar. Nuclear contributed most of the remainder, generating 19% of the total.

While it is unlikely that renewables will generate more electricity than fossil fuels during the full year of 2019, it is now a question of when – rather than if – this further milestone will be passed.

This summer, National Grid predicted that zero-carbon sources of electricity – wind, nuclear, solar and hydro, but not biomass – would generate more electricity than fossil fuels during 2019. Carbon Brief’s analysis through to the third quarter of the year is in line with this forecast.

New capacity

Over the past year, the most significant reason for rising renewable generation has been an increase in capacity as new offshore windfarms have opened. The 1,200 megawatt (MW) Hornsea One project was completed in October, becoming the world’s largest offshore windfarm. The 588MW Beatrice offshore windfarm was completed in Q2 of this year.

These schemes add to the more than 2,100MW of offshore capacity that started operating during 2018. Further capacity is already being built, including the 714MW East Anglia One project that started generating electricity this year and will be completed in 2020.

In total, government contracts for offshore wind will take capacity from nearly 8,500MW today to around 20,000MW by the mid-2020s. The government and industry are jointly aiming for at least 30,000MW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, with two further contract auctions already expected.

In September, the latest auction round produced record-low deals for offshore windfarms that will generate electricity more cheaply than expected market prices – and potentially below the cost of running existing gas plants.

Other contributors to the recent increase in renewable generation include the opening of the 420MW Lynemouth biomass plant in Northumberland last year and the addition of hundreds of megawatts of new onshore wind and solar farms. (Another new 299MW biomass plant being built on Teesside, with a scheduled opening in early 2020, is facing “major delays”.)

According to the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the rise in renewable output during the first half of 2019 was down to these increases in capacity, with weather conditions not unusual for the time of year.

Some two-thirds of electricity generated from biomass in the UK comes from “plant biomass”, primarily wood pellets burnt at Lynemouth and the Drax plant in Yorkshire. The remainder comes from an array of smaller sites based on landfill gas, sewage gas or anaerobic digestion.

The Committee on Climate Change says the UK should “move away” from large-scale biomass power plants, once existing subsidy contracts for Drax and Lynemouth expire in 2027.

Using biomass to generate electricity is not zero-carbon and in some circumstances could lead to higher emissions than from fossil fuels. Moreover, there are more valuable uses for the world’s limited supply of biomass feedstock, the CCC says, including carbon sequestration and hard-to-abate sectors with few alternatives.

In terms of fossil-fuel generating capacity, the UK’s remaining coal plants are rapidly closing down, well ahead of a 2025 deadline to phase out unabated burning of the fuel. By March 2020, just four coal plants will remain in the UK.

Utility firms have plans to build up to 30,000MW of new gas capacity – including 3,600MW at Drax recently given government planning approval – despite the fact that government projections suggest only around 6,000MW might be needed by 2035.

It is unlikely that all of the planned new gas capacity will get built. The schemes are generally reliant on winning contracts under the UK’s capacity market, which is designed to ensure electricity supply is always sufficient to meet demand.

The rise of renewables means that gas generation is likely to continue falling in the UK, whether or not this new capacity gets built. Nevertheless, the UK is unlikely to meet its legally binding goal of cutting overall emissions to net-zero by 2050, unless progress in the electricity sector is matched by reductions in other parts of the UK economy, such as heating and transport.

Consecutive months

Carbon Brief’s electricity-sector analysis shows that renewables are also estimated to have generated more electricity than fossil fuels during the individual months of August and September, the first time there have been two consecutive such months.

Previously, renewables beat fossil fuels in September 2018 – the first-ever whole month – and then again in March 2019. This means that there have only ever been four months where renewables outpaced fossil generation, of which three have been this year and two in the last two months.

This is shown in the chart, below, which also highlights the greater month-to-month variability in electricity generation and demand, which is overlaid on top of the broader seasonal cycles.

In the first three quarters of 2019, renewables outpaced fossil fuels on 103 of the 273 individual days, Carbon Brief analysis suggests. This is more than one-third of the days in the year so far and includes 40 of the 91 days in the third quarter of 2019.

(Although this is not a majority of days, the aggregate output during the quarter was higher for renewables. This is because their excess over fossil fuels was large on some days.)

As expected from the monthly aggregates in the chart, above, these days with higher renewable generation are concentrated in March and the third quarter of 2019, as shown in the chart, below.

The total of 103 days with higher renewable electricity generation than from fossil fuels in the first three quarters of the year is far in excess of the 67 such days by the same point in 2018.

This is shown in the chart, below, which also highlights the fact that there had never been any days with higher renewable generation until 2015.

There have already been nearly as many higher renewable days in the first three quarters of 2019, at 103, as there were in the whole of 2018, which saw 107 such days. There were only 58 such days in 2017, just 16 in 2016 and 12 in 2015. The first ever day when UK renewables generated more electricity than fossil fuels was 11 April 2015.

Methodology

The figures in the article are from Carbon Brief analysis of data from BEIS Energy Trends chapter 5 and chapter 6, as well as from BM Reports. The figures from BM Reports are for electricity supplied to the grid in Great Britain only and are adjusted to include Northern Ireland.

In Carbon Brief’s analysis, the BM Reports numbers are also adjusted to account for electricity used by power plants on site and for generation by plants not connected to the high-voltage national grid. This includes many onshore windfarms, as well as industrial gas combined heat and power plants and those burning landfill gas, waste or sewage gas.

By design, the Carbon Brief analysis is intended to align as closely as possible to the official government figures on electricity generated in the UK, reported in BEIS Energy Trends table 5.1. Briefly, the raw data for each fuel is adjusted with a multiplier, derived from the ratio between the reported BEIS numbers and unadjusted figures for previous quarters.

Carbon Brief’s method of analysis has been verified against published BEIS figures using “hindcasting”. This shows the estimates for total electricity generation from fossil fuels or renewables to have been within ±3% of the BEIS number in each quarter since Q4 2017. (Data before then is not sufficient to carry out the Carbon Brief analysis.)

For example, in the second quarter of 2019, a Carbon Brief hindcast estimates gas generation at 33.1TWh, whereas the published BEIS figure was 34.0TWh. Similarly, it produces an estimate of 27.4TWh for renewables, against a BEIS figure of 27.1TWh.

The Carbon Brief estimated totals for fossil fuels and renewables are very close in Q3 2019, coming within 0.5TWh of each other. This means that despite the relatively low level of uncertainty in the estimates, their relative position could be reversed in the official BEIS data.

This serves to emphasise the fact that the broader trend of decline for fossil fuels and an increase for renewables is of far greater significance than the precise figures for any individual quarter.

In contrast to Carbon Brief’s analysis, figures published by consultancy EnAppSys for the third quarter of 2019 suggest that fossil fuels generated slightly more electricity than renewables. There are several reasons for this difference.

First, the company’s analysis is for Great Britain only, whereas Carbon Brief’s covers the UK overall. Second, it reports on electricity “supplied” in the country, including imports, whereas Carbon Brief estimates the amount of electricity “generated” within the UK only.

Third, Carbon Brief’s analysis is, by design, aligned with the quarterly BEIS Energy Trends data for electricity generation, whereas EnAppSys uses its own approach.

For comparison, EnAppSys reported for the second quarter of 2019 that 28.3TWh was supplied in GB from gas, whereas BEIS reports that 34.0TWh was generated in the UK. Similarly EnAppSys reported 23.1TWh coming from renewables, against a BEIS figure of 27.1TWh."
We Reported on a Nonprofit Hospital System That Sues Poor Patients. It Just Freed Thousands From Debt.,https://www.propublica.org/article/we-reported-on-a-nonprofit-hospital-system-that-sues-poor-patients-it-just-freed-thousands-from-debt,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. This article was produced in partnership with MLK50, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The city’s largest nonprofit hospital system has erased the debts owed by more than 6,500 patients it sued for unpaid hospital bills, less than two months after announcing an overhaul of its debt collection processes.

The dramatic shift was prompted by an MLK50-ProPublica investigation that revealed that Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare filed more than 8,300 debt lawsuits from 2014 through 2018, including against its own employees. Methodist had doggedly pursued low-income defendants who had little ability to pay, often garnishing their meager paychecks.

The single-page “case satisfied” notices filed by Methodist are coming into the Shelby County General Sessions Court faster than staff can process them. A court administrator estimated a backlog of about 4,500 Methodist notices waiting to be entered into the court’s system.

From July 30 through Tuesday, the court had logged more than 2,300 notices submitted by the hospital system that wiped away patients’ debts. That’s more than nine times the number of notices filed by Methodist in the first six months of 2019.

For now, it appears that Methodist is no longer using the courts as a collection agency, a practice that was roundly criticized by health care experts, some elected officials and members of the United Methodist Church, with which Methodist is affiliated. Since July 3, the hospital has not filed any new debt collection lawsuits or garnishment attempts.

Methodist’s turnaround elated defendants and consumer advocates.

Among the defendants who no longer owe is Carrie Barrett, a part-time Kroger employee featured in one of the MLK50-ProPublica articles. Barrett’s case began in July 2007, when a two-night stay at Methodist Bonheur Healthcare, where doctors performed a heart catherization, left her with a $12,019 bill. In 2010, Methodist sued her for more than $16,000, one-third of which was attorney’s fees.

Over the years, thanks to interest and court costs, Barrett’s debt climbed to more than $33,000. If she paid $100 per month as ordered by the court, she would be 90 by the time she paid it off.

Barrett said she received a call nearly two weeks ago from an administrator who said the hospital had reviewed her records. “He said, ‘The balance is zero. ... I said, ‘You don’t know how good that sounds to my ears.’”

Jessica Curtis, a senior adviser at Community Catalyst, a national advocacy organization, has followed other nonprofit hospitals that have been the subject of similar media reports.

“I was trying to remember when have I seen such a rapid switch,” Curtis said. “I don’t know that I’ve seen that before. The scale of what they are attempting to rectify is really commendable from what we’ve seen thus far.”

Because the case satisfied notices do not include the amount owed, the total dollar amount of debt Methodist forgave could not immediately be quantified.

Methodist did not answer questions about how much debt it had forgiven or how many additional cases it has yet to review.

""We are implementing the policies and practices we announced in July, and we have reached out individually to patients who currently have legal proceedings to provide information related to their specific situation,"" a hospital spokesperson said in a statement sent Tuesday evening.

The hospital said formal letters to the patients were sent last week, and patients with questions should call the hospital's billing department at 901–842–1260. No date has been set to resume court collections.

Nonprofit hospitals are generally exempt from local, state and federal taxes. In return, the federal government expects them to provide a significant community benefit, including charity care and financial assistance.

Methodist, which operates five hospitals in Shelby County, does provide some charity care — but experts faulted it for its aggressive collections practices in a city where nearly 1 in 4 residents live below the poverty line.

Its handling of poor patients began with a financial assistance policy that, unlike many of its peers around the country, all but ignored patients with any form of health insurance, no matter their out-of-pocket costs. If they were unable to afford their bills, patients then faced what experts said is rare: A licensed collection agency owned by the hospital.

Lawsuits followed. Finally, after the hospital won a judgment, it would repeatedly try to garnish patients’ wages, which it did in a far higher share of cases than other nonprofit hospitals in Memphis.

Methodist repeatedly refused to make its executives available for interviews, but it sent statements defending itself, noting how it is the only health care system that has hospitals in all four quadrants of Shelby County and that it provided more than $226 million in community benefit. It did not address why its financial assistance policy was less generous than those of its peers or why it garnished wages in a higher percentage of cases than other hospitals.

But on June 30, three days after the MLK50-ProPublica investigation was published, Methodist CEO Michael Ugwueke said in a column published in The Commercial Appeal that the hospital would spend the next 30 days reviewing its collections and financial assistance policies.

Days later, Methodist announced it would suspend court collection activities over unpaid hospital bills. In the weeks that followed, the hospital’s attorney, R. Alan Pritchard, dropped dozens of suits that had been on the court docket.

On July 30, the hospital announced wide-reaching reforms. “We were humbled to learn that while there’s so much good happening across our health system each day, we can and must do more,” Ugwueke said in a media conference call.

Under the new policy, financial assistance will be provided to patients earning up to 250% of the federal poverty line, or $53,325 for a family of three. The previous policy applied to uninsured patients with incomes up to 125% of the federal poverty line. Methodist said more than half of the population of greater Memphis would be eligible for assistance under the new policy.

The hospital also said it would no longer accept court-ordered interest on medical debt nor would it seek to collect attorney’s fees or court costs from patients.

And it said it would raise its minimum wage to $13.50 an hour by mid-September and to $15 an hour by January 2021. The lowest-paid employees made $10 an hour and about 18% of workers earned less than $15 an hour, the hospital reported in response to MLK50’s 2018 Living Wage Survey.

The pay increase signaled that Methodist took the issue seriously, Curtis said. “The inclusion of wages means someone has realized not just the symptom of the problem but the core root of the problem. This is a clearly promising start,” she said.

It’s unclear whether Methodist will resume suing patients for unpaid bills. And the hospital has not said how many additional “case satisfied notices” it could file. Plaintiffs cannot refile lawsuits after the case has been marked satisfied.

One of the defendants featured in the investigation was a Methodist housekeeper, who asked that her name not be used for fear that the hospital would fire her for talking to a reporter.

In 2017, Methodist sued her for the cost of hospital stays to treat chronic abdominal pain she experienced before the hospital hired her. She owed about $23,000, including around $5,800 in attorney’s fees.

In January, a General Sessions Court judge ordered her to pay $75 biweekly. The housekeeper paid reliably until this summer, when she missed several days of work because she was sick, eventually ending up in the hospital. That left her paycheck short.

She received a small annual raise in August, and another to $13.50 less than two weeks ago

Last week, a reporter showed the housekeeper a copy of her case satisfied notice.

“God is a good God,” she said, laughing and smiling. “I’ve been calling them and they tell me nothing. … This is a blessing right here.”

Barrett, the Kroger employee featured in the first MLK50-ProPublica story, likewise praised God. At church this month, Barrett had an update for the congregation, which had heard her speak about her financial troubles before.

“I have a zero balance,” she said. “I just want to thank God for blessings that he has brought to me. … I thank him for the victory!” she shouted, as others joined her in praise.

“Victory is ours, amen!” a minister said from the pulpit. “Don’t y’all know that Jesus will drop those charges? Glory to God!”

99 out of 100 people expressed gratitude when a door was held open for them in a social experiment,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-gratitude-at-work-facebook-video-1.3729458,"If you held the door open for 100 people in Halifax and Dartmouth, how many of them do you think would say thank you?

That's what Halifax-based company Gratitude at work wanted to find out. One day, a little more than a week ago, they recorded a video. Ninety-nine out of 100 people said thank you when someone held the door for them.

""I didn't think we were going to get 99. I don't know why, but I was pleasantly surprised ... it went beyond just thank you's. People got into conversations with us,"" said Steve Foran, CEO of Gratitude at work.

The video was posted to Facebook and YouTube.

Foran's company gets hired by other businesses and organizations to create better work environments through gratitude. The idea is appreciated employees are more productive. Foran wanted to take that idea to the streets.

""What we know from research is that from grateful people come good things,"" he said. ""A simple way to induce gratitude in people is opening doors and so we went to six places and opened the doors for people.""

1 day, 3 hours, 6 locations

For the experiment, Foran's team went to Halifax Shopping Centre, Mic Mac Mall, an office building on Barrington Street, an office building on Alderney Drive, the Two if By Sea coffee shop in Dartmouth and the Tim Hortons by the Halifax ferry terminal. The door was held for 15 to 20 people at a time at each location.

The video has been a huge success on Facebook. It was uploaded on Thursday and as of 3:10 p.m. Saturday, it had been shared 1,301 times and viewed more than 74,000 times.

""We did have one that didn't say thank you. We're not here to judge them because on any given day, that could be me [or] it could be you ... I suspect of the 100 people, there were probably a bunch of them having a bad day, but grateful people make people grateful,"" said Foran.

Foran said his team plans to release another video next month."
"Cities cannot fine homeless people for living outside, U.S. judge rules in Grants Pass case",https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/08/cities-cannot-fine-homeless-people-for-living-outside-us-judge-rules-in-grants-pass-case.html,"Grants Pass has joined Boise in eliciting a precedent-setting court ruling that could alter how cities nationwide cite and fine people living outside.

A federal judge decided on July 22 that the Southern Oregon city of 37,500 violated its homeless residents’ Eighth Amendment rights by excluding them from parks without due process and citing them for sleeping outside. The ruling builds on 2018′s landmark Martin v. City of Boise case that said cities cannot make it illegal to sleep or rest outside without providing people with sufficient indoor alternatives.

Grants Pass City Attorney Mark Bartholomew said the city plans to appeal the decision.

Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the Martin case, forcing cities around the country to rethink how their policies and law enforcement officials deal with growing homeless populations.

In Grants Pass, homeless people have been showing up for years to the Oregon Law Center office with complaints that their ability to rest was made impossible by local ordinances.

Debra Blake was one of them. She lost her job and then her housing about 10 years ago and has been homeless in Grants Pass since. At 7:30 a.m. Sept. 11, 2019, Blake was lying in her sleeping bag in Riverside Park when she was cited for illegal camping and prohibited conduct. Later that morning, the same officer gave her a ticket for criminal trespass on city property.

Blake wasn’t arrested, but the two tickets still came with fines that reached $885. She was also excluded from the parks.

She appealed and two weeks later won, but she received no explanation why.

Blake owes Grants Pass $5,000 in stacked up fines and fees related to being homeless.

She is one of several people who joined the case, many with similar debts.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke wrote a stinging rebuke of the way Grants Pass fines people living outside.

“Let us not forget that homeless individuals are citizens just as much as those fortunate enough to have a secure living space,” he said.

Clarke’s opinion will likely have ramifications far beyond Grants Pass.

Many cities and counties were shaken by the Boise example, which has been widely interpreted as saying that it is unconstitutional to arrest people for what are called “sit-lie laws” -- resting and sleeping in public -- if the jurisdiction does not provide adequate shelter or affordable housing.

Clarke’s ruling extends that prohibition to the fines and fees that make being homeless difficult.

Many places have ordinances similar to Grants Pass’s with fees for living outside.

Clarke pointed out in his opinion that such citations often require a court appearance, which homeless people often either don’t know about because they don’t have an address to receive mail from the court, or do not have the means or will to show up for.

That results in failure to appear warrants that end in arrest the next time the person comes into contact with law enforcement -- an inevitability for many homeless people.

“Quality of life laws, even civil citations, contribute to a cycle of incarceration and recidivism,” Clarke wrote.

His ruling also left the door open for more court challenges to cities’ treatment of unhoused individuals.

The Boise case was based in part on the Eighth Amendment -- that arresting homeless people for simply being homeless is cruel and unusual punishment.

But Clarke went farther in the Grants Pass case, saying that the city’s policies amount to excessive fines for doing something that all humans must do -- sleeping, staying dry, staying warm, sitting down -- only applied to a small group of humans.

“Those activities are just unavoidable and tied up in the status of being unhoused,” said Ed Johnson, head of the Oregon Law Center.

Johnson said that the decision still leaves room for cities and counties to regulate how and where people camp.

“I hope what cities take from it they have a wide range of tools at their disposal, but the tools are not punishing people in their community who have no choice but to be living outside,” Johnson said.

The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty joined the Oregon Law Center in taking Grants Pass to court. Tristia Bauman, senior attorney, said she hopes the Boise and Grants Pass cases push cities to rethink how they invest in homelessness now that both criminal and civil punishments can be unconstitutional, if broadly applied.

“The nature of the punishment is somewhat inconsequential,” Bauman said. “At the time of enforcement, the message is the same: You are engaged in some kind of law violation because you are living in public because you have no option but to do so.”

Grants Pass created its system of fines as part of a strategy to make it difficult to be homeless there. According to court documents, top city officials hoped that the stringent rules would encourage people to leave the city, even if they grew up there.

About 70% to 80% of homeless people in Grants Pass are from the area, according to court documents.

However, Clarke said that a jurisdiction doesn’t have to intentionally dissuade homeless people from staying there to violate the Eighth Amendment.

“Arresting the homeless is almost never an adequate solution because, apart from the constitutional impediments, it is expensive, not rehabilitating, often a waste of limited public resources , and does nothing to serve those homeless individuals who suffer from mental illness and substance abuse addiction,” Clarke said.

"Endangered mountain gorilla population recovers to over 1,000",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-endangered-gorillas/endangered-mountain-gorilla-population-recovers-to-over-1000-idUSKCN1IX4NG,"GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - The population of mountain gorillas, one of the world’s most endangered species, which survives on the forest-cloaked volcanoes of central Africa, has increased by a quarter to over 1,000 individuals since 2010, wildlife authorities said.

That is despite the threat posed by poachers and armed groups in the Virunga Massif, a spine of volcanic mountains in the western Rift Valley straddling eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda, where most of them reside.

The latest census put them at 1,004 individuals: 604 in Virunga, and 400 in Uganda’s nearby Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Joel Wenga Malembe, spokesman for the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature, told Reuters.

The last survey, in 2010, found just 786 of this critically endangered eastern gorilla sub-species, of which 480 were in Virunga.

“These numbers are truly remarkable, far exceeding our expectations, and are the result of a collaborative, three-country effort with governments and partners all playing an important role,” Mike Cranfield, of charity Gorilla Doctors, said in a statement.

Partly because they are so rare, the mountain gorillas are a major source of tourist revenue for the three nations, and their habitat supports other rare species found nowhere else such as golden monkeys.

But they are under constant threat of encroachment by farmers in one of Africa’s most densely populated rural regions, and hunting for bush meat or bizarre trophies sold abroad.

Congo has also invited oil companies to start drilling in Virunga, Africa’s largest tropical rainforest reserve, which conservationists worry will put the environment in greater danger.

Adding to Virunga’s woes, rangers banned tourists this month from entering the park during investigations into the kidnapping of two Britons by an armed militia."

Utah Legalizes Lemonade Stands and Other Businesses Run by Kids,http://ij.org/utah-legalizes-lemonade-stands-businesses-run-kids/,"Kids in Utah will no longer have to worry about the police shutting down their lemonade stands. Under a new state law (SB 81) that passed with overwhelming, bipartisan support, cities and counties cannot require a license or permit for any occasional business operated by a minor.

Lawmakers shouldn’t even have to enact this type of Ron Swanson-style common sense, and yet licensing laws have stymied kid entrepreneurs all across the country. Police in Overton, Texas once stopped Zoey and Andria Green (aged seven and eight) from selling lemonade, because the two girls didn’t have the proper permits. Eleven-year-old Madison Root couldn’t sell mistletoe at a holiday market in Portland, Oregon without a permit, though begging for money would have been allowed.

In New Jersey, Matt Molinari and Eric Schnepf went door to door, offering to shovel snow ahead of an incoming snowstorm. But police soon barred the two teens because they lacked a solicitation permit, which can cost $450 in some boroughs. Their story later inspired lawmakers to scrap the ban.

But in Utah, the ban on local licenses will shield young entrepreneurs from government crackdowns. SB 81 follows an earlier measure passed in Salt Lake County, the state’s most populous county. Four years prior, the county council approved a business ordinance that specifically singled out “lemonade stands and similar operations run by children” from needing a government permission slip. Thanks to SB 81, that type of exemption now applies throughout the entire state.

SB 81 also provides some regulatory relief for adults. The new law bans local licenses and excessive fees for home-based businesses that are operated occasionally in Utah. According to the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Jacob Anderegg, many local licensing fees create a “perverse incentive to raise money” for the government. A fiscal note for the bill estimates that the reform will save home-based businesses over $720,000 each year.

Still, many stringent licensing laws remain in force. A 2012 report by the Institute for Justice found that the Beehive State is the “12th most extensively and onerously licensed state.”"

Australia to plant 1 billion trees to help meet climate targets,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/australia-to-plant-1-billion-trees-to-help-meet-climate-targets,"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia aims to plant a billion trees by 2050 as part of a new forestry plan the government says will help the country meet its Paris Agreement climate targets.

A sod-turning spree on that scale would contribute to the removal of 18 million tonnes of greenhouse gas per year by 2030 in a country currently producing in excess of 500 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year.

The Regional Forestry Hubs plan would also support jobs in a sector that contributes more than A$23 billion (S$22.3 billion) to the national economy, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a media statement.

Australia has the seventh-largest forested area in the world covering 17 per cent of its land area, according to the government's 2018 State of the Forests report.

Morrison has said Australia will comfortably meet its Paris-agreed goal to reduce carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030, but has no specific policies in place to get there.

An OECD report last month said the country would miss the target unless it intensified its efforts to combat climate change.

The importance of coal to the Australian economy is an obstacle to serious efforts to lower carbon emissions, environmentalists say. The country still gets around two-thirds of its power from the fuel, which is also its biggest export earner."

World's biggest fund manager threatens to oust company directors who ignore climate change,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/climate-change-blackrock-manager-threatens-directors-ignore-global-warming-a7631266.html,"The world’s biggest fund manager has threatened to vote out directors of companies that fail to address the risks posed to their businesses by climate change.

In a post on its website, BlackRock, which controls assets worth $5.1 trillion (about £4.2 trillion), said climate risk was a “systemic issue”.

It said it planned to engage with the companies that are “most exposed to climate risk” over this year to help them tell investors – like BlackRock -- about the financial impacts of global warming and the shift to a low-carbon economy.

In an associated briefing note, BlackRock made clear how serious it was about the issue, pointing to a letter written to businesses by its chief executive Larry Fink which had said “while we are patient investors, we are not infinitely patient”.

“Climate risk will be one of the key engagement themes that the Investment Stewardship team will prioritize in 2017 and the team’s recent work on this issue … will inform our assessment of shareholder proposals on the topic,” the briefing note said.

“Over the course of 2017 we intend to engage companies most exposed to climate risk to understand their views on [reporting their climate risks].

“For directors of companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate risk, the expectation will be for the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business and management’s approach to adapting and mitigating the risk.”

​BlackRock said it would vote in favour of proposals on climate risk that “clearly address a gap” which would otherwise lead to “material economic disadvantage to the company and its shareholders”.

And, if this was not enough, it promised to use its power to get rid of directors who were part of the problem.

“Ultimately the board is responsible for protecting the long-term economic interests of shareholders and we may vote against the re-election of certain directors where we believe they have not fulfilled that duty, particularly in markets where shareholder proposals are not common,” BlackRock said.

He highlighted Mr Fink’s comment that BlackRock was not “infinitely patient”.

“I’m picturing James Earl Jones as Darth Vader saying that,” Mr Jaffe said. “I wonder what energy executives are hearing.”

"Logan Boulet of the Humboldt Broncos helped save six lives through donated organs this weekend, and inspired thousands of Canadians to become organ donors. Organ donor registration this weekend 6x higher than normal in British Columbia, 3x in Ontario, 2x in Alberta.",http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/relative-of-kidney-recipient-praises-humboldt-broncos-player-logan-boulet-a-hero/amp?__twitter_impression=true,"Many social media users say the donation of Humboldt Broncos player Logan Boulet’s organs has not only potentially saved lives, but inspired them to have the conversation with loved ones and become donors themselves.

And one Twitter user called Boulet a hero, noting one of his kidneys went to her aunt.

Distroscale

“This man is a hero in our family,” posted Brittany B. “Thank you to Logan Boulet and his family for the gift of organ donation. He is my aunties (sic) angel. Last night she had a successful kidney transplant. So much gratitude.”

Boulet, a 21-year-old defenceman from Lethbridge, was among the 15 people killed in a horrific crash involving the junior hockey team in Saskatchewan. Fourteen others were injured when the team’s bus and a transport truck collided Friday in a tragedy that has reverberated around the world.

Boulet’s cousin Julie Kindt said on Facebook that Boulet had been on life support until his organs could be donated.

His godfather posted a statement on behalf of the family saying a surgical team from Alberta travelled to a Saskatoon hospital to conduct organ transplant procedures early Sunday morning. Neil Langevin said six people were set to receive the “gift of life” from Boulet, and his other organs would be donated to science.

“Logan had made it known, and very clear to his family, that he had signed his organ donor card when he turned 21 just a few weeks ago,” Langevin said in a Facebook post that had been shared more than 1,700 times as of Monday morning. “These actions alone give voice to the selfless and benevolent nature Logan possessed in life for others.”

About 4,600 people across Canada are on a waiting list for a life-saving organ transplant, according to Joyce Van Deurzen, executive director of the Kidney Foundation of Canada’s Saskatchewan and southern Alberta branches.

“There’s no doubt that the need is far greater than the number of organs available for transplant, so every donor, every organ is so precious,” Van Deurzen said. “This young man has saved the lives of many people so hopefully his family can take some measure of comfort in that. They really are granting his last wish by deciding to donate his organs in agreement with his wishes.”

Since the weekend, there’s been a “significant increase” in the number of people who have registered to become organ or tissue donors in the province, according to a spokesman for Alberta Health Minister Sarah Hoffman.

Close to 900 people registered on Sunday and Monday, compared to an average of 425 registrations that typically occur on a typical Sunday/Monday registration period.

A total of 462,861 people are currently registered across the province. The government said in a statement that each donor can potentially save up to eight lives through organ donation, or help as many as 75 people through tissue donation.

More than 3,000 lives in Alberta have been saved through organ donation in the past decade, it stated. Since the province launched the Alberta Organ and Tissue Donation Registry in 2014, about 10 per cent of Albertans have registered to become organ and tissue donors.

Boulet’s final act of generosity has been met with an outpouring of support on social media.

“Never thought a junior hockey player in Saskatchewan named Logan Boulet would motivate me to finally become an organ donor,” Jeff Vallance, of southern Alberta, posted on Twitter. “He saved 6 lives. Took 4 minutes. You can do it as well.”

Ontario’s organ donation agency says it saw online registrations nearly triple Sunday compared to two weeks prior.

A Tallahassee judge ruled Wednesday that a Tampa cancer patient can legally grow his own marijuana.The Tampa Bay Times reports that strip club owner Joe Redner will be allowed to grow and harvest cannabis ""for the purpose of his emulsifying the biomass he needs for the juicing protocol recommended by his physician."" The ruling only applies to Redner, a 77-year-old vegan with stage 4 lung cancer – no other medical marijuana patients would qualify under this order.Redner sued the Florida Department of Health after the agency said that under state law, registered medical marijuana patients were not allowed to grow their own cannabis.""Florida law only allows the licensed dispensing organizations to grow, process and dispense marijuana,"" the health department states on its website . ""The department will refer any business or individual suspected of violating state law to local law enforcement for investigation.""But Redner argued he was entitled to grow his own medical marijuana because he needs the raw plant for the treatment his state-certified doctor has prescribed him. Medical cannabis dispensaries across the state do not provide this product. Leon County Circuit Judge Karen Gievers said the state Health Department's Office of Medical Marijuana Use was being ""non-compliant"" with the requirements set by voters who approved Amendment 2 for expanded medical marijuana use in Florida.""The Court finds that Florida's Constitution provides Mr. Redner's right to grow his own medical marijuana so he can follow his physician's recommendation,"" Gievers wrote in her ruling . ""Until and unless the [Florida Department of Health] stops violating its Constitutional duty and adopts the mandated presumptive regulation, the evidence clearly demonstrates that Mr. Redner is entitled to follow the recommendations of his certified physician.""The Times reports Florida Department of Health will probably appeal the judge's ruling, which could block Redner from immediately growing medical cannabis."

Nana Chaichanhda said that her pit bull, Sasha, kept barking and even threw her weight onto the back door to alert Chaichanhda to the fact that the house was on fire.

Chaichanhda said she went outside to see why Sasha was making so much noise, then saw that the fourplex her and some of her family members live in was on fire.

Chaichanhda said she rushed inside to get her 7-month-old daughter when she saw the dog had the baby by the diaper and was trying to drag the child to safety. Chaichanhda picked up her daughter, grabbed the dog and escaped the home.

""It meant a lot. I owe her everything. If it wasn’t for her, I would have still been in bed and things could have taken a worse turn,"" Chaichanhda told FOX40.

Chaichanhda said it was one of the few times she left Sasha outside overnight and that it was likely the reason everyone survived.

According to to FOX40, the part of the fourplex where she and her cousin lives is now uninhabitable."

OTTAWA , June 10, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canada has passed legislation that bans keeping whales, dolphins and porpoises in captivity for entertainment, as well as the trade, possession, capture and breeding of cetaceans. Today, the House of Commons voted overwhelmingly in favour of Bill S-203, the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act.

Bill S-203 was introduced by Senator Wilfred Moore in 2015, and then sponsored by Senator Murray Sinclair. Upon passage through the Senate, it was championed by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May in the House of Commons.

Rebecca Aldworth, Executive Director of HSI/Canada stated: “The passage of Bill S-203 is a watershed moment in the protection of marine animals and a victory for all Canadians. Whales and dolphins don’t belong in tanks, and the inherent suffering these highly social and intelligent animals endure in intensive confinement can no longer be tolerated. We congratulate the sponsors of this bill and the Canadian government for showing strong leadership in responding to public will and sound science on this critical issue.”

Green Party Leader and Saanich – Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May stated, ""Canadians have been clear, they want the cruel practice of keeping whales and dolphins in captivity to end. With the passage of Bill S-203, we have ensured that this will happen.""

Bill sponsor Senator Wilfred Moore said, ""We have a moral obligation to phase out the capture and retention of animals for profit and entertainment. Canadians are calling upon us to do better – and we have listened.”

Leading marine scientist Hal Whitehead added, “The living conditions for captive marine mammals cannot compare to their natural ocean environments in size, nor in quality. We thank the federal government and all those involved in the passage of Bill S-203, so that our laws can finally align with the Canadian peoples’ values and end this cruel practice.”

HSI is at the forefront of a global movement to end the captivity of cetaceans for entertainment. HSI/Canada has been a central part of a broad coalition of key stakeholders, including organizations, scientists and parliamentarians, working to ensure the passage of Bill S-203.

Facts:

A coalition of over 20 leading marine scientists and stakeholder organizations have endorsed Bill S-203. Bill S-203 was supported by Humane Society International/Canada, Animal Justice, Humane Canada, marine scientists Dr. Lori Marino and Dr. Naomi Rose of the Whale Sanctuary Project, Ontario Captive Animal Watch, Phil Demers, the former head trainer at Marineland, World Animal Protection, Dr. David Suzuki, the Jane Goodall Institute, and more.

Bill S-203 phases out the captivity of cetaceans (i.e. whales, dolphins and porpoises) in Canada, except for rescues, rehabilitation, licensed scientiﬁc research, or cetaceans’ best interests.

Leading marine scientists agree that whales and dolphins suffer great psychological and physical harms in captivity, including isolation, chronic health problems, abnormal behaviour, high infant mortality and extreme boredom.

Currently, only two facilities in the country house cetaceans – the Vancouver Aquarium, and Marineland in Niagara Falls. Now, these facilities will no longer be able to breed or import any new cetaceans into their facilities.

We thank the key Parliamentarians and staffers who championed and sponsored this legislation: MP Elizabeth May, Senator Wilfred Moore, Senator Murray Sinclair, MP Fin Donnelly, MP Gord Johns, Senator Peter Harder, Senator Dan Christmas, MP Nathan Cullen, MP Sean Casey, MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, MP Mario Beaulieu, MP Monique Pauzé, MP Nick Whalen, MP Will Amos, Senator Elizabeth Hubley, Senator Janis Johnson, Senator Mary Jane McCallum, Steve Parkinson, Martin McKendry, Archie Campbell, and many more.

The Michigan man, named only as Bob, was alone when he left his farmhouse on New Year’s Eve to collect firewood.

Anticipating a journey of only several metres, Bob was wearing just long johns, a shirt and slippers when he went outside, despite the temperature being around -4C.

However, he slipped and broke his neck.

“I was screaming for help but my nearest neighbour is about a quarter mile away and it was 10.30 pm, but my Kelsey came,” said Bob.

Kelsey is Bob’s five-year-old Golden Retriever. She kept Bob warm by lying on top of top of him, and kept him awake by licking his hands and face.

Bob said: “She kept barking for help but never left my side. She kept me warm and alert. I knew I had to persevere through this and that it was my choice to stay alive.

“By morning my voice was gone and I couldn’t yell for help, but Kelsey didn’t stop barking.

“She was letting out this screeching howl that alerted my neighbour. He found me at 6:30 p.m. on New Year’s Day.”

Bob’s neighbour eventually discovered him after hearing Kelsey’s howls and called the emergency services. When Bob arrived in hospital, his core temperature was below 21C. Normal body temperature is 37C and hypothermia occurs when the body drops below 35C.

And to the surprise of doctors, Bob made a quick initial recovery from his neck injury.

“After the surgery, miraculously, he started to move his extremities with greater strength,” said Chaim Colen, MD, Neurosurgeon at McLaren Northern Michigan Hospital.

“Most people with spinal cord injuries, they don’t move,” Dr Colen told Petoskey News. “It’s tragic and when it’s done, it’s done. I don’t know if it was the cold temperatures that may have helped him or the fact he was laying down on the snow the way he was.”

He added: “I think animals can help and his dog really kept him alive and really helped him, he was very fortunate.”

The workers from the El Bolillo Bakery in Houston, Texas, used up nearly 2,000kg of flour to bake bread and pan dulce, Mexican sweet bread, throughout the night and day after they were left stranded by the floods over the weekend.

The four bakers had been working on a late shift when they realised they could not leave the shop because of the level of water on the streets.

Three of the four bakers who were trapped inside the El Bolillo Bakery for two days because of the floods in Houston and made hundreds of loaves for flood victims.

To take their minds off worrying about their family and friends, they decided to continue to bake for those affected by the devastating downpours.

The Mexican bakery, which specialises in Mexican cakes and patisseries, had remained dry and had not been cut off from electricity so the bakers were able to work throughout the night and the following day.

Brian Alvarado, the manager of the shop on South Wayside Drive, told The Independent: ""When they realised they were stuck, they decided to keep themselves busy and help the community and made as many loaves of bread as they could.

""By the time the owner managed to get to them, they had made so much bread that we took the loaves to loads of emergency centres across the city for people affected by the floods.

""We didn't count exactly how many loaves they made, but they used 4,400 pounds [1,996kg] of flour.""

"When your dog's day is over it dreams of you, says Harvard psychologist",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/dog-dreaming-about-you-owners-psychologist-harvard-a7373571.html,"Dogs probably dream about their owners while they sleep, an expert has said.

Dr Deirdre Barrett, a Clinical and Evolutionary Psychologist at Harvard Medical School, has spent years studying sleep behaviour in humans.

Extrapolating from her work with people, she said it is likely dogs dream about their everyday experiences, just like humans.

This collar shows if your dog is sad

“Humans dream about the same things they’re interested in by day, though more visually and less logically,” Dr Barrett told People.

“There’s no reason to think animals are any different. Since dogs are generally extremely attached to their human owners, it’s likely your dog is dreaming of your face, your smell and of pleasing or annoying you.”

She cautioned there is no way to know for sure what dogs see when they dream, or even if they dream at all, but said most mammals have a similar sleep cycle to humans, going into a deep sleep stage, in which the brain is much less active, and then into periods of activity called Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, in which dreams occur for humans. ""That certainly makes it the best guess that other mammals are dreaming, too,"" she said.

The dogs from Instagram Show all 6 1 /6 The dogs from Instagram The dogs from Instagram Noodle the Dachshund is just over a year old and comes with her own hashtag (#OodlesOfNoodle) The dogs from Instagram Three-year-old Staffie Ramsey was malnourished when he was adopted as a puppy but is now big and boisterous with ripped muscles and a cheeky grin The dogs from Instagram Winny the Welsh Corgi has been credited with the breed's upsurge in popularity The dogs from Instagram Bruno the miniature Dachshund has 66,700 followers The dogs from Instagram Mika the Husky has 58,900 followers The dogs from Instagram Elle the French Bulldog has 8,868 followers

But while dogs dote on their human companions, cats maintain their waking aloofness when they sleep.

“We actually know more about cats dreams, because one of the earliest sleep researchers, Michel Jouvet, destroyed the tiny area in cat brains that inhibits movements during REM sleep,"" Dr Barrett said. ""Cats lay quietly through the other stages of sleep, and when REM began, they leapt up, stalked, pounced, arched their backs and hissed. They looked like they were hunting mice in their dreams.”

Cats are better than dogs

Dr Barrett confirmed that dogs too are probably acting out their dreams when their legs move in running motion in their sleep.

The psychologist also offered advice to pet owners who want to make sure their animals have good dreams."
"Metallica Donate $100,000 to California Wildfire Relief Efforts",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/metallica-donate-california-wildfire-relief-efforts-757813/,"Metallica announced Friday that the band, through their All Within My Hands foundation, had donated $100,000 toward wildfire relief efforts in California. The heavy metal legends also encouraged fans to “support those in need and first responders.”

“Sadly once again communities in California are experiencing historically devastating wild fires in both the Northern and Southern parts of the state,” Metallica’s foundation wrote in a statement Friday.

“All Within My Hands has made a $50,000 donation each to the North Valley Community Foundation and the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation; both agencies provide service to victims at evacuation centers and other much needed relief.”

Metallica continued, “We would like to encourage you to join us in supporting those in need and our first responders in any way you can by donating money, non-perishable food, clothing and other supplies or by giving your time volunteering or providing temporary housing. Every little bit helps.”

The rash of wildfires in northern and southern California have so far killed at least 63 people and scorched hundreds of thousands of acres of land. According to CNN, over 600 people are still missing in the aftermath of the still-burning blazes. The Camp Fire in northern California is the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.

Additionally, Metallica shared a video of their live, acoustic performance of “All Within My Hands” from their recent All Within My Hands Foundation Helping Hands benefit concert at San Francisco’s The Masonic on November 3rd. The event, which raised $1.3 million for the foundation, featured a 12-song, all-acoustic set by Metallica; the band is now offering that entire special set as a digital download, with new proceeds donated directly to the All Within My Hands foundation."
Police chief offers opioid addicts help without fear of arrest,http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/23/health/north-carolina-police-help-opioid-addicts/index.html,"Nashville, North Carolina (CNN) He's only 24 years old, but he struggled with addiction for more than a decade. Thomas Spikes now owes his sobriety to none other than the chief of police in this small eastern North Carolina town.

""He saved my life for sure,"" he said. ""I owe a lot to him and the program.""

Thomas Spikes credits the police with saving his life and putting him on the road to recovery from his opioid addiction.

That program, called the HOPE initiative, is a collaboration between Nashville's town manager, Hank Raper, and Chief Thomas Bashore. As deaths from opioids continue to dramatically rise across America, topping the list for unintentional deaths at a higher rate than car accidents, North Carolina saw more than a 340% increase from 2010 to 2016.

""There's no clear characteristic of what a heroin or opioid addiction looks like. It's not a white problem, it's not a black problem, it's not a Hispanic problem, middle class, working class, upper class. It affects all peoples of all walks of life,"" Raper said.

So, the conversation began on how this small town of 5,400, where everyone knows their neighbors, could get ahead of the problem. The HOPE initiative, modeled after the innovative ""Angel"" program in Gloucester, Massachusetts , which opens the way for addicts to get police assistance and medical help without fear of arrest, is a way of rethinking law enforcement's role in responding to this growing epidemic.

""They walk into the front door, if they have drugs or paraphernalia on them at any time, they can turn it in to us at that time, and have no charges filed. And we facilitate them into recovery,"" Bashore said.

Drugs, but no arrest

So far the department has seen paraphernalia, syringes, cookers, pipes and injection ""rigs"" turned in. ""We have actually had individuals who have brought in heroin bags and turned that over because they knew that they were going to get into recovery and they didn't want that around when they got out,"" Bashore said.

Possession of heroin in North Carolina is a felony charge and having paraphernalia is a misdemeanor. Bashore and Raper met with the county's district attorney to ensure he was on board with not charging people. He was in full support.

HOPE, which is not an acronym but the town's offer of help in capital letters, kicked off on February 9, 2016. Eight days into the program, the first addict came into the police department.

""It was eye-opening, recalled Bashore. ""That individual came in and we spent the better part of 7½ hours getting him processed. Only then did I leave the hospital and come back to the police department to start calling facilities to start having him placed, after he left detox. You can spend hours on the phone, calling facilities, saying, ""Do you have a bed?""

Chief escorts addicts to detox

Bashore has driven many of the 172 men and women of HOPE to a detox facility himself. He has built personal relationships with several rehabilitation facilities across the state that now alert him when there is space available. And the business card he passes out has his personal cellphone number.

Nashville, North Carolina Chief of Police Thomas Bashore saw the increase in opioid deaths in his town and new he had to do something about it so he started a program called the HOPE initiative in which addicts can turn themselves into police with their drugs and paraphernalia. Rather than face arrest, they get help getting into a program to fight addiction.

""My cellphone, it rings all the time. Each participant who comes through the program and all their family members have it. So, when they need something, they reach out,"" Bashore said.

HOPE has created a positive result between the police and the community. Bashore said he wants people to understand that substance abuse is a disease and the police department's intention is to be ""supportive not only for their benefit, but for the community benefit.""

Nashville, North Carolina, a town of 5400 offers an unique program to help opioid addicts recover. Addicts can turn themselves into police with their drugs and paraphernalia. Rather than face arrest, they get help getting into a program to fight addiction.

Since the program began, Bashore said, crime is down 40% in the town, about 45 miles northeast of Raleigh. ""We've had a pretty significant drop in our crimes that are associated with substance-abuse disorder. Things like shoplifting and larcenies and breaking into cars.""

HOPE is not limited to residents of Nashville. People from all over the state have walked through the police station doors, as well as people from California and Pennsylvania.

The program comes at no cost to the participants. It is funded through small grants, fundraisers and donations.

""The chief paid for the first two months that I was there and the rehab I was at,"" recalled Spikes. Four months removed from rehab, he is now sober after being involved with drugs and alcohol for more than half his life.

Unlikely friendship

Spikes told CNN he first used drugs when he was 12 years old. ""It started off with just smoking weed,"" he said, ""then occasional pills, and it progressed through the years."" His addiction became a $200 to $300 a day habit at its worst.

Heroin became his drug of choice. He was caught with it in October 2016 and sent to jail. His arrest led to his first encounter with Bashore.

Spikes was skeptical of police and their offer to help. ""You don't talk to cops, you don't associate with them, they're not your friends,"" he said.

That changed quickly. Spikes said he recognized Bashore was solely there to help him, no questions asked. The chief ""never tried to pry into anything in my life in that era,"" Spikes said, ""(He doesn't) care who you hang out with, what kind of drugs you do.""

Spikes has cycled through countless rehab facilities, but said his life made a complete turnaround because of the chief and the HOPE initiative. ""He saved my life for sure because if it wasn't for the HOPE Initiative, I wouldn't have gotten help.""

As he hops back on the tiller in the hot summer sun, he smiles and says, ""My life has done a 180. I'm working, I have a vehicle, a house, I have a beautiful girlfriend with a baby on the way.""

And as for Bashore, he lives up to the name of his program. He hopes to continue to battle the opioid epidemic in his town, one addict at a time.

""Of those 172 people that have come through the program, I've actually been to two funerals. Knowing what the alternative could have been for Thomas ... (who) just recently disclosed to me that his girlfriend's pregnant, he's going to be a father,"" he said. ""So, that's an amazing thing. That touches me deeply."""

Leonardo DiCaprio's environmental organization will donate $3 million to help wildfire relief efforts in Australia.

DiCaprio's Earth Alliance said Thursday in a statement that the organization started the Australia Wildfire Fund to help with an ""international response to the catastrophic bushfires"" currently raging in the country. The Academy Award-winning actor co-chairs Earth Alliance, which was launched last year to combat climate change and biodiversity loss.

The wildfires have scorched an area twice the size of the state of Maryland. The blazes have killed 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes to date. The fires, fueled by drought and the country’s hottest and driest year on record, have been raging since September, months earlier than is typical for Australia’s annual wildfire season.

The fund will work with local Australian partner organizations including Aussie Ark, Bush Heritage and Wires Wildlife Rescue.

DiCaprio joins a growing list of other celebrities that have rallied to donate big bucks. Chris Hemsworth and Elton John each offered $1 million through social media earlier this week, and Pink, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban have donated as well.

Metallica said they will donation $750,000 to a firefighting agency and emergency services agency in Victoria, while Phoebe Waller-Bridge said Sunday she would auction off her Golden Globes outfit and have the proceeds go to firefighter relief."
Tennessee may become the only state to offer tuition-free community college to high school students and adults.,http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2017/01/30/haslam-outlines-expansion-tennessee-promise-scholarship/97149362/,"Haslam outlines tuition-free community college plan for adults

Adam Tamburin, USA TODAY NETWORK – Tennessee | Nashville Tennessean

In a surprise announcement during his State of the State address Monday, Gov. Bill Haslam outlined a plan to expand the Tennessee Promise scholarship model to allow adults to attend community college tuition-free.

The new scholarship, which will come before the General Assembly this year in the Tennessee Reconnect Act, is likely to further cement Haslam's national reputation as a change agent in higher education. If state lawmakers sign off on the program, Tennessee would become the only state in the nation to offer tuition-free community college to high school students and adults.

Before announcing the new scholarship for adults, Haslam emphasized the early success of Tennessee Promise, which has sent more than 33,000 high school students to community and technical colleges tuition-free since he proposed it during his 2014 State of the State speech. Expanding that model to adults, he said, was a natural next step.

State official explains Haslam college plan Mike Krause, the executive director of the state's higher education commission, explains the Tennessee Reconnect scholarship

“We need to reach the working mother that went to college but didn’t complete, or the son with sons of his own who like his dad never went to college but knows that he needs to upgrade his skills,"" Haslam said in his prepared remarks. ""Tonight, I’m introducing the next step in making certain that everyone in Tennessee has the opportunity to earn their degree.""

The lawmakers and officials packed inside the House chambers responded to the announcement with a thunderous standing ovation that lasted several seconds.

The Haslam administration has tried for years to entice adults without degrees to enroll in college, many times under the Reconnect banner. But the new scholarship program would represent the most sweeping effort by far, with more than 2 million adults potentially eligible.

Under Haslam's proposal, any adult Tennessee resident without a college degree or certificate could use the scholarship regardless of income or past academic performance. While college leaders suggested they would focus their recruiting efforts on the more than 900,000 Tennesseans with some college credit but no degree, adults who had never stepped foot on a college campus would be eligible as well.

""No caps. No first come, first served,"" Haslam said. ""Just as we did with Tennessee Promise we’re making a clear statement to families with Reconnect: Wherever you might fall on life’s path, education beyond high school is critical to the Tennessee we can be.

""We don’t want cost to be an obstacle anyone has to overcome as they pursue their own generational change for themselves and their families.”

State funding already covers tuition for adults who want to go to technical college, and there is a small program that pays community college tuition for adults who meet a rigorous slate of requirements. But officials expect the new community college scholarship, which will allow adults to attend college part time, to be a more popular option.

Funding for the new scholarship would come from the state's lottery proceeds. State dollars would be used to cover tuition only after all available federal aid was applied, a last-dollar model similar to Tennessee Promise.

Officials expect the Reconnect scholarship would cost the state $10 million annually.

David Gregory, the interim chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents college system, said the Reconnect scholarship would be a boon to the state's network of 13 community colleges, which have struggled to boost adult enrollment even as the Promise scholarship led to a surge in teenage students.

""This is a great time to continue the momentum that I feel like Tennessee has got right now,"" he said.

Gregory said that, to accommodate students who might be juggling coursework with a job and a family, colleges would need to ""enhance their efforts"" by considering night classes, weekend schedules and other nontraditional adjustments.

How Gov. Bill Haslam put together his gas tax plan

Haslam has become one of the nation's most outspoken advocates for college access since launching the Drive to 55 initiative in 2013. More than a dozen programs, including the Promise and Reconnect scholarships, have been launched under that umbrella — all with the goal of getting 55 percent of working-age Tennesseans to complete a college education by 2025.

To reach that goal, the state said, 871,000 additional Tennesseans would need to earn a degree or certificate. But only 645,000 high school students are expected to graduate in the next eight years, meaning the state will need to draw at least 155,000 adults onto campus and then graduation.

In a speech that Haslam acknowledged was stuffed with numbers, it was that prospect that drew emotion from the governor. Haslam told the audience he focused so heavily on higher education because he knew first-hand it had the power to change lives.

The governor told lawmakers about his father, Jim Haslam, who was in the audience, who was able to attend college because of a scholarship. Jim Haslam went on to start the massively successful Pilot Corp.

Because his father ""was the first in his family to attend college and get his degree,"" the governor said, ""the trajectory of his life — and mine — was changed forever.""

The two Koreas will start clearing mines from the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on October 1 as a first step after they agreed to disarm the border area starting with land mines.,http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=256216,"



By Lee Min-hyung







The two Koreas will start clearing mines from the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on October 1 as a first step after they agreed to disarm the border area starting with land mines.







For 20 days from Monday, Seoul and Pyongyang plan to remove all mines from the Joint Security Area (JSA) along the DMZ, the Ministry of National Defense said, Sunday.







""The two Koreas will engage in joint works to remove mines and explosives on the JSA and upland areas in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province,"" a military official said.







The remains of about 300 soldiers from the two Koreas and United Nation forces killed during the 1950-1953 Korean War are believed to be buried in the upland areas.







The two Koreas chose the area as a trial venue for the joint repatriation mission.







The move is part of a follow-up measure to the Pyongyang Declaration signed in mid-September by President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.







The leaders of the two Koreas agreed to continue concerted efforts to disarm the DMZ and withdraw troops from there as a confidence-building measure amid detente on the Korean Peninsula.







The two Koreas and the United Nations Command (UNC) will also form a trilateral negotiating body to speed disarmament along the inter-Korean border.







Details of when the organization will be set up have not been confirmed, according to the defense ministry.







It remains to be seen whether the two Koreas can complete removing the mines as scheduled because of a limited workforce and a shortage of equipment.

"After a lesbian couple's home was vandalized for hanging a rainbow flag, more than 40 homes in their neighborhood hung up rainbow flags in solidarity",http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/08/22/gay-couple-targeted-neighborhood-united/F1AYqZ1n1qiwCarKt8XcxL/story.html?s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Afacebook,"But what happened next reminded the couple why they loved the neighborhood in the first place. On Sunday, a squadron of children on bicycles delivered rainbow flags to house after house.

""It really sent us reeling,"" Cari said.

NATICK – Cari and Lauri Ryding always felt welcome on Strawberry Hill Road. Then they came home from vacation and discovered the rainbow flag they had hung after the Orlando massacre had been stolen and their front porch pelted with eggs.

And one by one, the flags went up, transforming a swath of suburbia – more than 40 houses in all — into a brilliantly colored declaration of pride and solidarity, displayed on picket fences, garages, doorways, and decks.

""It just happened so quickly — the whole neighborhood said, 'Get me a flag. Get me a flag. Get me a flag,' "" said Penni Rochwerger, who lives around the corner from the Rydings. ""If we can stop whatever hate is out there, I think that's really important.""

Lauri Ryding said that after cleaning the eggs off her porch, she walked through the streets around her home, overwhelmed by all the neighbors prominently flying the rainbow colors.

""One person's act of fear and maliciousness created such a powerful statement of love,"" she said. ""We are very blessed, very fortunate.""

Cari Ryding, 49, first moved to Strawberry Hill Road 23 years ago, and, she said, she immediately fell in love with the family-friendly feel of the place.

""I loved the diversity of the generations, and how there's a commitment to that — of all ages, and all shapes, and sizes, and preferences,"" she said. ""I've been feeling this energy in the neighborhood for years.""

That feeling was reinforced, she said, after she separated from her husband 10 years ago, and her neighbors helped her adjust to life as a single parent, bringing her dinners if she was sick or watching two of her children if she had to take the third to the doctor.

And the bond deepened even further, she said, when neighbors who had met her husband welcomed her wife, Lauri, 52.

""When I moved in four and a half years ago, I was embraced,"" Lauri said. ""Our relationship was embraced.""

So both women were stunned when they came home Wednesday to discover the vandalism.

""It was our first experience in Natick of having any type of prejudice,"" Cari said. ""We hadn't experienced it all, and it kind of broke open our little cocoon.""

They alerted Natick police, and asked neighbors on Facebook if anyone knew what happened. No one did and still there are no suspects. But many were outraged.

RELATED | The Word: There is no 'gay' voice

One neighbor suggested asking for a stack of flags from the Rainbow Peace Flag Project, a local organization that gives away the flags free to Natick-area residents.

The Rydings had ordered their flag from the group about a month ago, to honor the 49 victims killed in June at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando.

Immediately, requests flooded in, along with donations to the group.

""We said, 'Why don't we all have the flags? They can't take them from all of us,'"" said Dennis Gaughan, whose wife, Maura, helped organize the rainbow response.

Lois McGillivray, 85, who has lived on Strawberry Hill Road for 50 years, had one of the rainbow flags proudly displayed on her home on Monday.

""I have never met anyone who would do what that person did to that house,"" she said. ""This is a place where nobody bothers anybody, no matter how you want to live, as long as you're not digging up the garden and throwing the dirt in my yard.""

RELATED: Goodridge plaintiffs look back to May 17, 2004

Neil Podolski said he wanted to fly a rainbow flag, as well, after hearing that the Rydings' home had been vandalized.

""It's just not right,"" said Podolski, who is Jewish. ""Who's to say tomorrow we don't find a swastika on our house?""

Cari Ryding said that she had started thinking twice about her neighborhood after her home was targeted, ""and what they did completely overshadowed that fear and we are just overwhelmed with the kindness and generosity.""

As jarring as the initial crime was, Lauri Ryding said, the response has helped restore their faith in their community.

""Somebody's fear called them to action,"" she said. ""But our neighbors' support and love called them to action, and love conquers hate. Love wins. We win.""

Tunisia becomes the first Arab nation to approve gender equality in inheritance law,https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/africa/2018/11/25/controversial-gender-equality-in-inheritance-law-approved-by-tunisian-cabinet,"Tunisians demand altering religious law concerning inheritance in Tunis on March 10, 2018 AFP

The law was approved on Friday

The Tunisian cabinet- the first among Arab nations- has approved the law of gender equality in inheritance, which is to be discussed in the parliament dominated by Ennahda Movement before being effective in the country.

The law was approved on Friday, which has been suggested by the Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi in August 2017, on occasion of national women’s day.

The controversial law permits women and men to have an equal inheritance, contradicting the Qur’anic verse which states the share of women's inheritance is half that of men's.

The law will also guarantee a freedom of choice between following the constitution or the Sharia Islamic law.

Essebsi, overseeing the Tunisian cabinet, said he based his legislative initiative on the Tunisian constitution which states that “Tunisia is a civil country that is based on three elements: Citizenship, the will of the people, and the supremacy of law.”

He also said that the constitution stated “the rights and duties of Tunisian men and women are equal, and that the state is committed to defending women’s rights and works on supporting and developing them.”

The Tunisian president formed the Individual Freedoms and Equality Committee in August 2017, and assigned it to propose reforms for the Tunisian legislative system, with the purpose of increasing freedoms in the state."

While the report shows a global spike in life expectancy across the various regions, Africa has gained the most increase with life expectancy up 9.4 years between 2000 and 2015.

Africa’s improvement in life expectancy was the biggest increase recorded across all the regions. This increase, WHO says, is mainly down to the success recorded in the continent’s fight with the AIDS epidemic. After resulting in a severe decline in life expectancy on the continent in the 1990s, improved access to treatment for the virus has aided the reversal of the trend. Also attributed as a reason for the improvement in life expectancy has been the progress in malaria control and treatment. With as many as six African nations possibly getting rid of the disease by 2020 and malaria mortality rates falling by 66% across all age groups, the continent is on course to eliminate the disease faster than expected. The continent’s progress is highlighted by another fact: of the 37 countries that have recorded a 10% increase in life expectancy, 30 are in Africa, according to World Bank data.

But despite the many positives, more needs to be done as Africa remains home to the world’s lowest life expectancy rates for both genders. Sierra Leone have the world’s lowest rate of any country for both genders and Chad, Angola and Central African Republic (C.A.R) all feature among the bottom five countries for life expectancy rates for both genders.

In general, Algeria (75.6) ranks as the country with the best life expectancy rate on the continent. Asides Algeria, Cape Verde, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia and Seychelles all have life expectancy rates higher than the global average (71.4)."

GREEN BAY - The Green Bay Water Utility on Tuesday removed its last lead pipe in the city, closing a chapter in a years-long effort to improve water quality for residents.

Officials announced the milestone at a news conference Tuesday before removing an east-side lead service line and replacing it with a copper pipe. That marked the 1,782nd utility-owned line replaced since January 2016, when the utility ramped up lead removal amid the Flint, Michigan, water crisis.

""Our (lead) levels are way down,"" said Nancy Quirk, the utility's general manager.

Green Bay last installed lead pipes in 1944 and began replacing them in 1990, when the city had 4,400. In 2011, the water utility found levels in some homes were above limits set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and identified 1,782 utility-owned and 247 privately owned service lines that needed replacing.

Lead poisoning can cause brain damage and result in learning disabilities, developmental delays or reduced attention span, according to the state Department of Health Services. Children are the most vulnerable to those health risks.

Quirk said the utility has eliminated all but one privately owned lead pipe. The final line goes through a home pending foreclosure and will be replaced once it belongs to the bank.

The utility spent over $6 million to replace the city's remaining lead service lines, in part through two rate increases over the five-year period. The initiative also got a boost from the Lambeau Field tax credit and loans from the state Department of Natural Resources. Homeowners with lead lines were not required to pay for a replacement.

Quirk believed it was important to remove the source of the lead entirely instead of using a chemical treatment, which she feared could increase phosphorus levels in the Fox River. The utility also flushes the system to keep water clean and will monitor copper levels to ensure the new pipes don't cause any problems.

""We made it happen,"" she said.

Making it easier for teens to be vaccinated without parental consent.,https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/how-teens-from-non-vax-families-can-become-vaccinated-20190207-p50wbb.html,"Dr Vicky Sheppeard, director of the communicable diseases branch at NSW Health, said the new laws would “make it easier for people to receive catch-up vaccinations”. Loading “Any teenager aged 14 or 15 who wasn’t fully vaccinated when they were younger is able to be vaccinated by a GP or at a hospital without parental consent if the medical practitioner is satisfied they understand what they are doing and any potential risks, Dr Sheppeard said. “Those aged 16 and 17 also have the same rights as adults to be vaccinated.” However, she said teenagers need parental consent regardless of their age in order to take part in the NSW school vaccination program in year 7 and year 10. Associate professor Nicholas Wood, from the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network and the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, welcomed the improvement in access to vaccines. “Teenagers might find it easier to go to a pharmacist rather than sit in a GP’s waiting room,” Dr Wood said.

However, teenagers still need to see a GP to get all the recommended vaccines because pharmacists couldn’t administer vaccines such as meningococcal ACWY, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B and chicken pox, Dr Wood said. Loading Ms Moses, now 22, grew up in Mullumbimby in northern NSW, an area with the lowest rate of vaccination in Australia. She was not vaccinated as a child and had only a smattering of jabs as a teenager. Ms Moses had whooping cough when she was one and this contributed to her parents' decision to get her brother, 10 years younger than Maya, vaccinated on time. They offered to get Maya vaccinated but she was scared of needles and they didn't push her. By the time she left school, Ms Moses was “passionately pro-vaccination” and she had the added motivation that she needed to be fully vaccinated to enrol in a medical degree at university.

She went to a medical clinic in Melbourne, where she had moved for university, but the doctor didn’t know anything about designing a catch-up vaccination schedule and instead printed off the schedule for infants and children. “A lot of those vaccines aren’t even relevant any more, the timeline was five years and I had to get them done in the space of six months to a year,” Ms Moses said. Eventually, a nurse back in Mullumbimby designed a plan for Ms Moses, knowing which vaccinations could be done together and how to space them out appropriately over about nine months. Even then, some of the vaccines cost Ms Moses $100 a pop, a big outlay for a university student. “If I didn’t need it, it would have taken a lot longer because I would have found it harder to get motivated,” she said. Ms Moses said it would be helpful if health professionals could download sample catch-up schedules for people of different ages.

Dr Wood said South Australia had a catch-up vaccination calculator for under-10 year-olds that could be used Australia wide, while additional information was in the Australian Immunisation Handbook. He added the government covered the cost of vaccines recommended for 10- to 19-year-olds. Vaccination rates have improved in NSW, with 94.6 of children fully vaccinated by the age of five in 2018, up from 88.9 per cent in 2010. Northern NSW has the lowest rates in Australia at 90.6 per cent. Maya Moses says studying medicine has made her more vocal about vaccinations, though the topic is controversial in Mullumbimby. Credit:Jason South Associate Professor Ben Edwards, from the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods, said research suggested 23 per cent of all children in 2004 were delayed in receiving immunisation, compared with only 2.4 per cent of children who were not immunised at all. A delay might be because of travel, illness or other logistical factors, whereas no vaccination at all usually suggested a blanket objection. Ms Moses said vaccination was still controversial in Mullumbimby."

Giant lily pads have reappeared in a Paraguay lagoon after being listed as endangered in 2006.

The aquatic plants, their scientific name is Victoria cruziana, appeared in a tributary of the Paraguay river 25km north of Asunción, the capital.

The environment ministry told the Associated Press that the plant had slowly disappeared due to dredging and visitors collecting the plants.

Water lilies in the area are known for their 1.5m size, and exceptional shape.

Their return has drawn a mass of tourists to Piquete Cue in central Paraguay, where they take pictures and pay for boat rides to see the lilies up close.

""I have lived in the area since I was a child. The neighbours and I thought the plant had already become extinct, but it has returned,"" Antonio Benítez, a local resident, told The Associated Press (in Spanish) .

Agustin Gomez, a tourist, was stunned by their size. ""This is something that you just don't see every day, or even every year. You do see lily pads all the time but not so many. And not so enormous! Some are 2m wide,"" he said.

Locals use the aquatic plant to make a medicinal tea that they believe can help combat asthma and bronchial disorders, but the authorities have warned that those who try to harvest it could be fined."

Peanut allergy cured in majority of children in immunotherapy trial. Australian researchers hail breakthrough after ‘life-changing’ tolerance persists for up to four years.,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/17/peanut-allergy-cured-in-majority-of-children-in-immunotherapy-trial,"Australian researchers have made a breakthrough in the treatment of peanut allergy in children.

A small clinical trial conducted at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute has led to two-thirds of children treated with an experimental immunotherapy treatment being cured of their allergy. Importantly, this desensitisation to peanuts persisted for up to four years after treatment.

“These children had been eating peanut freely in their diet without having to follow any particular program of peanut intake in the years after treatment was completed,” said the lead researcher, Prof Mimi Tang.

Peanut allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction, and one of the most common causes of death from food allergy.

To combat this Tang, an immunologist and allergist, pioneered a new form of treatment that combines a probiotic with peanut oral immunotherapy, known as PPOIT. Instead of avoiding the allergen, the treatment is designed to reprogram the immune system’s response to peanuts and eventually develop a tolerance.

It’s thought that combining the probiotic with the immunotherapy gives the immune system the “nudge” it needs to do this, according to Tang.

Forty-eight children were enrolled in the PPOIT trial and were randomly given either a combination of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus with peanut protein in increasing amounts, or a placebo, once daily for 18 months.

At the end of the original trial in 2013, 82% of children who received the immunotherapy treatment were deemed tolerant to peanuts compared with just 4% in the placebo group.

Four years later, the majority of the children who gained initial tolerance were still eating peanuts as part of their normal diet and 70% passed a further challenge test to confirm long-term tolerance.

Tang said the results were exciting and had been life-changing for participants. “The way I see it is that we had children who came into the study allergic to peanuts, having to avoid peanuts in their diet, being very vigilant around that, carrying a lot of anxiety with that and, at the end of treatment and even four years later, many of these children who had benefited from our probiotic peanut therapy could now live like a child who didn’t have peanut allergy.”

The results are published in the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.

If confirmed by larger clinical studies, the broader hope is that this treatment can have an impact on the high rates of food allergy among children.

“This is a major step forward in identifying an effective treatment to address the food allergy problem in western societies,” Tang said."

Danish container shipping giant Maersk has pledged to become a carbon-neutral business by 2050 - the first commitment of its kind from the global maritime shipping sector.

Announced on Wednesday (5 December), the move will see Maersk work with governments and industry in order to help spur the development of net-zero vessels and shipping fuels in a bid to make these technologies commercially viable by 2030.

Given that the average container shipping vessel has a lifespan of 20-25 years, Maersk’s chief operating officer Søren Toft said that taking ambitious action to decarbonise the shipping sector within the next decade will be “crucial” in achieving the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) 2050 target of halving CO2 emissions from 2008 levels.

“The only possible way to achieve the so-much-needed decarbonisation in our industry is by fully transforming to new carbon-neutral fuels and supply chains,” Toft said. “Going forward, we cannot do this alone.”

While collaboration will be key to meeting its 2050 ambition, Maersk is also set to make “significant” investment into retrofitting its existing vessels, purchasing electric ground vehicles, sourcing renewable power and installing energy efficiency technologies.

An exact figure has not yet been disclosed, but Maersk has notably invested around $1bn each year into research and development projects around low-carbon technologies since 2014. Through this investment, it has trained more than 50 engineers in the design and installation processes for energy efficiency technologies.

The announcement comes off the back of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) landmark report, which warns that the world must achieve net-zero emsissions by mid-century if global temperature increases are to be limited to 1.5C.

Setting a course for sustainability

According to a report by the European Parliament, the international shipping industry is currently responsible for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions – but this proportion could rise to 17% by 2050 if the sector is left unregulated.

Cargo and container ships are an important transportation method, carrying billions of tonnes of goods across select trade groups each year. However, the heavy boats are often heavy emitters, with research suggesting that vessels of 5,000 gross tonnage and above account for 85% of carbon emissions from the shipping sector.

Some of the largest corporations within the sector have already made progress towards decarbonising their operations, with global non-profit BSR’s Clean Cargo Working Group estimating that emissions per container move have dropped by 37.1% since 2009.

Leading this trend, Maersk has reduced its relative CO2 emissions by 46% against a 2007 baseline, largely through the adoption of energy efficiency technologies and the sourcing of renewable power.

Indeed, since the IMO approved a roadmap through to 2023 on the global adoption of an emissions reduction strategy in 2016, more than 170 countries have reached an agreement to reduce CO2 emissions from their respective maritime sectors by at least 50%, against a 2008 baseline.

But as ambition levels rise, progress to convert aims into action continues to be slow, with the Clean Cargo Working Group’s most recent research concluding that absolute emissions accounted for by the 22 largest companies within the industry had fallen just 1% between 2016 and 2017.

To spur more ambitious action, BSR is now calling on those within the sector to turn to innovation. Agri-food giant Cargill notably launched the first industry competition to incentivise the development of innovative solutions to maritime shipping’s carbon challenges earlier this year.

Japan set to target zero emissions by 2050 in policy shift,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-japan-policy-shift/japan-set-to-target-zero-emissions-by-2050-in-policy-shift-idUSKBN2780PC,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is set to bind Japan to a target for carbon neutrality by 2050, a shift in stance that will bring the country in line with the European Union and more than 60 other nations in efforts to combat climate change.

The new target will be announced by Suga when he makes his first address to parliament on Monday, after taking office last month, the Nikkei reported earlier this week.

Japan previously said it would aim to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 and achieve net-zero emissions sometime in the latter half of the century.

The move, if confirmed, would make the world’s third-largest economy the second Asian country after South Korea to aim for the 2050 target that is considered the minimum needed to keep global average temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 Celsius.

Japan is the world’s fifth-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, the heat trapping gas that scientists say is already causing major heatwaves, bigger and more powerful cyclones and periods of drought around the world.

Under pressure from many business sectors, moves are also afoot to increase the use of renewable energy as the government starts forcing the shutdown of older, dirtier coal plants.

But investors say the apparent change in position is at odds with the country’s plans to roll out new coal stations.

“Any net zero commitment from a coal-intensive economy, such as Japan, has to be coupled with an urgent and credible coal phase out plan to be taken seriously,” Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Norway’s Storebrand Asset Management told Reuters.

Storebrand has assets under management of around $90 billion with investments in Japanese companies and has been critical of Japan’s stance on coal.

“Japan’s solar and wind power potential is huge and Prime Minister Suga has the opportunity to accelerate this and embrace a modern and coal-free energy system,” he added.

Pressure has also been building from below with the number of cities, towns and villages aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050 increasing to 163 from 4 in a little over a year, according to the environment ministry.

Still, there are plenty of vested interests to stymie the efforts including from the old power utilities, car and steel makers, along with industrial companies that use coal boilers to produce steam needed for manufacturing purposes, all of whom have plenty of lobbying power.

Companies running smaller, older coal plants are already lobbying the government heavily for exemptions to the plans shut to them down, an official at one of Japan’s trading houses that supplies them with fuel told Reuters this week.

But Japan’s most powerful business federation, known as Keidanren, is now advocating the 2050 target with its chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi pushing the line at the prime minister’s economic advisory council, according to minutes from the Oct. 6 meeting.

A report released in August showed how Keidanren is dominated by energy-intensive sectors representing less than 10% of the economy, resulting in national policies that favour coal and hindering efforts on climate change.

"12 Year-Old autistic boy who was bullied at school for his Eclectic taste in music gets to direct music video for his idol, Aphex Twin.",http://www.culturecreature.com/ryan-wyer-interview-aphex-twin/,"by |

The face of 12 year-old Dublin native Ryan Wyer has become emblematic of Aphex Twin’s new Cheetah EP, released today. Wyer was chosen by Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin) and his label, Warp records, to direct the official video for ‘CIRKLON3 [ Колхозная mix ]’ (Ryan also stars in the video). Today, Aphex Twin posted this heartwarming shot of Wyer celebrating Cheetah‘s release:

So how did it all happen? The short answer, according to Ryan, is that “Rich thinks I make cool videos.” Ryan’s mother, Marie O’Toole Wyer, transcribed her son’s answers to interview questions via email. Asked to describe his hometown of Rush, County Dublin, Ryan said, “I live by the sea in a small town, it’s quiet and peaceful.” When he grows up, Ryan hopes to be “a musician and a director.” He’s certainly off to a promising start.

Ryan’s journey with Aphex Twin began when James and Warp took notice of videos on Wyer’s YouTube channel. Ryan’s channel included Aphex Twin ‘fan videos,’ including one for ‘minipops 67 [120.2][source field mix].’ The Wyers were surprised when Warp contacted Ryan to create an official Aphex Twin video. According to Marie, “Warp said that Ryan had been spoken about a lot and they loved his work.” Ryan’s admirers also included filmmaker Chris Cunningham, whose twisted Aphex Twin videos (like those for ‘Window Licker’ and ‘Come to Daddy’) are considered masterworks of the music video medium. According to Marie, both James and Cunningham wrote comments on videos on Ryan’s YouTube channel.

Warp sent Ryan the Cheetah EP and asked him to make a video for a track of his choosing. As for the creative process, Ryan says, “Warp and Rich told me to do what I do best, that’s all.” Ryan’s ‘CIRKLON3 [Колхозная mix]’ video includes footage of Wyer dancing with friends and family. The cast are adorned with Aphex Twin shirts and eery, humorous masks bearing an iconic image of James’ face. Marie explains that “Warp and Richard put Ryan under no pressure and were very supportive and helpful along the whole process.”

Marie noted similarities in the personalities of Ryan and Mr. James. “As most people know,” she wrote, “Richard likes to stay out of the limelight and is quite private and has a very quirky sense of humour – actually very like Ryan. Ryan loves his own space and doesn’t really care what others think of him. So they have very similar personalities.”

The reality of Ryan’s international exposure settled in when the family saw his video screened publicly on a digital display in Tokyo. “Ryan’s face just lit up with excitement,” Marie explained. “We shed many tears of happiness for our very special, talented young man.” The entire experience “has given Ryan a huge confidence boost,” she says. Marie also noted that Ryan’s story has served as an inspiration to other children who have a disability and their families. Ryan has autism and is visually impaired.

“Ryan has listened and loved music from a very young age,” Marie wrote, “and we always knew he would do something with music. He expresses how he feels through music…. We are hugely thankful to Richard and Warp for seeing Ryan’s talent and giving him this amazing opportunity. They made his dreams come true.”

Early this week, Marie tweeted this photo of two friends shopping for records:"

A 106-year-old woman from Maharashtra's Thane district defeated COVID-19 and was discharged from hospital on Sunday with doctors and nurses giving her a warm farewell.

With happiness writ large on her face, the woman proudly displayed her discharge certificate to the media before walking out of the hospital after a 10-day stay.

After the Dombivli-based centenarian contracted the disease, no hospital was initially ready to admit her due to her age, said her daughter-in-law, who were happy to see her mother-in-law discharged from the hospital after recovering from the disease.

She was finally admitted 10 days back to the COVID-19 treatment facility set up by the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) at Savlaram Krida Sankul (sports complex) and doctors and medical teams there took proper care of her, the daughter-in-law said.

""We are really thankful to the hospital's medical team who took proper care of her and helped her in defeating the coronavirus,"" she said.

Dr Rahul Ghule, managing director of ''One Rupee Clinic'' which is managing this COVID-19 treatment facility, appreciated his team for taking care of the elderly woman. ""We are happy that she successfully responded to the treatment,"" he said, adding that the hospital was opened on July 27, and so far it has treated 1,100 COVID-19 patients.

''One Rupee Clinics'', which charge Re 1 per patient for their services, have been set up at select stations on the Central Railway''s suburban section to provide emergency help to rail accident victims and give medical treatment to the general public.

Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackery took to Twitter to laud the KDMC staff and Shiv Sena's Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde for providing proper treatment to the elderly woman.

He said the blessings of the woman and many more like her ""keep us all going strong"".

KDMC spokesperson Madhuri Phopale said so far 38,301 COVID-19 cases have been reported from areas falling under the civic limits and of these, 762 have died due to the disease.

As of now, there are 5,451 active COVID-19 cases in Kalyan-Dombivli while 32,088 patients have recovered, she said."
Fungi That 'Eat' Radiation Are Growing on the Walls of Chernobyl's Ruined Nuclear Reactor,https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2020/02/04/fungi_that_eats_radiation_is_growing_on_the_walls_of_chernobyls_ruined_nuclear_reactor.html,"Back in 1991, scientists were amazed when they made the discovery...

In the eerie environment inside the abandoned Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, researchers remotely piloting robots spotted pitch black fungi growing on the walls of the decimated No. 4 nuclear reactor and even apparently breaking down radioactive graphite from the core itself. What's more, the fungi seemed to be growing towards sources of radiation, as if the microbes were attracted to them!

More than a decade later, University of Saskatchewan Professor Ekaterina Dadachova (then at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York) and her colleagues acquired some of the fungi and found that they grew faster in the presence of radiation compared to other fungi. The three species tested, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Cryptococcus neoformans and Wangiella dermatitidis, all had large amounts of the pigment melanin, which is found – among many places – in the skin of humans. People with a darker skin tone have much more of it. Melanin is known to absorb light and dissipate ultraviolet radiation, but in the fungi, it seemed to also be absorbing radiation and converting it into chemical energy for growth, perhaps in a similar fashion to how plants utilize the green pigment chlorophyll to attain energy from photosynthesis.

This photomicrograph depicts Cryptococcus neoformans using a light India ink staining preparation.

To learn more about Chernobyl's radiation-loving fungi, Jet Propulsion Laboratory researchers sent eight species collected from the area to the International Space Station (ISS) back in 2016, seeking to observe how the organisms would react. The ISS environment exposes inhabitants to between 40 and 80 times more radiation than on Earth. Researchers behind the effort hoped that the fungi would produce molecules that could be adapted into drugs that could be given to astronauts to protect them from radiation on long-term missions. Results of the experiment have yet to be published.

Back on Earth, Dadachova noted in a 2008 paper that Chernobyl's radiation-loving fungi are almost certainly not the first examples of their kind.

""Large quantities of highly melanized fungal spores have been found in early Cretaceous period deposits when many species of animals and plants died out. This period coincides with Earth’s crossing the “magnetic zero” resulting in the loss of its “shield” against cosmic radiation.""

This raises an intriguing possibility – perhaps there are places in the cosmos where melanin-containing organisms thrive in environments awash in radiation? Wherever there is energy to be harvested, life might just find a way..."
Milwaukee Fire Department implemented a mobile health care unit to assist their chronic callers. 911 calls from those 100 people dropped by 62% in two years.,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2018/04/13/911-calls-chronically-ill-drop-after-milwaukee-launches-community-paramedic-initiative/511123002/?from=new-cookie,"911 calls from the chronically ill drop after Milwaukee launches community paramedic initiative

Jesse Garza | Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

Frequent 911 calls from chronically ill city residents have dropped significantly since the launch of an effort by the Milwaukee Fire Department to help those residents better manage their health conditions.

The Community Paramedic Mobile Integrated Healthcare Program began as a pilot project in the fall of 2015 after an analysis by the department revealed that 7% of the 62,763 calls for emergency medical services the year before — 4,288 responses — came from the same 100 people.

Once the program was initiated, from October to December 2015, calls from such patients who participated fell 26%.

In 2016 those calls fell by 56%, and fell by 62% in 2017, fire department officials said.

""I see it first-hand. People are getting better,"" said Capt. Michael Wright, mobile integrated health care coordinator for the department, who spearheaded the project.

Wright was among about 100 people who gathered Friday at the fire department's downtown Station 2 to herald the accomplishments of the program.

Since its launch, about 300 patients have participated in mobile integrated health care in rotating groups of 30 during 30-day periods, Wright said.

The program involves home visits by paramedics who receive 200 hours of managed care training from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee College of Nursing, in collaboration with the Medical College of Wisconsin.

That comes on top of the 2,000 hours of paramedic training they have already received, according to Milwaukee Fire Department Chief Mark Rohlfing.

The paramedics assess the health of patients with conditions such as asthma, congestive heart failure or diabetes, with the goal of preventing chronic health issues from escalating to expensive trips to emergency rooms.

The paramedics help connect those patients with medical services and identify and address other social obstacles to medical care, such as transportation to a doctor's office.

""The goal is better health and better care at a lower cost,"" Rohlfing said.

The paramedics also check smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors, promote firearms safety and look for other hazards, such as ""slip and fall"" areas in the home.

There are 34 community paramedics trained in managed care working with patients participating in the program at no cost.

""We had no blueprint to follow,"" the chief said.

""The best practices hadn't been developed. The program we've built is one of a kind,"" he said.

In 2017 state legislation was passed granting the paramedics legal authorization to function in non-emergency environments, and the project received legal authorization to operate as a full-fledged program, fire department officials said.

""We're serving the most at-risk citizens in a proactive way,"" Rohlfing said."
Aquariums report high number of webcam visits amid Covid shutdown from people seeking stress relief,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/21/aquariums-report-wave-of-webcam-visits-amid-covid-shutdown,"Facilities experience jump in online traffic as people take to internet to view marine life

Aquariums closed to visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic have reported big increases in traffic to their exhibit webcams as people turn to the underwater world for stress relief.

Since Monterey Bay aquarium in California closed to the public in March, visits to its website have tripled compared to the previous year. Nearly 80% of traffic goes to its 10 live webcams, with the sea otter, jellyfish and shark exhibits proving the most popular.

“People watch them religiously,” said Dana Allen-Greil, Monterey Bay aquarium’s director of digital strategy. “They email us and say ‘I eat breakfast every morning with the sea otters’ – it becomes part of their daily life.”

Georgia aquarium recorded an approximate 3,000% increase in daily traffic to its webcams at the start of lockdown in mid-March, in particular to its 6.3m-gallon whale shark tunnel.

A spokeswoman for the National aquarium in Baltimore said it saw “a large spike” to its blacktip reef shark, coral reef and jellyfish live streams, with anecdotal evidence that visitors were seeking stress relief.

Laura Reeve, a middle-school teacher in Santa Cruz, CA, said she had incorporated Monterey Bay aquarium’s webcams into her suggested self-care routines for students, alongside breathing exercises.

“Students were worried and anxious, and quite a few of them told me that watching the webcams helped them focus and calm down.”

Teachers had found them helpful too, Reeve said: “I regularly use the Open Ocean and Bay View webcams myself to help with relaxation.”

Research by the National Marine aquarium, the University of Plymouth and the University of Exeter published in the Environment & Behavior journal in 2015 found that viewing aquarium displays led to noticeable reductions in blood pressure and heart rate.

The study’s authors said it was the first robust evidence that “doses” of exposure to underwater settings could have a positive impact on people’s wellbeing.

A more recent review of aquariums’ restorative role, in 2018, concluded: “In today’s increasingly stressful world, quick and easy access to restorative environments that promote positive emotions and help reduce stress may be essential, especially for people who have few, if any, chances to engage with the natural world.”

During the Covid-19 shutdown, Monterey Bay aquarium has embraced this as a public service, producing a series of guided meditations – or “MeditOceans” – set to soothing footage of jellyfish or breaking waves.

“It just felt like the right thing to put out in the world,” said Allen-Greil, adding that she had been told of frontline hospital workers incorporating it into their workdays.

Monterey Bay has also recognised the boom in working from home with its own instrumental music mixes: “two hours of squid to work/study/relax to”. (Its jellyfish webcam, meanwhile, was highlighted on Reddit as one of “the best links to click while you’re stoned”.)

With 1 million followers on Facebook and now 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, social media has long been central to the aquarium’s mission to inspire ocean conservation. Its first webcams were installed in 2001.

But with no date set for reopening, Monterey Bay’s only presence during the pandemic is online, and at a time of great financial need. “It’s a lot of pressure right now to be the public face of the aquarium,” said Allen-Greil.

The institution is facing a $45m (£34m) shortfall this year and 174 staff have already lost their jobs: “We have needed more than ever this summer to use these tools for fundraising and to make clear our need.”

Monterey Bay’s call for its followers to appeal for emergency congressional funding for aquariums yielded 10,000 responses, as well as $27,000 in direct giving.

The aquarium has been exploring new potential sources of revenue, such as educational talks held in the world of the game Animal Crossing, live-streamed over Twitch; and YouTube tours behind the scenes of the jellyfish and cephalopod exhibits.

“We’ve got a ton of requests like, ‘Can you just Zoom my grandmother on her birthday and feed a penguin? I’ll pay’,” said Allen-Greil. “We’re thinking a lot about what that means for us.”

Though online initiatives alone would not save the aquarium, she said, “once we’re ready to open, we’re confident that we’ll have people wanting to come.”

Until then: “it’s about bringing the ocean to people in their daily lives.”

The policy addresses the first dose for everyone amid uncertainty at this stage over how many times a vaccine would need to be administered.

Whether the policy will cover foreign residents in Japan has yet to be officially determined, a ministry official said, while offering his personal opinion that it would be natural to include them for the sake of public health.

The government is trying to secure enough vaccines by the first half of 2021 to administer to all members of the public, having earmarked a budget of ¥671.4 billion ($6.4 billion).

It has agreed with British drugmaker AstraZeneca PLC and U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. to receive 120 million doses of vaccine from each company when successfully developed, and is also negotiating with U.S. firm Moderna Inc. for 40 million doses or more.

In case a vaccination causes serious side effects, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry plans to have the state, not companies, redress patients and pay damages through a law revision at an extraordinary Diet session expected to start later this month, it said."
Dentist who gives free smile makeovers to Brazil's poorest people proudly reveals their life-changing transformations in heart-rending before and after photos,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7631493/Dentist-transforms-teeth-living-poverty-free-charge-smile-factory.html,"Advertisement

A dentist who travels to underprivileged communities to give people dental makeovers free of charge is, quite literally, bringing bright and healthy smiles to the faces of people all over the world.

Keen to give back and do good, aesthetic dentist Felipe Rossi formed an NGO called Por1sorriso to provide free dental work to low-income people in need of root canals, cleaning, restoration work and more.

The Brazil-native, 38, said that his team can perform up to 1,500 dental procedures during a typical 'action' in a village or town; providing invaluable services for communities who need it most.

Life changing: Dentist Felipe Rossi has shared remarkable before and after images of his patients, many of whom live in extreme poverty and cannot afford dental work

Emotional: The before-and-after photos are powerfully emotive, and capture the raw reactions to their new smiles

Life altering: Felipe said the work that he and his team do is 'transformative' - as he estimates that they have provided free dental care to 1,500 people so far

Felipe also serves as the Director of Fundraising for Por1sorriso and while the NGO boasts up to 4,000 registered volunteers, the reality can be quite difference due to the cost of the undertaking.

Doing good: Felipe, pictured, has an NGO that provides dental work for residents of low-income communities

He recently told R7 news that each five-day mission in Brazil, which generally takes place in town halls, schools or theaters, will cost up to R $ 20,000 ($4,974).

Sponsorship generally comes from two private companies and, recently, from oral hygiene brand Colgate.

Individuals can also donate through the 'Smile Solidarity' program, choosing monthly amounts to donate and Por1sorriso hosts regular fund-raising events to keep up with the cost of continuing the free dental service around the country.

(The Federal Council of Dentistry estimates that about 20 million Brazilians have never been to the dentist.)

'There are costs that people have to bear and, with that, many people end up giving up on the action,' Felipe said of the volunteers.

On Instagram, Felipe routinely calls out how restricted access to dental care is.

He also admitted how Por1sorriso is 'struggling to survive' because of the expense of the dental work and the constant fundraising required.

After all, he said, the assistance that his 'social project' Por1sorriso provides is 'very different from projects where people simply get toothbrushes and toothpaste'.

Young again: A recent patient who Felipe treated in March looks generations younger thanks to her healthy smile

Change: Writing on Instagram of this woman, Felipe said, 'If we change the life of one person, everything will be worth it'

Smile factory: Felipe jokes that the NGO is like a smile factory; delivering makeovers to people all over Brazil

Communities: Felipe travels throughout Brazil and Africa to help people in neighborhoods who are unable to access dental care

Sharing a photo of a young woman who was given a dental makeover earlier this month, Felipe said 'I didn't do dentistry to take care of teeth, but to take care of people'.

'Awakening smiles, without business relationship, just for love, connects us with something bigger,' he said. 'One day, [a] smile will be for everyone and tears will fall with joy, just for being able to smile.'

The photo shows the woman in tears of happiness as she sees her new smile for the first time.

Of the transformations, Felipe also said: 'Our actions are worth more than words; building a better world is not done with syllables and verb conjugations. Doing is a transformative act.

Referring to Brazil he added: 'The country with the largest number of dentists in the world also has one of the biggest social inequalities and segregating dentistry.

'Millions don't know what sitting in a dental chair is like. It's time to wake up ... it's time to smile.'

So far, Felipe and the team have visited Africa nine times.

He jokes that Por1sorriso is something of a 'smile factory', delivering aesthetic makeovers with a deeper meaning everywhere the team goes.

Below are some of the most incredible and heartwarming transformations that Por1sorriso has provided in Africa and Brazil.

Small changes: Sometimes the work required is not as drastic as total restoration as patients might need just a clean or check up

A whole smile! One man was given a full set of new teeth, giving him a dramatic new appearance

Replacement: A woman looks over the moon with her new smile after being given replacement teeth by the team

Drastic: Some of the dental makeovers, such as this man's, are dramatic

Hygiene: Felipe lamented how disparate people's access to basic dental care is, which further propels him to continue providing services for free

Child: Patients of all ages from challenged socio-economic backgrounds have benefited from Por1sorriso's work

Help: Por1sorriso has provided dental work to people of all ages and all over the world, including this child in Africa"

Teenager delivers hundreds of solar lamps to Puerto Ricans living without power,http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/01/news/economy/puerto-rico-teen-solar-lamps-power/index.html,"More than four months after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, 15-year-old Salvador Gomez Colon is shocked by the poor living conditions that persist in many of the towns throughout the island.

""There is so much need,"" said Gomez Colon. ""People are still shoveling debris around their homes. With no power, the elderly are struggling with the heat.""

Nearly half a million of Puerto Rico's residents still don't have power. Families are living in houses with makeshift roofs made out of tarps and other materials and roads and bridges remain badly damaged.

""The farther you go from the metro areas is where you really see it,"" said Gomez Colon, who lives with his family in San Juan.

""It's very crazy to think that there are still people without power,"" he said on CNN on Saturday. ""Four months without power is an extremely traumatizing experience.""

Just days after Maria slammed Puerto Rico, the ninth grader launched a crowdfunding campaign on fundraising platform Generosity. His goal: to raise $100,000 and use the money to buy portable lamps and hand-operated washing machines for residents in the hardest hit parts of Puerto Rico.

Since that time, Gomez Colon has raised more than $125,000 and has donated 1,400 solar lamps to some 840 households. He has another 1,600 lamps that he hopes to distribute soon.

With the help of his family, friends and other volunteers, Gomez Colon started distributing the solar lamps last November through his initiative C+Feel = Hope.

""When we went to the first town that has no power, people from other towns would hear what we were doing. So we would add that town to our list for our next distribution,"" he said.

The teenager visits these communities on the weekends. He's seen schoolkids studying in the hot sun, rushing to finish their homework before the daylight disappears.

In one town, Gomez Colon met a young woman sitting outside reading Homer's Illiad. ""She told me she couldn't read at night because there's no light,"" he said.

So he handed her a portable solar lamp.

""I told her she didn't have to worry about rushing through the book in the heat,"" he said. ""For the first time in three months, she was going to be able to read it at night.""

CNNMoney first interviewed Gomez Colon in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria in September. At the time, he was hunkered down with his family in their San Juan apartment. The family was rationing the food and water they had stored before the storm hit. Still, the teenager knew he was better off than many others on the island.

With his mother's help, he sought a nonprofit organization to partner with and launched his online campaign.

As the money came in, Gomez Colon contacted makers of portable solar lamps and washing machines. To date, he's secured close to 300 hand-powered washing machines from companies like Gentlewasher and EasyGo and more than 3,000 lamps -- including some that have mobile phone charging capabilities -- from Mpowerd, Schneider Electric and Omnivoltaic Energy Solutions, among other companies.

Last week, he led the first distribution of the hand-operated washing machines to families in Naranjito, a town located in central Puerto Rico. ""Every weekend that we've gone for a distribution has made me feel so good,"" he said. ""But it's complicated. We are helping people, but there are just so many others also in need.""

According to the most recent tally from Puerto Rico's government, about 80% of the island has had power restored, 96% has access to running water and almost 98% now has telecom services.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was halting new shipments of food and water to the island as of Wednesday, an agency official with direct knowledge of the plan told CNN.

In a statement, the agency said that ""FEMA-provided commodities are no longer needed for emergency operations."" The agency also noted it has more than 46 million liters of water, two million Meals Ready to Eat and two million snack packs on the ground in Puerto Rico ready for distribution if needed.

Still, hundreds of thousands of residents remain in the dark, according to Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.

Loubriel Vega, 34, a fire inspector with the fire department in San Juan, is one of them. He lives with his three young children in Morovis, a town 38 miles outside of San Juan.

The family has running water, but has not had power, Internet or consistent cellphone service since September. Hurricane Maria also badly damaged the roof of his house.

Vega received two solar lamps through Gomez Colon's effort. He said the lamps have been immensely helpful for simple things like cooking and helping his kids and disabled family members move around the house at night.

""We need power badly,"" he said. ""Without it, how do we run our fridges and freezers and keep our food safe?""

Gomez Colon said he will keep going until either the money runs out or people no longer need the lamps and washing machines. People can still contribute to the campaign, he added.

""This experience has taught me to be grateful for what I have. My family supports me, my teachers support me,"" he said. ""The world can always benefit from a positive mission. So I have to take this to the end."""

Ginsburg had been taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore early on Tuesday ""after experiencing fever and chills,"" spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said.

New York City Reports No COVID Deaths in 24 Hours,https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/new-york-city-reports-no-covid-deaths-24-hours,"New York City, once the center of the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak, has had its first 24-hour period with no coronavirus deaths.

""This disease is far from beaten,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday, the first day without any reported COVID deaths since the first case was reported March 1.

“We look around the country and we see what so many other Americans are going through, so many other states and cities hurting so bad right now,” said de Blasio. “So, no one can celebrate, but we can at least take a moment to appreciate that every one of you did so much to get us to this point – 24 hours where no one died. Let's have many more days like that.""

De Blasio says he is particularly concerned about the growing number of people in their 20s contracting the coronavirus. He urged them to wear masks and social distance.

“I understand for so many younger adults, it has been a really difficult time — cooped up, disconnected, away from loved ones ... and I understand that people are just yearning to break out from that,” said de Blasio, who added that young people have to realize that everyone is vulnerable.

Also Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an emergency health order that requires visitors from states with high rates of COVID-19 to provide information about their in-state accommodations or face a penalty of up to $2,000, “If you fail to provide it, you will receive a summons with a $2000 fine. We’re serious about enforcing quarantine,” the governor tweeted.

NY is issuing an emergency health order:



Out-of-state travelers from designated high-COVID states must provide their contact information upon arrival.



If you fail to provide it, you will receive a summons with a $2K fine.



We’re serious about enforcing quarantine. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) July 13, 2020

Last week, he tweeted the 19 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.

One of them, Florida, reported its second-highest total number of cases for a single day, a day after setting the record for most new cases for a single day, 15,300. During the height of the New York outbreak, the worst day high was 12, 274 cases.

In California Governor Gavin Newsom Monday extended the closure of bars, restaurants, gyms, churches, and amusement centers from 19 counties to the entire state.

NEW: #COVID19 cases continue to spread at alarming rates.



CA is now closing indoor operations STATEWIDE for:



-Restaurants

-Wineries

-Movie theaters, family entertainment

-Zoos, museums

-Cardrooms



Bars must close ALL operations. — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) July 13, 2020

“The data suggests not everybody is practicing common sense,” Newsom said as the number of new cases began rising since some businesses began reopening in May.

In Maryland, three immigration courts reopened Monday in Baltimore while the U.S. Justice Department reported a backlog of more than 1 million cases.

No spectators or relatives were allowed in the courtroom, and everyone entering the buildings was required to wear a mask.

Courts in other cities began to hear cases in mid-June.

Immigration courts across the country suspended all non-deportation and non-detention-related hearings in March when the coronavirus outbreak began.

But some judges and lawyers have balked at returning to the courts, saying they don’t feel safe. They note that many immigration hearing rooms are small and wedged into federal office buildings instead of conventional courthouses with large rooms.

Canada’s largest province, Ontario, will continue to ease restrictions later this week.

Starting Friday, indoor gatherings will grow from a 10-person limit to 50 people. Outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people will be allowed as long as participants remain 2 meters apart. Gyms, movie theaters and restaurants will reopen.

But Toronto will be the exception and many closings and limits on gatherings in Canada’s largest city will stay in place for now.

A woman in Heilongjiang Province, China, spread COVID-19 to an estimated 71 people simply by riding in an elevator, according to a research letter published Monday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

According to the CDC, the 25-year-old woman returned to China from the U.S. in mid-March and was quarantined in her home. After others in her apartment building became sick, researchers tested the woman based on her travel and concluded she was an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier and had started the spread by infecting at least one of her neighbors in the elevator.

Researchers say this case shows how even a single case of the disease can result in ""widespread community transmission.""

Wearing face masks in supermarkets and stores in England will be mandatory starting next week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office announced Monday.

Face coverings are already required on buses and subways in London and other English cities. Other European countries, including Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain already require face coverings in stores.

A new study by Britain’s Academy of Medical Sciences says it is possible a second COVID wave this winter could kill as many as 120,000 people in U.K. hospitals if the medical facilities are not adequately prepared.

This is a “reasonable worst-case scenario” and stresses that this is just a possibility and not a forecast.

It urges the medical community to take “intense preparations” now, including a national information campaign and increased capacity for testing."

Trial vaccine wipes out breast cancer in Florida patient,https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/trial-vaccine-wipes-out-breast-cancer-in-florida-patient,"article

A Florida woman is the first patient to kill off breast cancer with the help of a promising new vaccine.

Lee Mercker, from the Jacksonville area, was diagnosed with a very early-stage form of breast cancer, in March, despite maintaining, she says, a healthy, active lifestyle.

""I was healthy,” she said. “That's why I was mad. I was stunned, and everyone around me was more mad and more stunned.""

Mercker said she went to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville to start treatment, but her doctor asked if she’d like to try something else first: An experimental vaccine that aims to fight off early-stage breast cancer and prevent future occurrence.

The simple set of shots sounded like a potential game-changer in the fight against the deadly disease.

""I signed up in like 10 seconds,” she said.

To the thrill of everyone involved, it worked.

""We saw some evidence of elimination of the tumor, as well as some evidence of the immune system crowding in,” said Dr. Keith Knutson, from the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville.

Knutson said Mercker’s results were, essentially, what their team had hoped the vaccine would do as it developed out, but it was happening in their very first human test subject.

RELATED: Blood test has potential to provide 5-years-early warning of breast cancer, researchers say

Mercker said she still underwent a double mastectomy to assure the breast cancer was out of her body completely, as the vaccine was just a trial.

Her removed breast tissue can now be studied for further results.

However, Mercker said it’s starting to hit her just how big of a breakthrough she may have helped discover.

""I feel like I walked on the moon,” she said. ""I worked in an industry with tons of women and I saw all kinds of stories, and it'd just be really nice to stamp this [breast cancer] out.""

Dr. Knutson said they have started trying the vaccine on two other patients, as well and are looking for more trial subjects.

The drug still has a long way to go, but Knutson said it’s promising and is helping show shades of a future that doctors have been working toward.

""Really, a vaccine against breast cancer and I think it's only a matter of time myself,” Dr. Knutson said.

The doctor said the Mayo Clinic is currently working on several vaccines aimed at preventing and beating cancer.

He even expects a trial to begin, possibly next year, on a vaccine that would aim to prevent breast cancer from forming in healthy patients, basically a sort of ""flu shot against breast cancer.""

"'I think he would be proud of me' : Viewers explain why they can't stop crying during the Mister Rogers movie trailer, and how he shaped their lives",http://www.tampabay.com/features/movies/Why-is-Mister-Rogers-making-adults-cry-decades-later-_168911762,"If people are crying this much watching fewer than three minutes of Won't You Be My Neighbor?, watch out for the waterworks when the full documentary opens Thursday with a block party at Tampa Theatre and in limited release around the United States.

Oscar-winning director Morgan Neville's film about Fred Rogers, beloved host of PBS kids show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood from 1968 to 2001, has picked up good reviews at festival screenings, but from the moment the first trailer went online in March, many who watched it did so through teary eyes.

The film covers Rogers' decades-long mission to make television a tool for helping children, stressing love, community and acceptance. He refused to talk down to kids when making episodes on divorce, death and even assassination in the wake of Robert Kennedy's death.

But why all the crying? It's not like we haven't had time to mourn the loss of the sweatered one, who died in 2003 at 74. Adults did take it hard at the time, though. Bonnie Smalley, 33, of Boulder, Colo., remembers it being her freshman year at West Chester University in Pennsylvania.

""When my dorm got notice that he died, we all gathered in the common area and put on old episodes someone had taped on VHS,"" she said. It was ""definitely a group therapy type deal.""

The sight of something from your childhood can make you emotional, but Rogers seems to cut deeper, and across a wide range of people. His show, produced in Pittsburgh, was viewed by a whopping 8 percent of U.S. households at its peak in 1985, according to Pittsburgh Magazine.

We tracked down people from around the country, including those

who commented on YouTube, Twitter or Reddit that the trailer made them cry. Fifteen years after Rogers' death, we asked what he meant

to them.

Dunn was in Army Ranger school, away from any phones or TVs, but the instructor came into the barracks and announced ""Mister Rogers died today."" Someone in the corner laughed, and started retelling the untrue urban legend that Rogers was a Marine sniper who'd had 50 kills. The rest of the barracks immediately shut the man down and fell completely silent in respect. He remembers a couple of guys going into the latrine and coming back with bloodshot eyes.

Fifteen years later, ""I cried when I watched the trailer,"" Dunn said. ""More people should."" For him, Rogers ""was a father figure in a home without one, a peaceful man in times that weren't so peaceful and someone who treated kids with respect, which sometimes was in short supply.""

Witecki is marketing and communications director for Tampa Theatre, one of a handful of theaters premiering the film this week.

""I've watched the trailer several times now, and get emotional every time. I've been trying to pinpoint why. Had you asked before I knew we were getting the movie, what I remembered about Mister Rogers, I would have mentioned the Land of Make Believe, the trolley, him putting on his sneakers. Watching it now I realize the lasting impact has nothing to do with those little details, and everything to do with growing up learning from that show to love yourself, love your neighbor, and learning that it's okay to be sad or angry and feel those emotions.

""I think maybe it just really hits me that, in today's climate of divisiveness, and now that I have a 2?½-year-old daughter, I wonder who is that Mister Rogers now. Who's the person today filling that role for children?""

The online community the Church of Rogers jokingly describes itself as ""followers of Rogerism who believe that Mister Rogers is a holy figure."" In reality, it's just a tongue-in-cheek name, but Poag said there's a grain of truth in it.

""I don't think there's a word in the English language for that feeling,"" he said, when asked why Rogers makes people cry. He theorized it has something to do with realizing you're an adult, but have failed to live the Neighborhood ideals. That you've somehow ""let your neighborhood down."" ""In Mister Rogers, we can see virtue, we can even feel it ... but we just can't seem to get there ourselves.""

THE STATE YOU'RE IN: Mister Rogers found his calling in Florida

Williams said her parents were mostly absent and abusive, and that Mister Rogers was a ""surrogate parent"" for her, ""as I'm sure he was with many others."" Her world was filled with chaos, but the world where Rogers came in every day and changed from his suit to a cardigan and sneakers provided a little stability.

""I promised myself if I ever had children of my own, I would parent them in a way where they would feel the same way Mister Rogers made me feel, safe and worthy and joyful. I did that. I have two beautiful children who are funny and awesome. I broke the cycle of generational abuse in no small part due to Mister Rogers. I genuinely feel if he were alive today he would be really proud of me for that.""

The high school English teacher who ""straight up sobbed"" during the trailer said she grew up in Louisiana exposed to bigotry, hatred and racism. Mister Rogers was ""revolutionary"" for her with his sensitivity, acceptance and songs like It's You I Like.

""I remember one thing that always blew my mind was that he never yelled. Men in my life were always yelling and so ... to me, Mister Rogers seemed like magic.""

Now in the classroom she chooses texts that will inspire empathy and guides her students to reflect on their feelings. ""Trying to teach kindness to kids is so radical and scary and infuriating and difficult, but Mister Rogers showed that it's possible ... and I think he would be proud of me.""

Long, author of 2015's Peaceful Neighbor: Discovering the Countercultural Mister Rogers, calls Rogers a ""radical"" for teaching pacifism while the United States was at war, using the show to break down gender norms and racial barriers, and for Rogers' vegetarianism on moral grounds.

Maybe the emotional reaction has something to with living in a time when things feel so chaotic, and technology spreads our attention thin. He said that watching Mister Rogers' Neighborhood while researching the book made him totally present in the moment.

""Rogers had a gift for slowing the clock, demanding us to be here and now, for quieting the noise of our everyday lives."" Rogers was an ordained Presbyterian minister, ""but in some ways, it seems as if Rogers sought to transform us into Zen Buddhist monks, present, quiet and peaceful.""

"The editor of an Alabama newspaper who recently urged the Ku Klux Klan to ""ride again"" has been replaced by an African-American woman",https://cnn.it/2BQiMDJ,"(CNN) An African-American woman is now the publisher and editor of the Alabama newspaper that recently urged the Ku Klux Klan to ""night ride again,"" the paper said.

Elecia R. Dexter, a ""strategic leader with expertise in human resources, operations and change management,"" took up the positions Thursday, the weekly Democrat-Reporter of Linden said in a press release.

Dexter replaces Goodloe Sutton, the newspaper's owner who penned a staggering editorial with the headline "" The Klan Needs to Ride Again "" in the paper's February 14 edition.

Sutton still owns the newspaper, Dexter told CNN.

Goodloe Sutton, former editor and publisher of The Democrat-Reporter, in an undated photo.

Dexter's family has ""strong roots and a rich history in Marengo County where her dad, John Dexter Jr. was born,"" the newspaper said.

Sutton's editorial sparked outrage around the country. ""Time for the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again,"" Sutton wrote. ""Democrats in the Republican Party and Democrats are plotting to raise taxes in Alabama.""

Sutton told the Montgomery Advertiser he urged the white supremacist group to ""clean out D.C."" via lynchings. ""We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them,"" Sutton told the newspaper.

He stressed that he wasn't calling for the hangings of all Americans, just the ""socialist-communists.""

""Seem like the Klan would be welcome to raid the gated communities up there,"" Sutton wrote in the editorial.

Beginning in the late 19th century, Klan members used night rides to terrorize blacks and their white allies with violence, including lynchings and firebombings.

When asked by the Advertiser if he recognized the Klan as a white supremacist group, Sutton compared it to the NAACP and said, ""The Klan wasn't violent until they needed to be.""

'Good riddance,' US senator tweets

US Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama, had called for Sutton to resign. On Friday, he applauded the change at the paper.

""Good riddance Goodloe,"" Jones said on Twitter . ""His dangerous views do not represent Alabama or the small-town papers in Alabama that do great work every day.

""The good people of Linden deserve so much better than these racist rants and I am confident they will get it with new editor, Elecia Dexter.""

Another Democratic lawmaker from Alabama who had called for Sutton's resignation, US Rep. Terri Sewell, tweeted late Friday that she wants him to take another step.

""Mr. Sutton has made a lot of poor decisions but stepping down is the right thing to do. Now, he must apologize,"" Sewell tweeted.

The school added that it ""strongly condemns Mr. Sutton's remarks as they are antithetical to all that we value as scholars of journalism, the media, and human communication.""

Auburn University's Journalism Advisory Council also stripped Sutton of its 2009 distinguished community journalism award following a Tuesday vote.

This is the editorial that ran in the Democrat-Reporter newspaper on February 14.

Newspaper has courted controversy before

Linden is a town of about 2,000 people in west-central Alabama. Sutton told USA Today in 2015 that The Democrat-Reporter's circulation, once more than 7,000, had fallen to about 3,000 subscribers.

The Klan piece isn't the first controversial editorial in the pages of the newspaper.

In October 2017, the paper published an editorial about the controversy over NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice.

""Some of the news programs are making a big to-do about black football players kneeling in the stadium,"" the editorial said. ""That's what black folks were taught to do two hundred years ago, kneel before a white man.""

A July 2016 editorial mocked President Barack Obama, calling him ""the Kenyan King,"" and complained about the ""way uncivilized tribes in Africa still run things.""

In April, the paper ran a political cartoon that ridiculed Palestinians.

'A new direction'

Dexter, who holds master's degrees in Human Services from the Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies and in Counseling from Argosy University, comes in at a ""pivotal time for the newspaper,"" the paper said. She will continue in the paper's journalistic tradition ""as well as moving the paper into a new direction."""

Long, who is white, drew attention this season for putting his arm around his black teammate Malcolm Jenkins, who raised his fist during the national anthem to protest discrimination and police brutality.

A member of the champion Patriots last season when they won the Super Bowl, Long was among several members of the team who chose to stay away from its White House visit with President Trump.

“Some people are tired of hearing me tweet because they want me to stick to football but I like to use social media like I was a regular guy because I think I am,” Long told NBC Sports Philadelphia in August. “I don’t tell people to stick to their job when they want to talk politics.”"
Husband saves wife's life by donating kidney after spending a year dieting and exercising to get his blood pressure low enough for surgery,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3027749/Husband-saves-wife-s-life-donating-kidney-spending-year-dieting-exercising-blood-pressure-low-surgery.html,"A man has spent a year losing 70lbs so he could donate his kidney to his wife.

PJ Spraggins was delighted when he discovered he was a perfect match for wife Tracy, who was told her life-long battle with Lupus would kill her if she didn't get a transplant. The waiting list is seven years long.

But the next day the couple from Birmingham, Alabama, were dealt a blow: his blood pressure was too high to perform the operation.

Refusing to accept the diagnosis, PJ embarked on a relentless fitness regime.

Finally, in December 2014, they got the green light. In February, they went under the knife together.

Transformation: PJ and Tracy Spraggins (pictured, left, in 2006, and right in 2015) together lost 145lbs in one year so he could donate his kidney to her. On the transplant list, she would have had to wait seven years

Made it! After a year of grueling dieting and exercise, PJ was given the green light to undergo surgery

'We both just feel amazing. I'm slowly getting back to work making music, Tracy is making sure she fully recovers. But the entire process has been amazing.'

Now 39, Tracy was six when she was first diagnosed with the chronic inflammatory disease which affects her kidney functions.

She was placed on the transplant list in 2013 - just a few months after her 34-year-old sister, who also had Lupus, died following complications from a kidney transplant.

Knowing that the seven-year wait might be too long, PJ, a self-employed musician, submitted himself for the weeks-long evaluation to assess whether he could donate his kidney.

Journey: For a year, he kept losing weight and going in for tests, only to be told he needed to lose more

Finally, he visited Nashville's Vanderbilt hospital in December 2014, and the numbers all matched up

However, the good news was tinged with disappointment as doctors said his size meant the operation couldn't go ahead.

'They said I was a perfect match but they wanted to check I was healthy and met their requirements. They sent me a blood pressure monitor, but they didn't like the numbers.

'That was a real kick in the gut.'

The doctors advised PJ, who weighed 265lbs, to lose 30lbs before returning for an evaluation.

He did - but on the day of the test he changed a flat tire.

'My blood pressure was all over the place. The results came back and they said no again.'

It didn't stop there.

Next try was a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was told to another 60lbs.

Eventually, they made it to Nashville's Vanderbilt Hospital in December 2014. PJ made sure he did everything he could to ensure the readings were perfect.

'I put that blood pressure monitor on and lay in bed all day. And thankfully, it all came back good!'

Undergoing the four-hour surgery together on February 24, the couple took a beaming photograph in matching hospital gowns.

Life saver: Special needs teacher Tracy, 39, has suffered from Lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease, since she was six. In 2013, doctors in Birmingham, Alabama, said she would need a kidney transplant to survive

Happy: Spraggins (pictured in hospital) described the feeling of dejection at every hurdle until they made it

Perfect match: The chances of being a perfect match for one's spouse is rare

The couple, who married in 2003, are now back home and recovering in Birmingham

GIft! This was the festive Easter gift given to Tracy and PJ by Vanderbilt hospital

'The way my kidney function is now, it's at 100 percent. And it's at the best it's ever been,' Tracy, a special needs teacher, told Fox.

PJ told DailyMail.com: 'It has just been amazing. To know that I did everything I could to give my wife a better quality of life is just the best feeling. I am so happy.'

The couple's friends have now set up a fund to financially support them during the two-month recovery period when they will be unable to work."

The six months were difficult for their couple, who have been dating for over three years. Hayward described his condition as “being in jail” in his own head.

“I could see everything that was going on — I could communicate, but the world couldn’t communicate back with me.”

The couple quickly learned as much American Sign Language (ASL) as possible so that they could communicate.

“He would place the ‘I love you’ sign on my leg or on my back, and that’s when I knew I could go to sleep,” Hayward recalled."
He spent 27 years wrongly convicted of murder. He wants to spend the rest encouraging inmates to read,http://cnn.com/2018/09/08/health/john-bunn-exonerated-literacy-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The first book John Bunn fell in love with, curled up in his cell at a maximum-security prison in upstate New York, was Sister Souljah's novel ""The Coldest Winter Ever.""

In the book, a maternal woman advocates for the improvement of her black community in Brooklyn as she watches the people she loves suffer from the consequences of incarceration, violence and a seemingly endless cycle of poverty.

""I related to that book on so many levels,"" Bunn says.

John Bunn outside the Kingsborough Projects in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where Robert Crosson and Rolando Neischer were carjacked and shot in August of 1991.

Bunn knows more than most what it's like to face injustice. Arrested and imprisoned as an adolescent in New York City, he spent 17 years in jail for a crime he didn't commit and a further decade on parole, fighting for his exoneration. In that time, he battled, among others, the courts, police investigators, PTSD and the challenges of illiteracy. He was 16 before he could read and write.

Today Bunn is 41 and a free man at last, mentoring at-risk young people and advocating for the power of reading through his own program that brings books to prisons.

In many ways, his own story sounds straight out of a Sister Souljah book. Except that Bunn, who survived years of wrongful incarceration with his humanity intact, is determined to write the next chapter himself.

The arrest

Bunn's ordeal began on August 14, 1991, when he was sitting in the kitchen of his mother's apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

It was 90 degrees in the shade and the AC was broken. Outside he could hear hip-hop music playing from passing cars and the thwack of basketballs on pavement as kids made their way to the courts. Bunn's mother, Maureen, was making pancakes, his two-year-old sister, India, cooing in her high chair.

Bunn, 14 years old and out of school for the summer, was ready for a typical day of playing ball and demonstrating his famous back flips in and around the four-block radius between the apartment on Ralph Street (his mom) and the house on St Marks (his grandma). Those four blocks, snug between the love of the two women who raised him, were his whole world.

But then, a bang on the door. It was the police.

""They wanted to take me down to the police station for questioning,"" Bunn recalls now, sitting in that same small apartment festooned with family photos, nearly three decades later.

He was taken to Brooklyn's 77th precinct, put in a room and handcuffed to a pole.

""The interrogation was led by a detective by the name of Louis Scarcella. And he was threatening me, telling me that I was never coming home if I wouldn't tell him what he wanted to know. He also told me that they already had beat up my co-defendant, that they had slammed his head into a wall and they already had him,"" he recalls.

The co-defendant? A 17-year-old Brooklyn boy named Rosean Hargrave. Bunn knew Hargrave ""from the block,"" although he and the older boy were never more than acquaintances. But, as he soon found out, they were both now suspected of the same crime: The killing of an off-duty Rikers Island corrections officer named Rolando Neischer.

""I kept telling them, ""No, I didn't have any knowledge of it,"" Bunn recalls.

But Detective Scarcella, who worked in the Brooklyn North homicide unit for years before retiring in 1999, told the young John he did not believe him.

Bunn's eyes fill with tears as he describes the moment he was placed in a police lineup with ""grown men."" As an adult, Bunn, a slight man with a gentle disposition and a shy smile, stands only 5 feet 6 inches. At 14, he estimates he was no taller than 5-foot-2. He was so much smaller than the adults he was lined up with that the detectives had to improvise.

They brought in stools so the lineup could be done sitting down. Bunn did what he was told. He sat down and held up a number.

A couple of minutes later, Scarcella came back into the room.

""He told me, 'It was my lucky day,' that I got picked,"" Bunn says, grimacing.

""Ever since then, I've been fighting to prove my innocence,"" he says, wiping his face and adjusting his hat.

On the front of his baseball cap, in bold white letters, are the words, ""WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. On the side, ""VICTIMS OF DETECTIVE LOUIS SCARCELLA.""

The hat, he adds, ""speaks for itself.""

The night of the killing

The day before Bunn was arrested, two off-duty Rikers Island correction officers and old friends, Rolando Neischer and Robert Crosson, were sitting in a car, chatting outside the Kingsborough projects, a housing project in Crown Heights. It was about 4 a.m.

Suddenly, two men on bicycles approached the car, pointed guns and ordered the pair out of their vehicle. Crosson later described at trial how a gun then ""went off,"" the bullet ripping through his hand. He managed to get out of the car and sprinted away, losing track of his friend.

At some point, Neischer had grabbed his own firearm and fought back.

In the ensuing gunfight, before the attackers jumped in the car and drove away, Neischer was shot five times. He was found slumped against a fence, bleeding, but still alive, 192 feet from where the car had been parked.

The next day, they came for John Bunn, with Crosson identifying both him and Hargrave in police lineups. Three days after that, Neischer died from his wounds.

On the night Neischer and Crosson were carjacked, Bunn had no inkling of what was to come. But his mother heard a portent.

At about 4:30 a.m., Maureen Bunn awoke from a deep sleep to the sound of gunshots. They sounded like they were coming from the backyard of her housing complex, near Kingsborough.

""I thought, oh my god, I hope everybody's ok,"" she says, recalling the incident 27 years later.

Instinctively, she padded to her children's room, peering into the dark to check on them. Minutes after the bullets that killed Neischer tracked their fatal course through the soupy August air that night, Maureen noted with relief that her kids were safe.

John lay sound asleep in his bunk.

The trial

On August 17, Bunn was formally charged with robbery and murder. He was sent to the notorious Spofford Juvenile Detention Center in the Bronx, a vermin-infested concrete building that was shut down in 2011 after allegations of violence and abuse. There, he waited for 16 months.

Spofford was ""one of the most violent places I ever experienced,"" Bunn says. ""The staff members were very abusive. It was like gladiator school. You had to fight maybe three or four times a day.""

What's more, there was ""a target"" on his back because he had been charged with killing a corrections officer. The months rolled by as he waited for trial. His 15th birthday came and went. An increasingly depressed and scared Bunn didn't tell anyone about it.

A 2005 photo of the Bridges Juvenile Center, where John Bunn spent nearly a year and a half awaiting trial.

""Things like birthdays stopped existing to me,"" he says. ""Time stopped in there.""

Still, Bunn and his mother believed the trial would show he was not Neischer's killer. Among other factors, Crosson, the sole witness to the crime, had described the carjackers as being light-skinned men in their 20s's. John was darker skinned and a short, slight-framed teenager.

Bunn and Hargrave's trial took place in November of 1992, on Thanksgiving eve. Detective Scarcella had testified in pre-trial hearings, but on the day of the trial itself, just four people took the stand: the first police officer to arrive at the scene, the medical examiner, a 77th precinct detective, and Crosson, the sole primary witness who had picked both boys out of lineups.

The trial lasted just one day. Bunn and Hargrave were both found guilty.

""The truth didn't prevail, it didn't come out ... My side of the story never came out, either. I never got a chance to have a voice. I never got a chance to say anything,"" Bunn says.

Bunn was sentenced to 20 years to life, though it was later reduced to nine years to life after lawyers successfully argued that he had been illegally charged as an adult. Hargrave received a sentence of 30 years to life.

When, Maureen Bunn heard the word ""life"" she had to be rushed to the hospital.

""They said I had a mild heart attack. I couldn't breathe. I don't even remember when the ambulance came. I went into another world. It was just disbelief,"" she says.

Both Bunn and Hargrave filed appeals which were denied.

Imprisonment

After being found guilty. Bunn was immediately taken to a youth facility upstate. Maureen visited as much as she could, spending all her money on long bus rides upstate as the household bills and eviction notices stacked up.

But John was isolated physically -- and mentally. For a long time, he had hidden a secret. He had never learned to read or write.

""I was further away from my family. I wanted to communicate with my mother, because I felt like me and her didn't have the best relationship. And I was out there, and I just wanted to tell her how I felt, and that motivated me,"" he says.

Determined to be able to write letters to his mom, Bunn started with dictionaries and children's books, working with teachers on how to sound words out, letter by letter. It was humbling at first, but he learned fast. And as he got the hang of it, he says, ""it did something for my self-esteem, and my imagination.""

By the time he was 17 Bunn had his GED, and was reading anything he could get his hands on from the prison library. But turning 17 also marked a more sobering milestone: He would soon be eligible to be transferred to an adult facility.

Photos of John Bunn during his time in jail line the walls at the home of his mother, Maureen.

""I got my GED and I graduated to state prison,"" says Bunn, adding that he remembers the bus journey to the adult facility as ""one of the scariest feelings I ever experienced.""

""You hear all of the stories about how people get raped, and there's knives, and there's razors. But all along that bus ride, I went from being fearful and intimidated, to suddenly me becoming aggressive, because I felt like I had to be aggressive in order for them not to take advantage of me,"" he says.

Bunn noticed that, increasingly, he was finding his anger hard to control.

""I became institutionalized to the point where I start letting that experience make me angry. I started being bitter in there and started getting into violent situations.""

The Elmira Correctional Facility in Elmira, New York, where John did much of his reading.

Through it all, one thing kept him level-headed. To those in the prison, he may have been John Bunn, inmate number 7129748Q, Brooklyn boy, corrections officer killer. But, with a book in his hand, lying in his bunk on G block at Elmira Correctional Facility, an imposing Victorian building that sits high on a hill in upstate New York, Bunn felt free.

In the daytime, he began taking anger management classes, passing them with such flying colors that he became a qualified anger management counselor himself, running his own program for inmates.

At night, he would return to his cell where he would read slowly so he had ""something to look forward to,"" savoring each word amidst the familiar soundtrack of the prison at night -- the hum of 50 radios all softly playing different stations, the monologues of top-dog inmates holding court for 10 minutes at a time as others kept a respectful silence, and the ever-present clang of the gates that slammed and opened, slammed and opened, signaling the night and heralding the morning.

""I wrote my mother one day ... and I said, ""They can lock my body, but they can't trap my mind,"" Bunn says.

""The power of reading made me feel that way. I felt trapped without a voice for so long, but the power of reading could take my imagination, and take me to anywhere in this universe.""

In 2006, Bunn saved a prison counselor from being violently assaulted and raped by another inmate. His heroic actions were a factor in the parole board's decision to release him that year.

Bunn walked out of Elmira, wearing a shirt, shorts and a pair of Timberland boots bought for him by his family, and with his $40 of ""gate money,"" earned from his $7.50 a week prison salary, in his pocket.

""When I got in the lobby, my brother and cousin were there. Once I got to them I felt safe,"" he says. ""It was the first time I felt like I was safe again in 17 years.""

Exoneration

But out on parole, Bunn struggled. With his criminal record as a convicted murderer, he couldn't get a job. He was diagnosed with PTSD and was granted social security and disability.

Then, in 2008, after struggling with depression, he failed to report for a parole meeting and was sent back to jail. He returned to prison for another year and released in 2009.

""I wasn't able to adjust after being alone and gone for so long,"" he says.

Bunn's prison identification card.

But Bunn was about to get some long-awaited good news. In 2010, the Exoneration Initiative, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal assistance to the wrongfully convicted in New York, began looking into Bunn's and Hargrave's convictions (Hargrave had not been granted parole and remained behind bars).

And on top of that, many of Detective Sarcella's convictions from the 80's and 90's were beginning to crumble, one by one.

In April 2014 came a breakthrough. A new motion was filed by Rosean Hargrave's legal team to vacate the charges.

""The pattern and practice of Scarcella's conduct which manifest a disregard for rules, law and the truth undermines our judicial system and gives cause for a new review of the evidence,"" declared the judge in the case, Justice ShawnDya Simpson.

Judge Simpson overturned Rosean Hargrave's convictions and ordered a new trial. After 24 years in prison, Hargrave was released on bond, pending retrial.

A year later, after a similar motion was filed on John Bunn's behalf by the Exoneration Initiative, his own day in court came. In her ruling, Judge Simpson called the evidence used to convict Bunn ""paltry"" and slammed what she called Scarcella's ""disregard for rules, law and truth.""

In May of 2018, after 27 years of wrongful conviction, the District Attorney's office announced they would not retry Rosean Hargrave or John Bunn. They became the 12th and 13th men to be exonerated of convictions related to investigations by Detective Louis Scarcella.

After Judge Simpson announced he was a free man, Bunn addressed the courtroom.

""I am an innocent man, Your Honor, and I have always been an innocent man,"" he said, tears streaming down his face, as his mother, Maureen, audibly gulped back sobs.

John Bunn holds hands with Judge ShawnDya Simpson at the hearing where he was exonerated after 27 years.

To date, 70 of Detective Scarcella's cases from the 80's and 90's have been flagged for review. And at least 14 of Scarcella's homicide convictions have been overturned because of tainted evidence, misleading testimony or forced confessions, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney's office.

But it's unlikely that Scarcella will face any consequences. He has never been charged with a crime. According to the DA, prosecutors have not found any laws that can be prosecuted today. The statute of limitations has expired for any potential criminal offenses.

CNN's attempts to reach Detective Scarcella were not successful, but he told the Daily News in 2018 that he had done ""absolutely nothing wrong.""

Scarcella remains in New York City, living on Staten Island. He still collects a full NYPD pension.

A new chapter

There's a palpable sense of excitement in the classroom at Ember Charter School in Brooklyn, where 25 third-graders await that morning's class speaker. When John Bunn walks into the room, after a rousing chorus of ""GOOD MORNING JOHN BUNN,"" the class tumbles around him, lining up for hugs and high fives.

It's his second visit. He says the kids were so great the first time and had such smart questions that he had promised them he would come back. This time he's bearing presents -- tiny T-shirts in an array of colors, each with a logo that spells out the name of his new non-profit organization, ""A Voice 4 The Unheard.""

Bunn's project began as a book drive aimed at refurbishing the libraries at Rikers Island and providing under-resourced communities with educational literature. So far, he's donated over 20,000 books to help others affected by illiteracy and incarceration.

John Bunn leads a class at Ember Charter School in Brooklyn.

""Reading changed my life,"" Bunn says. ""I want to share that experience with other people.""

Along with starting a library on Rikers, he also works at the prison twice a week, running group sessions with 16- and 17-year-olds. He's also starting a book club for the teens and leading group discussions. More than anything, Bunn doesn't want the young boys he mentors to give up and become institutionalized.

""I explain to them, 'Anything is possible. Feel like you're too good to be in here!'"" he says.

Back at Ember Charter School, Bunn is leading a class discussion.

""Who here can tell me what peer pressure is?"" Bunn asks the class, as a staccato wave of small hands shoots into the air.

He guides the children through a question-and-answer session, then doles out a bunch of shirts in pink, yellow and black. The kids swarm Bunn when the session is over.

""Let's get a group hug, y'all,"" he says as the kids clamber on chairs to get closer to him. Bunn's eyes fill with tears.

""There's no greater feeling than me feeling like I'm existing for a purpose, and this is what gives my life purpose right now,"" he says.

""Through my nightmare ... I found my dream."""
"Israeli scientists develop implanted organs that won’t be rejected - Breakthrough development uses a patient's own stomach cells, cutting the risk of an immune response to implanted organs.",https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-scientists-develop-implanted-organs-made-from-patients-own-cells/,"Israeli researchers report that they have invented the first fully personalized tissue implant, engineered from a patient’s own materials and cells. The new technology makes it possible to engineer any kind of tissue implant, for the spinal cord, to the heart, or brain, from one small fatty tissue biopsy.

“We were able to create a personalized hydrogel from the materials of the biopsy, to differentiate fatty tissue cells into different cell types and to engineer cardiac, spinal cord, cortical and other tissue implants to treat different diseases,” said lead researcher Prof. Tal Dvir of Tel Aviv University’s Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and Sagol Center for Regenerative Biotechnology.

“Since both the cells and the material used derive from the patient, the implant does not provoke an immune response, ensuring proper regeneration of the defected organ,” Dvir explained.

The research was conducted by Dvir’s postdoctoral researcher, Reuven Edri, and doctoral students Nadav Noor and Idan Gal, in collaboration with Prof. Dan Peer and Prof. Irit Gat Viks of TAU’s Department of Cell Research and Immunology and Prof. Lior Heller of Assaf HaRofeh Medical Center in Israel. It was recently published in the journal Advanced Materials.

Avoiding anti-rejection drugs

Currently, in tissue engineering for regenerative medicine, cells are isolated from the patient and cultured in biomaterials to assemble into a functional tissue. These biomaterials can be synthetic or natural, derived from plants or animals.

After transplantation, they may induce an immune response that leads to rejection of the implanted tissue. Patients receiving engineered tissues or any other implants are treated with immuno-suppressors, which unfortunately can endanger the health of the patient.

The new method solves that problem.

“With our technology, we can engineer any tissue type, and after transplantation we can efficiently regenerate any diseased or injured organ — a heart after a heart attack, a brain after trauma or with Parkinson’s disease, a spinal cord after injury,” said Dvir.

“In addition, we can engineer adipogenic [fatty tissue] implants for reconstructive surgeries or cosmetics. These implants will not be rejected by the body.”

The researchers extracted a small biopsy of fatty tissue from patients, then separated its cellular and a-cellular materials. While the cells were reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells — able to make cells from all three basic body layers, so they can potentially produce any cell or tissue the body needs to repair itself — the extracellular material was processed to become a personalized hydrogel.

After combining the resulting stem cells and the hydrogel, the scientists successfully engineered the personalized tissue samples and tested the patients’ immune responses to them.

The researchers are currently engaged in regenerating an injured spinal cord and an infarcted heart with spinal-cord and cardiac implants. They have also begun to investigate the potential of human dopaminergic implants to treat Parkinson’s disease in animal models.

The researchers plan to regenerate other organs, including intestines and eyes, using the patients’ own materials and cells.

“We believe that the technology of engineering fully personalized tissue implants of any type will allow us to regenerate any organ with a minimal risk of immune response,” Dvir said."

"Utah Woman Donates Over 1,200 Handmade Toys to Migrant Children Separated From Parents",https://www.insideedition.com/utah-woman-donates-over-1200-handmade-toys-migrant-children-separated-parents-45260,"When Sarah Parson’s friend told her about the children caught in the middle of the refugee crisis in Greece in 2015, she knew she had to do something to help.

""She had mentioned that the kids in the camps had no toys to play with, so they were playing with garbage and scorpions,"" said Parson, 42. “Just anything that they could find.”

With five kids of her own, she knew all too well how much toys meant to her children.

“They just love their stuffed animals,” she said. “They have so many of them. They carry them around everywhere.”

Parson said she had a sudden realization while watching her kids play with their toys that she could make handmade dolls and bears for children in need. Having previously made dolls for her girls, she knew she could make more.

From there, Dolls of Hope was born. Just two years later, she has sent more than 10,000 stuffed toys to children in 23 countries.

""There’s just something really special about making something for someone knowing it’s going to give them comfort,"" said Parson. ""And you put your heart into it and I really feel like the kids can feel that.""

In her most recent shipment, she sent more than 1,200 toys to migrant children separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border and placed in foster care.

The dolls were included in a bag full of gifts provided by Comfort Cases, with the goal of helping ease the transition for children entering foster care.

Parson lives with her children and husband in Cedar Hills, Utah, but she said the stories from the border hit close to home.

“I look at my own kids and I think, ‘How would my kids handle that if they were suddenly taken away from me?’” she said.

Parson hopes her dolls make the kids feel like kids again.

""My hope is we are giving a little piece of their childhood back,"" said Parson. ""That they can find comfort in that stuffed animal, or that doll. And that they can love that doll and hug that doll, even though they can’t hug their parents.""

Parson said she made the doll patterns simple so that anyone, even children, could get involved. Each and every doll is unique, “just like the kids who get them,” she said.

Parson thinks no problem is too big to run away from, and even the smallest efforts can lead to a big change.

“While it may seem overwhelming or we think the problem is too big, we could never solve the problem,” said Parson. “We can’t let that immobilize us to doing nothing because that doesn’t help. So we have to start where we are, doing what we can.”

Parson said she isn’t quitting anytime soon. “Too many children need us,” she said.

Wendall Gill's smiling face has greeted customers for decades at the Richmond Road McDonald's.

""Hi, How are you?"" he asked one customer Wednesday. It's a greeting he has said thousands of times at the restaurant.

Gill usually brings life to customers' faces, but two months ago, tragedy struck while at work when his wife Della decided to visit him for lunch. It would be their last meal together, as she went to the bathroom and never came out, dying of an aneurysm.

""When he walked up I could tell he was just destroyed, and he said ""I lost my wife,"" Todd Oldfield said.

""He had a lot of expenses that he was dealing with, especially being that he can't work full-time now because he's got his two sweet boys to take care of,"" Oldfield said, ""I wanted to pay off his van so he'd be able to drive his boys around.""

In 10 days the fundraiser collected $68,000. The money will go toward paying off Wendall's vehicles and other outstanding debt.

A Canadian who teaches at a school in a fly-in-only village in the Arctic has won a $1m (£800,000) Global Teacher Prize at a ceremony in Dubai.

Maggie MacDonnell, praised for “changing the lives of her students and transforming her community”, was among 10 finalists chosen from 20,000 nominations and applications from 179 countries.

She has taught for the past six years in the Inuit village of Salluit, Québec, in the Canadian Arctic, which has a high rate of suicide, according to her biography provided by the award organisers.

MacDonnell said she has witnessed over 10 suicides. “As a teacher, when I come to school the morning after there is an empty desk in that classroom. There is stillness and silence,” she said. “Thank you for bringing global attention to them,” she added.

MacDonnell has created a life-skills programme specifically for girls in a region where teenage pregnancies are common, alongside high levels of sexual abuse, according to her biography. Many teachers leave their posts midway through the academic year due to stress and the harsh conditions endured by the indigenous community.

The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, congratulated MacDonnell in a video message. “We are all proud of you,” he said.

MacDonnell, who has also been a temporary foster parent in the Inuit community, was handed the award at a ceremony on Sunday that opened with a performance by the Italian tenor Andrea Boccelli.

The Nobel-style award was set up three years ago by the Dubai-based Varkey Foundation. The prize is paid in instalments and requires the winner to remain a teacher for at least five years.

Last year a Palestinian teacher, Hanan al-Hroub, won the prestigious prize for her innovative approach of using play to counter violent behaviour among her students in the West Bank.

• In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14."
Pearl Jam raises millions to help Seattle’s homeless; local businesses join forces with iconic band,https://q13fox.com/2018/08/08/pearl-jam-raises-millions-for-homeless-crisis-and-many-area-businesses-joining-forces-with-iconic-band/,"



SEATTLE -- Thousands of people rushed Safeco Field on Wednesday to see Pearl Jam, with many of them camping out overnight to get the best view.



Others also waited as long as 3 hours to buy merchandise. The loyalty was in full display and now that loyalty could help make a dent in the region’s homeless crisis.



“They say something to you, you just follow suit,” fan David Morrison said.



Morrison traveled all the way from Australia to be a part of the two-day concert series called ""The Home Shows."" What he and others spent to be at the concert will help to fight our region`s homeless crisis.



“It’s awesome that they are doing that. Of course it’s cool,” fan Matt Ellis said.



The iconic members of Pearl Jam on their website say that the region's homeless population is the third largest in the country and it's not a number not to be proud of.



So now they are stepping in to help their hometown in a big way, giving some direction to a city struggling to put a dent in the crisis.



“People want to help but we often don't know what to do -- this is something that gives us traction,” Caffe Ladro owner Jack Kelly said.



Caffé Ladro is one of 140 businesses who are donating 10% or more from sales to the homeless problem.



Customers say it feels good to be a part of the solution.



“It becomes more deep-rooted when you're a parent, you want to know what the future is going to hold,” Krista Drumhiller said.



Drumhiller plans to spend her dollars at the businesses helping out.



That includes companies like Trophy Cupcakes, which has already sold hundreds of cupcakes decorated with Pearl Jam’s logo.



“Seven hundred so far, as of last night. We are hoping to do at least that many over the next couple of days,” Christina Logman said.



It’s a unified approach the city of Seattle doesn’t see every day.



“I think it's really unique, I don't think you see a lot of that, you see it somewhat on a small scale but this is on a massive scale,” one fan said.



Matt Hill took in the scene outside Safeco Field on Wednesday, selling the Real Change newspaper. He says he's moved by the community’s cooperation with Pearl Jam. Hill used to be homeless.



“I came to Seattle hoping to change that, and two years ago I was actually able to own my own place,” Hill said.



He says Pearl Jam's efforts will hopefully get more people into housing.



The Seattle Times reported that Pearl Jam has already raised more than $11 million as of Wednesday.



The second concert is set for Friday.



Pearl Jam is not only raising money but encouraging fans to volunteer their time. On their website they have listed organizations and events where fans can give their time, including an event on Thursday when there is a break between the two concerts.

Abusers and human traffickers will often force victims to get tattoos as a way to exert control. A Wisconsin woman is giving survivors a fresh start by removing them for free.,http://wqow.com/community/positively-chippewa-valley/2019/04/23/western-wisconsin-woman-removes-tattoos-forced-on-victims-of-violence-for-free/,"Onalaska (WQOW/WXOW) – A Wisconsin woman has found her life’s work in helping survivors of abuse erase scars that harbor painful memories.

For survivors of abuse, the emotional scars can last a lifetime. But for some, they’ve got physical scars in the form of tattoos, forced on them as a way to exert control. An Onalaska woman has found her purpose using high-tech machinery from her day job to help victims of violence, domestic abuse, and human trafficking get a fresh start.

Perfecting skin is all in a day’s work for Stephanie Andresen-Stephens. She owns Brilliant Body Works in Onalaska.

Now she can add tattoo removal to her resume. “When someone like myself chooses to go get a tattoo, we spend time and dedication going and designing it and telling our story… we’re doing it of our own free will.” Others are not. Human traffickers often tag their workers, gangs mark their members, and abusers can claim their victims, all through tattoos. “Often times people feel forced into it or it is very much forced upon them.”

That’s why she started Restorative Ink, a nonprofit removing the scars that harbor painful reminders of a previous life. She helped a woman named Tara erase the mark put on her body by an abusive ex-boyfriend.

Tara said it took about three hours to get the tattoo her boyfriend wanted on her. To take it off, it’ll be 6-12 sessions, and it feels like hot grease splattering all over the skin. But if you ask Tara, she’ll tell you the pain to remove the ink is nothing compared to what she endured at the hands of her abuser.

“The fear takes over you. You’re afraid to talk to people, to tell them what’s going on and you’re afraid you’re never going to get out of that situation,” said Tara.

Stephanie has found her calling erasing painful memories for people looking for a second chance. So far, she’s removed more than two dozen tattoos, and now people in prison are reaching out to her for help.

“One letter I got this gentleman is describing how he has three young children at home, and how he wants to be a better role model for them, and how his ex-gang symbols are going to keep him from getting a reputable job,” Stephanie said.

For Tara, the removal process has just begun, but already each painful stroke brings a glimmer of hope. “It will be amazing to not have that constant reminder of that time in my life where I went through some of the worst things I could possibly imagine.”

Tara said she has to thank Stephanie for her hard work to remove the painful reminder. Now she wants to begin the process of shifting her mindset from victim to survivor. “I’m so thankful to have the opportunity to be able to take my power back. He kind of took power away from me, in the time that we were together in the things that he did to me,” said Tara. “He broke me down… and Stephanie doing this for me is going to build me back up again.”

If you or someone you know is in need of tattoo removal from any of the scenarios above, you can contact Restorative Ink, operating out of Brilliant Bodywork in Onalaska. The phone number is (608) 783-8380."
Covid-19 victim who gave birth while on ventilator beats the virus,https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/26/covid-19-victim-gave-birth-ventilator-beats-virus-12612573/,"Megan Sites gave birth to her son, Jameson, while critically ill with coronavirus. (Picture: UC Health/Fox19)

A mother who gave birth while battling Covid-19 on a ventilator has beaten the virus.

Megan Sites, 27, underwent an emergency cesarean section to deliver her son at 29 weeks and six days this month as she battled the deadly virus on a ‘near-last resort’ ventilating machine that replaces the heart and lungs of a patient.

She was seven months pregnant with her second child when she took herself to Joint Township’s emergency department in Ohio on April 1 after she was having difficulty breathing and was unable to lie flat.

Testing uncovered that her lungs had been clotted with coronavirus and she was put on a ventilator while she was still awake. She said she could feel the tube scrape into her trachea as it was inserted. She was later sent to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. It is unclear how far along she was in her pregnancy when she tested positive for the virus.

Sites’s condition briefly improved, so the breathing machine was removed – but her condition then took a turn for the worse.

‘Within 24 hours, 48 hours, my condition completely worsened,’ she told the Columbus Dispatch.

Sorry, this video isn't available any more.

Sites said she was unable to see her husband Donny, her parents, in-laws, or friends because of hospital restrictions due to the outbreak.

‘I had a few breakdown moments. I told myself, “This is it, I’m not going to make it thorough,”‘ she said.

‘Everything in my body, it hurt to breathe, to move, to cough, to anything, it hurt.’

She asked hospital staff if she could go back on the ventilator, but this time she wanted to be sedated.

On April 8, doctors told Megan’s husband that the ventilator could help her get her pregnancy to 30 weeks. However, 20 minutes later he received a devastating call back from doctors that his wife’s lung had collapsed.

To save her, doctors said they had to deliver the baby the next day.

Sites had to undergo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a ‘near-last resort’ device that temporarily replaces the heart and lungs of patients, according to Dr Suzanne Bennett, a UC Health critical care anesthesiologist.

UC Health had reportedly never put a pregnant woman on an ECMO machine, but Sites was a good candidate.

Sites was then flown with the ECMO machine in a helicopter to Miami Valley Hospital where she underwent a cesarean section to deliver her son at 29 weeks and six days.

The baby was then taken to a neonatal intensive care unit. When she woke up she had no recollection of the delivery because of the sedation, she said.

‘I have a lot of hallucinations from that time…but the actual ECMO treatment, I don’t recall any of that,’ she said.

She now credits her medical team and the ECMO treatment for saving her life after she said her husband was told she had less than a 40% chance at survival.

‘It’s a miracle that I’m sitting here talking to you now,’ she said.

After ten days, Sites was finally able to see her baby, named Jameson, who is still in the NICU, although doctors said he is healthy with no signs of coronavirus.

He should be able to come home in four to five weeks.

‘There’s no words. There’s no way to show them the appreciation they deserve. It’s surreal,’ she said of her medical team.

"Davenport man beats COVID-19 after 99 days in hospital, family says",https://www.kwqc.com/2020/10/13/davenport-man-beats-covid-19-after-99-days-in-hospital-family-says/,"DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) - A Davenport man is on the road to recovery after spending roughly three months in the hospital due to COVID-19 and other complications. The family of 64-year-old Randy Burke said he spent 99 days at Genesis East Medical Clinic with 13 weeks of his stay being in the intensive care unit.

“Didn’t feel good. Didn’t notice a whole lot for a couple of days. Actually slept a lot,” said Kathy Burke, Randy’s wife.

The Davenport couple are high school sweethearts and have been together for 40 years. Kathy said he made her a promise.

“I said you told me you’d never leave me and I said I’m holding you to that. You better never leave,” she said.

Cough and fever came. Kathy said he started to feel okay and then things took a turn on July 2nd.

“He said I feel like I have knives poking in my head. So I said, okay, I’m done. I called 911, and they got here and his blood oxygen was down to 63, which normal is between, you know, 95 and 100,” she said.

When he went in, he was diagnosed with extensive bilateral pneumonia and COVID-19. During his stay, he was put on a ventilator and had a tracheotomy. Several weeks into his stay they also found out he had a rotten gallbladder and had to remove that as well.

For the first several weeks Kathy wasn’t able to see Randy. He tested negative for COVID-19 after roughly 6 weeks. Through it all, he beat the coronavirus and so much more. Kathy said at times the outlook was gloomy, with the ICU nurses unsure how he would be between their shifts.

“...some of them said they didn’t know when they left work on a certain day if they were going to see him when they got there the next morning,” she said,""...he was that ill.""

But Randy was a fighter and he had many people rooting for him. Family and friends used the hashtag #RallyforRandy on social media. He celebrated his 64th birthday the day before he was released, with the nurses surprising him with a decorated room.

“He was all surprised when we got back to the room. It was so [much] fun. They made things very joyous if you will. At a time where...well we didn’t know for sure. We didn’t know what the next day was going to bring,” she said.

The hospital staff sent him out with a celebratory parade leading out of the hospital doors. Cheers and chants filled the air. A moment of triumph for Randy and a new beginning.

“A couple of the nurses had told me that when they have people that have left the hospital, he’s been there probably one of the longest that they’ve had for this sort of deal, that they do do a parade through the hospital. So they did one through the floor that he was on and then I thought that was going to be it. Then we go down in the elevator and we’re walking out of the main part of the hospital and all those people were out there. I had no idea they’d be out there. That many of them. I mean like every department. I mean I was just...it was crazy. And then right by Randy, there were all the ICU nurses, and they had to all be there and his therapist and everything so it was incredible. It was incredible,” she said.

Kathy said the healthcare workers that helped Randy through this journey are all family now.

“They are the heroes. I don’t know what we would’ve done without them. They took care of him like he was their own. Like he, you know, he was their dad or their brother,” she said, “They really took such good care of him, and I can’t say enough about 'em,” she said.

Through it all, he beat the odds.

“Our general doctor said, you know, I honestly at one point Randy gave you 20% chance to make it,” she said, "" “to have him be at the stage he is now, although we thought 14 weeks was a long time and it is. There have been others that have been longer and you just have, stay with it and stay strong and keep pushing on, you know. Keep giving them...try to give them hope.”

Randy has a long road ahead of him as he starts rehabilitation.

“The nurses told me in the beginning, the kind of thing they go by is for every week in the ICU, it’s a month’s recovery. So when you look at it that way. He’s got at least a year [of] recovery. I’m sure some are sooner than others but that’s what they kind of go by.”

During Randy’s stay, Kathy said the support of their 3 daughters and a host of family and friends took care of her.

“They’ve been here for all of it. Family has been fabulous. Without them I don’t know what I do,” she said

Kathy said when he spoke to him Monday morning his voice was sounding stronger. More like himself. He started his rehabilitation process at Manor Care and will eventually go to Genesis West.

Kathy said they’re looking forward to eventually going to Florida to visit family and take a walk along the beach. Something they love to do.

A Catfishing With a Happy Ending: Emma was deceived by an older man on the internet—and then found love with the model whose photographs he had stolen,https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/hook-line-and-sinker/542748/,"It was April Fool’s Day, 2017, when Emma stood beneath the giant arrivals board at London’s Heathrow Airport, searching for Adem’s flight. When a lady beside her noticed her shaking hands, Emma explained that she was waiting for a man from the internet, whom she had never met. The woman froze. “You have to be very careful!” She warned, on the internet not everyone is who they say they are.

“Well actually, I know ...” Emma began, but the Turkish passengers were already flooding into the arrivals hall.

“Oh my God, it’s happening,” she thought.

When the crowd parted, she saw him walking toward her in a white T-shirt and a blue cardigan, the man in her photographs, come to life. Adem was taller than she expected, and when he recognized her, she felt breathless. As they hugged in the middle of the airport, Emma thought that he smelled “fantastique.”

In a quiet corner, Emma produced an egg-and-mayonnaise sandwich, which she had bought in case Adem was hungry. When he lifted it to his mouth, she noticed his hands were shaking too. “I was really nervous,” Adem said. They walked into the bitter cold air, and Emma summoned an Uber. It seemed to take forever. Adem was very quiet and there was a nervous energy between them. When he stepped off the curb to look for their car, Adem turned around and found Emma at eye level.

Inexplicably, she kissed him.

“Three minutes later I felt like I know her a long time,” Adem said. The spark was undeniable. She gave him a key to her apartment, and together they discovered the city like tourists, goofing around with a selfie stick. Later, when Adem opened his suitcase, Emma spotted the leather jacket from her favorite photograph, and felt starstruck. And Adem couldn’t believe his luck—his soul mate had appeared in his inbox as if by magic.

On April 23, 2017, their story became a tabloid sensation in England. “My catfish became cupid,” Emma told the Daily Mirror, “And now we’re living happily ever after.” Soon, other victims of Alan Stanley reached out to Emma. One woman from New York said she had been in a relationship with Ronnie for “years.” When the newspapers described Alan as a “love rat,” he endured summits about his behavior with his colleagues and employer, and an “awful” conversation with his daughter.

“These last few months have been beyond stressful,” he told me. “I don’t think I’ve slept properly for three or four months now.” Overwhelmed by shame, he moved to a faraway town. But even Alan felt relieved that the story ended in comedy, not a tragedy.

“I think it’s brilliant Emma and Adem have met,” he said. “It’s almost like fate.” Alan added that he no longer uses fake identities, and has since met someone special, he said, on Twitter: “A European lady, younger than me, younger than Emma.” There is someone out for there for everyone, he added. “I don’t consider myself to be particularly good-looking ... I’m not a David Beckham, or a Tom Cruise, or an Adem Guzel.”"
German parliament votes to legalise same-sex marriage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/30/germany-poised-legalise-same-sex-marriage-bill-law?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_reddit_is_fun,"German MPs have voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage, prompting joyous and unusual scenes in parliament as Green party politicians tossed glittered confetti across the chamber and gay couples sitting in the public gallery kissed and embraced.

The vote by 393 to 226, with four abstentions, followed 40 minutes of often heated and highly emotional debate, reflecting a wider, decades-long argument over marriage equality. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, voted against the move, despite having paved the way for the law’s passage by inviting MPs to vote according to their conscience.



Merkel had appeared to shift her longstanding opposition to gay marriage on Monday, when she said that she considered “the values lived out in a same-sex partnership equal to those in a heterosexual marriage”. After dropping a red “no” card into the ballot box in the Bundestag, she explained: “For me, marriage as defined by law is marriage between a man and a woman.

“It was a long, intensive, and for many also emotional discussion, that goes for me personally too, and I’m hopeful not only that there will be respect for either side’s opinions, but that it will also bring about more peace and cohesion in society,” she said.

Since 2001, same-sex couples in Germany have been able to enter into civil unions, but not to marry. Under the new law, which is expected to take effect before the end of the year, married, same-sex couples will also be able to adopt children together.

The vote marked a stunning farewell victory for the Green politician Volker Beck, 56, a veteran gay rights campaigner who was ending a 23-year career as a lawmaker yesterday. “Today a bastion has fallen,” he told the German news agency DPA.

The Lesbian and Gay Association, which has pushed for the reform since 1990, greeted the outcome, declaring that “Germany has voted for love”. “This is a historic day!” it said in a statement. “Not only for lesbians and gays, but also for a more just and democratic society.”

It remains something of a mystery as to whether Merkel is a canny operator who had meant to trigger the vote all along, or whether she was, as much as anyone else in the Bundestag, taken by surprise that it had happened.

What is clear is that she will now be able to take credit for having triggered the vote, despite the fact she and her alliance have been opposing moves towards marriage equality for decades.

Merkel has also effectively taken the wind out of the sails of her junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), who have treated gay marriage as a key campaigning issue in the runup to elections in September.

Some within the ranks of Merkel’s own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party were furious about having been bulldozed into a vote at short notice, although she will feel that she can hold her head high with disaffected colleagues because of her no vote.

Merkel faced a barrage of criticism from within the chamber, with the sharpest rebuke coming from the SPD’s Johannes Kahrs, who accused her of having stood in the way of the law for years. “In all honesty, Frau Merkel, thanks for nothing,” he said.



The vote was set in motion during an audience with Merkel at Berlin’s Maxim Gorki theatre on Monday evening, hosted by the women’s magazine Brigitte. Merkel held court on the issue of marriage equality for eight minutes towards the end of the question-and-answer session, after Ulli Köppe, a journalist and events manager who was sitting in the audience, asked her: “When will I be able to call my boyfriend my husband?”

Merkel responded pensively, saying she had given the issue much thought and had come to the conclusion that a same-sex partnership could be considered “just as valuable” as a heterosexual one, but she believed that “for those who are religious”, the question was more complicated, and ultimately down to an individual’s conscience.

She went on to describe a “life-changing experience” she had had after meeting a lesbian couple in her home constituency on Germany’s Baltic coast. She told the pair that her personal “sticking point” over same-sex marriage was the issue of children’s welfare.

Gundula Zilm, who has been in a relationship for years with her partner, Christine, with whom she cares for five foster children, invited Merkel to visit her at home to see how well her children were doing. Merkel said the encounter had led to a change of heart because authorities clearly had confidence in the couple’s ability to care for the children.

“If the state deems a child to be better off in a same-sex partnership than living in a household with a man and woman where violence is the norm, then I must recognise this and take it into consideration when making a judgment,” she said to applause.

Her U-turn was seized on by the SPD as an opportunity to hold a snap vote on the issue ahead of the summer recess and before elections on 24 September. The move was greeted with disdain by many of the members of Merkel’s conservative alliance, who accused the SPD of forcing the issue on the Bundestag.

Köppe, 28, who put the question to Merkel, was in the Bundestag’s public gallery on Friday to await the outcome of the debate he had effectively sparked. He said: “My question was totally spontaneous and unplanned. Because no one else in the audience was asking a question, I just grabbed the microphone.”

He said he had expected the chancellor to give him a “wishy-washy answer – as she’s done previously”, but that her detailed answer had surprised him. “It just happened to be the right question at the right time,” he said.

He and his partner of 12 years would now consider getting married. “Just having a civil union as has been possible until now was simply not enough for my boyfriend and me.”

Zilm, who watched the Bundestag debate on television, said she was “deeply disappointed” that Merkel had voted no, but was celebrating the outcome nonetheless. “I was very sad that Merkel voted against,” Zilm said. “But when the kids come home from school, we’re going to take them for an ice-cream.” She and her partner, Christine, already in a civil union, are also planning to marry, and have said they will invite Merkel.

The law is expected to come into force before the end of the year after it has been approved by the upper house and signed into law by the president. Renate Künast of the Greens urged registry offices across the country to “stock up on staff” to cope with the flood of marriage applicants."
"800,000 volunteers planted 49 million trees in Uttar Pradesh, India",http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/india-plants-50-million-trees-uttar-pradesh-reforestation/?source=rss,"Although the feat has yet to be certified by Guinness World Records, Indian officials have reported that volunteers planted a whopping 49.3 million tree saplings on July 11, blowing past the previous record for most trees planted in a single day.

That record, a mere 847,275 trees, was set by Pakistan in 2013.

A reported 800,000 volunteers from Uttar Pradesh worked for 24 hours planting 80 different species of trees along roads, railways, and on public land. The saplings were raised on local nurseries.

The effort is part of the commitment India made at the Paris Climate Conference in December 2015. In the agreement, signed on Earth Day 2016, India agreed to spend $6 billion to reforest 12 percent of its land (bringing total forest cover to 235 million acres by 2030, or about 29 percent of the country's territory).

Trees sequester carbon dioxide from the air, thereby reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. India has experienced substantial loss of its forest cover over the past few centuries, as people cut down trees for firewood, pasture, and to make room for development.

Other countries are also replanting trees. In December, African nations pledged to reforest 100 million hectares. A wide range of stakeholders, from countries to companies, also signed on to the non-binding New York Declaration of Forests that month, with the goal of halving deforestation by 2020 and ending it by 2030. The declaration also seeks to restore at leat 350 million hectares of degraded land with healthy forests.

Still, the young trees aren’t out of the woods yet, so to speak. Saplings need water and care and are susceptible to disease. Experience shows mortality rates as high as 40 percent after such massive tree plantings.

Watch India Man Plants Forest Bigger Than Central Park to Save His Island by William Douglas McMaster in National Geographic's Short Film Showcase. The filmmakers created the content presented, and the opinions expressed are their own, not those of National Geographic Partners.

Officials say they are aware of those concerns and will be monitoring the trees with aerial photography, to see which areas may need special attention.

“The world has realized that serious efforts are needed to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate the effects of global climate change,” Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said at an event promoting the planting.

Officials also hope the trees will improve air quality in India, which suffers from some of the worst in the world. Trees can help remove some pollutants from the air. Right now, 6 of the top 10 most polluted cities in the world are in the country.

Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India, a nation of 1.25 billion people. Some of them may be able to breathe a little easier, and find shade under the trees.

""The biggest contribution of this tree planting project is, apart from the tokenism, that it focuses on the major issues,"" Anit Mukherjee, policy fellow with the Centre for Global Development told the Telegraph. ""It addresses many of the big issues for India: pollution, deforestation, and land use."""
Terminator star Schwarzenegger feels 'fantastic' after latest heart surgery,https://news.sky.com/story/terminator-star-schwarzenegger-feels-fantastic-after-latest-heart-surgery-12112799,"Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger has told fans he feels ""fantastic"" after undergoing heart surgery.

The 73-year-old former governor of California said he had been given a new aortic valve.

In 2018 he was given a new pulmonary valve to replace one he received in 1997 due to a congenital heart defect.

In a social media post, he thanked doctors from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and told the city's residents he had been out and about enjoying the sights since his operation.

Thanks to the team at the Cleveland Clinic, I have a new aortic valve to go along with my new pulmonary valve from my last surgery. I feel fantastic and have already been walking the streets of Cleveland enjoying your amazing statues. Thank you to every doc and nurse on my team! pic.twitter.com/hmIbsEMHtA — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) October 23, 2020

Schwarzenegger talked in May about the surgery.

In the online graduation video, he admitted he could have died, adding: ""The reason why I'm telling you all this is because no matter how successful you are, life will throw obstacles in your path, like it was with my heart surgery or your graduation now.

""But if you have a very clear vision like I talked about earlier, of exactly what you want to do and who you want to be, you can go and find a way around all of these obstacles.

""That's what life is all about, overcoming obstacles."""
"Bee population recovering due to regenerative farming, producers say",https://globalnews.ca/news/5767381/bee-population-recovering-regenerative-farming/?fbclid=IwAR1981WqfACa26CbUVBjdZI8lK04AR_QEoorr2pK_HD7ntYbvqmVkrDrmxs,"Send this page to someone via email

Paul Kernaleguen says regenerative agriculture has brought bees back to his farm.

“With the flowering species [of plants] we have now, you definitely see more,” he said.

He’s referring to the mixture of plants in his fields, near Birch Hills, Sask. Along with his partner, Erin Dancey, he now grows flowers like red clover, phacelia and sunflowers, along with barley, oats and peas they grow to feed their dairy cattle.

Dancey and Kernaleguen manage their fields with regenerative agriculture. They said the practice has brought greater profits, efficiency and a higher bee population.

Regenerative agriculture, says Cover Crops Canada spokesperson Kevin Elmy, is designed to replenish “the biology in our soils.”

“We’ve mined our soils and our soil is going in the wrong direction,” he said.

“We’ve lost about two-thirds of organic matter in our soils. It’s time to build it back.” Tweet This

Elmy says the mixture of different crops, which bloom at different times and grow at different rates, replenishes the nutrients and bacteria necessary for the soil to be fertile. And he says that the flowers have encouraged the bees to repopulate.

Kernaleguen said there were lots of bees when he was growing up before they all but disappeared around 10 years ago.

“It’s encouraging,” he said. “It kind of lets you know [the bees are] happy with what you got and you’re helping out the ecosystem.

Kernaleguen didn’t switch to regenerative agriculture because he wanted more bees. He did it because, six years ago, he was worried about feeding his cattle.

“We were in some wet years, Kernaleguen said.

“What we were growing — barley and oats — kept drowning. [So we] got the idea to try something else.”

He attributes the better water management in the soil now to having more active root systems in the soil, and having cover crops — like alfalfa or clover — that are grown for the enrichment of the soil.

Some cover crops are grown all year.

Dancey, who moved to the farm three years ago, says that mixing the crops in the field has allowed them to harvest the mixed rations they need to feed their cattle. She estimates it now “takes probably a third of the time to get the feed in front of the cows.”

She says the new method has also made the farm more money.

“When you get higher quality feed to the animal then that obviously comes through in the milk side of it,” she said.

“We feel our cows are healthier [and that] they breed back better,” Kernaleguen said.

“They produce a lot more butterfat, butter protein and milk protein.”

He said that the cows now produce fewer litres of milk, but that the farm is making more money because Canadian dairy farms are paid for the kilograms of butterfat that they harvest.

He also said producing less milk has been better for the livestock.

“We don’t feel like we’re red-lining them like we used to. We used to push a lot more litres of milk per animal,” he said.

“The cows are stronger [and] healthier.”

The new farming system, and increased number of bees, has attracted the attention of General Mills, the maker of Cheerios and Lucky Charms.

“This is all-important to rebuild [the] soil health from areas where we source the ingredients,” said Jim Eckberg, a General Mills research agronomist. He said that GM is interested in the regenerative agriculture that Dancey, Kernaleguen and Elmy are using to improve the sustainability in their supply chain.

“Ultimately, to move into the 21st century, to be able to cope with the big challenges we have we need a healthier soil base,” he said, referring to soil depletion and sustainability.

“All of these practices can be implemented whether you’re in Texas or Saskatchewan.”

A supermarket in Thailand garnered attention from the netizens around the world for the implementation of its store policy which replaces plastic packaging in all of its produce with banana leaf wrappings.,https://www.breakingasia.com/news/saving-world-banana-leaf/,"A supermarket in Thailand garnered attention from the netizens around the world for the implementation of its store policy which replaces plastic packaging in all of its produce with banana leaf wrappings.

A World Wrapped In Plastic

We have slowly become engrossed with the use of plastic packaging in almost everything that we buy. When we walk into a supermarket, the most common sight we see are products wrapped in plastic. Even fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables are now already sold inside this ubiquitous form of wrapping.

We might very well disregard this issue altogether. However, sooner than later, we might find ourselves living in an ocean full of plastics.

Sad to say, we don’t have to contemplate on how this could severely affect our environment. It’s already happening and unless you purposely shut yourself from hearing the latest news, we always often hear cases of marine life being threatened by the overflowing plastic waste in the sea.

Studies even show that in a matter of 30 years, more than 12 billion tonnes of plastic will completely cover the oceans and fill our landfills.

A Green Initiative

But apparently, all hope is not lost, as some of us still have the heart to change for the better.

The Rimping supermarket in Chiangmai, Thailand, for example, is strongly implementing a no-plastic-packaging policy in every fresh produce being sold. Instead, the store uses banana leaves.

The pictures posted on Facebook by a Chiang Mai-based real estate company, Perfect Homes, show Rimping’s banana leaf packaging in action.

The simple, yet highly relevant innovation is used to hold together bushels of spring onions, bunch of chillies and peppers, and clumps of leafy vegetables. With the help of what appears to be strings made from the hard and flexible part of banana trunk, everything is tied together neatly in place.

One can still notice the use of plastic in its labeling, however, the primary use of leaves significantly reduces the need to do it with plastic. As such, this store policy can be seen as a huge step for a greener, plastic-free earth.

A Sustainable Alternative

Interestingly, the use of banana leaves for packing and preserving food has been a tradition being practiced not only in most Asian nations, as it is also prevalent in Polynesian countries like in Guam or Hawaii. It is also being done in Mexico and Jamaica.

In Thailand, the Rimping supermarket in Chiangmai is considered as one of the first to employ the method on a large commercial scale.

While bananas can grow in most regions that have humid tropical climates, Asia is blessed with multiple varieties of this plant. Some types can survive with minimal care, while others have the characteristics to grow very rapidly, in just a matter of months.

In Thailand, for example, they have 30 different varieties of bananas. Even if the country decides to implement this innovation on a nation-wide scale, this resource is still believed to be sustainable and would be difficult to deplete.

Adapting In A Global Scale

We might wonder, can this method be applied globally? We can certainly hope so.

There could be problems with this approach especially in western countries where banana fruits have to be exported, let alone the leaves! These materials, despite its nature-friendly properties, aren’t as readily available as compared to here in Asia.

But then, Rimping supermarket’s initiative should serve as an inspiration for everyone around the world to get creative and come up with alternative ways to help save our environment."
Vaccinations jump 500% in antivax hotspot amid measles outbreak,https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/vaccinations-jump-500-in-antivax-hotspot-amid-measles-outbreak/,"Demand for measles vaccines leapt 500 percent last month in Clark County, Washington—a hotbed for anti-vaccine sentiment that has now become the epicenter of a ferocious measles outbreak.

As of February 6 , the county—which sits just north of the border from Portland, Oregon—has tallied 50 confirmed cases and 11 suspected cases of measles since January 1. The case count is rising swiftly, with figures more than doubling in just the last two weeks. On January 18, the county declared a public health emergency due to the outbreak.

Health officials have long feared an outbreak in the area, given the rampant skepticism of vaccines driven by misinformation and fear-mongering by anti-vaccine advocates. Only 76.5 percent of kindergarteners in Clark County had all the standard immunizations during the 2017-2018 school year. Overall, the county’s population is below the 92-percent to 94-percent range some experts consider necessary to curb the spread of disease.

But, that might be about to change. As the threat of measles has become all too real in Clark County, residents are lining up for vaccines, according to data first reported by Kaiser Health News. Orders of measles vaccines in the county reached 3,150 in January. That is nearly a 500-percent jump in orders from January last year, when the total was just 530. Statewide vaccine figures also reflect a boost. Orders for measles vaccine climbed 30 percent in Washington overall, from 12,140 doses in January last year to 15,780 doses in January of this year.

Though health officials are glad to see the surge in life-saving immunizations, the motivation is less encouraging. “I would rather it not take an outbreak for this to happen,” Alan Melnick, the Clark County health officer overseeing the response, told KHN.

Still, the response is unsurprising, according to Virginia Ramos, infection control nurse with Sea Mar Community Health Center, which runs six sites that offer vaccines in Clark County. “During an outbreak is when you see an influx of patients who would otherwise be vaccine-hesitant,” she said.

The Clark County health department has stressed the dangers of measles, which is an extremely contagious, air-borne viral disease. The health department notes on its website that:

The virus travels through the air and can stay up to two hours in the air of a room where a person with measles has been. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch a contaminated surface, then touch their eyes, noses or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.

Measles usually starts with a high fever, cough, and runny nose, as well as red, watery eyes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It progresses to the telltale measles rash three to five days later, which breaks out all over the body and can be accompanied by fever spikes above 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Common complications include diarrhea and ear infections that can cause permanent hearing loss in children. Severe complications include pneumonia, which can be fatal, and encephalitis (swelling of the brain), which can lead to convulsions, hearing loss, and intellectual disabilities in children. Measles can also cause pregnant women to give birth prematurely or deliver a low-birth-weight baby.

The outbreak in Washington state is one of three ongoing in the US, with the other two in New York City and New York state. Cases have also been documented in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon, and Texas since the start of the year."
"Queensland becomes the 1st Australian State to criminalise gay conversion therapy, after state politicians voted to make the “highly destructive & unethical” practice illegal. “Being LGBTIQ is not an affliction or disease that requires medical treatment,” the state’s Health Minister said.",https://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/courts-law/queensland-becomes-first-australian-state-to-ban-gay-conversion-therapy/news-story/4a8f7778693c0cff14a7d8208cb6135d,"We thought Australia had finally got it right with their yes vote to gay marriage but it turns out there are still some minorities that believe the ‘gay’ can be counselled away.

Queensland has become the first state in Australia to criminalise gay conversion therapy, after state politicians voted to make the “highly destructive and unethical” practice illegal.

“Being LGBTIQ is not an affliction or disease that requires medical treatment,” the state’s Health Minister, Steven Miles, said in parliament Thursday.

“No treatment or practice can change a person’s sexual attraction or experience of gender.”

Under the Health Legislation Amendment Bill, health professionals who attempt “to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity” could face up to 18 months in prison, with a suite of practices including “conditioning techniques such as aversion therapy, psychoanalysis and hypnotherapy, clinical interventions, including counselling, or group activities that aim to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity” now illegal.

While Mr Miles deemed the practices “highly destructive and unethical”, the bill was only passed 47-41 with the support of the Queensland Greens and Queensland Labor. The LNP, Bob Katter’s Australia Party and One Nation voted against the ban, with the LNP claiming the law would “turn doctors into criminals”.

President of the Queensland Council for LGBTI Health, Peter Black, told the Thomson Reuters Foundationthe ban “sends a clear message to Queenslanders that conversion therapy is harmful in all contexts”.

“It is important that there are penalties for this dangerous and discredited practice,” Mr Black said.

“There continues to be a need for education and further research on the harms of conversion therapies, as well as support for survivors of conversion therapies.”

A 2018 landmark report by La Trobe University and the Human Rights Law Centre found conversion therapy is “pervasive” in Australian faith communities, with at least 10 organisations offering the practice in Australia and New Zealand.

The report highlighted disturbing testimonies from people who went through a form of gay conversion therapy – some willingly, others by force – in an attempt to become straight.

Mary, not her real name, now 49 years old, was sent to conversion therapy after she told her mother she was in love with another young woman at her church group.

Her parents and extended family were missionaries and ministers who shut her away in a mental hospital when she was just 17 years old, where she was made to sit in a bath full of ice cubes while Bible verses were read to her over and over again, and handcuffed to her bed at night.

“Then I remember going into another room … with a surgical table, and being restrained … having an electrode attached to my labia; and images projected on to the ceiling … and a lot of pain from the electrodes; and being left there for quite a long time afterwards, exposed and alone,” she told the researchers.

Hers was just one of many testimonies included in the report.

The Australian Capital Territory and Victoria have also committed to banning the harmful practice, with the ACT introducing a bill to outlaw conversion therapy for minors on Thursday.

Last October, the Victorian government began public consultation on similar legislation, with Premier Daniel Andrews denouncing conversion therapy as “bigoted quackery” in February last year.

“What they really are is a most personal form of torture, a cruel practice that perpetuates the idea that LGBTI people are in some way broken,” Mr Andrews said at the time.

“Some survivors, seeking genuine professional support, have instead found themselves on the other end of this bigoted quackery. It’s not LGBTI people who need to change. It’s our laws.”

Chris Csbas, of SOGICE Survivors, told the Star Observerhe hopes this bill is just the beginning, with concerns that the ban “only covers conversion practices in health services”.

“The concern is that a vast majority of survivors have gone through conversion practices in a religious or informal setting,” he said, adding the bill “is not going to be protective enough and it is not actually enough to stop the harm occurring”.

“I’m hoping that the other states will pass much broader laws that will address more than just health services. We’re very hopeful that they will actually adopt the recommendations by survivors groups rather than just passing something really quickly.”

Texas medical student survives 6 brain surgeries while studying to be doctor at hospital treating her,https://www.foxnews.com/health/texas-medical-student-hospital-doctor-miracle,"Claudia Martinez, 28, is a walking miracle. She's also a fourth-year medical student at the same hospital that has treated her throughout six brain surgeries.

The Brawley, Calif., native who was raised in Houston, Texas wanted to be a doctor since she was a little girl but she never could have imagined the journey it would take her on, which she now describes as ""a blessing in disguise.""

TEXAS WOMAN TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT AGAINST FAMILY'S WISHES – THEN A PRO-LIFE GROUP STEPPED IN

Martinez received a devastating diagnosis as an undergraduate student at the University of Houston. Plagued by headaches and blackouts, Martinez was told her debilitating condition was called Chiari Malformation, which involves brain tissue extending into the spinal cord. It could cause paralysis.

But despite the diagnosis, surgeries, and going in and out of hospitals, Martinez graduated with a 4.0 and got accepted into her dream medical school, the University of Texas at Houston, where she was being treated.

ALABAMA NAVY ROTC SENIOR CREDITS GOD FOR SURVIVING BRAIN INJURY: ‘MEDICAL SCIENCE CAN'T EXPLAIN MY RECOVERY’

""My journey has been long and at times has felt impossible, but what keeps me going is my future patients,"" Martinez told Fox News. ""I've learned we don't necessarily need a cure. We need inclusion, we need patience, we need accessibility, and we need individuals who are willing to work with us to give us the reasonable accommodations that, by law, we are entitled to.""

Martinez suffered a seizure during her first year of medical school and had to undergo experimental surgery. During her third year, she suffered a stroke that left her unable to function from the neck down. She was transferred to TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital for intense neuro-rehabilitation where she learned to walk, feed, dress, and bathe once again.

""Yes, I'm here to advocate for myself, but more importantly for those who do not yet have a voice, for those coming after me, and for my future patients,"" she added. ""If I can set a trail to guide others so they don't have to suffer as much as I have, then it will all be worth it.""

Martinez has shared her journey on Instagram, inspiring others through her honesty and fight.

CONNECTING THROUGH FAITH WITH A MISSION TO HEAL COUNTRY’S RACIAL DIVIDE

""I thank God every day for what I’ve gone through, [because] it is how I’ve found my calling,"" Martinez wrote on her Instagram. ""I’ve officially decided to pursue a residency in PM&R (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation).""

She added: ""I want to be on the side of medicine that most people don’t see. I want to work with a population of individuals whose worth and potential is often overlooked and be their advocate. I want to help them see that even though it may be a little different, life can be beautiful again.""

But Martinez doesn't use med school or being a patient as an excuse.

She also mentors college students, especially underrepresented minorities who are interested in pursuing medicine, through programs like Aspirations in Medical Professions, SMDEP Mentorship Program, Pre-Jamp symposium, and on her own.

NASA Satellite Shows Corn Belt Produces 40% More Oxygen Than Amazon Rainforest,https://www.nasa.gov/press/goddard/2014/march/satellite-shows-high-productivity-from-us-corn-belt/,"[image-51]Data from satellite sensors show that during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, the Midwest region of the United States boasts more photosynthetic activity than any other spot on Earth, according to NASA and university scientists.

Healthy plants convert light to energy via photosynthesis, but chlorophyll also emits a fraction of absorbed light as fluorescent glow that is invisible to the naked eye. The magnitude of the glow is an excellent indicator of the amount of photosynthesis, or gross productivity, of plants in a given region.

Research in 2013 led by Joanna Joiner, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., demonstrated that fluorescence from plants could be teased out of data from existing satellites, which were designed and built for other purposes. The new research led by Luis Guanter of the Freie Universität Berlin, used the data for the first time to estimate photosynthesis from agriculture. Results were published March 25 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

According to co-author Christian Frankenberg of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., ""The paper shows that fluorescence is a much better proxy for agricultural productivity than anything we've had before. This can go a long way regarding monitoring – and maybe even predicting – regional crop yields.""

[image-36]Guanter, Joiner and Frankenberg launched their collaboration at a 2012 workshop, hosted by the Keck Institute for Space Studies at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, to explore measurements of photosynthesis from space. The team noticed that on an annual basis, the tropics are the most productive. But during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, the U.S. Corn Belt ""really stands out,"" Frankenberg said. ""Areas all over the world are not as productive as this area.""

The researchers set out to describe the phenomenon observed by carefully interpreting the data from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) on Metop-A, a European meteorological satellite. Data showed that fluorescence from the Corn Belt, which extends from Ohio to Nebraska and Kansas, peaks in July at levels 40 percent greater than those observed in the Amazon.

Comparison with ground-based measurements from carbon flux towers and yield statistics confirmed the results.

The match between ground-based measurements and satellite measurements was a ""pleasant surprise,"" said Joiner, a co-author on the paper. Ground-based measurements have a resolution of about 0.4 square miles (1 square kilometer), while the satellite measurements currently have a resolution of more than 1,158 square miles (3,000 square kilometers). The study confirms that even with coarse resolution, the satellite method could estimate the photosynthetic activity occurring inside plants at the molecular level for areas with relatively homogenous vegetation like the Corn Belt.

[image-80]Challenges remain in estimating the productivity of fragmented agricultural areas, not properly sampled by current space-borne instruments. That's where missions with better resolution could help, such as NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 – a mission planned for launch in July 2014 that will also measure solar-induced fluorescence.

The research could also help scientists improve the computer models that simulate Earth's carbon cycle, as Guanter found a strong underestimation of crop photosynthesis in models. The analysis revealed that carbon cycle models – which scientists use to understand how carbon cycles through the ocean, land and atmosphere over time – underestimate the productivity of the Corn Belt by 40 to 60 percent.

Unlike most vegetation, food crops are managed to maximize productivity. They usually have access to abundant nutrients and are irrigated. The Corn Belt, for example, receives water from the Mississippi River. Accounting for irrigation is currently a challenge for models, which is one reason why they underestimate agricultural productivity.

""If we don't take into account irrigation and other human influences in the agricultural areas, we're not going to correctly estimate the amount of carbon taken up by vegetation, particularly corn,"" Joiner said. ""Corn plants are very productive in terms of assimilating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This needs to be accounted for going forward in trying to predict how much of the atmospheric carbon dioxide will be taken up by crops in a changing climate.""

According to Frankenberg, the remote sensing-based techniques now available could be a powerful monitoring tool for food security, especially data from OCO-2 and in combination with data from other upcoming satellites, such as NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive, scheduled for launch later this year.

NASA monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns. NASA develops new ways to observe and study Earth's interconnected natural systems with long-term data records and computer analysis tools to better see how our planet is changing. The agency shares this unique knowledge with the global community and works with institutions in the United States and around the world that contribute to understanding and protecting our home planet."

Canada just ruled to Uphold Net Neutrality,https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/canada-just-ruled-to-uphold-net-neutrality,"On Thursday afternoon, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the country's federal telecom regulator, dropped a bombshell ruling on the status of net neutrality—the principle that all web services should be treated equally by providers. And, blessedly, it's good news.

The CRTC ruled that ""[internet] service providers should treat data traffic equally to foster consumer choice, innovation and the free exchange of ideas,"" a CRTC news release states. What this means is that service providers won't be able to privilege certain services over others—say, YouTube or Apple Music—by letting you use them without dinging your data plan. This is a practice generally known as ""zero-rating"" or differential pricing.

Differential pricing contradicts the principle of net neutrality because it allows service providers to leverage their privileged position to decide which services are most attractive to their customers, effectively discriminating against others.

The CRTC's decision is welcome news as its sister organization in the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), is right now starting to roll back some of its previous commitments to net neutrality.

The CRTC ruling originated from complaints against Quebec-based provider Videotron's unlimited music streaming service, which launched in 2015. The service allowed subscribers to stream music from third-party apps without it counting against their data plans.

Those complaints sparked a series of hearings on the practice of differential pricing. At the time of the hearings in the fall of last year, two of Canada's ""big three"" telecom providers came out in support of differential pricing—Telus and Bell—while Rogers was the sole dissenting voice among the trio.

The CRTC also ruled on the Videotron case today, and in line with its decision on net neutrality and its new framework for evaluating differential pricing schemes—also published on Thursday—it ordered Videotron to come into compliance with the law, which is a nice way of saying it should stop offering its unlimited music service as it stands. The company has yet to release a public statement responding to the order.

"Man who struggled w/mental illness starts service to send nice texts to people with stress, anxiety, and negative thoughts",http://www.tampabay.com/health/a-support-group-in-your-phone-healing-for-mental-illness-comes-one-text-at-a-time-20190222/,"Johnny Crowder used to have a negative outlook on the world.

He grew up in what he described as an abusive household. He was diagnosed with a slew of mental illnesses during his formative years, from bipolar disorder to obsessive compulsive disorder. It was easy for him to feel down about himself.

""I realized how I was thinking was contributing to my struggles,"" said Crowder, a 26-year-old Tampa native. ""But I couldn't climb out of it.""

So he started filling sticky notes with positive, affirmative messages, and leaving them around his house. On one note, he remembers penciling, ""You deserve to spend time with people who care about you.""

It made a difference. For just a few seconds a day, he'd feel better. But eventually the notes became commonplace, and their effect seemed to wear off.

So he decided to try it another way. This time, by sending uplifting text messages to his friends to see how they reacted.

""The first text, I sent to about 32 friends in my contacts, with the same message. Nearly everyone responded,"" he said. ""They interpreted it differently based on their own lives, but I was surprised to see so many of them replied with 'How did you know?' Like I knew they were going through something.""

That's how Crowder founded Cope Notes.

It's a text messaging service aimed at those going through a difficult time. Every day, a Cope Notes user will get a random message, usually something uplifting, but it could also be advice about an exercise to try or tips to boost positivity. Users are encouraged to text back, and to use the thread as their own ""digital journal,"" Crowder said.

""People would rather text their friends than talk to them about something difficult,"" he said. ""We wanted to create something that was optionally interactive. Some of the texts are prompts, and while it's not necessarily a two-way conversation, we want the platform to foster independence. The goal is not to be something people rely on forever.""

RELATED: When suicide threats come calling: 'I try to make a connection.'

Crowder's timing, it seems, is important. Depression diagnosis rates rose 33 percent from 2013 to 2016, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's Health of America Report. Children and millennials seem to be the most at risk, with diagnosis rates spiking by 63 percent and 47 percent, respectively, over the same period.

Women, too, seem to suffer from depression more often, with diagnosis rates that are double those of men, according to the Blue Cross report.

What's more, the report said, people with depression are nearly 30 percent less healthy on average than those without it, and 85 percent also suffer from other chronic health conditions.

Cope Notes launched quietly nearly a year ago from Crowder's South Tampa home, and now has about 1,000 users. Crowder said they range in age from 14 to 40. He's the one writing the messages that are delivered each day, but they are reviewed by a panel of mental health counselors and professors, public relations professionals and privacy compliance officials.

The service costs $9.99 a month, or $8.99 a month for an annual subscription. There's also an option of a one-week free trial.

A recent example of a Cope Notes message: ""When you hold the door open for someone, and they step on your foot, you should still be proud. Their bad decision doesn't invalidate your good one.""

Another one said, ""The entire world was changed by people just like you. Normal folks who didn't think they were just about to change the world. Don't underestimate yourself.""

And this: ""Coloring for 15 minutes can help clear your mind and soothe anxiety. It may sound childish, but how do you think adult coloring books became best sellers?""

Cope Notes is not meant to replace therapy or clinical treatment, but it can supplement it, said Kristin Kosyluk, an assistant professor in the Department of Mental Health Law & Policy at the University of South Florida. She said Crowder and his text messaging platform are also good examples of where mental health care is headed.

""We're moving toward a recovery model and away from a medical model,"" Kosyluk said. ""It gives someone like Johnny, who has been through the system and has personal experience, the authority and credibility to provide support to others.""

Kosyluk cited the ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" community — where people who have suffered from the same afflictions, comfort and support one another — as a good example of a recovery model.

""Cope Notes has that piece to it because Johnny is open about his experiences,"" she said. ""A lot of times, people are seeking help in a clinical setting and not finding support in their own communities. A simple text message that somebody receives, that's an intervention being delivered in the moment.""

Kosyluk is working with Crowder to potentially collect research data from Cope Note users in the future.

Before becoming a mental health activist in 2011, speaking about his survival story to community groups and schools, Crowder tried just about anything that would help as he struggled with depression.

""I tried meditation apps, the Tony Robbins 'walk on coals' type self-help people. You name it, I was hungry for anything that would help me cope with what was happening to me.""

But what bothered him most about the programs he tried were the promises of an overnight cure.

""It takes a long time to feel better. There's no flip of a switch in your brain that makes everything normal,"" he said. ""It takes a lot of tiny steps and nudges in the right direction over time to heal and come up with healthy coping practices.""

Jimmy Carter back to building homes in Canada after after being treated for dehydration,http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-jimmy-carter-out-of-hospital-20170714-story.html,"Jimmy Carter was back at a Habitat for Humanity worksite Friday, a day after the former president was hospitalized for dehydration while working with the organization to build homes for needy families in Canada.

A smiling Carter showed up in blue jeans and a work shirt to the site in the St. James neighborhood of Winnipeg, where hundreds of Habitat for Humanity volunteers joined him and his wife, Rosalynn, to build 25 homes.

Carter, 92, was discharged earlier in the morning from St. Boniface General Hospital, where he was treated “as a precaution” for dehydration, Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said. He then attended a prayer service at the work site.

“He and Mrs. Carter extend their appreciation for the many well-wishes he received worldwide,” Congileo said in a statement.

Habitat for Humanity, which has had a long association with the Carters, is constructing 150 homes this year for people in need in Canada to celebrate the country’s 150th anniversary.

The Carters were in Edmonton, where Habitat for Humanity is building 75 homes, from Monday to Wednesday before coming to Winnipeg.

The former president had been working for about 90 minutes Thursday morning when he went to sit in a chair, the Winnipeg Free Press reported. He appeared to wobble, so Secret Service agents led him to his motorcade. He was treated by paramedics who took him away in an ambulance, without using lights or siren, the newspaper said.

This week’s project building houses in several Canadian communities is the 34th time the Carters have pitched in on Habitat for Humanity projects, lending a hand and their name to promote the work.

Carter was diagnosed with melanoma that spread to his brain in 2015, but announced in March of the following year that he no longer needed treatment. Carter continued to volunteer for Habitat for Humanitywhile being treated for cancer, working alongside volunteers at a home in Memphis, Tenn., in November 2015.

We Have to Save the Planet. So I’m Donating $1 Billion.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/earth-biodiversity-conservation-billion-dollars.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage,"But some scientists, including the Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson, have concluded that at least half the planet needs to be protected to save a large majority of plant and wildlife species from extinction. Indeed, the food, clean water and air we need to survive and prosper depends on our ability to protect the planet’s biological diversity. In other words, we have to protect half to save the whole.

Every one of us — citizens, philanthropists, business and government leaders — should be troubled by the enormous gap between how little of our natural world is currently protected and how much should be protected. It is a gap that we must urgently narrow, before our human footprint consumes the earth’s remaining wild places.

For my part, I have decided to donate $1 billion over the next decade to help accelerate land and ocean conservation efforts around the world, with the goal of protecting 30 percent of the planet’s surface by 2030. This money will support locally led conservation efforts around the world, push for increased global targets for land and ocean protection, seek to raise public awareness about the importance of this effort, and fund scientific studies to identify the best strategies to reach our target.

I believe this ambitious goal is achievable because I’ve seen what can be accomplished.

Indigenous peoples, local leaders and conservation groups around the world are already busy setting aside protected areas that reflect the conservation, economic and cultural values of nearby communities. Financial support from philanthropists and governments is critical to helping these leaders conserve places like the coral reefs of the Caribbean, the glaciers of Argentina and what is known as the “place of many elephants” in Zimbabwe."
'Cosby' actor Geoffrey Owens donates $25K gift from Nicki Minaj,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/09/25/cosby-actor-geoffrey-owens-donates-25-k-gift-nicki-minaj-am-extremely-grateful/1426638002/,"'Cosby' actor Geoffrey Owens donates $25K gift from Nicki Minaj: 'I am extremely grateful'

Cydney Henderson | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption 'Cosby Show' actor Geoffrey Owens unashamed about Trader Joe's job Geoffrey Owens, the actor who played Elvin on ""The Cosby Show,"" is speaking up after being called out for bagging groceries at Trader Joe's.

Geoffrey Owens is using his time in the spotlight to help provide financial security to others in the entertainment community.

The ""Cosby Show"" alum, who was infamously job-shamed earlier this month for working at a New Jersey Trader Joe's, donated $25,000 gifted to him by Nicki Minaj.

“I would like to give this donation of 25K to the Actor’s Fund in memory of the late, great Earle Hyman – who played Cosby’s father, ‘Russell’, on ""The Cosby Show"" – who lived his last many years and died at the Actors’ Home, (funded and run by the Actor’s Fund),” Owens, 57, said in a statement to TMZ.

He continued: ""I am extremely grateful to Nicki Minaj for enabling struggling actors to continue pursuing their dreams.""

The ""Queen"" rapper offered the hefty donation to Owens after a photo of him bagging groceries at the supermarket went viral. (The person who snapped the photo has since expressed regret.)

“This man is a whole (expletive) legend in these streets,” Minaj said on-air during her NSFW Queen Radio show on Beats 1. “That man is now getting so many opportunities, I personally want to donate ... $25,000.”

Owens, who played Sondra Huxtable’s husband, Elvin, on ""Cosby"" in the '80s and '90s, worked at Trader Joe's for 15 months in between acting gigs to make ends meet.

“I’d been teaching, acting, directing for 30-plus years, but it got to a point where it just didn’t add up enough and you gotta do what you got to do,"" he told Robin Roberts on ""Good Morning America,"" adding the job offered ""flexibility"" so he could ""try to stay in the business.""

Several media outlets reported on Owens' day job, in what many including the actor himself deemed as an attempt to job-shame him. The disappointment didn't last long, however, because the unwanted limelight proved fruitful.

Since the viral photo, and the subsequent backlash, Owens landed roles on Tyler Perry's ""The Haves and the Have Nots,"" ""NCIS: New Orleans"" and Hilary Swank's upcoming thriller ""Fatale."" The donation from Minaj was the cherry on top, which Owens ultimately decided to donate to a charity close to his heart.

""Thank you to Geoffrey Owens for paying forward his gift from Nicki Minaj & making a very generous donation of $25,000 to our work,"" tweeted the Actor's Fund, an organization that provides financial support and a ""safety net"" for entertainers over the course of their lives.

Children suffering from anxiety and depression will be offered counselling at school under government plans to tackle a widely reported crisis in young people’s mental health...attempt to stop any psychological difficulties deepening into lifelong issues.,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/03/children-with-mental-health-issues-to-get-more-help-but-not-until-the-2020s,"Children suffering from anxiety and depression will be offered counselling at school under government plans to tackle a widely reported crisis in young people’s mental health. Pupils in England will be able to attend sessions with therapists at school or college in an attempt to stop any psychological difficulties deepening into lifelong issues.

Every school will also be required to appoint a teacher to co-ordinate improved support for the fast-growing number of children who are struggling mentally, many self-harming as a result of bullying, exam stress, dissatisfaction with their body shape, troubles at home and other factors.

The plans are included in a government green paper to be launched on Sunday by health secretary Jeremy Hunt and education secretary Justine Greening.

A new guaranteed maximum four-week waiting time for children with more complex problems to access NHS child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) will be phased in. That is a response to concerns that many vulnerable under-18s, including some who may be suicidal, are being forced to wait for care or even denied help because Camhs care is overloaded.

“Around half of all mental illness starts before the age of 14 so it is vital that children get support as soon as they need it – in the classroom. If we catch mental illness early we can treat it and stop it turning into something more serious,” said Hunt.

Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity YoungMinds, welcomed the plans. “We are facing a crisis in our classrooms and far too many children are not getting the support they need. Too often we hear from young people who have started to self-harm, become suicidal or dropped out of school while waiting for the right help,” she said.

The improvements will begin in 2019 and be backed by what the government says is £300m of new funding over several years, which is on top of the £1.35bn the coalition government allocated to children’s mental health up to 2020.

The National Association of Head Teachers, which represents most primary school heads, welcomed the four-week Camhs waiting time as an “extremely important step forward”. Under-18s are currently enduring waits of as long as 18 months, the NHS regulator said recently.

Around £215m of the £300m will fund the creation of mental health support teams in schools. Ministers intend that several thousand new “children and young people’s wellness practitioners”, therapists providing mainly cognitive behaviour therapy, will undertake most of the work with pupils, but with school nurses and educational psychologists also involved. Ministers hope that this increase in early intervention will reduce the number of children who go on to struggle mentally as adults.

However, the initiatives will initially be piloted to assess their effectiveness, so the new forms of support envisaged will not be available across England until an unspecified time in the 2020s. The government’s ambition is only that they have been put in place in a fifth of the country by 2022-23.

Dr Bernadka Dubicka, a children’s psychiatrist who chairs the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ child and adolescent faculty, said she was frustrated that more help would not be put in place sooner. While welcoming the four-week treatment pledge, she also queried where the extra mental health professionals would come from to provide speedier Camhs care. Official figures show that the number of specialist children’s psychiatrists working in the NHS in England has fallen since 2013.

Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, chair of the health select committee, welcomed the announcement but said she was keen to see more details. “We need to have a much greater focus on early intervention and prevention. Any money going into that is a good thing,” she said.

She welcomed better coordination between schools and the NHS, but said that some schools were already working well with the health service and others should learn the lessons from those places. “It’s often down to resourcing,” she said. “Most young people prefer to have these services delivered in a setting of school because it’s much easier to access. Children don’t necessarily want to feel stigmatised by a referral to psychiatric services.”

Catherine Roche, chief executive of the national children’s mental health charity Place2Be, said: “We welcome the commitment demonstrated by the green paper, and are heartened to see recognition of how vital it is to provide mental health support in schools. We believe that a ‘whole school approach’ to mental health is essential to build a culture of openness and understanding, with appropriately qualified mental health professionals available when needed.”

Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, the coalition’s mental health minister, said: “We published the Future in Mind report in March 2015. It was a blueprint for modernising children and young people’s mental health services. They have failed to drive the implementation of that blueprint. Why should we have any expectation that this will be any different? They should have just implemented it. At its heart it was all about linking schools much more closely with mental health services. Two years on, deja vu.”

Barbara Keeley, Labour’s shadow cabinet minister for mental health, said that the plans left “many unanswered questions”, including over funding and whether every school would be able to help every pupil who needed it. “The Tories’ record on children and young people’s mental health has been shocking, with a postcode lottery of provision across child and adolescent mental health services and many long waits for treatment,” she said."
An adopted 14-year-old girl is helping senior dogs find a forever home just like she did,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/02/us/teen-senior-dogs-adoption-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A 14-year-old girl has raised $14,000 for senior dogs who have been left behind with the goal of helping them find a forever home like she did when she was adopted.

Meena Kumar at nine months old was found abandoned in a basket on a college campus in Pune, India. After spending a year in an orphanage, she was adopted by a couple in Mumbai and brought to San Jose, California.

In Mumbai, Meena would watch over a litter of puppies at her home. When she came to the United States, almost every weekend included a trip to the Humane Society or to Muttville Senior Dog Rescue

Muttville is a cage-free dog rescue that gives senior dogs a ""second chance at life,"" according to their website. The organization was founded by 2016 CNN Hero Sherri Franklin and rescues about 1,000 dogs per year and runs mostly with the help of volunteers.

Meena first heard of the rescue from a neighbor whose dog had been adopted from Muttville. The neighbor shared stories of how senior dogs are often left behind in shelters. With tender love and care, those dogs can make great companions.

Meena Kumar pet sits in her home to raise money for Muttville Senior Dog Rescue.

17-year-old discovers planet 6.9 times larger than Earth on third day of internship with NASA,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/17-year-old-discovers-planet-on-third-day-of-internship-with-nasa.html,"During his junior year at Scarsdale High School in New York, Wolf Cukier landed a two-month internship with NASA. So during the summer of 2019, he traveled down to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

His first assignment was to examine variations in star brightness captured by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, known as TESS, as a part of the Planet Hunters TESS citizen science project. (The citizen science project allows people who don't work for NASA to help with finding new planets.)

Just three days into his internship, Cukier discovered a new planet.

NASA announced the news on their website this week, after confirming the teenager's work, submitting a paper that Cukier co-authored for scientific review and announcing the discovery of the planet, now named ""TOI 1338 b,"" at the 235th American Astronomical Society meeting.

""I was looking through the data for everything the volunteers had flagged as an eclipsing binary, a system where two stars circle around each other, and from our view eclipse each other every orbit,"" 17-year-old Cukier tells NASA. ""About three days into my internship, I saw a signal from a system called TOI 1338. At first I thought it was a stellar eclipse, but the timing was wrong. It turned out to be a planet.""

""I noticed a dip, or a transit, from the TOI 1338 system, and that was the first signal of a planet,"" Cukier explains to NBC 4 New York. ""I first saw the initial dip and thought, 'Oh that looked cool,' but then when I looked at the full data from the telescope at that star, I, and my mentor also noticed, three different dips in the system."""

Lawyer fighting palm oil among 6 to win environmental prize,https://news.yahoo.com/lawyer-fighting-palm-oil-among-6-win-environmental-090518700.html,"BOSTON (AP) — When Alfred Brownell arrived in a remote Liberian village, the surrounding tropical rainforest had been leveled by bulldozers. Burial grounds were uprooted, religious shrines were desecrated and a stream people depended upon for water was polluted.

Brownell, an environmental lawyer and activist, blamed the devastation on the palm oil company Golden Veroleum Liberia. The company had been given a green light in 2010 by the government to expand in the country and was poised to turn more than 800 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) of lush forest into palm oil plantations.

Brownell on Monday was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize for exposing alleged abuse by the company and helping to prevent it from converting about 20 square miles (about 50 square kilometers) of forest that is home to elephants, pygmy hippopotamuses and chimpanzees.

He said he was forced to flee the country in 2016 after the government threatened to arrest him for his activism.

""It was total annihilation,"" said Brownell, now a visiting scholar at Northeastern University's School of Law in Boston.

""It was just not that they were destroying the forest, destroying habitat for species and everything,"" he said. ""They had also a system where they were working with the local government officials who were threatening, harassing and intimidating the communities.""

A spokesman for the company, Randall Kaybee, acknowledged in a statement that ""there have been lapses in following its own operating procedures, resulting in grievances among some communities and in the inadvertent clearance of some high carbon stock forest areas."" He said measures have been put in place to address these problems.

Gregory Coleman, who now heads Bureau of Concessions under Liberia's current government, said authorities are working to avoid past problems like those that arose with Golden Veroleum.

""A green Liberia is the ultimate goal of this government and we have agreed to halt all expansions until we can line up all the requirements in accordance to international best practices,"" he added.

Story continues

For his work saving forest lands, Brownell won the Goldman prize along with five others for grassroots environmental activism. The prize was created in 1989 by the late San Francisco philanthropists Richard and Rhoda Goldman. Winners are selected from nominations made by environmental organizations and others. The prize carries a $200,000 award.

The other winners are:

— Linda Garcia of Vancouver, Washington, who rallied local communities to successfully prevent the construction of North America's largest oil terminal.

— Ana Colovic Lesoska of North Macedonia, whose seven-year campaign helped stop hydroelectric projects from being built in the country's largest national park and home to the endangered Balkan lynx.

— Bayarjargal Agvaantseren of Mongolia, who led the fight to create the 2,800 square miles (7,300 square kilometers) Tost Tosonbumba Nature Reserve. It is the country's only federal reserve for snow leopard conservation.

— Jacqueline Evans of the Cook Islands, whose work led to the conservation and sustainable management of all 763,000 square miles (1.98 million square kilometers) of the Cook Islands' ocean territory and creation of 15 marine protected areas.

— Alberto Curamil of Chile, a jailed indigenous activist who had protested several hydroelectric projects in the country. His efforts were credited with halting two projects and protecting a critical ecosystem surrounding the Cautin River.

Despite Brownell's campaign, palm oil development remains a threat in Liberia as mostly Southeast Asia companies move to expand their operations beyond Malaysia and Indonesia to West Africa.

Golden Veroleum, one of the largest palm oil companies in the country, still holds the concession it signed with the government in 2010 to develop 800 square miles (2,000 square kilometers). Kaybee said the company is confident it will able to develop ""a significant part"" of the land in its concession while conserving forests.

Supporters say Brownell deserves much of the credit for forcing palm oil companies to change the way they do business in Liberia.

""He has compelled the oil palm companies to undertake robust diligence. He changed the mindset of oil palm companies operating in Liberia forever,"" said Francis Colee, head of programming for the nongovernment organization Green Advocates International that Brownell founded. ""Everywhere, the oil palm companies are now trying to uphold their international commitments or deforestation rules.""

Tiny goldfish weighing just ONE GRAM becomes UK's smallest ever surgery patient as vet removes tumor from its belly in 40-minute operation,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7472969/Goldfish-weighing-just-ONE-GRAM-UKs-smallest-surgery-patient.html,"A goldfish weighing just one gram has become the UK's smallest ever surgery patient after vets removed a tumour from its abdomen.

Molly the fish was rushed into the practice after its owners noticed a large lump on its belly.

Staff at Highscoft Vets in Bristol immediately diagnosed a tumour and prepared Molly for surgery.

The emergency procedure saw vets catheterise the goldfish's mouth before anaesthetising Molly and remove the mass within 40 minutes.

The vets, who normally operate on the likes of iguanas, snakes and crocodiles, says the goldfish is the smallest animal to go under the knife.

Molly the goldfish is shown lying in a water solution with a catheter placed in its mouth to keep it alive during the delicate procedure

The emergency procedure saw vets catheterise the goldfish's mouth before anaesthetising Molly (shown here) and remove the mass within 40 minutes

The operation, which cost the owners less than £100, was hailed a success after Molly woke up within minutes of the anaesthetic being stopped and returned home the same day.

Exotic species vet Sonya Miles said: 'It's not common across the UK to bring your fish to the vets but it is here. We are seeing more and more fish which is great.

'It used to be the odd one or two every few months but more and more people are realising we are happy to see them.

'Although it looks like a goldfish its actually an exotic fish from the molly species although it does look incredibly like a goldfish.

'A couple had been given the molly fish by an elderly neighbour but after a few weeks they noticed a lump on her underbelly and brought her in.

'It was definitely the smallest animal we've seen here. It barely registered on our scales.

Molly the fish was rushed into the practice after its owners noticed a large lump on its belly (circled above)

The operation, which cost less than £100, was hailed a success after Molly woke up within minutes of the anaesthetic being stopped and returned home the same day

'Both modern and veterinary medicine has advanced over time so we're able to perform

'It's a pretty simple procedure and took no longer than thirty or forty minutes. We submerged the fish in a container of anaesthetic solution.

'Once the righting reflex is lost and the fish is asleep it was the laid on the operating area.

'The fish is kept wet, the mouth is catheterised and different concentrations of anaesthetic are injected over the gills to keep the fish at a stable level of anaesthesia.

'The area covered with a water proof paste as stitching the skin closed isn't a possibility. The fish was then woken up in fresh oxygenated water.

'The operation was a success as we were able to remove the tumour before it started to upset its balance.

'You definitely have to have steady hands and good eyesight. It was definitely a team effort.

'We're glad to have been able to help the fish before the tumour started to upset its balance.'"

After finding out she has stage 2 breast cancer, Jillian Hanson thought it would only be fair for both her and her then-boyfriend of three years, Max Allegretti, if she’d give him the heads up that times will get really hard and if he’s not ready for it, it would be okay to leave then. “Jillian told me that it was going to be hard and that she did not know what to expect with everything and if I couldn’t handle it, she wanted to know now,” he said. But Max didn’t actually see that as an option and stuck by her through two years of treatment.No matter who you are or where you live, life seems to give a fair share of lemons to everyone. It could be a single fruit or an enormous handful but you can be sure of one thing only – you will definitely get it. Jillian Hanson from New Jersey got her handful when she found out she had cancer. Knowing times would get pretty rough, she decided it would only be fair to her and her boyfriend as well if he knew it wouldn’t be easy and take his chance to leave before it gets really rough. The man did not blink for a second and stayed by her side through the worst. Little did she know he had a very special surprise planned for the already special day of her last chemo.Instead of choosing an easy way out like she suggested, he stuck by her through two years of treatment. And popped the question on her last day of chemo to which she, of course, said yes!“I talked with Jill’s friends and family, and we decided how we could make her last day of chemo even better,” he said. “And then we planned everything out for the proposal with Memorial Sloan Kettering, the hospital where she was receiving treatment.” He asked for her hand in marriage on February 28, 2018, surrounded by her family, friends, and nurses.Even though they had talked about getting married before Jillian got her diagnosis, it came as a big shock to her. “I was so surprised that he decided to propose on a day that was already so special. It was such an exciting bonus that we were now celebrating two amazing milestones!” she said.After hearing their story, wedding planner Lauren Grench offered her services for free and got vendors to donate their services as well.The couple tied the knot on October 18th, surrounded by friends and family."
"This undersea robot just delivered 100,000 baby corals to the Great Barrier Reef",https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/undersea-robot-just-delivered-100-000-baby-corals-great-barrier-ncna950821,"With oceans growing warmer and more acidic as a result of climate change, the world’s coral reefs are under siege. Recent research shows that the number of coral bleaching events has risen drastically in recent years, and in 2016 and 2017 about half of the coral making up Australia’s Great Barrier Reef died off.

But researchers at two Australian universities have developed an underwater robot that could help turn the tide in the ongoing struggle to save at-risk reefs. The briefcase-size submersible, dubbed LarvalBot, is designed to move autonomously along damaged sections of reef, seeding them with hundreds of thousands of microscopic baby corals.

“The reduced number of corals means we’ve lost the ability for coral to provide enough larvae to settle and restore these communities quickly,” said Peter Harrison, director of the Marine Ecology Research Centre at Southern Cross University and the leader of the coral restoration project. “The idea here is to use an automated technique that allows us to target delivery of the larvae into damaged reef systems and increase the efficiency that new coral communities can be generated.”

Harrison’s team recently tested LarvalBot at Vlasoff Reef, an outer part of the Great Barrier Reef along Australia’s northeastern coast. In the trial run, the submersible dispersed 100,000 baby specimens derived from corals that survived the bleaching event of 2016-17, which are believed to be especially tolerant of warmer ocean temperatures.

Future versions of the bot should be able to disperse millions of baby corals in order to speed the regrowth of damaged reefs, Harrison said, adding that the team is also planning to test LarvalBot on a reef in the Philippines.

But the researchers will have to wait and see if the microscopic baby corals take hold.

“We can’t actually see the results of these experiments until we start to see juvenile corals grow — so, for at least six to nine months,” Harrison said. “What we’ll be doing now is monitoring the reef over the coming months.”

LarvalBot is based on another submersible robot known as RangerBot, which was designed not to deliver babies but to kill a coral-eating species of starfish. RangerBot was developed and built by Matthew Dunbabin, an engineering and robotics professor at Queensland University of Technology, who also reworked the RangerBot to carry the baby corals.

Harrison hopes to eventually develop a fleet of LarvalBots that would be used to repopulate reefs around the world, though he is unsure how much such a project would cost.

Mark Eakin, the College Park, Maryland-based coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Watch program, called Harrison's project an ""excellent idea"" but questioned the effectiveness of underwater robots in tackling a global problem like coral loss.

“The area of coral reefs hit by significant mortality is about the size of the state of West Virginia,” Eakin said. “Now, imagine dividing the state of West Virginia across the entire Pacific Ocean. We need to be doing everything we can to protect coral reefs, but we have to keep in mind that this problem is absolutely huge compared to what these robots can do.”

Eakin said saving reefs will ultimately require addressing the root cause of the problem: climate change.

“Even if this technology is scaled up, if we don’t deal with climate change, it won’t be enough,” he said. “It’s like coming up with a robot to replant trees after the devastating wildfires that just happened. It’s not addressing how to stop the wildfires in the first place.”

Canada reports no new deaths from coronavirus for the first time since March,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/canada-zero-coronavirus-covid-deaths-first-time/,"Canada reported no new deaths from COVID-19 on Friday for the first time in six months. The last time the country reported no new deaths from the virus on March 15, at the start of lockdowns in North America due to the pandemic, Reuters reports.

As of Friday evening, over 6 million people had been tested for COVID-19 in Canada, 2.1% of which came back positive. Some 702 new cases were reported on Friday, but no new deaths, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, Quebec reported one new death on September 11, but Ontario removed a previously reported death. That meant the number of deaths reported, 9,163, remained unchanged from the previous day.

As the numbers improve, ""I am reminded of the ways Canadians have pulled together to reduce the spread of COVID-19,"" Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, said Thursday in a statement. ""We have been physically apart from each other in order to plank the curve, but we have found new ways to be together, and connected, while at a distance.""

The majority of cases, 80.0%, and deaths, 93.7%, have been reported by Ontario and Quebec.

Coronavirus fatalities spiked in April and steadily increased until July, data from the country's health department shows, before starting to plateau over the summer. 71.3% of deaths in Canada were people over the age of 80.

Several Canadian provinces have started easing lockdown restrictions, as schools reopen for in-person classes, resulting in a recent spike in cases.

Compared to the U.S., its southern neighbor, Canada has had fewer coronavirus infections and deaths. The country has 137,676 COVID-19 cases and 9,214 deaths as of Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Comparatively, the U.S. surpassed 6.4 million cases and 193,000 deaths as of Saturday."

Coke & Pepsi to end partnership with Plastics Industry Association Lobby - increasing recycling & reusability goals.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/business/coke-pepsi-plastics/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, two major sellers of plastic bottles, have made sweeping sustainability commitments . Now they are stepping away from a plastics lobbying group .

Both soft drink companies are trying to increase the amount of recycled plastic they use in bottles. They want to improve recycling infrastructure and ensure their packages are recyclable.

But the Plastics Industry Association has ties to the American Progressive Bag Alliance, which encourages states to make plastic bans illegal. Participation in the association could tarnish Coca-Cola and Pepsi's images as companies working to find solutions to plastic pollution.

The association took positions that ""were not fully consistent with our commitments and goals,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement last week, noting that it withdrew from the group earlier this year. Pepsi said it had joined the association to learn about innovation as it works to ""achieve a circular economy for plastics.""

""We do not participate in the policy advocacy work of the association or its subsidiaries, and our membership will conclude at the end of this year,"" Pepsi said.

Coke and Pepsi ""made the wrong choice"" by being a part of the lobbying organization, said Dianna Cohen, CEO of the nonprofit Plastic Pollution Coalition. The optics of membership, she added, ""are really bad.""

Plastic pollution is a major problem.

Cutting ties with the Plastic Industry Association is a sign that ""companies understand that they cannot publicly say they want to end plastic pollution, while financially supporting an association that lobbies for our continued reliance on throwaway plastics,"" said Greenpeace USA Oceans Campaign Director John Hocevar in a statement.

The move may help reassure some customers. But as people grow more worried about the negative impacts of plastic pollution on the environment as well as on animal and human health, companies like Pepsi and Coke will have to go even further to find a solution.

Tackling plastic pollution

Both companies are trying to figure out ways to reduce their use of virgin plastics and increase recycling. They're also exploring alternatives to plastics, like aluminum, that are easier to recycle.

PepsiCo announced recently that its Aquafina-brand water will be sold in aluminum cans at US fast food and restaurant chains as soon as next year. The company is testing out a broader rollout to retail stores.

""Tackling plastic waste is one of my top priorities and I take this challenge personally,"" PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said at the time. ""We are doing our part to address the issue head on by reducing, recycling and reinventing our packaging."" Pepsi has committed to using only recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging by 2025, and it's pledged to make new plastic bottles using 25% recycled material.

Plus, Coca-Cola last year launched a World Without Waste initiative that encompasses its recycling goals , which include collecting and recycling the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells by 2030. The company has also committed to making its bottles and cans out of at least 50% recycled material in the next 11 years.

The companies are also exploring refill stations that eliminate single-use packaging altogether.

Pepsi is selling a high-tech water cooler that lets customers fill up their own bottles with flavored or unflavored, still or carbonated water in varying temperatures. Coca-Cola has launched a similar product for Dasani on college campuses.

Leaving the lobby

Those initiatives made membership in the plastics trade group problematic, at least from a PR standpoint. The Plastics Industry Association is not only a lobbying group. Some of its initiatives, like helping recycling, may overlap with those of Coke and Pepsi.

""Our members work together to align their efforts to put recycling and sustainability at the forefront of their businesses,"" said Patty Long, interim president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, in a statement.

The plastics association says it does not itself lobby for legislation that bans plastic or hold an official position on those laws. It says that it operate separately from the bag alliance and has different memberships and dues.

But a page on the association's website redirects to the bag alliance site, and the contact email for the bag alliance has the same suffix as the association's. An association representative declined to share how the groups are connected.

Activists started pressuring Coke, Pepsi, and other companies to leave the plastic association last year.

The shareholder activist group As You Sow and Walden Asset Management called attention last year to corporate involvement with the Plastic Industry Association, and wrote letters to the CEOs of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, among others.

This year, Greenpeace also drew a line between the Plastic Industry Association and anti-plastic ban laws.

The plastics association said Greenpeace is responsible for companies' withdrawal from the group.

""We are aware that several prominent brands that are members of the association have been targeted by a persistent Greenpeace activist campaign to pressure them to leave our association,"" Long said, calling the efforts ""unfortunate.""

"The Last Of The Whales Have Finally Been Freed From Russia's Notorious ""Whale Jail""",https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/the-last-of-the-whales-have-finally-been-freed-from-russias-notorious-whale-jail-/,"Russia’s notorious “whale jail” is no more.

Following a huge international backlash, the last of the belugas housed at the “whale jail” on Russia’s Far East coast have been released into the wild, according to a statement from the Russian Federal Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO). An estimated 10 orcas and 87 beluga whales were once held at the facility, which consisted of cramped, ice-covered enclosures in a gloomy bay near the Pacific port of Nakhodka.

The situation first made headlines in November 2018 when conservationists shared drone footage of the whales’ enclosures (video below). The video quickly went viral, sparking an international outcry from activists and even some high-profile celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio. The Russian government was relatively receptive to the criticism, with President Vladimir Putin himself asking his government to investigate the whale enclosures.

Following a lengthy investigation, prosecutors eventually deemed the enclosures illegal and ordered the company to release the whales, along with a fine of 28.1 million rubles ($432,000).

-

The whales have since been steadily released in several batches starting in early summer, with the last of the orcas being freed in August. On November 10, 2019, authorities stated that the release of the last belugas into the Bay of Uspeniya had been completed successfully.

“During transportation, the animals behaved calmly, their behavior was monitored by scientists, veterinarians and experienced trainers,” VNIRO said in a statement. “Three large individuals have satellite tags that will allow scientists to monitor the movement of animals in the wild.”

However, the move has received some criticism. Conservation group Free Russian Whales notes that two of the belugas that were being transported currently remain unaccounted for. The Whale Sanctuary Project also argues that the choice of location, the Bay of Uspeniya, could put whales at risk of poaching and natural hazards.

“This outcome is not ideal for the belugas, since this is not their normal habitat or the area where they were captured,” Jean-Michel Cousteau and Charles Vinick of the Whale Sanctuary Project said in a statement. “Nonetheless, we trust the intention of Russian government authorities to release the belugas, despite limitations due to the availability of ships, inadequate finances, and weather conditions.”

“We also hope that visual monitoring will help reduce concerns about threats from North Korean fishing vessels that we understand are poaching in the area and that the Russian government will do what is necessary to protect the belugas from repeat capture.”

While the situation might not be ideal, a worse fate was facing the captured orcas and belugas. It’s thought the animals were illegally caught last year to be sold to marine parks and aquariums in China, where the captive orca park industry is booming."
Church wipes out $46.5 million in medical debt,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/02/24/crossroads-church-nonprofit-wipe-out-46-5-million-medical-debt/4854753002/?fbclid=IwAR1MMDWZKi9U_rQ8bwSZB_irls6Ejjqgu4oMrZuozZ23yI8qG5tIEKw59-s,"Crossroads Church leverages donations to wipe out $46.5 million in medical debt

Madeline Mitchell | Cincinnati Enquirer

Crossroads Church senior pastor Brian Tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing.

He spent about three minutes describing the burden of medical debt during his Nov. 23 sermon, entitled “The Marks of Multiplication.” Tome said members of the congregation could text “MULTIPLY” to 313131 to help “free others from medical debt,” but insisted the campaign was not a challenge.

Just an awareness.

It was also a great metaphor for his lesson on multiplicity.

“When we are in debt, a sin debt to God, we can’t get our way out of the sin debt to God,” he said during the sermon. “Jesus comes and gives himself so we can pay off our sin debt, so we never have to worry about God hurting us for our sin.”

Crossroads could give to free others' debt, too, he said. And for every dollar they raised, Crossroad's partner RIP Medical Debt would leverage that dollar to abolish $100 in medical debt, therefore multiplying the church's impact.

Within a week and a half, members of the Crossroads community donated enough to abolish over $46.5 million in medical debt nationwide.

Over $42 million of those funds came back to Ohio families.

“Most of it probably that weekend,” said Crossroads director of marketing Brennan Hill. “'Cause I think most people, if I had to guess, were doing it in real time. You know, if they were literally getting their phones out and texting in.”

Church officials announced the impact of their campaign Sunday morning.

Most of the funds came back to Ohio families since the church is based out of the Cincinnati region. But the sermons are streamed online, which means anyone in the nation can tune in and participate.

RIP Medical Debt is able to track the donations back to their original ZIP codes to give back. So, if you donated from Indiana, your donation was multiplied and given back to your community in Indiana.

In Ohio, church officials say, they have abolished $42.8 million in debts across 41,233 households in 103 ZIP codes.

They also abolished $1.9 million in debt across 2,974 Kentucky households, $1.5 million across 503 Tennessee households and $200,000 across 136 Indiana households.

What is RIP Medical Debt?

An article posted by USA Today last year explains that RIP Medical Debt is a nonprofit organization based out of Rye, New York, that arranges debt payoffs.

The article said medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll showed that of the 26 percent of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59 percent reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings.

“How sad that probably the only debt that you don’t choose to get – 'cause you don’t choose to get sick – and it’s the one that’s affecting most people,"" said Victor Martinez, spiritual growth site leader for the Oakley location.

When a person can’t pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people’s debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. RIP Medical Debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors.

But instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.

To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level (about $25,000 a year for an individual and $52,000 for a family of four), have debts that are 5 percent or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.

Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap.

Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of around 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.

A debt that never goes away... even if you don't know about it

According to the Federal Trade Commission, debt collectors have a certain number of years they can sue you and win to collect a debt. This rule is called the statute of limitations, and is six years in Ohio.

This means that for any type of debt, a creditor cannot sue a debtor for debt collection purposes after six years, according to America's Debt Help Organization. That timeframe begins when someone fails to make a payment on a debt. The clock will start again if you make a payment or provide written acknowledgment of your debt after the first six years are up.

Martinez says that because of this law, many people who got a letter explaining that their debt had been abolished thanks to Crossroads didn't even know they had medical debt. If it was after those six years, hospitals and debt collectors had stopped calling.

“If those six years pass, then nobody can give you a call asking for that money,"" Martinez said. ""But you still owe that money, technically. And the only way that you can really get rid of it is if you file bankruptcy, or if you pay for it.”

Medical debt never goes away. It will stay on your record if you don't pay it. The law just states that if you don't pay it within that six year window, people will stop asking you to pay – not that you are off the hook.

Martinez said that now that he understands how the law works, he's afraid to call and ask if he owes anything. Because, what if he owes a lot of money? He'll be accountable to pay it, he said.

“That is very scary,"" he said. ""Because what if I have medical debt that I don’t know about?”

'A great analogy to what Jesus did for us.'

Crossroads officials did not want this story to be about them.

“We kept it off social media,"" Hill said. ""We really want it to be about people in our community, like I said, who are currently giving.”

Crossroads members don't know who specifically they have impacted. They could not choose whose debt to pay off. In a letter to each debtor, Crossroads explained the campaign and said that they hope to provide more resources for those in need, whether that is through prayer or connecting them with healthcare professionals in their community.

“We don’t want this to be the last interaction that we have with them, but there are no strings attached,"" Hill said.""We just hope that they understand who Crossroads is, what our heart is for the community, maybe set foot in one of our sites.”

This whole experience has been a great analogy to what Jesus did for us, Martinez said.

""Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt,"" Martinez said. ""And here, we don’t know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven.""

According to RIP Medical Debt, Crossroads' campaign is its largest amount of medical debt that's ever been retired. The nonprofit's site claims that its partnerships have erased almost $1.4 billion in medical debt to date.

An Arizona man challenged 'bored teens' to pick up trash — and it went viral,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5054746/an-arizona-man-challenged-bored-teens-to-pick-up-trash-and-it-went-viral-1.5054748,"Read Story Transcript

Last week, Arizona's Byron Román posted before-and-after photos of a guy sitting in the middle of a wooded area.

The first picture shows the ground strewn with garbage. In the second picture, the ground is clean, all that garbage neatly collected into nine trash bags.

The post included a challenge to ""all you bored teens out there"" to follow his lead and collect trash at a nearby area requiring a bit of clean-up.

Since then, the so-called Trash Tag Challenge has gone viral.

""I just posted a photo for my friends to see, which is something I do every day just some inspirational, motivational words of wisdom I guess,"" he told As It Happens host Carol Off.

The Phoenix man's original post has been shared more than 300,000 times, and groups from all over the world have added their own before-and-after shots of their clean-up attempts.

""I came up with the 'bored teens' because lately all you see online is all these challenges of people jumping out of cars ... or the Tide Pod challenge, eating soap,"" he said.

""But if they're bored and doing something silly and dangerous, then they should do something positive for the Earth.""

At first, it was just a few likes and shares from Román's friends.

""As the day went along it just kept snowballing,"" he said. ""I think people saw it and liked the message.""

But Román wants to be clear that he didn't come up with the challenge — and it's not him in the original photo that he shared.

I think that trash tag is amazing - so cool to see all the people picking up their communities. I don’t do it in any sort of organized group or anything, because I prefer the quiet solitude of picking up a dozen bags of trash with just the wildlife in the mangroves as company 😍 <a href=""https://t.co/rsErq4G58M"">pic.twitter.com/rsErq4G58M</a> —@bobbydevito

The initiative was originally started by an environmental lighting company called UCO when their employee Steven Reinhold vowed to pick up 100 pieces of trash while out on a road trip.

Often when something like this goes viral, people will just share the original images without actually participating or contributing themselves.

But the #TrashTag (or #Basura, in Spanish) Challenge seems to have inspired action.

""Some of the participants are schoolteachers and they showed the picture to their students and encouraged them to go out and keep areas clean,"" Román said.

""It was very shocking and overwhelming for me to think, wow, people are doing what I suggested. And not just teens — it was all ages.""

Before and after. Makeup and clothes dumped near Moston Brook, now cleaned up 😀<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/litterpick?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#litterpick</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrashTag?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TrashTag</a> <a href=""https://t.co/9GsFIUORaI"">pic.twitter.com/9GsFIUORaI</a> —@AJDelusion

Given the typical life cycle of a viral meme, it's likely that the #TrashTag challenge will lose momentum at some point.

But Román thinks that the good generated by the meme so far will continue.

""At least the goal was met where an area was clean. I think more people are likely to keep an area clean,"" he said.

""So hopefully by cleaning up and keeping an area clean people will have pride and ownership of the planet and do more things about it and not get it dirty again.""

Some companies still paying Puerto Rico employees despite closed stores after hurricanes,http://abcnews.go.com/US/companies-paying-puerto-rico-employees-closed-stores-hurricanes/story?id=50986272&cid=social_fb_abcn&,"Several companies still paying Puerto Rico employees despite closed stores after hurricanes J.C. Penney, TJX, and Luxottica are paying employees of closed PR locations.

 -- Some companies with locations in Puerto Rico, where hurricanes have caused unprecedented death and destruction and power is not yet restored in many areas, have continued paying their employees despite store closures.

TJX, the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods, and Marshalls, J.C. Penney and Luxottica, the eyewear company behind Lenscrafters and Pearle Vision, have continued to pay employees based in Puerto Rico, even though some locations remain closed.

""We believe it is the right thing for us to do under these circumstances,"" TJX said in a statement to ABC News.

J.C.Penney continued paying employees, issuing cash paychecks while access to operable banks and ATMs were limited, J.C. Penney said in a statement to ABC News.

Nordstrom and Starbucks have also paid their employees while Puerto Rico locations have been closed in the wake of the hurricane destruction.

""We’re working to find opportunities to transfer employees who are interested in staying with the company and will offer some relocation assistance to any employee who needs it,"" Nordstrom said in a statement to ABC News.

Starbucks has started an employee assistance fund specifically for workers whose homes and families have been destroyed by the hurricanes in Puerto Rico.

Hurricane Maria made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on Sept. 20, destroying communities on the island after Hurricane Irma struck just a couple of weeks before.

A viral Facebook post under the hashtag “PuertoRicoStrong” highlighted some help that TJX provided their employees.

A father thanked the Marshalls parent company for continuing to pay his son even though the store where he worked has closed. He also wrote that the company gave his son supplies.

TJX did not disclose how many of its 29 locations in Puerto Rico have been closed.

Four of J.C.Penney's seven locations on the island remain closed and the company said employees of those stores are still being paid.

The company said it also delivered supplies, like water, food, and generators, for all 1,300 associates.

Nordstrom, the luxury department store chain, also paid Puerto Rico store associates after the devastation forced their one location on the island to close until further notice.

They company paid employees through Nov. 4th and then offered them a separation package. The employees had been receiving checks since the stores closed on Sept. 19th in anticipation of the storm, Nordstrom told ABC News in a statement. After the destruction, the company donated to relief efforts in addition to using its company employee relief fund.

The Nordstrom location will be closed until further notice because of hurricane damage.

Luxottica's eyewear brands have a sizable presence on the island -- 46 locations that include Oakley, Sunglass Hut, Lenscrafters, and Pearle Vision.

Despite thirty locations that remain closed, all 200 employees are being paid. Luxottica also started a Guardian Angel Fund to which company employees everywhere can make donations matched by the company, Luxottica told ABC News in a statement.

Starbucks Corp. initiated a similar effort called the Starbucks Puerto Rico Tacita Verde Fund, along with Baristas del Cairbe, a Puerto Rican coffee company that is a subsidiary of Empressas Fonalledas Inc. that licenses Starbucks on the island.

The program is a new fund for employee assistance that provides financial grants to employees and their families who need urgent home repairs, food and medical help, among other critical needs, Starbucks said in a statement to ABC News.

All Starbucks employees received temporary disaster pay the first week. Employees from still-closed locations have been moved to stores that have reopened.

In the statement, Starbucks said that 18 of its 24 locations have reopened, but they are keeping hours flexible for employees' safety amid the loss of power supply on the island.

Puerto Rico’s goal is to restore electricity for half of the island by mid-November and for 95 percent by mid-December, according to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello."
"San Francisco sends less trash to the landfill than any other major U.S. city - The city diverts about 80 percent of its waste from landfills, or more than 1.5 million tons every year. San Francisco aims to reach zero waste by 2020.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/how-san-francisco-became-a-global-leader-in-waste-management.html,"The average American produces about 4.4 pounds of waste per day. Roughly 1.5 pounds of that is composted or recycled, meaning the U.S. avoids sending just 34 percent of its waste to landfills, according to the EPA. San Francisco provides a much different narrative. Thanks to bold public policy and educational initiatives, the city diverts about 80 percent of its waste from landfills, or more than 1.5 million tons every year. Ultimately, San Francisco aims to reach zero waste. That means recycling, composting, reusing, and reducing consumption so that nothing goes to either the landfill or incineration. The city hopes to achieve this goal by 2020. But even if it doesn’t, San Francisco is already way ahead of other cities. For example, New York only diverts about 21 percent of its waste and Chicago is at about 10 percent.

How has San Francisco done it?

In 2009, San Francisco made recycling and composting a requirement for all businesses and residences. It passed the nation’s first mandatory composting law, and while a few progressive cities have followed suite, most haven't. San Francisco also banned environmentally hazardous items like checkout bags and Styrofoam. Debbie Raphael, director of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, said she's proud of how the city has used market incentives to drive behavior.

“If we can't ban the materials sometimes we'll put a charge on it,"" she said. ""We might ban a plastic bag and put a charge on using a single-use paper bag, because we're sending signals to the producers and to the users, to the consumers, that there's an easy, convenient, right way to do things.” To encourage behavior change, San Francisco initially set trash collection rates much higher than recycling and composting rates. While rates are more comparable now, residential bin sizes provide a behavioral nudge. Standard residential services include a 64-gallon blue recycling bin, a 32-gallon green composting bin, and 16-gallon black trash bin. Businesses are also charged according to the volume of waste they present. They receive discounts for using the green and blue bins, and are penalized if recyclables or compostables end up in the trash. Another key to San Francisco’s success is its exclusive partnership with waste management company Recology. Raphael said that working with one company eases the administrative burden and makes it possible to collaborate on long-term goals. New York, by comparison, has a private system for commercial waste, comprised of hundreds of competing waste collection companies. This makes it challenging for the local government to collaborate on citywide initiatives.

Behind the scenes

The final element that sets San Francisco’s apart is the sheer scale of its recycling and composting operations. All of the city's recyclables are brought to Recycle Center, a 200,000 square foot warehouse on Pier 96 that processes 40 to 45 tons of materials per hour. A team of 14 people work alongside high-tech screens, magnets and optical sorters to weed out contamination and separate the paper, metals and plastics. Similar materials are placed in a bale together, and shipped out to recycling plants both domestically and abroad. As for the compost, all of the city’s yard waste and food scraps are brought to Jepson Prairie Organics in Vacaville, about 60 miles northeast of San Francisco. Here, compostables are weighed, ground up and blended. Eventually, the nutrient-rich product is sold as fertilizer to vineyards in wine country and nut growers in the Central Valley.

Greg Pryor, general manager of Jepson Prairie, said this was one of the first facilities in the U.S. to compost food scraps. “When we started in ‘94-’95 with food, there wasn't anybody doing it on a commercial scale that we were processing, and a lot of naysayers in the beginning,"" he said. ""Today they can't argue with our success. It can be done.” Both Recycle Central and Jepson Prairie host national and international visitors, who are eager to learn how they can replicate San Francisco’s success. While San Francisco’s waste management system costs about $300 million annually, the program is funded solely through waste collection fees, which are no higher than average for the Bay Area.

"Muslim-led fundraiser nets $150,000 for funeral costs of synagogue shooting victims",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pittsburgh-shooting-muslim-led-launchgood-fundraiser-raises-money-for-funeral-costs-of-synagogue-shooting-victims/,"NEW YORK — A fundraiser organized by two Muslim-American groups for the victims of Saturday's deadly shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue reached its goal of raising $150,000 from about 3,600 donors in just over 48 hours. Some of the money is already on the way to victims and their families, and organizers say they hope to cover the funeral costs for all 11 people who were killed.

The fundraiser on the site LaunchGood is a joint effort by the groups Celebrate Mercy and MPower Change. It reached its initial goal of $25,000 in just under six hours after being launched Saturday afternoon, according to Tarek El-Messidi, founder of Celebrate Mercy, a group that teaches about the prophet Mohammed through education and charitable campaigns. The fundraiser welcomes contributions from donors regardless of faith.

""Initially it was intended to be a gesture of solidarity,"" said Linda Sarsour, the co-founder of MPower Change, in an interview with CBS News on Monday. ""We wanted to give more than just 'thoughts and prayers.'""

The organizers increased the fundraising goal several times to reflect the outpouring of giving, according to the fundraising page. On Monday morning, organizers transferred $25,000 via PayPal to the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh (ICP) for families of the victims at Tree of Life Congregation, the synagogue targeted in Saturday's attack. Another transfer is planned for Tuesday morning, according to El-Messidi.

""Right now, because in Jewish tradition funerals happen right away, the priority is to help with funeral expenses,"" El-Messidi said Monday. The group hopes to cover the entirety of all funeral expenses for each of the victims, El-Messidi said, noting that Jewish funerals in the Pittsburgh area cost roughly $10,000.

Wasi Mohamed, the executive director of the ICP, said Monday that the center was in touch with the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Tree of Life and local funeral homes to figure out how to distribute the funds.

""Pittsburgh is such a tight knit community and the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh are true friends of the Jewish community here,"" Josh Sayles, director of the Jewish Federation's community relations council, said in an interview. ""They have stepped up for us in countless ways. There's few things keeping us going right now, but this is at the top of the list.""

The fundraiser surpassed its goal of $150,000 on Monday evening. Organizers had said the goal wouldn't be increased unless the short-term needs of the victims' families exceed that amount, but kept the page open for donations beyond the $150,000 goal, saying any extra funds would be used only on ""projects that help foster Muslim-Jewish collaboration and solidarity.""

There are no limitations on how victims and families can use the money, Sarsour said.

LaunchGood, the crowdsourcing site hosting the campaign, is a five-year-old Muslim-centered platform for grassroot fundraising efforts. Unlike similar sites like GoFundMe, LaunchGood does not publish the names of donors or how much they give, reflecting a belief in Islam that ""the right hand gives, the left hand doesn't know,"" Sarsour said.

""In Islam, the idea of charity is something to strengthen your relationship with God,"" Sarsour said. ""It's supposed to be something that's secret. You're not suppose to flaunt it.""

Other groups have also been moved to charity after Saturday's shooting. A GoFundMe campaign supporting Tree of Life had raised over $742,000 from more than 12,000 donors as of Monday evening. The fundraiser was launched by GoFundMe user Shay Khatiri, an Iranian immigrant living in Washington, D.C., according to his GoFundMe profile."

On Thursday morning, 17-year-old Kayla Rose was walking her dog around her neighborhood in Irvington, New Jersey, when she heard someone crying for help.

The muffled sounds were coming from the trunk of a car parked on the street.

""I heard knocking and scratching on the trunk of the car, and I just backed up because I was scared,"" Rose told WABC in a recent interview. ""And then I heard it again. And then I said, 'Hello.' And he was like, 'Hello, can anybody help me?'""

Rose ran inside her house to tell her mother what she heard. She also alerted neighbors who came out to help and called 911.

""I got a crowbar and tried to pop the trunk, but it just bent the metal,"" neighbor Joe Bollaro told WABC. ""The cops were coming, so I didn't want to, I said, 'They're coming. Hold on.' I said, 'Can you breath?' He said, 'Yeah.'""

Police arrived on scene and opened the locked trunk. The man inside was then transported to a local hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, according to the Union County Prosecutor's Office.

""He was shaken up, he was beat up,"" Rose's mother, Marie Banks, told WABC. ""I guess he was very happy, thankful for my daughter that she found him.""

After a preliminary investigation, police learned the man had been carjacked, kidnapped and robbed the previous night in Hillside, about 3 miles south of Irvington.

Two gun-wielding suspects took the victim to local banks in the area and ordered him to withdraw sums of cash, then drove to Irvington, where they left him locked in the trunk of the car, according to the prosecutor's office.

JaVohn Berrouet, 24, was arrested on Friday and charged with carjacking, kidnapping, robbery and weapons offenses. Police said they found a ski mask and .45-caliber handgun at his residence. Police are still searching for a second suspect.

Owl hit and caught in SUV Survives - “Will make a full recovery”,http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/saskatchewan/owl-hit-and-caught-in-suv-survives-1.4468624,"Tahoe, the snowy owl, got his moniker with a bang, one so strong it caught him in the vehicle for which he's been dubbed.

Salthaven West, a Regina wildlife rehabilitation centre, often responds to reports of injured animals, but Thursday night's call was different from the norm, according to director Megan Lawrence.

""It's definitely common that owls and other wildlife get hit by vehicles, but this is the first time we've ever attended where one's still been stuck inside the vehicle after being hit,"" she said.

A driver was travelling south of Regina along the highway when she saw the owl fly into her SUV, and assumed the worst for the bird. After driving a few minutes into the city, she stopped to see if there was damage to the truck.

What she discovered instead was the bright white plumage of a snowy owl, caught within the grille of her Tahoe. She immediately called for assistance, with a local conservation officer contacting Lawrence to respond.

Salthaven West shared pictures of the snowy owl that was caught in the grille of a Tahoe, with people sending wishes for his speedy recovery. (Salthaven West/Instagram)

""The faster we get an animal for treatment, the better chance it has for recovery,"" Lawrence said. ""So I'm lucky I was just able to get over there right away and get him out.""

Rescue mission

With Thursday's temperatures dipping to as low as –30 C, Lawrence staged a frigid, but fast-acting rescue. Owls can typically be quite aggressive, but with the owl putting up little fight, Lawrence could tell he was badly injured.

When we first got him, he spent a lot of time laying down and now he's standing up all the time, which is a great sign. - Megan Lawrence, Salthaven West

She performed a brief triage before getting him to the Animal Clinic of Regina, where it was confirmed his wing was fractured. Of concern, however, was the severe head trauma he sustained, with a concussion making his recovery touch-and-go. Fortunately, things seem to be looking up.

""Over the last 48 hours, he's made great improvements,"" Lawrence said. ""When we first got him, he spent a lot of time laying down and now he's standing up all the time, which is a great sign.""

Recovery journey begins

The young male, whom they've been calling Tahoe, is in for at least a six-week minimum recovery period while his bone heals and stabilizes. Before being released, he will be given test flights to ensure he is strong, healthy and not suffering permanent vision damage as a result of concussion.

But Lawrence says she's cautiously optimistic Tahoe will make a full recovery.

""I think everyone involved made a difference and will definitely contribute towards getting him healthy and back out to the wild."""

Indian clerk funds school fees of 45 underprivileged girls in daughters memory.,https://thelogicalindian.com/get-inspired/karnataka-clerk/,"It is said that when you desire something truly, then the entire universe will find a way to make it happen. So it did for 45 girls from Kalaburagi, Karnataka. Mr Basavaraj, fondly called ‘God’ by these 45 girls, is paying for their education.

Mr Basavaraj works as a clerk at MPHS Govt High School in Kalaburagi’s Maktampura. He is sponsoring the education of 45 children.

ANI reported that last year, Basavaraj lost his daughter due to some health issues. As a tribute to Dhaneshwari, his daughter, he started paying for other children’s education in the school.

Speaking to ANI, Mr Basavaraj, said, “From this year I have started paying the fees of poor girls who study in this school.”

Humbled by his act of kindness, one of the students said, “We belong to poor families and the fees which we can’t pay is paid by our Basavaraj sir in memory of his late daughter. We wish his daughter rests in peace,” said Fathima, one of the girls whose education is being sponsored by Mr Basavaraj.

The Logical Indian community appreciates Mr Basavaraj and wishes that her daughter rests in peace. We are sure that she would have been proud of her father’s beautiful way of honouring her memory.

France is offering US scientists 4-year grants to move to the country and do research on climate change via a website called Make Our Planet Great Again.,http://www.businessinsider.in/France-is-offering-US-scientists-4-year-grants-to-move-to-the-country-and-do-research/articleshow/59056984.cms,"If you are an American scientist, student, teacher, or business person working on climate change solutions, France would love for you to stay awhile.

Following President Trump's June 2 decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement - a multi-country pact that acknowledges global warming poses serious threats to humanity and the environment - the French government has created an outlet for people from all countries who still want to fight climate change.

The website is called Make Our Planet Great Again Researchers, teachers, and students can apply for a four-year grant that allows them to continue their studies or instruction, fully financed. The site also provides information on how to move to France by obtaining a work visa and residency permit.

The website explains: ""You will be able to stay in France at least for the duration of the grant, and longer if you are granted a permanent position. There is no restriction on your husband / wife working in France. If you have children, note that French public schools are free, and the tuition fees of universities and 'grandes écoles' are very low compared to the American system.""

Businesspeople and heads of NGOs can also apply to receive funding from the federal government, which issues grants to organizations it considers deserving.

Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential election May 7. Since his victory, a video his campaign posted in February has been making the rounds on American social media. The Facebook video was addressed to American climate scientists who feel alienated by the Trump administration. Looking straight into the camera, speaking English, Macron tells American ""researchers, entrepreneurs, [and] engineers working on climate change"" that they have a home in his country.

""I do know how your new president now has decided to jeopardize your budget, your initiatives, and he is extremely skeptical about climate change,"" he said. ""I have no doubt about climate change.""Macron went on to promise robust funding for climate initiatives. In Europe, as a general rule, climate change is less of a political issue, with few major political parties arguing against established science.

Macron's opponent in the second round of the election, the far-right candidate Marinne Le Pen, was a bit of an exception to this rule. Le Pen opposed various environmental initiatives and did not acknowledge outright that humans are the primary cause of climate change.

Macron defeated Le Pen 66% to 34%.

Anonymous donor gives every household in an Iowa town $150 in gift cards for food,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/us/iowa-earlham-anonymous-donor-gift-cards-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Like most of the world, the residents of a small town in Iowa are stuck at home, feeling isolated, alone, and trying their best to stay positive during the coronavirus pandemic.

So when an anonymous donor gave everyone in the town of Earlham $150 worth of gift cards for food, the community received something more valuable than money: hope.

It started on March 26, when Earlham Mayor Jeff Lillie received a call from a friend who told him there was a donor interested in interjecting money into the town's economy. Earlham, population 1,450, is 30 miles west of Des Moines,

At first, the donor, who did not reveal their identity to the mayor, said they would buy 100 gift cards from three local businesses. An hour later, his friend called Lillie again and said the donor was bumping the number up to 250. An hour after that, the number was raised to 500.

""I said to him, at 500, you're darn near giving a gift card to every single household in Earlham,"" Lillie said. ""When I told him there were 549 households in town, he said 'Done.' And that was it. I was ecstatic because it made sure everyone would get a card.""

Bollywood film star Amitabh Bachchan has been hailed as a hero after clearing 40 million rupees (£438,000) worth of loans taken out by almost 1,400 farmers in his home state in northern India.

An ongoing agricultural crisis has seen India's farmers hit hard by a drop in commodity prices, stagnant wages, record fuel prices and high fertiliser costs.

Bachchan, one of Indian cinema's most revered actors, wrote in his blog this week that he had helped 1,398 farmers from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and felt a 'sense of accomplishment'.

'Gratitude leans across to the desire of removing some of the burdens that farmers continue to suffer... and the inner peace it generates when the desired is completed,' he wrote.

The agricultural crisis has sparked rallies across the country this year calling for better prices for produce and loan waivers.

Farmers and other agriculture workers together make up about half India's 1.3 billion people.

'It is a very big problem that has left farmers across the country in dire straits,' Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Indian Farmers' Union) told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.

'The government policies are flawed and need an overhaul. We are fighting for that change but are thankful for any help that comes along the way.'

Tikait said Bachchan's gesture might have been symbolic but it meant a lot for farmers who were struggling to survive.

More than 12,600 farmers and agricultural workers committed suicide in 2015 alone, accounting for about 10 percent of all suicides in India, with almost 60 percent of suicides caused by bankruptcy and indebtedness, according to official data."

Missing 13-year-old Jayme Closs found alive in Wisconsin,https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/01/10/us/jayme-closs-missing-wisconsin-girl-found/index.html,"(CNN) Jayme Closs, a 13-year-old girl who vanished after her parents were found dead in their northwestern Wisconsin home, has been found alive, the Barron County Sheriff's Department said.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Department in Wisconsin notified the Barron County Sheriff's Department on Thursday that they had located Jayme alive.

She was found late Thursday afternoon in Gordon, Wisconsin, a town about 66 miles north of where Jayme was last seen, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said.

A suspect was taken into custody about 10 minutes after authorities found Jayme, the sheriff's office said.

Though authorities didn't immediately release more details, a woman told the Star Tribune in Minneapolis that Jayme approached her for help Thursday afternoon while the woman was walking her dog.

They rushed to a neighbor's home, where someone called 911, the Star Tribune reported.

Authorities have said they will hold a news conference Friday morning.

Jayme's aunt, Sue Allard, said her niece was in the hospital Thursday night.

""There was rumors earlier today, and I prayed and prayed, and they come to not be true,"" Allard told CNN affiliate WCCO reporter Mary McGuire. ""And I just shut myself totally down. I thought today was going to be the day, and then I find out two hours later that she's found and I just cannot believe this.""

Jayme vanished October 15, and her parents, James and Denise Closs, were found fatally shot in their home near Barron, a town of 3,300 people in northwestern Wisconsin.

Investigators say a mysterious 911 call led deputies to discover the bodies. The call was ""pinged"" to the Closs home. When the dispatcher called the number back, a voicemail greeting indicated the phone belonged to Denise Closs. The log does not indicate who made the 911 call, but the dispatcher heard yelling in the background.

Police arrived to find the door kicked in, but no one was there. Investigators said they believed Jayme was at home during the shooting.

""Finally, we want to especially thank the family for their support and patience while this case was ongoing. We promised to bring Jayme home and tonight we get to fulfill that promise. From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU!"" Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said in a statement.

""This case has been very trying on the family so please respect their privacy and we reunite them later tonight.""

Thousands of people joined search parties for months as investigators received thousands of tips. The FBI offered a cash reward for information on Jayme's whereabouts, and hunters in the area were urged to be on the lookout for clues.

In December, the Barron County Clerk of Courts Office dedicated its Christmas tree to Jayme. The decorations spelled out her name in big, glittery letters, and they included green bulbs and ribbons. The color green is often used to raise awareness of missing children.

In the days after Jayme's disappearance, law enforcement officials assured the public they believed she was alive and in danger.

Another of Jayme's aunts, Jennifer Smith, pleaded with those who knew where the girl was to contact the sheriff's department.

""Jayme, we need you here with us to fill that hole we have in our hearts,"" Smith said shortly after the girl went missing. ""We all love you to the moon and back. And we will never stop looking for you.""

The poor wolf was struck by a car in Israel several months ago and due to the fact that is was in the wilds of the rural countryside, he was all but sure to die from his wounds, which included a broken leg.

By chance, he was spotted by some people who decided to step in and take him to the nearest vet. They named him Oliel, and his recovery is truly remarkable. Suffering from a fractured leg and fearing for his life, vets went straight to work repairing his leg. It would not be a case of job well done, as he required four months to recover and be able to fully walk and run again, otherwise he would not be able to survive in the wild.

Luckily he made it through, and was released back into his native habitat! Just avoid the roads in future Oliel!"
A Kentucky dentist set up a mobile dental clinic so he could drive around offering free dental care to disadvantaged children in Appalachia,http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/health/cnn-hero-edwin-smith-kids-first-dental-services/index.html,"Barbourville, Kentucky (CNN) When Dr. Edwin Smith was a young dentist beginning his career in eastern Kentucky, he encountered many patients with rampant tooth decay.

""I saw a lot of patients who hadn't seen a dentist before,"" said Smith, a Kentucky native.

Appalachia has one of the worst dental health problems in the nation. And Kentucky has the third highest rate of tooth loss.

Smith treated patients who had tried to pull out their teeth with pliers; others had superglued their teeth back onto their gums. And he saw people who were sick from chronic infection.

But the most heartbreaking stories came from his youngest patients.

""I would see a lot of kids who had a mouth full of rotting teeth,"" Smith said. ""They were in pain, and they'd be hurting at school.""

So in 2005, Smith created a mobile clinic to bring free dental care to children in need.

Dr. Edwin Smith and his staff use a mobile clinic to bring free dental care to students across Kentucky

Since then, his nonprofit, Kids First Dental Services, has treated more than 43,000 children throughout Kentucky.

""(I hope) none of these kids ever have poor oral health and bad teeth as a barrier to keep them from moving up in life and bettering themselves,"" he said.

CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Smith about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: You were born and raised in Appalachia. What makes this region special to you?

Smith: What you see right away is the beauty. I think it's the most beautiful place I've ever been. We have the mountains and trees and lakes. We have lots of talented, resourceful people who live here—real craftsmen and just good, solid people.

The only disadvantage is there's not a lot of economic opportunity with jobs. Poverty is a serious issue. Unfortunately, when we make the news, most of the time it's talking about the poverty and the negative. People from Appalachia feel like they're stereotyped as toothless, barefoot and uneducated.

CNN: Appalachia does have some of the worst dental health problems in the country. Why do you think that is?

Smith: The number one issue is education. When I first started practicing, I would see babies being fed bottles filled with sugary drinks. Also, many people can't afford to get treatment done, and many of these families don't have the transportation that they need to access it.

JUST WATCHED CNN Hero Dr. Edwin Smith: Miles of smiles Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Dr. Edwin Smith: Miles of smiles 02:04

It's also the history here. People have been poor here in the past, and they didn't have means for taking care of their teeth. People have that fatalistic notion that, ""If my parents lost their teeth early, I'm going to lose mine anyway. So what's the point in getting them fixed?""

People let their teeth go. That's why it is so important to educate the kids. If you teach them early on, they'll take better care of their teeth and won't have these problems later on in life.

CNN: How did your nonprofit work evolve?

Smith: We wanted to help kids access preventative dental care, so we turned a trailer into a mobile dental clinic. At first we went to a couple schools. Then other schools around the county started asking us if we could come to see them. In a couple years, we had school districts all around Kentucky asking us to come and see their students.

We saw so much need that hadn't been met. Now, there are schools we go back to each year, and with every year we see more improvement in the oral health of these kids.

CNN: What services does your mobile dental clinic offer?

Smith: We provide free checkups for kids. We give them dental exams, clean their teeth, do x-rays when needed, apply fluoride, do sealants on any permanent molars that don't have decay in them. And we make a treatment plan of any other needs that they have—the restorative work or extractions they need done—because we don't have the ability to do invasive procedures in the mobile clinic.

The Hill family, patients of Dr. Smith, show off their smiles

That treatment plan is sent home to the parents. I do that follow-up treatment for any of the kids who are able to come to my private practice. But in some cases it's too far away, so we also provide a directory of local dentists in different areas who've agreed to provide follow-up care.

CNN: What does this work mean to you?

Smith: I felt like I had a calling to do this. It was just something that was laid out in front of me that needed to be done, and no one else was doing it. Just seeing that we're still making a difference keeps me going.

When I see kids at schools we've been providing treatment to for 10 years and how much the incidence of tooth decay in the kids there has been reduced, that's motivation enough.

I've had people get up out of their chair, look in the mirror, and cry. People who, before, wouldn't even let you see their teeth, and now they've got these big, wide smiles. That's one of the most rewarding things.

Medical marijuana saves five year old from seizures,http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/health/health-care-refugees-part-2/index.html,"This is the second part of a series on health care refugees. Read the first part here .

(CNN) Rich and Kim Muszynski know when their 5-year-old daughter, Abby, is about to have a grand mal seizure because her pupils enlarge, and she'll seem to fixate at something in the distance that only she can see.

Then it starts. Abby's extremities shake. She gasps for air.

By the time she turned 3, Abby had tried about eight different anti-seizure medications. None of them worked very well. Panicked to see their daughter getting worse and worse, the Muszynskis drove three hours to Orlando to see Dr. Ngoc Minh Le, a board certified pediatric neurologist and epileptologist.

Le told them that chances of another anti-seizure drug working on Abby were tiny. He recommended medical marijuana. The timing was right: Just months before, Gov. Rick Scott had legalized the use of a type of non-euphoric cannabis called Charlotte's Web.

The formulation had been a miracle for a little girl with epilepsy named Charlotte Figi. The Muszynskis had seen her story on Dr. Sanjay Gupta's CNN documentary "" Weed .""

Charlotte's Web did help Abby, but not as much as it had helped Charlotte. She still was having about two grand mal seizures a week, each lasting about eight to 10 minutes.

Le explained to Kim and Rich that Charlotte's Web has only tiny amounts of THC, one of the psychoactive ingredients in marijuana. Medical marijuana with higher levels of THC was Abby's best hope, he told them.

But at this point, in 2015, high-THC marijuana wasn't legal in Florida for Abby. To get it, the Muszynskis would have to move, leaving behind their friends and family, including two older children.

Kim thought about Colorado, where Charlotte Figi lived. She'd checked with parents of disabled children there, and they told her the state had a fair and efficient Medicaid program.

Getting to Colorado would be a challenge: Abby's doctors said it wasn't safe for her to fly on a commercial plane or to take a long car ride across the country.

The Muszynskis began their final fight with Florida Medicaid -- one that would leave Kim and Abby homeless for several days.

Kim says that in mid-August, she started talking to Medicaid officials about getting an air ambulance to Colorado. On September 19, Rich drove the family car out to Colorado. They planned for Kim to attend the closing on their house in Boynton Beach on September 23 and leave on the air ambulance with Abby that afternoon.

Kim had emailed and spoken with various Florida officials, and it seemed to her that everything was in order. ""Please give a call today so we can finalize travel arrangements!"" Mary Joyce, a senior registered nurse supervisor at Children's Medical Services at the Florida Department of Health, wrote in an email to Kim on September 20.

But then several days passed, and there was still no final approval for the transport.

Their house sold, Kim and Abby were homeless. They moved in with Kim's best friend and her husband. All of Abby's equipment, like her bed with guardrails, was with Rich on their way to Colorado. Kim slept with Abby on the floor.

Abby's cries at night kept Kim's friends awake. Kim wrote emails begging Florida officials for help. But for the first time, she added someone not previously included on the email: this CNN reporter.

Three days later, she learned that the transport had been approved.

A spokeswoman for Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration gave this statement:

""In this case relocation services are not covered by Medicaid, per federal Medicaid guidelines. However, thanks to Safety Net funds made available by Governor Scott and the Legislature, the state supported this family by covering the costs to provide relocation services via the air ambulance of the mother's choice. Working with the family, the state arranged transport as quickly as possible,"" wrote the spokeswoman, Mallory McManus.

Paramedics transport Abby Muszynski to the air ambulance that will fly her from Florida to Colorado.

On September 28, an ambulance picked up mother and daughter and brought them to Boca Raton Airport. Abby's grandmother and aunt said a prayer over Abby's stretcher as it was loaded on the plane.

As they prepared to leave, Kim said she felt like a refugee in her own country.

""I feel like I'm being forced out of my home,"" she said.

But when Kim and Abby arrived in Colorado Springs, Rich was there to welcome them to their new home.

'The most incredible thing I've ever seen'

Within a few weeks of arriving in Colorado, the Muszynskis felt like they'd been visited by not one but two miracles.

First, the high-THC marijuana has almost completely eradicated Abby's grand mal seizures. When they left Florida, she was having about two to four a week, each lasting about 8 to 12 minutes. In Colorado, she's had about one a week, and they last only a few seconds: Just a drop of high-THC marijuana oil under her tongue stops the seizures almost immediately.

""It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen,"" Kim said.

She hasn't had to go to the hospital for seizures in Colorado at all.

Abby Muszynski takes high-THC medical marijuana for the first time in Colorado.

The second miracle is that so far, Colorado Medicaid has paid for all of Abby's prescriptions and doctors' visits without a problem, a far cry from their experience in Florida. All the hours Kim spent fighting Medicaid can now be spent with her daughter.

Now that Abby is essentially free of grand mal seizures, she's made strides. She can grasp a fork. She can pick up a block and move it. These are small steps for a typical child but huge for Abby.

And more and more, her parents see her personality come out. She smiles and giggles more than she used to, at a balloon floating in the room or when her parents blow bubbles.

Kim and Rich wonder if maybe -- just maybe -- Abby will one day be able to learn some very rudimentary sign language to express what she wants. Maybe she'll be able to take a step with a walker and lots of support.

Despite Abby's improved health, it's been tough on the Muszynskis to be in Colorado. Two weeks after they moved, their elder daughter, Christina, FaceTimed Kim and Rich from Florida to show off her new driver's license.

Abby Muszynski and her older sister, Christina.

Kim rejoiced with her daughter, but she later broke down in tears, knowing that she'd missed this important milestone. She knows she'll miss other big days, like cooking Thanksgiving dinner with her daughter and shopping for a prom dress, and prom itself.

And recently Christina, who's living with her biological father, has been having dizzy spells and fainting. It pains Kim that she's not there to help her.

On November 8, six weeks after the Muszynskis moved to Colorado, Florida voters approved a ballot initiative giving more patients like Abby access to cannabis with higher THC levels.

And about two months before Kim and Rich left Florida, Medicaid started to give them enough doses of Diastat, the expensive anti-seizure medication they'd had to fight for.

Even so, the Muszynskis said they still would have made the choice to leave Florida.

The Medicaid system there was just too unreliable, they said. They never knew when it would stop paying for Abby's medicines or her equipment or her respiratory therapist or if it would kick her off the program altogether, as it did three times in less than three years.

""Florida was unable to meet the needs of our medically fragile child,"" Kim said. ""It ultimately could have resulted in her death.""

Kim Muszynski says Abby's improvement is ""the most incredible thing I've ever seen.""

Abby's not alone

There's a saying among Medicaid experts: When you've seen one Medicaid program, you've seen one Medicaid program.

That's because although there are federal standards, states have a great deal of leeway about how they manage their programs.

Nearly four out of 10 children in the United States are on Medicaid, and care in one state can look very different than care in another.

Though there are no official rankings of state Medicaid systems, experts say there are data that can help gauge quality.

For example, some state Medicaid programs pay doctors relatively low amounts, which means doctors are more likely to stop accepting patients on Medicaid.

Florida ranks the fifth lowest in the country in Medicaid payments, paying 13% lower than the national average, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute of payments made in 2014.

McManus, the spokeswoman for Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, noted that the Urban Institute numbers are based on fee-for-service physician rates, but the state's Medicaid program predominantly operates managed care plans. The state says it has transitioned to the managed care system over the past few years.

""These rates do not reflect how the majority of Medicaid providers are paid,"" she wrote.

Stephen Zuckerman, the lead author of the Urban Institute report, said there's not much difference between the amounts paid by fee-for-service and managed care, pointing to a report by the US Government Accountability Office (PDF), a nonpartisan agency that works for Congress, that shows only a 5% difference.

Critics of Florida's Medicaid program also point to a report (PDF) this year by a group led by Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, who's studied Florida Medicaid for more than a decade.

The small survey of pediatricians concluded that ""challenges exist for children enrolling in and accessing care through Florida's managed care system"" and that ""barriers to getting their patients the prescription and over-the-counter medications they needed were also a serious concern for pediatricians.""

In a letter to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune , Dudek, then the secretary of the state Agency for Health Care Administration, said the Georgetown report was biased, noting that the response rate was less than 1% of physicians participating in Medicaid.

Overall, advocates for families on Medicaid say Florida isn't the only state where doctors and parents have expressed dissatisfaction, noting that families have fled other states, not just Florida, in search of better Medicaid services.

""This isn't unique to Florida, but Florida certainly has serious problems,"" Alker said.

She said her heart breaks for the parents who must provide around-the-clock care to severely disabled children.

""These families already face incredible struggles,"" she said. ""These families are my heroes.

""They don't need the state of Florida making it harder for them,"" she added. ""The state of Florida should be making it easier."""

"Woman Carries Twins for Her Sister, Who Had 9 Miscarriages",http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/23275-woman-carries-twins-for-her-sister-who-had-9-miscarriages,"Melissa Kayser had lost hope of becoming a mom after having nine miscarriages – until her older sister stepped in.

Kayser, 33, had been trying to have a baby for three years when doctors finally suggested, after fertility treatments and IVF, that she should consider a surrogate.

“I was devastated because you think as women we are literally born to do one thing and that’s to reproduce and when you can’t do that one thing you feel like a failure,” Kayser told InsideEdition.com. “I didn’t know if I could emotionally handle another woman being able to carry my child.”

That's when Kayser’s sister, 35-year-old Lisa Auten, offered to carry a baby for her.

“I couldn't stand watching Melissa go through loss after loss,"" Auten told InsideEdition.com. ""She hurt so badly and she just wanted a child so bad. If I could help give her a family, then I was going to do it.""

Doctors recommended that the sister have two embryos implanted. No one was expecting both to take, however, because doctors said one of the embryos was poor quality.

But then came the news: It was twins.

“I think we were all a little bit shocked. My sister was telling them to count again,” Kayser said. “My sister had a really good pregnancy and very little complications. I got to be at all the ultrasounds and got to feel the babies kick. We did a gender reveal and we tried to make things fun and memorable.”

The baby girls, Tierney and Ashlynn, are now 6 weeks old.

The sisters, however, are still going through the process of getting Kayser listed as their official mom due to Nebraska law. Although the twins are biologically Kayser’s, Auten was listed on the birth certificate and Auten has to relinquish her parental rights to allow Kayser to ‘adopt’ her children.

The adoption will take place when the girls reach 6 months old.

Auten said she still doesn’t want to have kids of her own although pregnancy was a fun experience for her.

“I never saw myself being a mom. I enjoyed being pregnant, but the experience has not changed my mind,"" Auten said. ""I am just fine being an aunt.""

And Kayser is extremely grateful for the gifts her big sister has given her.

“Every day I am in awe. You hear women say you don’t really know love until you have children. They really do complete me,” Kayser said. “There’s never any words that I can say to thank her for what she did. She gave up a year of her life so that we could have a family. I could never repay.”

A female soldier became the US Army's first female Green Beret on Thursday.

The National Guard soldier graduated, earned her Special Forces Tab, and earned her Green Beret Thursday at a ceremony at Fort Bragg, North Carolina celebrating her and her classmates completion of Special Forces training.

US Army Special Operations Command is withholding identifying information about the woman due to mission security demands for special operations troops.

Video: Ex-SAS special forces soldier rates 11 military movie scenes

In a major achievement for women in the armed forces, a soldier became the US Army's first female Green Beret Thursday, US Army Special Operations Command announced.

The female National Guard soldier, whose name is being withheld due to mission security concerns for special operations troops, graduated from Army Special Forces training, received her Special Forces Tab, and donned her Green Beret at a socially distanced ceremony at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.

Commanding General for US Army Special Operations Command Lt. Gen. Fran Beaudette told the graduating class Thursday that ""from here, you will go forward and join the storied formation of the Green Berets where you will do what you are trained to do: challenge assumptions, break down barriers, smash through stereotypes, innovate, and achieve the impossible.""Â

""Thankfully,"" the general said, ""after today, our Green Beret Men and Women will forever stand in the hearts of free people everywhere.""

The soldier, a Special Forces engineer sergeant, first completed an initial 24-day screening program before heading into the yearlong Special Forces Qualification Course (Q Course), The New York Times, which first reported her graduation, reported Thursday.

She completed the final assessment, the culminating Robin Sage exercise that tests soldiers on skills essential to being a Green Beret, in mid-June.

Story continues

The Pentagon opened all combat positions in the armed forces to women in late 2015.

""They'll be allowed to drive tanks, fire mortars and lead infantry soldiers into combat,"" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said at the time. ""They'll be able to serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers, and everything else that was previously open only to men.""

Since then, women have begun to fill previously restricted roles, the exception being the Special Forces. These elite troops wage unconventional warfare, and their training is especially demanding. Special Forces has been one of the few remaining all-male warfighting communities.

While the woman that graduated Thursday is the first to become a Green Beret, she is not the first woman to graduate from the training program.

In the early 1980s, a woman named Capt. Kate Wilder completed Special Forces training, but she was forced out at the last minute. The Army later sent her a graduation certificate after an investigation upheld her discrimination complaint and determined that she was wrongfully denied graduation.

But Wilder, who left the Army as a lieutenant colonel in 2003, never joined the Green Berets.

""It isn't important that I wear the hat,"" she told the AP after graduating. ""I'm not at all hung up on a hat like a lot of the men are ... What matters is that I'm officially qualified.""

A senior Army official previously told Military.com that the woman who graduated Thursday ""excelled throughout the course and earned the respect of both her instructors and her peer group.""

"800,000 People Attempt to Plant 50 Million Trees to Break Guinness World Record",http://www.ecowatch.com/plant-50-million-trees-guinness-world-record-1917368877.html,"More than 800,000 people turned out Monday in India to plant trees in hopes of breaking a world record.

Uttar Pradesh officials distributed 50 million tree saplings across the state to help India increase its forest cover and to break the Guinness World record for the number of trees planted in 24 hours—which was set by Pakistan in 2013 with 847,275 trees—the AP reported. Students, lawmakers, government officials and others headed out to plant trees at designated spots along roads, rail tracks and in forested lands.

Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, told the AP that this record-breaking attempt would help spread awareness and enthusiasm about afforestation and conservation.

""The world has realized that serious efforts are needed to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate the effects of global climate change. Uttar Pradesh has made a beginning in this regard,"" he said.



The Indian government is encouraging all states to start tree-planting drives like the one in Uttar Pradesh. The government has designated more than $6.2 billion for this purpose alone. India pledged to push its forest cover to 235 million acres by 2030.

Sites where the saplings have been planted with be monitored through aerial photographs, Sanjeev Saran, senior forest official, told the AP. Normally, only 60 percent of saplings survive so it is important for the government to check how many are thriving or dying.

Auditors from Guinness World Records, working ""incognito"" according to Saran, are checking on the numbers of saplings planted.

""They are out in the field and are supervising the plantation drive,"" he said. ""We do not know who they are or where they are at this point in time."""
Holland has reduced the amount of plastic bags used by more than 70% since a 2016 law that banned all retailers and restaurants from giving them for free.,https://nltimes.nl/2017/04/18/dutch-ban-free-plastic-bags-sees-71-pct-drop-use,"The use of plastic bags dropped 71 percent since the Dutch government banned shops from giving them out for free in 2016, according to a report commissioned by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment on the results of the ban. Some 300 retailers were questioned about their experience with the free plastic bag ban, NU.nl reports.

Bakers and butchers estimated that about six out of 10 customers now bring their own bag. Department stores estimate about 40 percent. The ban on free plastic bags was introduced in the fight against litter. According to a study by Dutch public works department Rijkswaterstaat, the number of plastic bags that end up as litter decreased by 40 percent.

A total of 30 percent of retailers now offer paper bags, as an alternative to the plastic bag. In most cases the paper bag is offered for free. And while some retailers doubt whether paper bags are really more environmentally friendly, the ban on plastic did mean a 30 percent increase in sales for paper bag wholesalers.

Most retailers support the free plastic bag ban and only a small percentage still insist on giving plastic bags away with purchases. About 3 percent of market vendors and 5 percent of department stores still give bags away. All butchers, bakers and greengrocers adhere to the ban.

Market vendors charge an average of 6.9 cents per plastic bags. Department stores and small businesses charge around 10 cents per bag. In exceptional cases a plastic bag can cost up to 29 cents."

Illinois-based AveXis, a subsidiary of the Swiss drug giant Novartis, has agreed to provide Zolgensma, an intravenous gene therapy that requires only one dose, free to Natalia Boidi through a compassionate use program. She has spinal muscular atrophy, which kills more infants than any other inherited disorder.

A 2½-year-old Easton girl who was deemed ineligible for the world’s most expensive drug will get the $2.1 million medicine to treat her rare genetic disease, after all.

Afflicting one in every 6,000 to 10,000 babies, spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, attacks the neurons that control muscle function. Its most dire form kills most children by their second birthday.

Natalia can’t swallow liquids, has a feeding tube inserted into her abdomen, uses a breathing machine at night, and often needs her parents to clear mucus from her airways with a suction device. During a reporter’s recent visit to her house, she watched TV with an oxygen monitor tethered to the big toe on her right foot.

Before the drug won Food and Drug Administration approval on May 24, AveXis had been providing it free to some patients under its compassionate use protocol. But the program was limited to children with Type 1 SMA, the worst form of the disease. Based on Natalia’s medical records, the Novartis subsidiary concluded that she had Type 2, a milder form, and denied her application.

But after receiving more documentation from Natalia’s neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital after the Globe story was published, AveXis concluded the toddler did indeed have the worst form and was entitled to receive Zolgensma as an experimental drug.

“We are pleased that we are able to treat this child” under the program that AveXis set up with the FDA “now that we have received the proper documentation,” a company spokeswoman said in an e-mail to the Globe.

Although the compassionate use program ended the day the FDA approved Zolgensma, Natalia and several other patients were already in a queue to receive it if deemed eligible, AveXis said.

Natalia is expected to get the medicine later this month, according to the staff of her neurologist, Dr. Kathryn Swoboda.

The FDA approved Zolgensma for all forms of the disease, but only for children up to the age of 2. The compassionate use program made the drug available free to Type 1 patients older than 2 if they weighed less than 29 pounds and met other criteria. Natalia weighs 26 pounds.

Swoboda said she believes the turn of events illustrates that the way the medical world classifies the four forms of spinal muscular atrophy may need to change.

There was never any doubt in her mind that Natalia had the worst form, Swoboda said. Natalia began gasping for air in 2017, when she was about five weeks old, and had a breathing tube temporarily inserted into her throat. She spent more than two months in the pediatric intensive care unit at Mass. General.

But since late 2017, Natalia has received 10 injections of an earlier breakthrough drug, Spinraza, sold by the Cambridge biotech Biogen. Approved the year before, Spinraza was the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. It’s injected into the spinal canal and helps make more of a protein that controls muscle movement.

That drug doesn’t come cheap, either: It’s $125,000 for each 5-milliliter dose. Patients need six doses the first year, at a cost of $750,000, and three doses every year afterward, at an annual expense of $375,000.

Spinraza saved Natalia’s life, Swoboda said. But the girl’s survival and ability to sit briefly now, the neurologist said, evidently led AveXis officials to incorrectly believe she had the less severe form of the disease and didn’t need Zolgensma.

“I think it’s the right decision,” she said of AveXis’s change of heart. “I personally believe she will have a significant added benefit from the gene therapy. Spinraza has helped her tremendously. But she has a lot of ongoing medical issues.”

In clinical trials, Zolgensma helped infants and young children breathe on their own and achieve motor milestones, like sitting up without support.

AveXis hardly wants more controversy about Zolgensma. Last Tuesday, the FDA disclosed that the company had delayed disclosing to the government that one or more people at the subsidiary had manipulated animal testing data for the gene therapy, although the agency said the drug should remain on the market.

A group of senators, including presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, subsequently blasted Novartis in a letter to the FDA. The data manipulation, they wrote, “smacks of the pharmaceutical industry’s privilege and greed.”

The FDA has said it’s considering whether to bring civil or criminal penalties against Novartis and its subsidiary.

Ten Tons of Trash Removed from Mount Everest,https://www.breakingasia.com/news/ten-tons-of-trash-removed-from-mount-everest/,"“Waste is a taboo in our society, considered as dirt,” mused Ujen Wangmo Lepcha of Moware Designs, which upcycles rubbish into light fixtures and glasses.

“When they see these kind of products they are like ‘wow’, these things can be made and it is possible,” she explained.

Their products are now used in upmarket hotels, restaurants, and homes around the capital, and Lepcha says there is growing consumer interest in goods made from salvaged Everest scraps.

Aanchal Malla of Hotel Yak & Yeti, a luxury five-star hotel in Kathmandu, said opting for the upcycled goods was in-line with the hotel’s move towards sustainable and environmentally friendly products.

“It is not just better for us and the environment but then it goes way bigger than that… it is encouragement of everyone who is trying to move into that direction of making the globe into a better place, reducing all the waste,” Malla said.

A new waste facility — called Sagarmatha Next after the Nepali name for Everest — is also being completed in Syangboche at an altitude of nearly 3,800 metres (12,400 feet), passed by trekkers and mountaineers on the way to the base camp.

It will process garbage, and collaborate with artists and innovators to make new products in a bid to tap into this burgeoning market for Everest ‘products’."
"Pakistan aims to reclaim land from mafia, turn it into forests with 10 billion trees",https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/pakistan-aims-to-reclaim-land-from-mafia-turn-it-into-forests-with-10-billion-trees-1.61964596,"Image Credit:

Dubai: Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan launched the Spring 2019 tree plantation drive as part of the 10 billion tree tsunami today.

Khan had announced the 10 billion tree tsunami last year, soon after he took office, and today he tweeted about the inauguration.

@ImranKhanPTI: We are launching our #Plant4Pakistan programme and reclaiming mafia encroached land, converting it into forests and wildlife parks for our future generations to fight climate change and pollution.

The tree planting drive is part of the ‘Prime Minister’s special initiatives’. The poster shared by Khan provided details of the inauguration today at Nankana Sahib, near the city of Lahore, with the message: “Earlier, forests would be captured (by the land mafia). Now the land will be reclaimed and used to grow forests again.”

The day will be marked across the country with several Pakistanis participating in the drive. On social media, people shared the message encouraging others to participate and #Plant4Pakistan became a trend across the country.

In a television interview to Pakistan’s Hum News, the Minister of Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said that it was the Prime Minister’s vision to reclaim the land that had been taken over by the land mafia.

Most appreciated the initiative by the Prime Minister and highlighted the importance of the drive in the long run. Tweep @QiaserAfridi wrote: “No one till now had paid attention towards this issue in history … trees also combat climate change and buffer the impacts of storms and floods. Hope this initiative and awareness will motivate people towards the healthy environment.”

Even in neighbouring India, tweeps could not help but share their thoughts. Tweep @AroraGirish wrote: “The problem of land mafia seems international, thanks for your concern for environment.”

However, some users felt like Khan’s time in power had not shown concrete results on the ground. Tweep @Mahar8baloch wrote: “Time is short but subjects [of concern] are more and more. So make the best use of your time. Imran Khan should get the trust of the nation that believes on you. Your progress in missing in front of the nation.”

About the drive

Khan has been an advocate of environmental conservation for quite a long time. When his party - Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) – was in power in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, his government planted one billion trees in two years.

Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP) to use drone technology to plant millions of trees."

"Lenexa, KS couple to brew beer for suicide prevention. A limited-edition beer called ""Your Story Is Not Complete"" will have the Johnson County 24-hour crisis hotline number on the back of the can. The beer is available until supplies run out, with 100% of the proceeds going to suicide prevention.",https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/personal-loss-prompts-lenexa-couple-to-brew-beer-for-suicide-prevention,"LENEXA, Kan. — September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, there is help available.

It's a message that's being shared in perhaps an unlikely place: a Lenexa brewery. The couple who runs the brewery says their efforts were born from a very personal loss.

Two years ago, Dave Mobley gave up his career with the U.S. Postal Service to follow his passion — brewing beer.

His brewery, Limitless Brewing, took off. And it wasn't long before his wife quit her job to help him full-time, especially when the pandemic hit and to-go orders went through the roof.

Provided Dave Mobley and his wife, Emily, run Limitless Brewing in Lenexa.

""The amount of cans we had to produce a day, we were shocked,"" Mobley said. ""We were basically getting cans, filling them, 16 hours a day. Then we'd put them out on a Saturday and it would be gone in a couple hours.""

It's been a good problem to have and a reason to celebrate.

Sadly, it's a success story his younger brother and best friend never got to see for himself.

""So, 10 days before we opened Limitless, my brother committed suicide,"" Mobley said, tears filling his eyes.

His family said it was completely out of character, an act they never saw coming.

Provided Dave and Josh Mobley. Dave says his brother’s suicide was an act the family never saw coming.

It happened one day after Josh Mobley's 35th birthday, along Frisbie Road by the Kansas River. A police report determined Josh fatally shot a female friend before turning the gun on himself. Although it was officially declared a murder-suicide, his family maintains two notes were found, indicating it was a suicide pact.

""I think in their minds a lot of them think it's going to help, like even the suicide notes? There's zero closure,"" Dave Mobley said.

""If you've never been through this kind of loss, there's just no answers, and that's the hardest part, you're left with this emptiness and you have no closure to it,"" added Dave's wife, Emily Mobley.

Still, instead of bottling up that pain, they're sharing their story in the hopes of helping others.

The past two years, they've raised money for Johnson County's Suicide Prevention Coalition, including $5,000 last year. The money helps to fund promotional material, including magnets and coasters with suicide hotlines printed on them that are used at local restaurants and bars.

""So, if someone comes in, they might be trying a beverage and they see this coaster,"" said Megan Clark with the Johnson County Mental Health Center. ""They might not need this coaster now or right at that point. We've had some people take pictures so later on they can always go back to this kind of resource.""

Provided Limitless Brewing in Lenexa is raising money for Johnson County's Suicide Prevention Coalition. The money helps to fund promotional material, including magnets and coasters with suicide hotlines printed on them that are used at local restaurants and bars.

But this year, the Mobleys are taking it a step further, brewing a limited-edition beer called ""Your Story Is Not Complete."" On the back, the Johnson County 24-hour crisis hotline number will be listed. The beer is available all month, or until supplies run out, with 100% of the proceeds going to suicide prevention.

Provided For National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month., a Lenexa brewery is brewing a limited-edition beer called “Your Story Is Not Complete.” On the back, it will list the Johnson County 24-hour crisis hotline number.

That money will go toward youth suicide prevention as part of the program Sources of Strength.

""Sources of Strength is a program that aims to prevent suicide by harnessing our strengths we all have as humans. When we talk about prevention, we want to start early,"" Clark said.

Sources of Strength is used in three school districts in Johnson County and some private schools. It's for middle and high school students, but the center also is looking at introducing some curriculum for elementary students.

For the Mobleys, it's important work that they hope teaches kids and teens at an early age that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. It's a lesson they hope will someday save someone's life.

""You know, everyone has ups and downs in life. We all have our own scars,"" Dave Mobley said. ""It's fine to speak about it. And unfortunately, sometimes pride and other things like that get in people's way. And they don't realize that, how much they matter.""

""Your Story Is Not Complete"" beer can be bought at Limitless Brewing in Lenexa. For more information, head to the brewery's Facebook page or website.

Royal Caribbean ship rescues sailors stranded at sea for 20 days,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/12/23/royal-caribbean-ship-rescues-sailors-stranded-sea-20-days/2401862002/,"Royal Caribbean cruise ship rescues two sailors stranded at sea for 20 days

Show Caption Hide Caption Watch: World's largest cruise ship Symphony of the Seas arrives in Miami Cruise hub Miami got its biggest ship ever on Friday as Royal Caribbean's giant new Symphony of the Seas arrived for the first time. At 228,081 tons, it's the largest cruise vessel ever built.

A Royal Caribbean cruise ship rescued two sailors who were stranded at sea for several weeks.

""Empress of the Seas did rescue two sailors who had been adrift for more than 20 days,"" the cruise line said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""Both passengers onboard the vessel were provided water and medical attention onboard by the ship’s crew. There were no injuries reported.""

Royal Caribbean's chief meteorologist James Van Fleet documented the rescue on Twitter Friday. He says the stranded sailors were found between Jamaica and Grand Cayman in only a small boat.

""Empress lowered her tender boat at 21:57 and rescued the passengers,"" the Royal Carribean statement added. ""Due to the high swell, the boat was towed close to the ship in order to get shelter.""

Van Fleet added that the Royal Caribbean cruise took a detour from its normal itinerary in pursuit of ""better weather"" and would have not located the castaways otherwise.

“Sometimes a little luck is all you need for a miracle,” Van Fleet said.

It's not clear where the sailors started their journey.

Arizona DPS trooper drags man from car seconds before train hits it,http://ktar.com/story/1919387/arizona-dps-trooper-drags-man-car-seconds-train-hits/,"PHOENIX — An Arizona Department of Public Safety trooper likely saved a man’s life when he dragged the unresponsive driver out of a car that was hit by a train seconds later.

In a release, the agency said trooper Henry (Hank) Roanhorse was driving home when he spotted the car on some railroad tracks in McKinley County, New Mexico, which is just across the state line.

“Roanhorse was familiar with the area and knew that the tracks carried a large volume of rail traffic, often traveling at high speeds,” the release said.

Roanhorse approached the vehicle and found the 56-year-old driver, Sampson Whitegoat, unconscious behind the wheel. Whitegoat smelled strongly of alcohol.

Roanhorse crawled into the vehicle to take off Whitegoat’s seat belt as a train rounded a nearby curve.

He was able to pull Whitegoat from the vehicle — despite Whitegoat, who had regained consciousness, fighting against him — and dragged his 300-pound frame about 25 feet from the tracks.

Seconds later, the train collided with the car and threw it 150 feet.

“Thank you officer, you just saved my life,” Whitegoat said to Roanhorse after the crash.

The McKinley County Sheriff’s Office responded to the scene and investigated the incident.

Roanhorse lives in northeastern Arizona.

"A village in the Philippines is trying to tackle plastic waste by offering rice to residents in exchange for their trash. Residents can get 1 kg of rice, the staple food for Filipinos, for every 2 kg of plastic waste, which are handed over to the government for proper disposal or recycling.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-waste-philippines-rice/filipino-villagers-swap-trash-for-rice-in-fight-against-plastics-idUSKCN1VX2M5,"MANILA (Reuters) - A village in the Philippines is trying to tackle the scourge of plastic waste by offering rice to residents in exchange for their trash.

Residents of Bayanan outside the capital, Manila, can get one kg (2.2 lb) of rice, the staple food for Filipinos, for every two kg of plastic waste, which are handed over to the government for proper disposal or recycling.

The Southeast Asian nation is among the world’s top marine plastic polluters, studies show, with laws on solid waste poorly enforced and no regulations on packaging manufacturing.

“I weighed in at 14 kilos of residuals, so I got 7 kilos of rice grains. This is a big help for us to have one kilo of rice for the day,” Veronica Dolorico, a 49-year-old supporter of the program, told Reuters.

“I feel that our surroundings are really dirty. If only I could, I would pick up all the plastics along the road when I walk outside,” she added.

One kg of rice costs about 30-40 pesos ($0.70), which is costly in a country with a fast-growing economy, but high rates of urban and rural poverty.

One-fifth of the population of 107 million people live below the national poverty line, with monthly consumption of less than $241 per person.

Bayanan collected more than 213 kg of sachets, bottles and plastic bags in August, said village chief Andor San Pedro, adding the food-for-trash swap is teaching people how to properly dispose of their waste."

World Class Musician Finds Appreciative Audience At Maximum Security Prison,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/gidon-kremer-pacific-institution-prison-abbotsford-bc-looking-at-the-stars-1.5443794,"Over his 50-year career, classical violinist Gidon Kremer has performed with some of the world's most prestigious orchestras, conductors and concert halls, but Wednesday marked the first time he played his 379-year-old Amati violin for prisoners.

The Pacific Institution in Abbotsford, B.C., is a federal penitentiary housing up to 400 inmates serving time for everything from property crimes to murder.

About a quarter of them signed up to hear Preludes to a Lost Time by Mieczyslaw Weinberg and Chaconne by J. S. Bach played by the Latvian master violinist.

The concert is a gift to the prisoners from the Looking at the Stars Foundation, a Toronto-based charitable organization that delivers classical music to those without access to traditional venues.

Watch part of Gidon Kremer's performance at the Pacific Institution:

As the inmates filed in from their maximum and medium security units, each one was searched by prison guards and a sniffer dog before they entered a gymnasium filled with rows of plastic chairs.

""I think music is something that can give warmth to everyone in trouble, in prison or not in prison,"" said 72-year-old Kremer.

Inmates respond

Inmate Robert doesn't share his last name or why he's in prison, but says he came to hear the violin because where he comes from it's used to accompany square dancers and this would be a different experience.

As well, he said, he's heard of Kremer in the past.

Robert says he would like to see a classical music program in the prison.

""For the lower-functioning inmates, it would be good for them for therapy,"" he said. ""They come out of their bubble. They come out of their shell.""

Robert missed a performance by a classical pianist at the institution in April 2019 and he says inmates later talked about how much they enjoyed the concert.

He believes prisoners will be able to talk about how they feel through music.

Questions for maestro

At the end of the concert the inmates were given a chance to ask Kremer questions.

They wanted to know about other musicians like Vivaldi, how old Kremer was when he first started to play the violin, who played his Amati violin made in 1641 before he played it.

But mostly they wanted to say thank you to Kremer for coming and playing for them one of the most complicated pieces of music.

""I have to say that in some ways they were more attentive or more enthusiastic compared to some concert audiences,"" said Kremer. ""I'm happy to have been here.""

Kremer describes his experience of playing for an audience of inmates:

In Gidon Kremer's own words 0:59 Gidon Kremer describes playing for an audience of inmates. 0:59

If he's ever invited to play at a prison again Kremer says he would say yes immediately.

The inmates gave him several rousing standing ovations.

Music restores dignity

The Looking at the Stars Foundation was created by Dmitri Kanovich, who came to Canada as a refugee from Lithuania in 1983 and went on to build a successful career in information technology.

An entrepreneur and lover of classical music, Kanovich says he created the foundation as way to give back to Canada.

Music, he says, is a way for inmates to retain dignity, to be treated like human beings.

He knows they have committed serious crimes and being in jail, he says, is ""well-deserved"" but prison is where recovery must begin.

""We owe them this recovery because they will rejoin us in society inevitably,"" he said.

Dmitri Kanovich describes his motivation behind bringing classical music performances into prisons:

At every concert Kanovich stands at the door to gymnasium and shakes hands with each inmate coming into the room.

Since the foundation was established in 2015 it has hosted 37 concerts in 15 Canadian prisons.

The Pacific Institution concert was presented in partnership with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (VSO).

""The audience was spellbound for an hour,"" said VSO president and CEO Angela Elster.

Music, she says, has incredible power to heal and connect.

To that end, an initiative in the works between the VSO and Corrections Canada called Play It Again will help inmates come back to instruments they may have played in the past or would like to play.

PARIS -- France's environment minister has announced a gradual ban on using wild animals in traveling circuses, on keeping dolphins and killer whales in captivity in marine parks and on raising mink on fur farms.

Barbara Pompili, France's minister of ecological transition, said in a news conference Tuesday that bears, tigers, lions, elephants and other wild animals won't be allowed any more in travelling circuses “in the coming years.”

In addition, starting immediately, France’s three marine parks won’t be able to bring in nor breed dolphins and killer whales any more, she said.

“It is time to open a new era in our relationship with these (wild) animals,” she said, arguing that animal welfare is a priority.

Pompili said the measures will also bring an end to mink farming, where animals are raised for their fur, within the next five years.

The ban does not apply to wild animals in other permanent shows and in zoos.

Pompili did not set any precise date for the ban in travelling circuses, saying the process should start “as soon as possible.” She promised solutions will be found for each animal “on a case-by-case basis.”

The French government will implement an 8 million-euro ($9.2 million) package to help people working in circuses and marine parks find other jobs.

“That transition will be spread over several years, because it will change the lives of many people,"" she said."
Townville Elementary: Firefighter praised for tackling teenage gunman and preventing school massacre,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/townville-firefighter-south-carolina-elementary-school-jamie-brock-a7337476.html,"A volunteer firefighter stopped a teenager who shot two students and a teacher outside a South Carolina primary school after killing his father at their home, authorities said.

Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said the shooter was apprehended Wednesday afternoon outside rural Townville Elementary School before he could get inside the building.

Firefighter Jamie Brock, a 30-year veteran of the Townville Volunteer Fire Department down the road from the school, “just took him down,” the sheriff said. He said the fire station is close to the school and Mr Brock arrived before others officers responding to the dispatch.

Mr Brock has said he doesn't want attention for his actions.

He “wants to remain humble and quiet about it” as he believes “he did nothing any of the other volunteer firefighters wouldn't have done,” said Scott Stoller with Anderson County Emergency Management.

Regardless, he said, “Firefighter Brock is absolutely a hero.”

Authorities said the shooting spree began at the teen's house about 2 miles from the school, where he gunned down his 47-year-old father, Jeffrey Osborne. Authorities have not released the suspect's name or age beyond saying he's a teen.

Crying and upset, the teen called his grandmother's cellphone at 1:44 pm, Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said. The grandparents couldn't understand what was going on, so they went to his home just 100 yards away. When they got there, they found Osborne dead and their grandson gone.

About one minute later, authorities received a 911 call from a teacher at the school in this rural town about 110 miles northeast of Atlanta.

The shooter drove a truck into the school parking lot and immediately started firing as he got out and moved toward the school, Mr Skipper said. He did not know who the truck the teen drove was registered to and declined to say how many shots were fired.

One student was shot in the leg and the other in the foot, sheriff's Capt Garland Major said. Both students were male. The female teacher was hit in the shoulder.

“We are heartbroken about this senseless act of violence,” said Joanne Avery, superintendent of Anderson County School District 4. She cancelled classes at the school for the rest of the week.

Television images showed officers swarming the school after the report of an active shooter. Some were on top of the roof while others were walking around the building. Students were driven away on buses accompanied by police officers to a nearby church.

Authorities said they don't yet know a motive for the shooting and they were not sure if the students and teacher were targeted. The sheriff said the teen had been homeschooled.

“There are no racial undertones there. There's no terrorism involved,” Mr Major said. “We're confident we have the sole shooter and no one else is involved.”

Mr Skipper said the teen's mother was at work at the time of the shooting.

One of the students and the teacher were released from the hospital Wednesday evening, AnMed Health spokeswoman Juana Slade said. Greenville Health System spokeswoman Sandy Dees said the other student, Jacob Hall, remained in critical condition.

Bob Rutherford's friend didn't believe the Saskatoon man could make a cheap knitting machine that worked really, really fast.

That's when Rutherford got to work.

""It could be knitting at 90 stitches a second,"" he proudly said.

And the octogenarian has now finished making 10,000 pairs of socks with the machines for shelters in Saskatoon and across the country.

How on earth did he do it?

He puts it rather simply: ""The wool comes in the door and I knit it.""

Rutherford started making the socks seven years ago.

""When my wife passed away in 2010, I felt the loss that everybody feels and had nothing to do,"" said Rutherford.

""[My son] said to me, 'If you want to help yourself, help somebody else.'""

He made the knitting machines years earlier, but had never really put them into action.

And so he got to work, knitting every week.

""Bob and I yak about things. And he's very good company,"" said Slater.

Just in the last year, they've made more than 2,000 pairs of socks.

Rutherford says the socks have given him purpose.

""There's a lot of us, as we grow older, we sit at home and look at the wall with nothing to do.

"All five living former US presidents make rare appearance together - Presidents gather for fundraiser for those affected by hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/22/all-five-living-former-us-presidents-make-rare-appearance-together,"Presidents gather for fundraiser for those affected by hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands

The five living former US presidents made a rare appearance together on stage on Saturday night at a fundraiser for those affected by recent hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

It was a show of unity and compassion after a week in which Barack Obama and George W Bush broke an unwritten rule to deliver implicit criticism of the present occupant of the White House.

While neither mentioned Donald Trump by name, Bush gave a speech in New York expressing concern that “bigotry seems emboldened” in a climate of cruel rhetoric and nativism, while Obama referred to the “politics of division” and “folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry” at Democratic campaign stops in New Jersey and Virginia.

Politics was set aside for the sold-out concert at Texas A&M University’s Reed Arena, however, as Bush, Obama, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George HW Bush were given a rapturous welcome by the audience. Both Bushes live in Texas and the 41st president’s library and museum is on the A&M campus.

'I was very comforted': gold star families recall receiving condolences from Obama Read more

The event, Deep From The Heart: The One America Appeal, featured a host of country and gospel music stars. It was launched last month after Hurricane Harvey battered Texas and expanded when Hurricane Irma hit Florida and Hurricane Maria devastated parts of the Caribbean, together causing several hundred deaths and billions of dollars in damage.

Trump, whose response to relief efforts in Puerto Rico has come under fire, has frequently denigrated Obama and earlier this year baselessly claimed his predecessor in the Oval Office ordered Trump Tower to be wiretapped before the 2016 election. Last Monday he intimated Obama and other former presidents treated the families of dead military members with a lack of respect.

However, he recorded a two-minute video message for the appeal which was rather more collegial in tone. “Now, as we begin to rebuild, some of America’s finest public servants are spearheading the One America Appeal. Through this effort, all five living former presidents are playing a tremendous role in helping our fellow citizens recover,” he said.

“[First Lady] Melania and I want to express our deep gratitude for your tremendous assistance. This wonderful effort reminds us that we truly are one nation, under God, all unified by our values and our devotion to one another.”"
India's gay prince opens his palace to LGBT people,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/prince-manvendra-singh-gohil-palace-lgbt-people-a8146491.html,"A gay Indian prince has opened up his 15-acre palace grounds to vulnerable LGBT people and is said to be constructing more buildings to house visitors.

Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, who is the son and probable heir of the Maharaja of Rajpipla in Gujarat in western India, will run the centre with his organisation The Lakshya Trust.

The royal, who was ostracised by his family after coming out publically in 2006, started the community based organisation to support gay men and educate people about the prevention of HIV/Aids.

Homosexuality remains a big taboo in Indian society and sex between people of the same gender is punishable by law in the country.

The controversial Section 377 of the country’s penal code bans sexual activity that is “against the order of nature” and many have interpreted the wording to include gay sex.

Speaking to the International Business Times, the prince said he was keen to empower people with the social security system they need to ensure they are not left with nothing if their families disown them after coming out.

""If I could undergo these problems then any other gay person could face a similar situation,” he said.

""In India, we have a family system and we are mentally conditioned to be with our parents. The moment you try to come out you are told you will be thrown out and society will boycott you. You become a social outcast. A lot of people are financially dependent on their parents.""

""I want to give people social and financial empowerment, so eventually people who want to come out won't be affected. They will have their own social security system. It won't make a difference if they are disinherited.""

The prince’s coming out was breaking news all over India at the time and resulted in effigies of him being burned in his home state and people calling for him to be denied his title. On top of this, he was disowned and disinherited by his parents.

Since then he has been the subject of BBC series Undercover Princes – a 2009 reality TV show which took three royals from their respective cultures and put them in Brighton where they were forced to “live and date”.

Prince Manvendra's charity provides counselling, clinical services and support groups to thousands of men who have sex with men. Many of the men in question have yielded to cultural burdens to marry women despite their sexuality.

The prince himself was forced into marriage in 1991 but has since said the relationship was ""a total disaster"". It resulted in divorce the following year.

Prince Manvendra, who had a highly traditional and conservative upbringing, appeared as a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show back in 2007. He was one of three persons featured on the show titled “Gay Around the World”, saying he does not regret coming out and that he thinks the people living in his state admire him for the leading role he has taken in preventing and educating about HIV/Aids.

Last summer, India’s Supreme Court issued a historic ruling confirming the right of the country’s LGBT people to express their sexuality without discrimination."

North Carolina’s Famous Wild Horses Emerge from Hurricane Florence Unscathed,https://www.southernliving.com/news/wild-horses-outer-banks-hurricane-florence,"They relied on their instincts to ride out the storm.

We're thrilled to report that the herds of wild horses that roam North Carolina's Outer Banks have emerged from Hurricane Florence unscathed.

Cape Hatteras National Seashore and Corolla Wild Horse Fund both confirmed on social media over the weekend that their equine populations are safe and sound following Hurricane Florence's lashing last week.

Corolla Wild Horse Fund herd manager Meg Puckett told The News & Observer that the wild herd found higher ground and grouped together against the wind and rain. People on the island also kept an eye on them.

""So far it's been business as usual for them, out grazing in all the normal spots,"" Puckett said. ""The horses are back out at all their usual haunts.""

Further South, Cape Hatteras National Seashore confirmed that their herd of ponies on Ocracoke Island fared well in the storm. ""We are happy to announce that all of the Ocracoke ponies are safe and that the pony pen did not sustain any damage from Hurricane Florence,"" the national park wrote alongside a photo of the ponies grazing happily.

Leading up to Hurricane Florence, Sue Stuska, a wildlife biologist based at Cape Lookout National Seashore, explained to the Associated Press that the horses are ""highly sensitive to weather changes and instinctively know what to do in a storm.""

""Naturally, they are meant to be outside and they have high ground and they have thick places to hide,"" Stuska said. ""Don't worry about them. They've survived for hundreds of years, and we expect that they'll be just fine."""
HIV vaccine in 2021? Leading experts 'optimistic' about ongoing trials,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/hiv-vaccine-2021-leading-experts-optimistic-about-ongoing-trials-n1092021,"The global fight against the human immunodeficiency virus is poised to make important advances thanks to three experimental HIV vaccines that are entering the final stages of testing at sites across the globe.

While any of these three late-stage HIV vaccine trials — known as HVTN 702, Imbokodo and Mosaico — could fail, scientists say they are more hopeful than at any time since 1984, when Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler raised hopes by predicting that there would be a test-worthy HIV vaccine within two years.

This is “perhaps one of the most optimistic moments we have been in,"" said Dr. Susan Buchbinder, director of the Bridge HIV research program at the San Francisco Department of Public Health and a chair of both the Imbokodo and Mosaico trials.

“We have three vaccines currently being tested in efficacy trials,"" she said, ""and it takes quite a bit to actually be promising enough in the earlier stages stages of trials to move you forward into an efficacy study.""

HVTN 702

The oldest ongoing HIV vaccine trial, known as HVTN 702, is based on a prior vaccine candidate, RV144, that was effective, but not effective enough. In 2009, the RV144 clinical trial released findings showing that the vaccine lowered the rate of HIV infections by about 30 percent. To this day, RV144 remains the only HIV vaccine that have ever demonstrated any efficacy against the virus.

HVTN 702, launched in South Africa in 2016, was the first vaccine trial approved after the failure of RV144. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the modified vaccination regime “aims to provide greater and more sustained protection than the RV144 regimen and has been adapted to the HIV subtype that predominates in southern Africa,” also known as HIV-1 clade C.

While RV144, at 30 percent effective, did not suffice for global distribution, it pointed the way forward for vaccine researchers, who adapted RV144’s successes to create HVTN 702. Buchbinder said even a partially effective vaccine would be “a tremendous breakthrough,” and ""would really have the power to change the trajectory of the epidemic.”

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID and a longtime advocate for a vaccine that is at least 50 percent effective, said he feels “even more strongly now” that a partially effective vaccine would be worth deploying. He said that is because prevention strategies like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and treatment as prevention (TasP) “are being so successfully used, even in the absence of a vaccine, that if one or more of these vaccines look good, have a 50-60 percent efficacy, I think that’s going to be the game changer for turning the epidemic around.”

HVTN 702 completed enrollment this summer, and clinical results are expected in late 2020 or early 2021.

Imbokodo and Mosaico

Imbokodo, the second trial, began in five southern African nations in 2017 and completed enrollment of 2,600 women this summer. In southern African nations, heterosexual women are at extremely high risk of HIV infection.

“It’s almost unbelievable, but it’s true, women between the ages of 18 and 25 — the prevalence of infection is well over 50 percent,” Fauci said. “If ever you wanted to get a population that, if the vaccine works, you’re going to know pretty quickly, then you want to go in women.”

Unlike HVTN 702, Imbokodo uses “mosaic” immunogens, which are “vaccine components designed to induce immune responses against a wide variety of global HIV strains,” according to the National Institutes of Health.

“The presumption is that a mosaic is going to give you broader coverage,” Fauci said.

In November, the third vaccine trial, Mosaico, marked its informal start after the first study participant received an injection. Mosaico is based on Imbokodo’s unique mosaic immunogen approach.

Imbokodo and Mosaico are largely identical and consist of six injections, with slightly different vaccine formulations administered during the final two clinic visits.

In addition, while Imbokodo is only being tested in African women, Mosaico will recruit 3,800 gay men and transgender people for its clinical trials at 57 sites in the United States, Latin America and Europe. For any HIV vaccine, Fauci said there’s a need to prove it works in different at-risk populations.

Imbokodo completed enrollment of study participants this summer, marking the formal end of the recruitment process. Results from Imbokodo are expected in 2021, and results from Mosaico are expected in 2023.

Challenges ahead

Fauci noted that there has been a rapid pace of vaccine-related developments in recent years, with these three vaccine trials starting in 2016, 2017 and 2019.

“In all of these trials, intermittently the data and safety monitoring board takes a look at the data, and either says the data are so bad you have got to stop, or the data are so overwhelmingly good that you have got to stop,” Fauci said. So far, after several reviews of the data in HVTN 702 and Imbokodo, “there’s nothing there to say stop the study,” which happened in 2007 when a Merck vaccine trial was shut down after the monitoring board determined that it had no impact on prevention.

""None of these vaccines is a particularly simple regimen,"" Buchbinder said, ""so it’s going to require quite a bit of effort to deploy.”

“They require multiple injections, and so each one would require a minimum of four different doses in its current configuration,” Buchbinder said. But an effective vaccine could be a “stepping off point” to potentially create a simpler and more effective vaccine in the future.

And if these vaccine trials all fail, public health officials say enough tools currently exist to stop the spread of HIV — if only people would, or could, use them.

PrEP, the daily pill that prevents HIV infection, is safe and effective, but not enough people are using it to slow HIV transmission and end the epidemic. And successful treatment of people living with HIV results in an undetectable viral load that they cannot transmit the virus via sexual activity, known as “treatment as prevention” or TasP.

“It goes exactly to what I have been saying for years and years — if you implement the tools that you have, you will definitely see an impact on the dynamics of the epidemic,” Fauci said. “I have been talking about this for well over a decade. If you implement, the incidence is going to go down. It happened dramatically in San Francisco, and it is happening right now in New York.”

Fauci said President Donald Trump’s Ending the HIV Epidemic plan, which Fauci played a central role in drafting, aims to lower new infections by 75 percent in five years and by 90 percent in 10 years “even in the absence of a vaccine.”

So, if one of the three vaccines currently being tested works, “that would be the endgame,"" she said.

Fundraiser to help Harlem children see Marvel's Black Panther more than doubles goal,http://mashable.com/2018/01/09/black-panther-gofundme-harlem/,"A crowdfunding campaign to help children in Harlem see Black Panther in February has more than doubled its goal and now includes celebrity donors as well.

The fundraiser is currently at over $24,000 of its $10,000 goal, with all extra proceeds going to the Boys & Girls Club of Harlem.

“The release of Marvel’s film the Black Panther is a rare opportunity for young students (primarily of color) to see a black major cinematic and comic book character come to life,” campaign organizer Frederick Joseph wrote in the GoFundMe description. “This representation is truly fundamental for young people, especially those who are often underserved, unprivileged, and marginalized both nationally and globally.”

The campaign will send approximately 300 kids to see Black Panther in theaters and covers the cost of a Manhattan movie ticket, snacks, and adult chaperones. Joseph received criticism about the pricing on Twitter, but for the most part feedback for his campaign has been positive.

The GoFundMe also caught the attention of J.J. Abrams and wife Katie McGrath, who donated $10,000, among others.

Homeless man moves into a house after 33 years and has first hot shower in more than a decade.,http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/92508264/one-hot-shower-one-cold-pie-one-roof-over-his-head,"It was his first hot shower in more than a decade.

Rob Marriner said he stood underneath the water for one hour, until it ran cold. Then he went to sleep for nine hours - the longest he has been able to sleep in years.

Marriner had been homeless since 1984. For 33 years he roamed the streets of West Auckland.

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX Rob Marriner this week moved into private rented accommodation.

""I still remember the day I moved out of my home. My father's abuse drove me out.""

But he moved into a two-bedroom one-bathroom house in Sunnyvale this week.

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX ""This is my house,"" says Rob Marriner, standing in the doorway of his home after 33 years on the streets.

His new home has furniture, courtesy of St John New Zealand, and he even has a flatmate.

But Marriner said living under a roof could be daunting.

""It's scary, spooky and strange.""

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX NZ Marriner says he is living ""the life of luxury"" now.

He said he felt like a baby having to adjust to a completely new way of life.

On his first night in the house he ended up having a cold pie for dinner because he did not know how to turn on the oven.

""We left our pies in the oven for two hours and still ended up having them cold. I did not know there was a switch.""

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX Marriner says he did not know the oven had to be switched on to work so he had a cold pie for dinner.

However, the next morning he said he had a ""feast"" for breakfast with his flatmate.

""We had 24 eggs with two loaves of bread. We figured out how to turn the thing on.""

Marriner said living in a home was the ""life of luxury"".

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX NZ ""The streets have many secrets,"" says Rob Marriner.

""You can have coffee when you want and open the fridge when you like.""

He said he could not sleep the first night in his new home.

""We moved the furniture about four times from room to room.""

Marriner said it was nice to make a bed in the morning instead of wrapping up his bedding at the break of dawn like he had done for 33 years.

He was also getting used to washing his clothes.

The 54-year-old said he always dreamt of living in a home.

It was after two deaths in his family that he became more serious about achieving his dream.

Marriner's sister was murdered in 2014. The following year he said his mother died of a ""broken heart"".

""She couldn't deal with my sister's death.""

He became involved with Taniwha Tales, an initiative of Te Whanau o Waipareira Trust launched in 2015, aimed at helping the homeless find a safe place in society.

Through them he found a new life and a new home, he said.

On the streets he would go to The Salvation Army and get whatever had been donated to charity, and Marriner said he found ways to get food, shelter and stay warm.

""The streets have many secrets,"" he said.

But there was one thing he did miss about being homeless.

""I had no bills when I was homeless."""

Georgetown students help free prisoner wrongfully convicted of murder.,https://www.georgetown.edu/news/georgetown-students-help-free-prisoner-wrongfully-convicted-of-murder,"Georgetown welcomed the recently exonerated Valentino Dixon of Buffalo, New York, to share his story on a panel yesterday with three students who successfully challenged his wrongful murder conviction.

Dixon, who was imprisoned for 27 years and released this past September, was joined on stage last night in the university’s Gaston Hall with those students, Julie Fragonas, Isobella Goonetillake (C’18) and Naoya Johnson, along with Marty Tankleff, Georgetown adjunct professor and exoneree, and Max Adler, the editorial director of Golf Digest who publicized Dixon’s plight.

The panel, moderated by Prisons and Justice Initiative director Marc Howard, also showcased the art Dixon created in prison and included phone conversations with men still incarcerated and whose cases students will continue to work on.

LEADING THE WAY

“When [Tankleff] explained to me that the Georgetown students were on board,” Dixon said, “it just changed our lives immediately. We just said, ‘This is going to happen now.’ ”

The students were in a Prison Reform Project course taught by Howard and Tankleff, Howard’s childhood friend who was wrongfully imprisoned for almost 18 years and whom Howard helped free.

Howard named a number of other Georgetown initiatives that work with currently or previously incarcerated individuals and their families, including a mentoring program for children of incarcerated parents.

“I think it’s safe to say there’s not a single university in the world that is as actively involved in the effort to reduce mass incarceration and to humanize and support people while they’re incarcerated,” Howard said at the event. “ … we’re really leading the way nationally.”

‘ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE’

In prison, Dixon worked 10 to 12 hours every day, creating numerous elaborate and colorful drawings mostly of golf courses and their surrounding landscapes. He now intends to help other wrongfully convicted prisoners and pursue life as an artist. His website, valentinodixon.com, now offers his artwork for sale.

Dixon was exonerated Sept. 19 in the early 1990s murder of Torriano Jackson and released after serving more than 26 of his 38.5 years-to-life sentence, mostly at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility.

“The Georgetown students made me a believer that anything is possible – and that justice can be done,” Dixon said after learning about his release.

A group of 16 undergraduates in Howard and Tankleff’s course last semester conducted investigations into four murder cases, including Dixon’s, that were thought to be wrongful convictions.

SAVING A LIFE

Fragonas, Goonetillake and Johnson worked on Dixon’s case, interviewing witnesses and experts as well as Dixon’s original prosecutor and public defender.

Following their investigations, the then-undergraduates created a website, a social media campaign and a documentary detailing the case.

“I am so proud of our students,” said Howard, also a Georgetown professor of government, in September. “They understood that this wasn’t just a class activity or school project, but a real attempt to save a wrongfully convicted man’s life. As someone who has been through it before with my friend Marty, I know that there is no greater joy or satisfaction than to walk someone from prison into freedom.”"

Elton John celebrates 29 years of sobriety,https://pagesix.com/2019/07/29/elton-john-celebrates-29-years-of-sobriety/,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)

Elton John reached a milestone Sunday at the age of 72.

The iconic singer celebrated 29 years of sobriety, reflecting on his life’s direction via social media.

“29 years ago today, I was a broken man. I finally summoned up the courage to say 3 words that would change my life: ‘I need help’,” he shared alongside a photo of his new Alcoholics Anonymous chip. “Thank you to all the selfless people who have helped me on my journey through sobriety. I am eternally grateful. Elton xo.”

The “I’m Still Standing” crooner’s struggles with drug and alcohol addiction have been well documented, most recently in the Taron Egerton-starring biopic “Rocketman.” In May, John reflected on his addictions and said he had “lost touch” with the life he led before launching into superstardom.

“The life I was leading — flying on [his legendary private plane] the Starship, living in beautiful houses, buying things left, right and center — it was not a normal life, not the sort of life I came from anyway,” John told Variety in May. “I lost complete touch with that.”

“There were times I was having chest pains or staying up for three days at a time,” John added. “I used to have spasms and be found on the floor and they’d put me back to bed and half an hour later I’d be doing the same. It’s crazy.”

A friend of his who lost his battle with AIDS in 1990 ultimately triggered John to get help. He eventually launched the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which has raised more than $400 million to fight the virus."
A&W Canada to eliminate plastic straws from all restaurants,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/a-w-canada-to-eliminate-plastic-straws-from-all-restaurants-1.4698272,"A&W restaurants in Canada will eliminate plastic straws from its locations by January 2019.

The burger shack will become the first fast-food chain in North America to eliminate plastic straws in favour of biodegradable paper straws, according to representatives from A&W Canada.

""We're on a waste reduction journey,"" said director of packaging Tyler Pronyk at an announcement on Friday. ""By the end of the year, there will be no plastic straws in our restaurants.""

Restaurants will begin making the transition in August. The chain, which has close to 1,000 locations, says it will fully phase out plastic straws by the end of 2018 and offer paper straws instead.

Officials say paper straws will last two to three hours in a drink without breaking down, and biodegrade in three to six months.

The move will prevent 82 million plastic straws from ending up in landfills every year, according to A&W Canada.

Customers will be offered biodegradable paper straws when ordering a beverage. (Foodology.ca)

Consumer pushback

The move comes amid widespread consumer pushback against plastic straws.

Several municipalities in Canada have introduced bylaws in an effort to phase out plastic straws. Vancouver, for example, has voted to ban the distribution of plastic straws as well as foam takeout containers and cups as part of its zero-waste strategy.

However, some fast food chains are resisting the transition.

In May, McDonald's shareholders voted down a proposal to ban plastic straws; however, the company has indicated in the past that it's working on finding an alternative.

CBC News reached out to McDonald's Canada for comment on A&W's decision, but did not receive a response.

A proposal by activist group SumOfUs asked a report about the ""business risks"" of using plastic straws at McDonald's 37,000 locations globally. The proposal was rejected at the company's annual meeting.

Chain reaction?

Food analysts suspect A&W's move could set off a chain reaction, igniting other major fast-food chains to follow suit.

""As we look at the movements to ban plastic straws ... it's only a matter of time before it happens here in the Canadian marketplace,"" said Robert Carter, a food service industry analyst with the Toronto-based NPD Group.

""This is part of the dialogue for most restaurants right now around the plastic straw issue,"" he added. ""Operators who don't move to it or don't address the consumer needs and concerns — there might be a bit of a backlash.""

Expensive transition

Making the transition won't necessarily be cheap.

A&W, which will be buying the paper straws from an American-based manufacturer, said there are few outlets to purchase paper straws from, which is why the transition will unfold over several months.

""I would think that there's a bit of an investment associated with moving from plastic to paper,"" said Carter. ""But the dialogue has been ongoing for the past 12 months.""

""We're dealing with more educated consumers,"" he added. ""The industry is evolving to meet consumer demand."""

Russian authorities have decided to free nearly 100 whales held in cages in the country’s far east, according to reports.

Images of the whales, kept in cramped enclosures in a bay near the Sea of Japan port city of Nakhodka, first appeared last year, triggering a storm of criticism.

The animals had been captured by a company that planned to sell them to China but the Kremlin intervened and ordered local authorities to find a way of freeing them.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Orca are seen in one of the pens Photograph: Reuters

After months of delays, the decision to release the whales coincided with a visit to the enclosures by the French oceanographer Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of the famous marine expert Jacques Cousteau.

“An official decision has been taken to release all the animals into the wild,” Oleg Kozhemyako, the governor of the Primorsky region, was quoted by the Tass news agency as saying. “Scientists from Cousteau’s team and Russian scientists will decide when and which animals to release.“

Kozhemyako was cited as saying the authorities would set up a rehabilitation facility for the whales where the conditions would be as close as possible to their natural environment and where any sick animals could be treated.

The Kremlin had said the 11 orcas and 87 beluga whales were being held in cruel conditions, intended for sale to aquariums and Chinese buyers, but that it would be difficult to release them into the wild without harming them.

On Sunday evening, he was miraculously found alive having spent nine days stuck above a waterfall in rugged terrain in the Belmont Regional Park, north of Wellington.

After going missing during a pack walk on April 6, Benny survived without any food and endured a freezing storm that brought snow and tornados to parts of the lower North Island last week.

FACEBOOK Benny went missing in the Belmont Regional Park on April 6. He was found alive nine days later, attached to a log by his lead.

Despite only being a few hundred metres from where he went missing, he somehow escaped the attention of 1000 searchers and a helicopter with specialist thermal imaging gear.

Owners Matt and Grace Newman-Hall set up a social media page to keep people informed on how the search was going.

SUPPLIED Benny's owners Matt and Grace Newman-Hall launched an extensive search of the Belmont Regional Park, backed by some 50 volunteers and thermal imaging technology.

Matt Newman-Hall said Benny was in surprisingly good shape. A timid dog, he did not even bark when rescuers eventually found him cold and hungry.

Buoyed by stories of dogs being lost for months and turning up unexpectedly, Newman-Hall said he had never given up hope of finding Benny.

""There were 70 to 100 people out looking for him [on Sunday] so we were feeling very confident that someone would find him, and it was only half an hour after we got home that we got the call.""

But even after he was discovered in the Belmont Regional Park, the adventure was not over for Benny.

His rescuers had to scale a waterfall and rock wall to follow a stream. They found Benny attached to a log by his lead. In fading light, they sent out a message that they might struggle to get down.

Matt Newman-Hall alerted the park ranger and the SPCA animal rescue team, but after three hours his rescuers emerged with Benny happily trotting alongside them.

FACEBOOK Benny The lost beagle had his own social media page.

Benny was taken to the emergency vet, who said he had lost weight but was otherwise in good shape.

Grace Newman-Hall said she was indebted to the people who found him.

""We can't express how thankful we are.""

SUPPLIED Buoyed by stories of dogs being lost for months and turning up unexpectedly, Benny's owners never gave up hope of finding him safe and well.

After they got home and had some cuddles, Benny then enjoyed a long sleep. He spent the night snuggled up between his happy owners.

The Newman-Halls had been advised to keep him quiet for a few days and slowly reintroduce him to food.

Matt Newman-Hall estimated that in the nine days Benny was missing, 1000 people had helped with the search.

SUPPLIED Missing beagle Benny, right, with his friend Spike, who has helped with the search.

""The search has been expensive and extensive.""

The helicopter was paid for by insurance and he said they will forever be grateful for all the help they received.

One of the searchers came down from Whanganui and spent nine days covering the rugged park.

They plan to organise a community barbecue so all the helpers can meet Benny and repay the kindness they had received.

A MetService spokesperson said that temperatures last Thursday fell to an overnight low of 2.5 celsius. With snow on the nearby Tararaus, the wind chill would have made it feel much colder.

Wairarapa beagle breeder Chelsea Macklin said Benny did well to survive in the cold. Having access to a stream was probably the key to his survival.

""Beagles are small dogs but they are quite a tough dog. They are pretty resilient and can cope with a lot.""

When in trouble beagles seek cover or burrow and she would not be surprised if Benny had done that.

As long as he had access to water, the lack of food would not have been a big problem.

Hutt City Council animal control officer Les Dalton said dogs could survive a surprisingly long time without food.

Although it was cold last week, he said he would expect a well fed beagle to be okay.

He had lost farm dogs down rabbit holes and they eventually returned home, he said.

""They finally dig themselves out after 10 days and come home very skinny."""

Mom carrying baby without brain to term - to donate the organs,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/health/father-letter-baby-tribute-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) When Keri Young found out her unborn child didn't have a brain, she made an unthinkably selfless decision. She decided to carry Eva to term to donate the organs to other babies in need.

Young's wrenching story broke hearts when her husband Royce Young, a writer for ESPN, posted an emotional letter praising her brave decision.

""It would just be irresponsible to take the gifts that Eva has and not share them with others,"" Royce Young told CNN about his wife's decision.

The discovery

The Youngs found out Eva didn't have a brain at the 19-week ultrasound.

""Somehow through full body ugly crying, Keri looked up and asked, 'If I carry her full term, can we donate her organs?'"" Royce Young wrote in his post.

""This whole process has been rough, but I say that as someone watching from the bleachers like the rest of you. Keri has been in the trenches the entire time, feeling every little kick, every hiccup and every roll. She's reminded every moment of every day that she's carrying a baby that will die.""

The decision to donate baby Eva's organs wasn't the only reason.

The couple also ""came to the realization Eva is alive and our daughter deserves to meet her mama and daddy,"" her husband wrote.

On her own Facebook page, Keri Young added, ""Eva will have life even though it will be short. She'll donate anything she can and do more in her time on earth than I ever will.""

The baby is due May 7.

""Choice doesn't just mean terminating,"" Royce told CNN. ""Choice can mean life.""

Here is the full text of his post:

""The other night, before I left for New Orleans, I was watching my beautiful wife sleep peacefully on the couch.

I looked at her laying there, her belly big with our daughter kicking away, a daughter that won't live more than a few days, and it just overwhelmed me of how incredible this woman is. I'm a writer so when I'm feeling something, I tend to have to write it down. So I pulled out my phone and started writing what I was thinking. And I realized tonight sitting a thousand miles away in a hotel room, especially after meeting this awesome kid named Jarrius that's been everywhere at All-Star Weekend who needs a liver transplant, that instead of just keeping this one for me like I normally do, I should tell everyone else just how incredible Keri Young is. (I also miss her five seconds after I leave the house for a trip so I'm thinking about her all the time anyway.)

I thought back to the moment where we found out Eva wasn't perfect, and how literally 30 seconds after our doctor told us our baby doesn't have a brain, somehow through full body ugly crying, Keri looked up and asked, ""If I carry her full term, can we donate her organs?"" I remember our doctor putting her hand on Keri's shoulder and saying, ""Oh honey, that's so brave of you to say."" Like, how nice of you, but come on. Keri meant it. There I was, crestfallen and heartbroken, but I momentarily got lifted out of the moment and just stood in awe of her. I was a spectator to my own life, watching a superhero find her superpowers. In literally the worst moment of her life, finding out her baby was going to die, it took her less than a minute to think of someone else and how her selflessness could help. It's one of the most powerful things I've ever experienced. In the eight years we've been married (and 15 years together) I've had a lot of moments stop me in my tracks where I thought, ""holy crap, this woman I'm married to, lucky me."" But this one was different. It hit me that not only am I married to my very best friend, but to a truly remarkable, special human being.

This whole process has been rough, but I say that as someone watching from the bleachers like the rest of you. Keri has been in the trenches the entire time, feeling every little kick, every hiccup and every roll. She's reminded every moment of every day that she's carrying a baby that will die. Her back hurts. Her feet are sore. She's got all the super fun pregnant stuff going on. But the light at the end of her nine-month tunnel will turn into a darkness she's never felt before a couple hours or days after Eva is born. She's the one that is going to deal with all that comes with having a baby-- her milk coming in, the recovery process, etc, but with no snuggly, soft, beautiful newborn to look at to remind you that it was all worth it.

We made our choice to carry Eva to full term for a lot of reasons, but the first and foremost was to donate her organs. We don't say that to try and sound like great people or anything. It was just a practical endgame that in our minds, before we came to the realization Eva is alive and our daughter deserves to meet her mama and daddy, gave us a purpose to continue on. Donating was on Keri's mind from darn near the second we found out and while the experience of holding and kissing our daughter will be something we cherish forever, the gift(s) she's got inside that little body of hers is what really matters. Keri saw that almost instantly. That kid Jarrius wears a shirt that says ""It Takes Lives To Save Lives."" I couldn't stop thinking about that all day. There's another family out there hurting and hoping for a miracle for their baby, knowing full well someone else's baby will need to die first. Eva can be that miracle.

We're getting closer to the finish line, and while it's going to be amazing to run through that tape and meet Eva, it comes at a cost. We'll go to the hospital for a birth, and go home without a baby.

A lot of people say things like, ""I wouldn't change anything"" after a trying circumstance, but I'm not about to say that. I would definitely change this if I could. I want my daughter to be perfect. I want her to blow out her candles on her first birthday. I want to watch her bang her head on our coffee table trying to learn to walk. I want her to run up a cell phone bill texting boys. I want to walk her down an aisle. I want to change it all so, so badly. But I can't. This is our reality. And there's no stopping it.

Whenever Harrison gets hurt, or has to pull a bandaid off or something, Keri will ask him, ""Are you tough? Are you BRAVE?"" And that little boy will nod his head and say, ""I tough! I brave!"" I'm looking at Keri right now and I don't even have to ask. She's TOUGH. She's BRAVE. She's incredible. She's remarkable. She's cut from a different cloth, combining wit, beauty, courage, silliness, character and integrity into one spectacular woman. And somehow, she's my wife. Not that I needed some awful situation like this to actually see all of that, but what it did was make me want to tell everyone else about it."""
"One Man's Journey To Mexico For Heroin Addiction Treatment Using Ibogaine -- ""It's not just [that] it gets you off the heroin, it's like, it hits the reset button""",https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/09/10/ibogaine-psychedelic-opioid-misuse-therapy,"By the time Dustin Dextraze decides to travel outside of the United States to get psychedelic addiction treatment, he's desperate. ""I tried to overdose about a week ago,"" he says. ""And I just woke up like five hours later and the needle was in my arm, and I just woke up and was like, 'well, didn't die, so ... Now what?' "" It's taken about three years for Dextraze to get to this point. He started using prescription painkillers recreationally, then switched to heroin because it was less expensive and easier to get. He lost his car, his job. He left his wife, his three kids. At 36 years old he's shuffling between staying with his father in Massachusetts and his mother in New Hampshire. Every day he focuses on panhandling to get money to buy drugs so he won't be sick from withdrawing from opioid use. Walking the streets of Dover, New Hampshire, in July, Dextraze is so dope sick he can barely focus. ""I'm gonna be alright. I have to be until I go find someone to find something for me,"" he says, often groaning, chain-smoking cigarettes, and frequently stopping strangers to ask for money or drugs. ""It's not like Massachusetts where I can just walk down the street and get it from anybody,"" Dextraze says. ""Five bucks and I wouldn't be sick."" Dustin Dextraze outside the Experience Ibogaine Clinic in Mexico. (John Gastaldo for WBUR) 'My Whole Life Is Riding On This' Dextraze says he hates this cycle of panhandling to get drugs. For years, he's tried to quit. He's been to several detoxes and rehabs, taken addiction medications, attended 12-step meetings — but nothing has worked. His drug use has landed him in the hospital with a severe blood infection, and he now has hepatitis C. He's been jailed for possession. ""The day I got out of jail I used,"" Dextraze says. ""It's just a constant cycle, and it becomes such a vicious cycle, you can't get out of it."" What's giving Dextraze some hope that he can break the cycle, though, is an alternative psychedelic treatment called ibogaine. But it's illegal in the U.S. Ibogaine is a substance from the iboga plant that's primarily found in Africa. It's believed to be used in coming-of-age ceremonies by the Bwiti religion. For decades people have reported it eliminates withdrawal symptoms and cravings associated with various drugs. And many say it's most effective for opioid users. ""I've tried everything they've offered me to try, and this is the last thing that I know of is the ibogaine,"" Dextraze says. ""My whole life is riding on this ibogaine."" A Drug Mired In Controversy Claims about ibogaine have been controversial, and the subject of several studies. Dr. Kenneth Alper, an associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at NYU, has studied the psychedelic drug and its history. He found ibogaine was first tested in the U.S. in the 1950s, but it became better known in '60s when scientist Howard Lotsof claimed ibogaine eliminated his heroin withdrawals — so he began treating others with it. Less than 10 years later, ibogaine was declared a Schedule 1 drug in the U.S. because of its psychoactive effects. The World Health Assembly classified ibogaine as a ""substance likely to cause dependency or endanger human health."" But still, ibogaine advocates have pushed for more testing in the U.S. amid reports in other countries that it was effective in addressing addiction to heroin and cocaine. At one point in the '90s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved testing it, but that was never completed — reportedly because of health risks. ""[Ibogaine is] apparently telling us something that is pertinent to either drug discovery or understanding the neurobiology of opiate dependence,"" NYU's Alper says. ""The fact that we cannot readily explain it means that it's probably going to teach us something that we do not already know about addiction."" But many researchers are reluctant to do more research because of the reported risks. One of Alper's studies found that 19 people died after using ibogaine between 1990 and 2008. Most of the deaths were attributed to heart problems. Some researchers say that's largely because of ibogaine's underground status, which means patients are not properly screened and medical professionals are not administering it.

""People think there is going to be a magic pill that's going to erase addiction, and that's just not reality. What they should not be desperate for is a quick fix."" Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Bertha Madras

Dr. Martin Polanco, the founder of an addiction treatment center in northern Mexico, has studied ibogaine and says the drug is safe if it is properly administered. ""Ibogaine has known cardiac risks in that it reduces heart rate,"" Polanco says. ""When combined with other medications, it can cause arrhythmias. It's important to be under continuous cardiac supervision while on the medication."" But it is also risky to find a reputable medical provider of ibogaine outside the U.S., where dozens of clinics are operating. In Mexico, the psychedelic treatment is not illegal — but it's not exactly sanctioned medicine, either. Polanco used to run an ibogaine clinic in Mexico but moved it to the Bahamas because of concerns about the safety of his patients and staff there. Polanco warns people should research their provider, saying ""the quality of treatment and medical oversight can vary from one clinic to another."" To Mexico, To 'Take This Chance' (John Gastaldo for WBUR) Dextraze believes he's found a reputable provider through someone he knows from Massachusetts who works at a clinic in Mexico. Friends offer to pay the $5,000 for a week of treatment, and his mother buys his plane ticket. He says any potential risks don't scare him; he says his drug use has already put him in a dangerous place. ""I was ready to die anyways,"" he says. ""So I'd rather take this chance and be able to live a normal life than not take this chance and die a horrible death on dope."" Before arriving at the clinic, he landed in San Diego and immediately left to look for drugs. He went missing for a few days, but then got in touch with the clinic. They came to bring him to treatment. For the first few days at the Experience Ibogaine Treatment Center in Mexico, Dextraze goes through medical tests of his heart and liver and takes short-acting opioids so he doesn't get sick. He's advised to rest and do light exercise while learning about what to expect from the treatment. The clinic is actually two well-appointed homes next door to each other that the clinic owners rent in a gated residential community. The homes are private, perched high on a hill just south of Tijuana, with views of the Pacific Ocean. One home has treatment rooms and staff offices. The other is where patients stay for about a week after taking ibogaine. On the grounds are a sauna, a hot tub and hammocks. A chef prepares meals and clinic staffers oversee the patients. Once Dextraze is medically cleared, he can take ibogaine. It will be given at night, when the short-acting opiates wear off and Dextraze starts to go into withdrawal. The clinic staff have been warned Dextraze that he may see visions that aren't pleasant. Still, Dextraze is eager. ""I was a little nervous, but I'm just going to remind myself that this is in my head and none of it's real — nothing can hurt me,"" Dextraze says. Aeden Smith-Ahearn, the treatment coordinator, left, with Dextraze (John Gastaldo for WBUR) The day Dextraze is due to take ibogaine, he fasts after breakfast. Two nurses and a doctor monitor Dextraze and the other patient there at the time. Aeden Smith-Ahearn, the treatment coordinator, is also on hand to help. ""It's absolutely crucial to have medical staff here, because it is a dangerous substance,"" Smith-Ahearn says. ""It's cardiotoxic."" A Massachusetts native, Smith-Ahearn knew Dextraze before he came to Mexico. Six years ago, Smith-Ahearn came to Mexico to get ibogaine treatment for his own addiction to opioids. He's been an ibogaine enthusiast ever since. Smith-Ahearn estimates his clinic has treated more than 1,000 people in the past five years, and that more than 95 percent of them are from the U.S. He says most patients seek ibogaine after several tries at conventional treatment -- when they reach a point where they believe ibogaine is less risky than continuing to use drugs. ""Just having gone through the hell that most of these people have gone through — and because of how the American health system is set up — I just feel that there is not a lot of hope for people over there,"" Smith-Ahearn says. Dr. Paul Castillo, who will administer the ibogaine, also works in a hospital emergency room in Mexico. He became a supporter of ibogaine after a friend who owned another clinic asked him to help monitor patients. ""When they arrive, [there are] like clouds in their eyes. After [ibogaine], shining eyes, smiling,"" Castillo says. ""They're alive, basically."" Castillo follows treatment guidelines from the Global Ibogaine Therapy Alliance, a Canadian nonprofit that developed the guidelines in 2015 and updated them last year. They recommend continuously monitoring patients — especially their hearts. The clinic says it gets the ibogaine from a lab it trusts in Africa. Right before he gives Dextraze the medication, Castillo hooks him up to a heart monitor and puts in an IV. He checks Dextraze's blood pressure and temperature. Then he gives him a capsule containing a small ""test dose"" to make sure Dextraze doesn't have an adverse reaction. After about an hour, he administers a full dose based on Dextraze's weight and drug history. Right before Dextraze is given the ibogaine, he's hooked to a heart monitor. (John Gastaldo for WBUR) (John Gastaldo for WBUR) The treatment is partly spiritual, Castillo says, so he and the nurses speak softly, dim the lights, and put on soft flute music. Smith-Ahearn burns sage in the treatment rooms, he says, for cleansing. Dextraze lies on a double bed, hooked up to the medical monitors with a sleeping mask over his eyes. ""I feel a little warm,"" he says. ""I feel something, but I'm just relaxed. Normally, in withdrawal, I wouldn't be this relaxed."" For about the next 10 hours Dextraze lies in the darkened room, mostly quiet. The medical staffers stay with him most of the night. The next morning Dextraze describes sometimes feeling as if his body was vibrating. He also says he saw visions, like someone was showing him photos of the negative things he has done. ""I saw my kids when I left them,"" Dextraze says, ""and I knew that they were sad and afraid that I wasn't coming back, so I kept saying, 'I didn't really leave them.' ""It also showed me other embarrassing things I've done ... I don’t want to go into detail about a lot of it. But once I said, 'OK, I did those things,' it got better. At first it seemed like it was not the greatest experience, because it wasn’t — but it was exactly what I needed."" And Dextraze says for the first time in three years, he doesn't have any withdrawal symptoms. ""Even when I was in detox I would feel some withdrawal,"" he says. ""But now, nothing, absolutely nothing."" The Psychedelic Experience It's not clear exactly how ibogaine eliminates withdrawal, but most studies describe it as affecting the brain's receptors in a way that resets them back to their pre-addictive state. Dr. Alan Davis, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University, has been a leader in studying psychedelic treatments. One of Davis' research papers surveyed 88 ibogaine patients, and 80 percent reported fewer or less intense withdrawal symptoms. ""There seems to be, especially for people who have an opioid use disorder, some critical piece that often gets in the way of success in treatments that are currently available in the United States,"" Davis says. ""You know, most people drop out of detox or treatment because of their withdrawal symptoms or cravings. ""I wouldn't say this is a magic bullet. I think there are a lot of unknowns about why it works for some people."" Davis' research also found that many of those who reported success from ibogaine attributed it in large part to the psychedelic experience. Essentially, they said they benefited as much from the psychedelic trip as they did from the removal of the physical withdrawal symptoms. Davis is studying this in other psychedelics, too — namely the substance 5 MEO-DMT, which is said to cause an intense mystical experience. Many ibogaine clinics offer other psychedelics, like 5 MEO-DMT, as complementary treatments. Dextraze's psychedelic experience under ibogaine was considered somewhat minimal. So three days after taking the ibogaine, the clinic gives him 5 MEO-DMT. A Short But Intense Trip Smith-Ahearn puts a sand-like substance into a small glass pipe and lights it. ""It's life-changing,"" Smith-Ahearn says, ""and what you're about to see with Dustin, it's mind-blowing."" Dextraze inhales from the glass pipe, holds it in for a few seconds, and lays back on a bed in the treatment room. Almost immediately, he starts intensely tripping. Three days after taking ibogaine, Dustin Dextraze inhales a dose of 5 MEO-DMT, a powerful psychedelic used by Experience Ibogaine Treatment Center in Mexico as a supplemental treatment. (Deborah Becker/WBUR) Dustin Dextraze is tripping on 5 MEO-DMT given to him as part of his opioid addiction treatment at the ibogaine clinic in Mexico. (Deborah Becker/WBUR) He's smiling and yells out while staring at the ceiling, addressing people or things unseen: ""Yeah dude ... I knew it, man. ... I don't have to hang onto anything anymore. ... I don't ever want to come back from this. ... Please don't ever go away."" After about 20 minutes Dextraze becomes coherent again. When he's able to describe the experience, he calls it one of the most positive, intense things he's ever been through. ""I was surrounded by love,"" Dextraze says. ""I just feel completely at peace. It's like I understand the world, and I know now that I will never be a slave to drugs again."" Psychedelics are increasingly being used and tested for a variety of disorders such as PTSD and depression. Another addiction clinic in Mexico, the Baja Ibogaine Center, offers the anesthetic ketamine to patients struggling with depression. The center's owner, Jose Cerva, says these medications should be further researched and might help with the opioid epidemic. ""I don’t know why it is this way,"" Cerva says. ""The U.S. has the funds to start doing studies on ibogaine and other psychedelics. America has to be more open about it. There is a lot of potential, and the U.S. addiction treatment system is obviously failing."" Will Ibogaine Work In The Long-Term? The long-term success rate of ibogaine is not known. Both clinics in Mexico say no one in their care has died from taking ibogaine, and both estimate about 40 percent of their patients stay off drugs long-term. But the clinics acknowledge that information comes from those patients they stay in contact with. They add that the key to success for patients is ongoing support, and many times that means conventional treatment after they leave the clinic. Davis, from John Hopkins, says this is where his research found a significant problem. ""Largely absent [in his ibogaine study] was any followup aftercare,"" Davis says. ""So people who return home may not have the support they need to continue making changes in their lives.""

""Now you have to work at it. ... You can't just leave here and expect that that part of your life is magically over."" Aeden Smith-Ahearn, treatment coordinator, to Dextraze"

Riley Morrison wrote in her letter, which her father posted online on Nov. 18, that she's a big fan of the Golden State Warriors point guard, and in preparation for her basketball season wanted a pair of Under Armour Icon Curry 5 sneakers.

But when she visited the website to buy them, she didn't see them listed under the girls' tab.

He said he has now worked with Under Armour to put them in the girls section too, and sure enough the shoes are now there, customizable and with instructions for women to order the sneakers one and a half size smaller than their usual size.

Curry also told Riley he was sending her a pair of Curry 5s, and said she would be among the first kids to have the Curry 6s.

Researchers say blood test can detect cancer years before symptoms,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jul/21/researchers-unveil-test-that-can-detect-cancer-years-before-symptoms,"Team based in China develop test that identifies cancers up to four years before signs appear

A blood test can pick up cancers up to four years before symptoms appear, researchers say, in the latest study to raise hopes of early detection.

A team led by researchers in China say the non-invasive blood test – called PanSeer – detects cancer in 95% of individuals who have no symptoms but later receive a diagnosis.

“We demonstrated that five types of cancer can be detected through a DNA methylation-based blood test up to four years before conventional diagnosis,” the team wrote in the journal Nature Communications.

They said the test was unlikely to be predicting cancer but rather picking up on cancerous growths that had not yet caused symptoms or been spotted by other methods.

Such tests, known as liquid biopsies, have become the focus of much research as they offer a non-invasive way to screen patients..

Could we soon be able to detect cancer in 10 minutes? Read more

The new study is not the first to report positive results for a blood test for early detection of cancer. However, the team said the research was exciting because it showed cancers could be detected before patients showed any indication of symptoms – something few studies have shown before.

The researchers reported how the new test was based on screening particular regions of DNA found in blood plasma for telltale tags, called methyl groups, that often crop up in tumour DNA. The team said they used techniques that allowed them to pick up even very small levels of such DNA.

They then used machine learning algorithms – a type of artificial intelligence – to develop a system that could determine whether any DNA found circulating in the blood was indeed shed by tumours, based on the presence of these methyl groups.

To develop the test, the team used blood plasma samples collected from individuals in China between 2007 and 2014 as part of a wider research endeavour.

Overall, 414 samples were used from participants who remained cancer-free at least five years after the blood was taken, and 191 samples were used from participants who were diagnosed with stomach, colorectal, liver, lung or oesophageal cancer within four years of the blood being collected. The team also used samples from biobanks from 223 patients already diagnosed with one of the five cancers.

After training the system on about half of the samples, the team tested their approach on the remainder.

The results revealed PanSeer flagged cancer in 88% of participants who had already been diagnosed and in 95% of participants who were not diagnosed with cancer but later went on to develop the disease. The test correctly identified those without cancer 96% of the time.

The study has limitations, including that it is based on a relatively small number of samples, storage was not optimal, and the team has raised some concerns about possible contamination. Also, the test cannot identify which type of cancer an individual has.

But Dr Eric Klein, of Cleveland Clinic’s Taussig Cancer Institute, who was part of a team that previously revealed a liquid biopsy that can identify 10 different types of cancer at an early stage and predict which organ is affected, welcomed the new research.

“This is an exciting study which provides further confirmation that methylation-based assays can detect cell-free circulating tumour DNA and may form the basis for new screening tests that detect cancer at early stages,” he said. “There is a need for such tests to screen for cancers for which there are currently are no effective screening paradigms.”

Samantha Harrison, a senior early diagnosis manager at Cancer Research UK, said: “The PanSeer test has achieved encouraging initial results. Promisingly, the test may be able to detect cancer in blood samples taken years before diagnosis. But these are early results that now need to be validated in larger studies.”"

Over 15,000 student households in five school districts were gifted with free internet connectivity this morning, as many children struggle with online learning due to unreliable Wi-Fi amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.

""Good Morning America,"" revealed the surprise today to students attending five public school districts located in Allegheny Valley, Pennsylvania, Jackson, Mississippi, Baltimore, Maryland, Santa Fe, New Mexico and South Bend, Indiana. They will now have five years of free internet connection in their homes, thanks to T-Mobile's Project 10Million--a program that aims to eventually get free Wi-Fi to 10 million students' households in the US.

""It means a lot to the community--to narrow the gap, for students to have the opportunity to have internet access at home. It's amazing,"" said Shawn Henderson, principal of Riley High School in South Bend. ""We're blessed, thank you.""

Of the 50 million children learning remotely, between 15 and 16 million lack adequate internet connectivity, according to the Center for Democracy and Technology. As a result, many students have turned to fast food restaurants or school parking lots to access online classes.

In Jackson, where school administrators are dealing with the challenges of online learning, Errick Greene, Superintendent of Jackson Public Schools told “Good Morning America” that about 25 percent of students are not connected through the internet.

The digital divide has been present even before the pandemic hit, with many households without internet access due to racial, economic and geographic inequalities.

""There’s a lot of barriers, infrastructure barriers, cost barriers and just barriers in general to getting people connected,"" said Brett Slezak, Supervisor of Technology at Allegheny Valley School in Pennsylvania.

In Baltimore, 20,000 families were without access to broadband, which is equivalent to 40,000 students.

And in indigenous communities in New Mexico, 40 percent of students do not have internet access.

""We had some families that might go to town to go to a Starbucks or McDonald's to use Wi-Fi said Kimball Sekaquaptewa, chief technology director at the Santa Fe Indian School.

""They did what they needed to do, but that is just unacceptable in our community,"" said Sekaquaptewa.

""To keep our tradition strong is to continue to learn our language. And without Internet access, I don't think we'll have the privilege of that,"" added Marcelina Smith, a member of the Jemez Nation.

Now, as many students have begun the school year across the country, school districts are working hard to close the gap.

In South Bend, where public schools have deployed buses with Wi-Fi to neighborhoods that needed it most, T-Mobile has gifted hot spots with free data for five years through its initiative, Project 10Million, which delivers reliable internet connectivity for free to students who don’t have access to it.

School administrators or parents interested in receiving free hotspots and data for students in their school district can learn more on T-Mobile's website.

In addition, Donors Choose is helping educators receive school supplies during these challenging times.

While it’s been challenging for families across the country during the pandemic, educators and communities all over the country aren’t giving up.

""While there’s great needs, there’s also great sense of soul and heart and care that this community has and demonstrates daily as they help us to ensure that all of our scholars have their basic needs met,"" said Greene.

""We have to do it all together,"" Slezak added. “We have to think about what’s best for making everything work for our families."""

"Australian mining giant Fortescue Metals Group has lost their bid to overturn a native title claim that covers one of their iron ore mines, with the High Court ruling in favour of the Yindjibarndi people",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-29/fortescue-andrew-forrest-native-title-yac-high-court-decision/12299700,"The head of an Aboriginal corporation in Western Australia's Pilbara says he can ""give the next generation hope"" after mining giant Fortescue Metals Group lost its High Court bid against a native title determination covering one of its iron ore mines.

The company was seeking to contest the exclusive possession rights of the Yindjibarndi people over land in the Pilbara that includes the site of its multi-billion-dollar Solomon mine hub.

On Friday, the High Court rejected the company's application for special leave to have the case heard, with costs to be paid by FMG.

The failed bid to the High Court came after the $41 billion company lost a Federal Court appeal last year where five judges unanimously decided to uphold the Yindjibarndi people's native title rights.

Friday's decision paves the way for the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation (YAC) — the organisation representing about 800 traditional owners — to pursue what is expected to be a multi-million-dollar compensation payout for both economic loss and spiritual harm.

YAC had been fighting for ownership of its land since 2003, when it first lodged a formal native title claim while simultaneously fighting for a cut of mining royalties.

Most of the Yindjibarndi people are based in the small Pilbara town of Roebourne and were not in court for the decision, which was handed down in Brisbane but streamed to court rooms in Perth and Sydney.

Speaking to the ABC from Roebourne, Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation's chief executive Michael Woodley said they ""clapped and cheered"" when the news arrived.

""This is a real jubilant moment today,"" Mr Woodley said. ""We can rest easy now, knowing this is the end.

""We can give the next generation some hope from this point forward.""

Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation's legal representative Tina Jowett said it was a ""brilliant outcome"" for the traditional owners.

She said the Yindjibarndi had ""never got a cent"" from FMG.

""Having that huge mine built in their land … they deserve to get compensation so they can benefit their community,"" she said.

""This is for their health and housing that they so desperately need. Now we will start to put a compensation claim together.

""It [the compensation claim] will take quite a bit of time, we think a year or two to put together, but that's definitely the next thing that's going to happen here.""

In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange, FMG said it was ""disappointed"" with the outcome.

It said it did not expect the decision to impact its operations or mining tenure at the Solomon hub and it did not anticipate ""any material financial impact"".

At an FMG shareholders meeting last year, company founder and chairman Andrew Forrest called compensation for the Yindjibarndi people ""mining welfare"" and said Roebourne was ""not a community I'm going to empower with tens of millions of your cash"".

On today's iron ore price, the mine generates roughly $6.5 billion in revenue each year for the company.

The High Court decision has failed to scare investors, with the company's share price closing up 17 cents on Friday to $13.69 a share, valuing Mr Forrest's stake at $15.2 billion.

FMG's High Court challenge was led by Bret Walker SC, one of Australia's most eminent silks and barrister for George Pell's recent High Court acquittal.

Legal representatives for Fortescue, YAC and the WA State Solicitor's Office all made brief arguments in court.

Lengthy submissions had already been filed to the court weeks prior.

But after an hour of discussion between the parties, the court ruled the application would be dismissed.

YAC's lawyers loudly exclaimed, while Fortescue's representative, Mr Walker, quickly left the room.

YAC's chief executive Michael Woodley said compensation from FMG would help fix their social, cultural and economic struggles. ( ABC News: Susan Standen )

The legal dispute with FMG began in 2017, after the traditional owners were awarded exclusive native title — after applying in 2003 — over a parcel of land that included Fortescue's Solomon Mine Hub.

The Solomon iron ore deposit was discovered by FMG geologists in 2005.

Unlike non-exclusive native title, the exclusive ruling now means the Yindjibarndi have legal possession rights and can control who accesses and uses their land.

FMG had been operating the mine without an agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, after negotiations broke down in 2008.

In its submission to the court, the company was contesting the concept of exclusive native title.

Speaking to the ABC earlier this week, native title expert and former WA Law Society president Greg McIntyre described FMG's argument as a ""hard-nosed approach"".

""It really boils down to an argument that if the colonisers have come in and flexed their muscles and made it the case that Indigenous people are subservient to them, then that is a basis for taking away their rights.""

WA Aboriginal Affairs Minister Ben Wyatt said the decision marked the end of a ""17-year struggle"".

""My congratulations to the Yindjibarndi people for the patience, grace and determination they have demonstrated since first lodging this claim in 2003,"" he said.

""I hope the divisions created through this process can now begin to heal.""

Northern California Esselen tribe regains ancestral land after 250 years,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/28/northern-california-esselen-tribe-regains-land-250-years,"The tribe purchased the 1,200 acre ranch near Big Sur as part of a $4.5m deal and will use it for educational and cultural purposes

This article is more than 2 months old

Two-hundred and fifty years after they were stripped of their ancestral homeland, the Esselen tribe of northern California is landless no more.

This week, the Esselen tribe finalized the purchase of a 1,200-acre ranch near Big Sur, along California’s north central coast, as part of a $4.5m acquisition that involved the state and an Oregon-based environmental group.

The deal will conserve old-growth redwoods and endangered wildlife such as the California condor and red-legged frog, as well as protect the Little Sur River, an important spawning stream for the imperiled steelhead trout.

Tribal leaders say they’ll use the land for educational and cultural purposes, building a sweat lodge and traditional village in view of Pico Blanco peak, the center of the tribe’s origin story.

“We’re the original stewards of the land. Now we’re returned,” Tom Little Bear Nason, chairman of the Esselen tribe of Monterey county, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel.

“We are going to conserve it and pass it on to our children and grandchildren and beyond.”

Nearly 250 years ago, Spanish soldiers built a military outpost in Monterey and Franciscan padres founded missions in nearby settlements – places where tribal members were brought to be baptized and converted to Catholicism. By the early 1800s, nearly all of the remaining tribe had been decimated by disease and death. Esselen tribal members were stripped of their land, language and culture.

But this week, after 250 years, their descendants reclaimed some of their land. The tribe has no plans on leaving.

“We are back after a 250-year absence – because in 1770 our people were taken to the missions,” Nason told Monterey County Weekly. “Now we are back home. We plan on keeping this land forever.”

Since the 1950s the property, known as Rancho Aguila, had been owned by Axel Adler, a Swedish immigrant. After his death in 2004, his family put it up for sale for $15m. After years-long negotiations, the Western Rivers Conservancy, a Portland-based environmental group, etched a deal to purchase the land and hand it over to the US Forest Service.

Working on behalf of the tribe, the conservancy secured a $4.5m grant from the California Natural Resources Agency to cover the land purchase and studies of the area.

“The property is spectacular, and on top of that it repatriates land to a tribe that has had a really hard go of it over the years. To be a part of helping a tribe regain its homeland is great,” said Sue Doroff, president of the Western Rivers Conservancy.

While the property was originally expected to be broken in five lots that developers could build on, this week’s deal will allow the tribe to preserve the land as undeveloped.

Nason said the 214-member Esselen tribe will share it with other groups also native to the area, including the Ohlone, the Amah Mutsun and the Rumsen people – all of whom were devastated by the arrival of white settlers.

“Getting this land back gives privacy to do our ceremonies,” Nason said. “It gives us space and the ability to continue our culture without further interruption. This is forever, and in perpetuity, that we can hold on to our culture and our values.”"

And when he turned up wearing a suit and with a bunch of flowers for Ellie she said it reduced her to tears.

Speaking exclusively to Sun Online Ellie said: “He said it was his first ‘date’ in 55 years and he was as nervous as a schoolboy.

“It made me cry because I could see how much it meant to him. For me it’s the most important part of my job to speak with customers and see how their day is going.”

Ellie who has worked in a Leeds branch of the supermarket for three years, said Edwin pops into the store on most days and chats to staff.

She offered to take him to dinner over the Christmas period after hearing he would be spending the day alone with a ready meal.

Now the unlikely pals meet for coffee and a chat regularly and Ellie says they enjoy each others company.

She added: “He is without a shadow of a doubt my favourite customer.

“He is the cutest man and so chatty. I thought if it was my granddad and he was alone I would want someone to talk to him.

“I see him regularly now and we meet for coffee. It’s nice to be able to chat with him.""

Former painter and decorator Edwin said: “The dinner made me very happy as it was unexpected and I had very pleasant company.”

The pensioner, who lives in sheltered housing not too far from the store, lost his wife in 2006 after 45 years of marriage.

He has no family in this country as his daughter and two grandchildren live in Australia.

He added: “As for the suit, it was my first date for about 55 years, and I got the flowers because I wasn't going to go empty handed.”

FDA May Soon Allow MDMA Prescriptions for PTSD,https://reason.com/archives/2018/07/31/fda-may-soon-allow-mdma-prescr,"""I was finally able to process all the dark stuff that happened,"" Nicholas Blackston, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, told The New York Times, describing his experience with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. ""I was able to forgive myself. It was like a clean sweep.""

MDMA, which was banned by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1985, could be available by prescription as soon as 2021. The rehabilitation of MDMA, a.k.a. ""ecstasy"" or ""molly,"" is directly related to the rehabilitation of veterans like Blackston, who participated in a study that confirmed the drug's potential as a catalyst for catharsis.

The trial was sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and reported on May 1 in The Lancet Psychiatry. It involved 22 military veterans, three firefighters, and one police officer, all of whom had been diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ""resulting from traumatic experience during their service."" The researchers, led by Charleston, South Carolina, psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer, randomly assigned the participants to receive 30, 75, or 125 milligrams of MDMA in conjunction with two psychotherapy sessions separated by about a month. The lowest dose served as an ""active placebo."" Neither the researchers nor the subjects knew who was receiving which amount.

The results were striking. Average scores on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), which indicates symptom severity, fell by 71 percent in the medium-dose group and 49 percent in the high-dose group, compared to 13 percent in the low-dose group. Sixty-eight percent of the medium- and high-dose subjects no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared to 29 percent of the low-dose subjects.

When people in the control group were given the opportunity to use higher doses of MDMA, they saw additional progress. One year after the MDMA sessions, the mean CAPS score for all subjects was 39, down from 87 at the beginning of the study. The cutoff for a PTSD diagnosis is 50.

These large, persistent improvements reinforce the results of an earlier MAPS-sponsored study that provided MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to crime victims.

The next step is Phase 3 clinical trials, which are the last stage before the Food and Drug Administration decides whether to approve the drug as a treatment for PTSD.

Last August, the agency streamlined that process by deeming MDMA a ""breakthrough therapy,"" meaning it ""may demonstrate substantial improvement"" over current options. Mithoefer notes that ""at least one in two PTSD patients cannot tolerate or do not respond adequately to existing treatments."" MAPS plans to start the Phase 3 studies this summer."
Southwest Airlines removes woman from flight after they are notified her son was in an accident. Immediately puts her on flight home free of charge.,http://www.faithit.com/kicked-off-plane-back-to-the-gate/,"One of the biggest idols in our world today is the bottom dollar. With common phrases like, “everyone has a price” and “money makes the world go ’round” it’s no wonder why the concept that success and money go together in our culture. Enter Southwest Airlines. No we are not getting paid for this story. We’re sharing it because it shows that loving people successfully often comes at a cost and it was a price that the airline was happy to pay for this passenger.

They went above and beyond their responsibilities right after they learned that the son of one of their passengers had just been in a life threatening accident. Peggy Uhle was on a flight from Chicago to Columbus in her seat with the plane still in the runway when the plane turned back to the gate and she was asked to get off.

“I figured I was on the wrong plane. The gate agent told me to check in at the desk and when I did she told me to call my husband,” Uhle said. After she got off the plane customer service told her that her son, who lives in Denver, was in a coma after suffering a head injury. Even before Uhle had disembarked, the airline rebooked on the next non-stop flight to Denver–free of charge.

“They offered a private waiting area, rerouted my luggage, allowed me to board first, and packed a lunch for when I got off the plane in Denver,” Uhle told Boarding Area. “My luggage was delivered to where I was staying, and I even received a call from Southwest asking how my son was doing.”

Uhle said her son is still recovering but she couldn’t be more grateful for the way she was treated. It’s so awesome to see major corporations doing awesome things for awesome people!"

Colin Kaepernick is giving back on his birthday ... and doing so for the people who need it most.

The former NFL quarterback was out in Oakland Sunday to celebrate his 32nd birthday, but rather than party it up ... he was out in the streets bright and early helping to feed and supply the countless homeless residents lining Tent City -- Oaktown's own skid row.

In partnership with his foundation, Know Your Rights Camp, and with the help of his girlfriend, Nessa, Colin was literally walking around handing out backpacks that were filled with snacks, socks, air quality masks, shampoo and other crucial resources.

He even got a food truck to come out and feed everyone on his dime -- which folks seemed more than grateful for as Colin and co. pointed them in the direction of some free grub.

Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

Of course, Colin also drew a crowd of locals who were clamoring for photo-ops ... which he happily obliged. Fitting he did this in the Bay too -- a place he's all too familiar with.

You'll recall ... CK was the SF 49ers' QB just a few years ago, before he exited the NFL amid his National Anthem protest ... and without even so much as a proper workout since.

That's not gonna get him down on his birthday though -- he's clearly still out there working for the people, and doing it with a smile to boot. BTW, it looks like he's been doing this on his birthday for a little while now ... based on a flashback video from 2016.

Botond Roska, who works in the Swiss city of Basel, has uncovered a gene-based therapy that reprograms cells in the human eye so that they can perform the work of the light-sensitive receptors needed for human vision, according to the Körber Foundation that hands out the annual prize. It is hoped the procedure will reactivate the retinas of the blind.

Iger made the announcement at Texas Children's Hospital.

Though hospitals worldwide will benefit from the initiative, Texas Children's will be the first to work with the company.

""We chose Texas Children's Hospital because they are global leaders in pediatric care as well as the largest children's hospital in the country and their dedicated healers share our commitment to support the emotional well being of young patients and their families,"" Iger said.





Iger said that the company has also assembled a Team of Heroes, which is a group of patient care experts to help Disney understand various aspects of the patient experience such as what causes the most stress for parents.

""We're going to use our beloved characters and renown creativity to bring our timeless stories to life in innovative ways and hopefully transform a hospital stay into a warmer, more personalized environment for each patient,"" Iger said during the announcement.

Texas Children's Hospital also presented Iger with a special picture.

Commissioned by Walt Disney himself, it's a depiction of Texas Children's Hospital while it was under construction in 1952.

The hospital opened two years later in 1954.

Dog sworn into Illinois state's attorney's office to provide support for sexual assault victims,https://abcnews.go.com/US/dog-sworn-illinois-states-attorneys-office-provide-support/story?id=66665033&fbclid=IwAR2QrVj7iB2MJMzLUpxxmBjMHTHYXC9erFJEV8Bf7EgcjMlecio0BPsivo4,"Dog sworn into Illinois state's attorney's office to provide support for sexual assault victims Hatty, the black Labrador, will provide comfort to sexual assault victims.

A state's attorney's office in Illinois has welcomed its newest member: Hatty the black lab.

The 2-year-old dog was sworn into the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Tuesday, placing her right paw over a law book during the ceremony.

Hatty will join the office to provide support to children who are victims of sexual assault, according to State's Attorney Kim Foxx.

""Coming to this work with compassion and understanding of victims' experiences helps to ensure the system is fair and just to everyone,"" Fox said on Twitter. ""Hatty was trained to help provide comfort and relaxation while victims are in the courthouse or while they are giving their testimony.""

Hatty is expected to handle between 150 to 200 cases each year, according to Cook County.

She is the office's first therapy dog and was trained by inmates through the group called Duo, which is an assistance dogs provider and training organization based in St. Louis, Missouri.

""We are proud to have a resource like Hatty to provide a source of comfort for victims as they navigate this difficult process,"" the Cook County office said in a tweet."
Suicide bombing survivor gets highest score in country on Afghanistan's national exam,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/world/asia/afghanistan-woman-university.html,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Shamsea Alizada’s story could so easily have ended when she was just 15.

A coal miner’s daughter whose family had moved all around Afghanistan seeking safety and the chance for her and her siblings to get a good education, Ms. Alizada was among the lucky who evaded the suicide bombing that killed dozens of her fellow students at a Kabul tutoring center two years ago.

But if it was luck that saved Ms. Alizada, now 17, it was resilience and hard work that made her a national inspiration, when it was announced on television on Thursday that she had achieved the highest score out of nearly 200,000 students on Afghanistan’s national university entrance exam. Her mother saw it and gave her the happy news personally.

“I thought she was kidding. But when I entered the room, I saw the brightest smile on my mother’s face,” Ms. Alizada said in an interview. “I have seen her smiling, but yesterday’s smile was something else. Her smile was a gift and made my day; it was better than gaining the highest score in the country.”

A generation ago, she would probably never have gotten the chance. Under Taliban rule, girls were prevented from going to school. It is the success of Ms. Alizada and young Afghans like her that have provided one of the few bright spots in the decades of war and unrealized Western goals since: More girls are not only going to school, they are also starting to translate that into social mobility."
More than 100 seal pups born in the Thames 60 years after the river was declared 'biologically dead',https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/02/100-seal-pups-born-thames-60-years-river-declared-biologically/,"In 1957 the River Thames was so heavily polluted it was declared “biologically dead” by the Natural History Museum leaving hope for marine life lost.

But now, more than 60 years after the museum's dismal proclamation, experts have counted over 100 seal pups on the river’s shores.

Scientists from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), an international conservation charity, were ""thrilled"" to discover 138 pups on the sandbanks and creeks of the river in what is the first ever comprehensive count of the offspring.

Using a light aircraft, they were able to capture images during pupping season of the harbour seals, also known as the common seal.

The count is evidence that the London river’s ecosystem has come back from the brink after the National History Museum said its low oxygen levels and polluted waters would mean nothing could survive in its murky tides.

The pioneering research took place in 2018, with the data released for the first time today. It saw scientists carefully analyse hundreds of photos taken as part of UK-wide seal monitoring initiative.

Explaining the decision to count using photographs, ZSL said it was “much easier, and so more accurate, to count the seals in photos instead of the constantly moving, playful creatures”."
"25 years after returning to Yellowstone, wolves have helped stabilize the ecosystem",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/07/yellowstone-wolves-reintroduction-helped-stabilize-ecosystem/,"Twenty-five years after gray wolves returned to Yellowstone National Park, the predators that some feared would wipe out elk have instead proved to be more of a stabilizing force. New research shows that by reducing populations and thinning out weak and sick animals, wolves are helping create more resilient elk herds.

For the past 12 years, elk numbers in the park’s largest herd have leveled off between about 6,000 and 8,000, instead of extreme boom-and-bust cycles due to climate fluctuations.

“Elk aren’t starving to death anymore,” says Chris Wilmers, a wildlife ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

During years with normal amounts of rain and snow, wolves primarily kill older cow elk, since they’re the easiest to hunt. But Wilmers led a recent study that showed during particularly dry years—when grass, shrubs, and wildflowers aren’t as lush—wolves switch to hunting bulls. These burly males already don’t eat much in the fall, focusing instead on making deafening bugles and smashing into each other while fighting over cows. All that effort burns calories, weakening them heading into winter. In dry years, they’re even more diminished.

As adaptable, intelligent predators, wolves have learned to recognize these conditions, and they would rather kill an undernourished 750-pound bull versus a 450-pound cow. So by targeting bulls during years of scarce food, they give the cows a chance to reproduce, thus keeping the population afloat. (Explore the Yellowstone most don’t see.)

But most importantly, the Yellowstone area’s wolves—which now number between 300 and 350—could help elk herds weather the perils of a more volatile climate, according to the study, published in the Journal of Animal Ecology. For instance, elk herds that maintain consistent numbers, rather than yo-yoing up and down, can better withstand more frequent droughts—one impact of climate change that is already occurring in the region.

“In a future that will be very unpredictable, we want a buffer” against mass die-offs, says Doug Smith, Yellowstone’s senior wildlife biologist, and wolves’ ability to keep elk herds balanced can play that role. Through hunting and management practices, “humans help stabilize elk populations, but they don’t do the same thing as wolves.”

The findings in Yellowstone are also relevant, he adds, as Coloradans vote in November whether to reintroduce wolves to their state, home to about 287,000 elk—the largest number in the U.S.

Finding a balance

For their study, Wilmers, Smith, and colleagues analyzed more than a thousand dead elk in Yellowstone—located in the states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho—over 20 years. The scientists spent about a month at the beginning and end of each winter tracking three wolf packs, locating every elk kill the wolves made; recording the dead animal’s age and sex; and removing a bone marrow sample, which determined the elk’s physical condition before death. The team then used satellite data to derive how much plant life was available for elk to eat each year, an amount dependent on snowmelt and rainfall.

Synthesizing all of that data revealed that wolves target bulls during years when vegetation is poor, offering a clearer understanding of how shifts in climate can change predators’ behaviors.

This is especially useful for managing and conserving wolves, which are still rebuilding their numbers after over a century of persecution. Before the 1900s, Yellowstone predators such as grizzly bears, black bears, wolves, and mountain lions thrived alongside robust populations of American bison, elk, mule deer, pronghorn, and bighorn sheep.

But a coordinated campaign by the federal government exterminated almost all those predators, and bison, from the area. The last known Yellowstone wolf pack was killed in 1926, and the canines were also wiped out in most of their historic range in much of the lower 48, hanging on in a few populations around the Great Lakes. (Read more about the history of Yellowstone National Park.)

With the wolves gone, and bears and lions greatly diminished, elk populations skyrocketed. Between 1932 and 1968, the U.S. National Park Service and the state of Montana removed more than 70,000 elk from the Northern Yellowstone herd by killing them or shipping them across the country to areas where they’d been eliminated.

When the park stopped killing elk in 1968, numbers shot up again from about 5,000 to close to 20,000. For the next several decades, elk cycled through population booms and collapses along with climate fluctuations; hard winters left the ground littered with hundreds of the carcasses of elk that had starved to death. Then, between 1995 and 1997, wildlife officials reintroduced 41 wolves to Yellowstone. Grizzly bears and mountain lions, which also prey on elk, increased due to more protections from states and the federal government. The elk population dropped, eventually evening out the spikes and dips.

Watch Yellowstone's wolves on the hunt

In the winter of 2010 to 2011, for instance, elk fared relatively well during abnormally deep snow and cold temperatures, compared with the mass deaths seen during similar winters in the 1980s and 1990s, Smith says. (Read about the threatened species bouncing back in Yellowstone.)

“These systems are better evolved or better adapted to that way of life than elk starving to death,” Smith says. “What elk starving to death means is they’re eating themselves out of house and home.”

Lessons for other states

As November’s ballot initiative looms, researchers are using the 25 years of data to predict what might happen if the predators return to Colorado or any other U.S. state within the species’ historic range. Some groups are pushing to reintroduce more Mexican wolves, a gray wolf subspecies, into their former habitats of New Mexico and Arizona.

So far, there are more questions than answers. While the Yellowstone area is vast and sparsely populated, much of Colorado is not—which means where wolves would be reintroduced, how many would be allowed to roam the mountains, and how much humans would tolerate their presence are all potential challenges, says Joanna Lambert, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder and scientific advisor for the Rocky Mountain Wolf Project, which advocates for wolf reintroduction. (See 12 of our favorite wolf photos.)

State officials would manage the wolves, unlike packs reintroduced into Yellowstone, which were managed federally. This means that wolves that wandered outside Yellowstone Park were largely prohibited from being killed, particularly early in the reintroduction. Colorado would likely not have similar restrictions.

But one takeaway from Yellowstone is clear, Lambert says: Wolves will certainly eat some of Colorado’s abundant elk."

"Amid a critical shortage, London's pandemic ventilator inventor makes his design open source. CBC news",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/pandemic-ventilator-design-covid19-1.5511412,"The London, Ont. man who came up with a potential low-cost solution to Ontario's critical shortage of ventilators is making his design for a pandemic ventilator freely available to anyone through an open source website.

Retired respiratory therapist John Strupat said he made the decision after failing to get any kind of serious consideration to make the life-saving device from federal governments in Canada or the United States.

""It's been two weeks,"" he said. ""The pace is too slow. The [infection] numbers aren't even plateauing and I don't know what else to try.""

Strupat is making his design open source at a critical time, as hospitals brace for a potential surge of Canadian COVID-19 cases and with it a cruel reckoning: there may be not enough ventilators to go around if the infection rate spirals out of control like it has in Italy or Spain.

'They're all going to have PTSD from this'

John Strupat shows his pandemic ventilator prototype in action 1:29 John Strupat shows his pandemic ventilator prototype in action 1:29

Since CBC News first reported Strupat's story two weeks ago, he's been inundated by a deluge of emails and phone calls, many of them from increasingly anxious healthcare workers battling the illness on the front lines.

Many of them have told Strupat that as waves of the infection build, they could grow into a tsunami large enough to overwhelm the healthcare system.

""They're managing right now, that's the word they use. They're very nervous it will be coming.""

""You can imagine the decisions they're going to have to make soon, if there is more people than equipment,"" he said. ""I certainly wouldn't want to be in their shoes.""

""They're all going to have PTSD from this.""

We don't have enough ventilators to cope

If coronavirus were to go full throttle here like it has in Italy or Spain, Canada wouldn't have enough ventilators to cope. In Ontario, there are roughly 12 ventilators per 100,000 people, one of the lowest rates in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Canadian Medical Association President Dr. Sandy Buchman has already told the nation's doctors to prepare for the possibility that, if Canada found itself in as dire a situation as Italy, many people over 65 would not be allowed to be ventilated.

Dozens of people who fall into that category also have written to Strupat, asking whether they can have his design to build their own ventilator, or in some cases buy his prototype outright so they can bring it to hospital in case they get infected.

""How scary is that? Most of those come from the U.S. because they look at healthcare a little differently than us.""

Design free to 'anyone from anywhere'

Emails and phone calls such as those are the biggest impetus for Strupat to make his design freely available.

""Anyone from anywhere can look at the design and decide for themselves if they want to manufacture it or share ideas on developing this for their own country,"" he said.

Strupat said while his $500 design may not offer the same standard of care as the current $25,000 designs used at hospitals, his machine would save lives, even in a blackout.

""It will run three to four hours before the batteries die,"" he said. ""If I had my choice, I'd rather be on that than nothing if it came down to it.""

While federal governments in Canada and the United States might not be receptive to his invention, Strupat said he'll keep trying.

""I'm not giving up yet, I'm just a little frustrated.""

Drugs that could signal the end of HIV and AIDS are here,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/02/end-to-aids-in-sight-as-huge-study-finds-drugs-stop-hiv-transmission,"An end to the Aids epidemic could be in sight after a landmark study found men whose HIV infection was fully suppressed by antiretroviral drugs had no chance of infecting their partner.

The success of the medicine means that if everyone with HIV were fully treated, there would be no further infections.

Among nearly 1,000 male couples across Europe where one partner with HIV was receiving treatment to suppress the virus, there were no cases of transmission of the infection to the HIV-negative partner during sex without a condom. Although 15 men were infected with HIV during the eight-year study, DNA testing proved that was through sex with someone other than their partner who was not on treatment.

“It’s brilliant – fantastic. This very much puts this issue to bed,” said Prof Alison Rodger from University College London, the co-leader of the paper published in the Lancet medical journal. Earlier studies have also shown the treatment protects heterosexual couples where one partner has HIV.

She added: “Our findings provide conclusive evidence for gay men that the risk of HIV transmission with suppressive ART [antiretroviral therapy] is zero. Our findings support the message of the international U=U campaign that an undetectable viral load makes HIV untransmittable.

“This powerful message can help end the HIV pandemic by preventing HIV transmission, and tackling the stigma and discrimination that many people with HIV face.

“Increased efforts must now focus on wider dissemination of this powerful message and ensuring that all HIV-positive people have access to testing, effective treatment, adherence support and linkage to care to help maintain an undetectable viral load.”

In 2017, there were almost 40 million people worldwide living with HIV, of whom 21.7 million were on antiretroviral treatment. An estimated 101,600 people are living with HIV in the UK, and of these, about 7,800 are undiagnosed, so do not know they are HIV positive.

Myron S Cohen of the UNC Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at Chapel Hill in North Carolina, said in a commentary in the Lancet on the study that it should push the world forward on a strategy to test and treat everyone who has HIV. But, he added, maximising the benefits of treatment, particularly for men who have sex with men, has proved difficult.

“It is not always easy for people to get tested for HIV or find access to care; in addition, fear, stigma, homophobia and other adverse social forces continue to compromise HIV treatment,” he said.

“Diagnosis of HIV infection is difficult in the early stages of infection when transmission is very efficient, and this limitation also compromises the treatment as prevention strategy.”

According to the National Aids Trust, 97% of people on HIV treatment in the UK have an undetectable level of the virus, meaning they cannot pass it on. “Hearing this can be enormously empowering and reassuring to people living with HIV,” said Deborah Gold, the trust’s chief executive.

The latest findings reinforce the importance of people taking HIV tests frequently, which could ultimately end the transmission of the virus altogether in the future. New diagnoses have been declining since their peak in 2005, with figures from 2017 showing a 17% drop on 2016 and a 28% fall compared with 2015.

Late diagnosis remains a major challenge, still accounting for about 43% of new HIV diagnoses. This disproportionately affects certain groups, including black African heterosexual men and people aged 65 and older.

“If we don’t reduce late diagnosis, there will always be those who are not aware of their HIV status and who therefore cannot access treatment,” said Gold. “We think that the findings from this study could be incredibly powerful in breaking down some of the barriers to testing in communities where there is still a lot of stigma around HIV.”

However, she added that government funding cuts to specialist health services would make it more difficult to achieve a goal of eliminating transmission by 2030.

Jens Lundgren, a professor of infectious diseases at Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, and joint-lead for the study, called Partner, said: “We have now provided the conclusive scientific evidence for how treatment effectively prevents further sexual transmission of HIV.”

Dr Michael Brady, the medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “It is impossible to overstate the importance of these findings.

“The Partner study has given us the confidence to say, without doubt, that people living with HIV who are on effective treatment cannot pass the virus on to their sexual partners. This has incredible impact on the lives of people living with HIV and is a powerful message to address HIV-related stigma.”

Bruce Richman, the founding executive director of the Prevention Access Campaign, which launched U=U, said Pac was tremendously grateful to the researchers and participants. He said the study “has for ever changed what it means to live and love with HIV around the world”.

In a linked comment in the journal, Cohen expressed optimism for future treatment of Aids. “During the course of these studies, antiretroviral drugs have become more effective, reliable, durable, easier to take, well tolerated and much less expensive,” he said.

“The results … provide yet one more catalyst for a universal test-and-treat strategy to provide the full benefits of antiretroviral drugs. This and other strategies continue to push us toward the end of Aids.”

Case study

Alex Sparrowhawk, 34, has been living with HIV for almost 10 years. When he was diagnosed in November 2009, he had two major concerns: how being HIV positive would impact his work as a financial analyst, and what it meant for future relationships.

“I was single at the time,” he said. “Just navigating what to do – when to tell people and how to talk to people was really difficult.”

Alex immediately began antiretroviral treatment, initially taking four pills a day, which was reduced to one pill once his viral load came down to undetectable levels several months later. The latest results confirm that for the past nine years, he has not been able to transmit the virus to anyone, although at the time, medical advice was less definitive.

Between his diagnosis and now, Alex spent six-and-a-half years in a relationship, and said the possibility – however tiny – of transmitting HIV to his partner was a source of anxiety. “You’d be told it was very unlikely, or that it was only possible under certain circumstances like having an STI,” he said. “But you’re constantly worried about these caveats and you go through this worry together.

“Now we can say zero risk, which is just so much more empowering for people. It’s a huge weight off your shoulders.”

Alex hopes the findings will help transform public attitudes about HIV, bringing them in line with medical evidence. “A lot of stigma is driven by fear of being exposed to HIV,” he said. “People still think you can get it from kissing and casual contact. If more people knew about this study, this would change.”

"Despite all the chaos happening in Hong Kong, Hong Kongers have raised more than ¥13.8 million to help people in Japan recover from the recent typhoon",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/10/21/national/hong-kongers-raise-money-japanese-typhoon-victims/#.Xa82OqTmiaM,"Hong Kongers have raised more than ¥13.8 million to help people in Japan recover from a powerful typhoon that tore through the country earlier this month.

The crowdfunding campaign, which ended Sunday with nearly four thousand backers, was created by YouTuber Jason Chau, who said the money will be donated to the Japanese Red Cross Society. The campaign website says that it collected about 1.06 million Hong Kong dollars.

“Despite what’s happening in their own country right now, many Hong Kongers want to help Japanese people who are struggling,” said Agnes Chow, a high-profile activist in Hong Kong, in a statement to The Japan Times regarding the campaign, for which she was not an organizer.

Typhoon Hagibis, the 19th named typhoon of the season, made landfall Oct. 11 on the Izu Peninsula in Shizuoka Prefecture before making its way north towards the Tohoku region.

The storm brought with it record-breaking rain, strong winds and heavy flooding that claimed the lives of 83 people, damaged or destroyed some 56,000 buildings and left more than 2,500 hectares on the country’s main island of Honshu inundated with floodwater.

The government plans to disburse ¥710 million to provide emergency aid — including water, temporary beds and toilets — at evacuation centers.

For more than four months Hong Kong has been overrun by violent protests and police crackdowns. What began as a relatively peaceful demonstration in July against a controversial bill that would allow the extradition of fugitives to mainland China has descended into a bloody clash between police and protesters that has engulfed the former British colony in a symbolic fight for freedom. Since June, two people have been shot and wounded by police, thousands have been injured and more than 2,300 arrested.

“Even in a time of unrest in our own city, we still look to help in whatever way we can to others … Part of me feels proud to be a Hongkonger and still have this spirit of solidarity with others,” wrote Jianne Soriano, a 23-year-old born in Hong Kong who now lives in Tokyo. “It just goes to show that Hong Kong people are in solidarity with others.”

Tear gas and firebombs littered the streets of Hong Kong once again on Sunday as thousands of protesters staged an illegal protest, wearing masks in defiance of recent efforts by the central government to activate emergency laws to ban them.

Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, will be one of 400 VIP guests to attend Emperor Naruhito’s enthronement ceremony in Tokyo on Tuesday, a move that could draw criticism amid the ongoing protests."
"Canadian woman braves storm on horseback to deliver coffee, meal to stranded trucker during blizzard",http://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/minto-woman-braves-storm-on-horseback-to-deliver-coffee-meal-to-stranded-trucker-1.3315992,"A Winnipeg truck driver is thanking a woman who jumped on her horse and brought him coffee and a hot meal while he was stranded on highway 10 south of Brandon.

An image of a stranded trucker captured by Manitoba 511 highway cameras prompted Eileen Eagle Bears, 18, to spring into action.

She saw the image of the stranded motorist on the highway 10 camera and rode four kilometres each way up and down hills in icy conditions to deliver a thermos of hot coffee to the man on Tuesday morning.

""I just thought I should do something,"" she said. ""I made up a thermos of coffee and took it to him on horseback.""

The trucker, Winnipeg resident Peter Douglas, was on his way to Brandon from Boissevain Monday afternoon at around 4 p.m. when he got stuck in his semi on highway 10 in the Souris Valley.

He was monitoring the weather, thinking he could make it to Brandon.

""The Souris Valley was one sheet of ice and I couldn't pull the whole thing,"" Douglas said. ""I was trapped.""

""With all my brakes on, I still started sliding backwards.""

While Douglas was alone on the highway, he knew his truck was parked in view of one of the province's highway cameras.

""My family, my bosses and it seems everyone on Facebook knew exactly where I was.""

He slept in his truck Monday night. The next morning, he got a pleasant surprise.

""Lo and behold, first thing in the morning, I look out my window and there was a horse and a young lady by the name of Eileen Eagle Bears,"" Douglas said. ""She brought me coffee.""

""She had to walk that horse half a mile up that hill and half a mile down because it was so icy. Blew me away,"" Douglas said. ""She said she saw me on the camera. Her and her family were watching.""

Douglas was surprised when Eagle Bears came back a second time with water and a thermos of stew and potatoes.

He eventually got towed and made his way to Brandon after spending 28 hours stranded on highway 10.

He said he's grateful for Eagle Bears generosity. He still has her thermoses, but plans to drop them off on his next run down

""He was really happy to know someone came,” Eagle Bears said.

An image of her horse was saved by a Facebook user and the image has been circulating on social media ever since.

Eagle Bears said she just wanted to help; she didn't think her horseback delivery would garner so much attention."
Ariana Grande 'raises more than £2 million' for victims with Manchester One Love concert,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/ariana-grande-raises-2-million-victims-manchester-one-love-concert/,"Ariana Grande is expected to raise more than £2 million for the victims of the Manchester terror attack with her One Love benefit concert, it has been reported.

Early estimates showed more than £2 million had been raised for the victims of the terror attack at the American singer's Manchester concert less than two weeks ago.

All the artists performed on Sunday at Old Trafford for free and Live Nation has underwritten the cost of the event.

The event is expected to have more viewers than Live Aid.

Grande shouted ""Manchester we love you"" before Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am said: ""Manchester, London, we are here together and we are one.""

Wizards of Waverly Place star Jennifer Stone is now fighting coronavirus as a registered nurse,https://ew.com/tv/wizards-of-waverly-place-star-jennifer-stone-registered-nurse-fighting-coronavirus/,"The actress announced the milestone on Instagram, writing that she hopes ""to live up to all of the amazing healthcare providers"" fighting the coronavirus.

Jennifer Stone is stepping into a new role.

The actress, known for Disney Channel's Wizards of Waverly Place, has officially become a registered nurse. In an Instagram post celebrating World Health Day on Tuesday, Stone announced that she is joining the ""front lines"" of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

""A very good friend of mine...pointed out to me that today is #worldhealthday. It is also the day I went from a volunteer, then a student nurse, and now an RN resident,"" she wrote. ""I just hope to live up to all of the amazing healthcare providers on the front lines now as I get ready to join them.""

Stone is best known for playing Harper Finkle, the eccentric best friend of Selena Gomez's Alex, on Wizards of Waverly Place, and has appeared in several other Disney projects and independent films. In 2013, after the series ended, Stone was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and left acting to pursue a nursing degree; she graduated last year.

“I think after a few years, I felt like I found a balance and came to healthy place with [diabetes] — I am now ready to inspire other people and help make this world a more receptive place for this disease,"" Stone said in a 2016 interview. “I can be really private, but with this — it isn’t mine to be private about. Speaking up can help so many people, and they need to know they aren’t alone, and it can happen to anyone. I know how ignorant I was when I was first diagnosed; I want to help the world know more about the disease.”

"10 year-old boy donates 3,000 comics to deployed soldiers - gets a day he won't forget in return",http://carlscomix.com/living-the-dream-at-joint-base-mcguire-dix-lakehurst/,"Living the Dream at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst

In my last article, I said that Jennifer Myers from the Department of Veterans Affairs had an idea. It was a great one! She suggested that I donate the rest of the comic books (8 long boxes that I had collected from my own collection and dealers, collectors and creators I know) to soldiers overseas. We liked that idea, so she arranged for us to visit Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, which is near Trenton, NJ. On April 5, we packed the boxes into the car. There were so many I got to sit in the front seat! When we got there, I thought I would get a tour and deliver the comic books, but I got a lot more than I expected!

When I arrived, I saw that they had reserved a parking space for me with a sign that said “Master Carl.” My new friend Master Sergeant Dominick Griego met my dad and me in the parking lot and took us inside, and he and two of his co-workers carried in all of the boxes. I found out that they had planned a really neat and fun tour for us.

They took my us back outside and we went to see the military planes. First we went in a C-17 and I got to sit in the seats, go through the hatch on the top that led to the outside, and even go in the cockpit! They also taught me how to open and close the tracks, which are used to load things on and off the plane. Back outside, we also saw a KC-10 and also a helicopter and plane land from up close.

Next we met Chief Master Sergeant Nicole Sheleva. The Chief gave us a tour of the hallway with a history of the 87th Logistics Readiness Squadron. There was a big, framed American flag hanging in the hallway, too.

The Chief then introduced me to Commander Rayna Lowery, who is in charge of the 87th LRS. Commander Lowery told me about her “Dream Building Blocks.” Her motto is “I’m living the Dream” and the first letter of each building block spells out DREAM:

Direction

Respect

Execution

Attitude, and

Mastery.

She said that this is how she wants all of her team to act to each other and to their jobs. She also told me that she wants the DREAM motto to grow so everybody can use it. After that she asked me some questions like: how I got my start in my comic book adventure, how I came up with the idea for my website, and who have I interviewed. Then I had a question for her: do you read comic books? The Commander said that she doesn’t read many comic books, but that she loved to watch Disney shows with her daughter. I told her that I interviewed Dan Povenmire, co-creator of Phineas and Ferb, and she thought that was really cool.

Commander Lowery, Chief Master Sergeant Sheleva and Master Sergeant Griego took us to the Armory, the place where they keep all of their military gear. I tried on a vest, which weighed 35 pounds! I could barely stand! They also put a helmet on me which weighed 8 pounds. It was almost like I had my own me on my head!

Luckily I was able to take off the gear in a few minutes because right after that there was an unexpected fire alarm. Everybody had to evacuate the building so, since everyone was together outside, the Commander told everyone what I was doing there. They all gathered around and Commander Lowery said that she had a medal for me. I was so surprised when she handed me her coin of excellence. It made me feel very special and excited. Everybody who was outside applauded for me. I was so surprised I could barely stand.

And then we were able to go back inside, to Commander Lowery’s office, to take some photos. The Chief surprised me by presenting me her coin of excellence, too. The coin has the words “integrity,” “service” and “excellence” on the front and “lead,” “inspire” and “dream” on the back. She gives these coins to anyone who does a spectacular job. I felt really honored!

After we took the pictures, we said goodbye to Chief Sheleva and Comander Lowery, and Master Sergeant Griego took us to his office. He gave me a wristband that he got at the NJ Run for the Fallen and then he asked me which coin in his collection looked the coolest. The coins commemorate deployments that a soldier has been on. He said that every coin has a story. I looked at all of the coins on every single shelf really closely and I finally chose one. This coin is set inside an American flag and commemorates his role with Special Inspector General in Afghanistan. He told me that the story behind this one was about the time he survived an attack in Afghanistan. I later learned that he received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his bravery when he helped save other soldiers in the attack. After he told me the story, he said he wanted me to keep it as a memory of helping soldiers overseas. I was so surprised and honored that Master Sergeant Griego would give me something so special to him.

Jennifer Myers spoke with me to make sure I understood what these coins meant and that I would always treasure them. We all hugged goodbye and thanked her for setting up such a special day. I do not think I have ever felt as special and welcome as everybody at Joint Base MDL made me feel!

Thank you to Jeff Beck, Paul Castiglia, Steven Donohue, John Paul, Adam Solomon, Laurie Jeffers and Michael Williams for helping make this all possible. And a huge thanks to Jennifer Myers and everyone Joint Base MDL for everything!

It was the best day of my life!"
UT regent donates $25M to School of Social Work to alleviate students’ debt because 'they’re heroes',https://www.dallasnews.com/news/higher-education/2017/09/06/ut-regent-donates-25m-school-social-work-alleviate-students-debt-heroes,"Steve Hicks (UT-Austin)

University of Texas Regent Steve Hicks is donating $25 million to the University of Texas at Austin's School of Social Work, in part to help cut the debt of students whom he calls ""heroes.""

Hicks, a businessman with a UT government degree, doesn't have a background in social work, but he said he's always been focused on supporting institutions and causes that directly help people. He settled on the school after studying where he felt he could make the most difference.

""I think we have a great society, but in every social system, parts of it break from time to time and the social workers are there to pick up the pieces, whether in the hospitals or recovery centers, assisted living facilities and the prisons,"" Hicks said in an interview.

""It's not the most glamorous of jobs. I don't know that I could do it myself, but I have deep admiration for those who can.""

The gift, announced publicly Wednesday, is believed to be among the largest ever to a public university's social work school, according to UT.

In recognition of his contribution, the university said it will name the school after Hicks, who built up a broadcasting business over several decades and later moved into private equity.

""By investing in our social work students, Steve Hicks is investing in a fabric that binds

communities together,"" UT-Austin President Gregory Fenves said in a statement. ""Social work students commit to dedicate their lives to service and enriching the lives of others. In return, UT commits to support them thanks to Steve Hicks' generous philanthropy.""

Of the funds, $10 million will establish a permanent endowment for student scholarships, $5 million will be used to match funds as an encouragement for potential donors and the remaining $10 million will enhance research and teaching in the field of addictions, as well as skills in fundraising and philanthropy.

Hicks works closely with several addiction recovery programs because it's a personal issue for him — he's battled alcoholism, which runs in his family.

""The root of all those diseases is you're trying to fix a broken part of your soul,"" he said. ""It's given me a lot of humility and compassion.""

His interest in social work runs even deeper than that, though, said Luis Zayas, dean of the UT School of Social Work.

""When he thought about the School of Social Work, he knew that one social worker could help impact thousands of lives,"" Zayas said. ""Like the wise businessman that he is, he knew the investment it could have.""

On average, students are $45,000 in debt when they leave the School of Social Work, Zaya said. Hicks' funds will greatly reduce students' anxiety about financing their education, he said, which will allow graduates to better serve their communities.

""I'm going to work hard to really drive down that student debt load because what happens is they can't pay their debt, can't buy a house and have to leave the profession,"" Hicks said. ""That's what I'm trying to solve.""

Hicks also hopes the contribution will serve as a sign of appreciation to social workers whose selfless deeds often go unrecognized.

""It's really a cradle-to-grave profession,"" Hicks said. ""To me, it's almost doing God's work. They're heroes in a lot of ways."""

Kid Rock paid off the balances of 350 layaway accounts at a Walmart store in Nashville.

The musician gave the 3458 Dickerson Pike store about $81,000 to pay down all of the accounts, said Tom Meyer, the store's manager.

""Kudos to Kid Rock for making such a gesture in our community,"" Meyer said. ""I think that's a pretty Nashville proud moment.""

Kid Rock said on Twitter that he was following director Tyler Perry's lead. Perry posted a video on Twitter, saying he had paid off the layaway balances at two Georgia locations.

""@tylerperry Great idea! I followed your lead and paid off the layaway at my local Walmart in Nashville. Merry Christmas and God Bless You!"" said Kid Rock, in the tweet.

It was a shocking, cool moment for Meyer, he said. And he said it has been an awesome experience letting customers know their accounts have been paid off. The items on lawaway are likely Christmas gifts, since the store only offers the program during the holiday season, Meyer said.

The layaway customers, who have been coming into the store as a result of Rock's gesture, were wearing shocked and smiling faces, Meyer said. Each one is being handed a card explaining that Kid Rock made the payment on their behalf, he said.

""Merry Christmas from your neighbor!"" the cards read.

Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Richie, has property in Whites Creek.

Surprised customers thank Kid Rock for his generosity

Autumn and Woody Nuccio want to make sure Kid Rock knows how grateful they are for his generosity. Without him, the parents would not be able to give their three young children presents for Christmas this year.

They did not have enough money for both rent and the toys they had put on layaway at the Dickerson Pike store, said Autumn Nuccio, as she waited for Walmart staff to grab her items.

""It's such a burden lifted off of our shoulders knowing that our kids will have Christmas,"" said Autumn Nuccio, who works at the Walmart location.

@KidRock We were gonna have to give up our kids christmas this year because we needed to pay rent but now, because of you, our babies will have a good christmas!! So thank you so much!! — Autumn Nuccio (@IndicaStonerGrl) December 8, 2018

One of the items in their layaway cart was a guitar for their 3-year-old son, Dustin. They were excited that Rock's gift meant their son would have a fun story to tell about the musician for the rest of his life.

""He bought my son his first guitar,"" Woody Nuccio said.

Rock also paid for the gifts Henrietta Lewis will give her grandchild for an upcoming fourth birthday.

Lewis received a text that an anonymous person had paid off her layaway items.

""I just want him to know that I'm very grateful that he done this for the community,"" Lewis said. ""I love you Kid Rock. Keep up the good work.""

Layaway gift comes on the heels of controversy

The official Twitter account for the retail giant applauded Rock and Perry for paying off the layaways at the three Walmart locations.

Rock was tapped to be the grand marshal of the Nashville Christmas Parade on Dec. 1, but that did not happen after he made controversial comments on a Fox & Friends. His remarks quickly caused a public backlash and led Nashville's mayor to threaten to sit out for the event.

Facebook user Maris Mayol Tian posted today a heart-warming scene she saw when she ordered breakfast from fast-food chain Jollibee.

The Bacolod City resident wrote that after her order was delivered, her 92-year-old neighbor called over the delivery man from across the street. The reason? She wanted to order some food too.

The woman proceeded to order spaghetti and macaroni soup, not realizing that she had to call the delivery hotline first.

Cute lola (grandma) alert.

“I honestly thought he would just ignore her, laugh and be on his way, but he actually took out his own cellphone, dialed a number, and ordered for her!!!” exclaimed Tian in her post.

The photo shows her neighbor and the delivery guy whom she identified as Elpegie Palmares Sicor ordering for the woman using his phone.

Tian shared that she doesn’t actually know the old woman’s name, but said they refer to her as Nanay. Nanay literally means mother but it is also used as a sign of respect.

“Not a lot of people show kindness and pay attention to old people, but this guy did and I think that is very commendable and heartwarming,” she said of the encounter.

Tian added that Sicor reached out to her through Facebook Messenger after the post went viral. She told Coconuts: “He was praised at work by his manager and his co-workers. He said thank you. He can’t explain the feeling, [he’s just] very humble.”

Tennessee couple married for 64 years die spending final moments holding hands,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4061820/Couple-married-64-years-die-hours-spending-final-moments-holding-hands.html,"His wife Dolores stood by for as long as she could as his condition

A Tennessee couple married for nearly 64 years died just hours apart as they spent their final moments holding hands in their hospital beds.

Dolores Winstead, 83, and husband Trent Winstead, 88, died in Nashville's Saint Thomas West Hospital two weeks ago - five weeks short of their 64th wedding anniversary.

Several days before the couple passed away, a healthy Dolores stood by her husband's hospital bed holding his hand after he was admitted due to his failing kidneys.

Dolores Winstead, 83, and husband Trent Winstead, 88, died just hours apart in Nashville, Tennessee as they spent their final moments holding hands in their hospital beds

Dialysis had started to weaken his heart and he was moved to intensive care as Dolores and their two adult children, Eddie and Sheryl, were forced to watch his condition worsen.

But soon after on the night of December 7, Dolores started to complain of a headache and started throwing up.

The 83-year-old had suffered a severe brain aneurysm as she stood by her husband's bedside. She was connected to a ventilator as her condition started to deteriorate.

Hospital staff received approval to place the couple in the same room so they could spend their final moments together.

They were pictured lying together holding hands.

Dolores and Trent had been married for almost 64 years and had two children, three grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren

Trent was admitted to the Nashville hospital suffering failing kidneys and his beloved wife Dolores stood by his bedside as his condition worsened. She suffered a brain aneurysm two days before they both died

The couple met back in the 1950s in Dickson County, Tennessee and married soon after Trent returned from serving in the Korean War

Dolores stopped breathing at 9.10pm on December 9.

The couple's son Eddie had to lean over and tell Trent that his beloved wife had died.

The 88-year-old blew a kiss to his wife and died just hours later.

'Because she was gone, he just could not handle it. We just watched him die,' their daughter Sheryl told the Washington Post.

Trent and Dolores would have celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary on January 17

'I hadn't thought about it this way at the time. (He) literally, he died of a broken heart.

'Never in a million years did I think I was going to come out of the hospital with neither one.'

The couple met back in the 1950s in Dickson County, Tennessee. They sent each other love letters when Trent was sent away to serve in the Korean War.

They married soon after he returned to the U.S. after Trent proposed to Dolores on day as she brushed her teeth.

Dolores and Trent welcomed two children, three grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

Their children said they were polar opposites - Dolores was quiet and had a love of cooking, while Trent was outgoing and spent his days fishing on the lake.

They would have celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary on January 17.

The couple were laid to rest last week with Dolores in a pink casket and Trent in a blue one."
"Florida news reporter reveals cancer diagnosis after viewer spots lump on her neck ""Had I never received that email, I never would have called my doctor,"" WFLA reporter Victoria Price wrote.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-news-reporter-reveals-cancer-diagnosis-after-viewer-spots-lump-n1234796,"A Florida news reporter said she found out she had cancer after a viewer sent her an email expressing concern about a lump on her neck.

Victoria Price, a reporter with NBC affiliate WFLA-TV in Tampa, said the viewer emailed her last month and encouraged Price to see her doctor.

""As a journalist, it's been full throttle since the pandemic began. Never-ending shifts in a never-ending news cycle. Adjusting to remote workflows and in my case, taking on a new investigative role,"" Price wrote on her social media pages Thursday. ""We were covering the most important health story in a century, but my own health was the farthest thing from my mind.""

The reporter shared the email she received from the viewer.

""Hi, I just saw your news report. What concerned me is the lump on your neck. Please have your thyroid checked,"" it read. ""Reminds me of my neck. Mine turned out to be cancer. Take care of yourself.""

Price said the lump on her neck is cancerous and is in the middle of her thyroid pushing the gland up and out, causing a ""subtle protrusion."" She will undergo surgery on Monday to remove the tumor, her thyroid, and a couple of nearby lymph nodes.

""Doctor says it's spreading, but not too much, and we're hopeful this will be my first and last procedure,"" she wrote. ""Had I never received that email, I never would have called my doctor. The cancer would have continued to spread. It's a scary and humbling thought.""

Price ended her post by saying she ""will forever be thankful"" to the viewer who emailed her.

""She had zero obligation to, but she did anyway. Talk about being on your side, huh? The world is a tough place these days. Don't forget to take care of yourself. Take care of each other. Love y'all and see you soon,"" she wrote.

Thyroid cancer, up until recently, was the most rapidly increasing cancer in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society. This is largely due to increased detection and ""appears to be the result of the use of more sensitive diagnostic procedures"" that can detect incidental small thyroid nodules that might not have been found in the past.

Women are three times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men, the organization said.

WFLA re-tweeted Price's post on Twitter and said they are ""sending all of our love"" and wished her a speedy recovery.

Several journalists sent the reporter uplifting messages.

""Wow truly '8 on your side' @WFLA @WFLAVictoria sending you support from DC,"" tweeted Nexstar Media Group Washington Correspondent Kellie Meyer. ""Incredible story. Thank you for sharing and you got this girl!!""

""Sorry to hear about this, I wish you the very best,"" KLBK meteorologist Nick Kraynok tweeted. ""I went through cancer, along with six weeks of chemo eight years ago, if you need anything, or have any questions, let me know!""

WTVT reporter Haley Hinds called the viewer who emailed Price a ""guardian angel.""

""What a blessing they are, to have taken the time and care to reach out. Sending you lots of love for a successful procedure and quick recovery,"" she tweeted.

Last year, ""Inside Edition"" host Deborah Norville underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from her neck after a viewer spotted a lump on her neck."
OxyContin maker will stop marketing opioid products to doctors amid scrutiny,http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/373278-oxycontin-maker-will-stop-marketing-opioid-products-to-doctors-amid,"The maker of the painkiller OxyContin will stop actively marketing its opioid products to doctors.

Purdue Pharmaceuticals announced that it would cut its sales staff by more than half and would stop sending sales representatives to doctor's offices to discuss opioid products.

""We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,"" the company said in a statement.

Purdue also said it will start referring opioid-related requests and questions from prescribers to health-care professionals in its medical affairs department.

In a message to health-care professionals, Monica Kwarcinski, the head of Purdue's medical affairs department, said that the new policies would go into effect on Monday.

""Effective Monday, February 12, 2018, our field sales organization will no longer be visiting your offices to engage you in discussions about our opioid products,"" she said.

Many experts have placed blame on the over-prescription of powerful painkillers for the opioid epidemic that has ravaged the country in recent decades.

A number of states have filed lawsuits against Purdue, alleging that the company misled prescribers and patients about the risks of prescription opioids.

Purdue has denied the allegations, noting that its products are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and that they account for only a small portion of all opioid prescriptions."

In a nod to the popular sci-fi Netflix show, the bash featured strings of Christmas lights, a beverage dispenser of Demogorgon blood and a beautiful cake alongside a hearty feast.

The only thing missing? All of his friends.

""My brother waited outside our house for a little bit for his friends to show up,"" older sister Ayen Alambat told TODAY. ""I wish they would have told him sooner.""

That's when the 16-year-old, who lives with her family in Rancho Cucamonga, California, came to the rescue. But instead of wielding psychokinetic powers, Ayen harnessed the power of the internet.

""My brother invited 8 of his classmates for his stranger things themed bday party & none of their punk selves showed up,"" she tweeted on March 18.

Since then, the tweet has received more than 242,000 ""likes"" and nearly 50,000 retweets in a show of support reminiscent of ""Sad Papaw"" — the man who made dinner for his six grandkids, only to have one show up — almost two years ago to the date.

UPS Driver Adopts Orphaned Pit Bull Pal After Dog's Original Owner Dies,http://people.com/pets/ups-driver-adopts-orphan-pit-bull-after-owner-dies/,"Katie Newhouser regularly delivered packages to Leo's former owner's condo complex, which is how they first became friends

A dog named Leo’s life story went from tragic to triumphant when a caring UPS driver named Katie Newhouser from Rancho Cucamonga, California, crossed paths with him.

In May, Newhouser posted a photo of her pit bull pal in a Facebook group called UPS DOGS. Their bittersweet tale touched many hearts and began to garner attention.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

As she writes in her post, Leo’s “owner passed away and now he lives with me.” That’s the short version of the story; the more in-depth tale, as first recounted by Newhouser to Pup Journal, is more dramatic and heart-tugging.

Leo had been adopted by his original owner, a woman named Tina, after her son Cannon brought him home as a puppy. Leo was actually too young to have been separated from his dog mom, so he could not yet eat solid puppy food and Tina had to bottle-feed him. Thus, the pair formed a unique bond.

“They were very very close and did everything together,” Newhouser tells PEOPLE. “I don’t think that dogs ever forget anyone who they have been that close to.”

The friendly pup also bonded with his local UPS driver, Newhouser. She tells Pup Journal, “He would hear my truck come into the condo complex and start barking and scratching at the door to come down to the truck. He would love to come into the truck and go into the back to look around. I remember one day I was driving up one of my busier streets and they were coming down the street and all of a sudden there was Leo popping his head out the passenger side barking at me! He barked all the way down the street!”

Newhouser learned of Tina’s untimely death through a Facebook post. She contacted her friend’s son Cannon, a Marine who could not keep the dog, and offered to foster Leo. Although Newhouser already had three pups of her own, her personal bond with Leo proved too strong to let go of the gentle giant.

“It was probably confusing for him at first, [but] he has adapted well,” says Newhouser. “He and his brother Moose are inseparable. Bailey, his sister, has taken a while to come around, [but] they actually play now … once Leo was introduced into the house, the whole vibe changed.”

“He loves going for rides, he loves the water, he loves playing with his chew toys, he loves tormenting his two feline sisters, he loves laying in the sun, he has NO concept of personal space. He likes to be on us or right beside us! He is a character,” says Newhouser of her new furry kid.

One new lifestyle challenge for Leo was weaning him off the human food that Tina used to feed the pup. His begging face was in full effect 24/7. However, Newhouser adjusted by adding boiled chicken to all her pups’ dog food, which she figures may partially account for the rest of the canine crew accepting him with open paws.

“He has some health issues,” Newhouser tells PEOPLE. “He has had constant ear infections since he has been here, and he has also developed a really bad rash. We recently found a really good vet and she is trying new treatments on his ears and seems to think he has a food allergy, so we have switched all their food over to limited ingredients to see if that helps.”

However, the biggest challenge for Leo was more emotionally focused.

“Leo missed Tina when he first got here,” Newhouser explained to Pup Journal. “He would whine at night before he would fall asleep. It was heartbreaking, really. He still does every once in a while. I know he misses her.”

Despite his moments of sadness, Leo has come a long way and absolutely loves playing with his new dog siblings. While neither Leo nor Newhouser expected that a twist of fate would bring them together permanently, it’s a sweet relief to know their friendship has blossomed into a forever family."
"Helicopter Upsets Invictus Games Tennis Player With PTSD, Teammate Abandons Game to Comfort Him Using a Song",https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/invictus-games-moment-brings-crowd-to-tears-at-sydney-olympic-park-tennis-centre/news-story/b7dffb0182d0122fe851afba82af328a,"AN Invictus Games crowd has been brought to tears by the heartwarming response to one athlete’s distressing break down.

English mine warfare specialist Paul Guest was left visibly upset when he heard a helicopter flying over the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre during his wheelchair tennis doubles match.

The 54-year-old toured Northern Ireland for the English Armed Forces before he was injured on active duty in 1987.

The Navy serviceman suffered injuries to his neck and spine during the incident, resulting in partial deafness and a visibility impairment and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Before receiving the care he needed, Guest attempted suicide four times following his medical discharge from the Armed Forces.

It all came back to him in one traumatic moment at the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre when the helicopter could be heard nearby.

Guest was unable to continue his service game after being overcome with emotion.

He was comforted by Dutch teammate Edwin Vermetten, who immediately saw his teammate was suffering and tried to comfort him in an incredible moment that has come to signify everything the Games stands for.

media_camera Paul Guest also competed in the IHB1 Men's Road Cycling Time Trial.

Vermetten’s emotional support left the crowd in tears as the pair shared a lengthy conversation near the back wall of their court before Guest was eventually able to recover.

Incredibly, the pair went on to win their match in a third set tiebreak.

Vermetten revealed he was able to console his teammate in a moment of raw hurt by singing together.

He described the moment he and Guest sang popular Disney movie anthem “Let it Go” from the movie Frozen as an important moment for the Englishman’s ongoing recovery.

“I took him by the face and said ‘Look at me. We are a team so let it go,’” Vermetten said, according to the Invictus Games website.

“Look into my eyes and sing the Frozen song, and we did.

“For him, this was the moment he let go, and he did, he literally let it all go.”

Guest also competed at the 2017 Invictus Games in Canada, where he shared his incredible recovery to become a poster boy for the Invictus Games movement.

“On the fourth occasion when I tried to commit suicide, my wife literally dragged me off to get help,” he said, according to The Clacton Gazette.

“She contacted Help for Heroes (a charity organisation that provides support for servicemen and service women and their families), I became a Band of Brother and the rest is history.

“The Invictus Games has given me something to aim for. Pulling on the Invictus Games uniform is like pulling on my Navy uniform.

“I feel part of a team again, like I belong. I’m proud to be representing my country once again.

“Without Help for Heroes and without the goal of the Invictus Games I honestly wouldn’t be here today. I recently lost a good friend of mine called Michael. He sadly took his own life recently and I promised at his graveside I would never give up.”

His emotional recovery at the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre shows he was telling no lie.

Portugal generated 100% of its energy from renewable sources in March,https://qz.com/1245048/portugal-generated-enough-renewable-energy-to-power-the-whole-country-in-march/,"Portugal’s renewable electricity production exceeded monthly consumption for what is likely the first time, in March, according to the nation’s transmission system operator, REN.The average renewable generation for the month exceeded 103% of consumption, beating out the last record (99.2%), set in 2014.

It almost certainly won’t be the last time. The country is predicting that renewables will satisfy its mainland electricity needs by 2040, ultimately eliminating the electricity sector’s greenhouse gas emissions. Although most of last month’s electricity came from water and wind (link in Portuguese), the country relied on some fossil fuel and imported electricity. Water- and wind-generated power can be rather unpredictable, so even as total renewable generation exceeded Portugal’s electricity consumption for the month (as well as some exports), Portugal needed those sources to even out supply.

An international debate is gathering steam about whether 100% renewable energy is possible (or even advisable). Portugal’s feat, the result of decades of investment in low-carbon technology, shows it is possible, but plenty of caveats remain. The grid only ran on 100% renewables for relatively short periods: two 70 hour spans (Portugal managed a four-day streak in 2016). But imports and conventional generation from natural gas were still needed to balance the grid because solar and wind can vary significantly. The proposition that a full year’s worth of peaks and valleys can be managed with renewables alone has yet to be tested. During the same period last year, renewables supplied only 6% of Portugal’s electricity (thanks in part to a drought that reduced its hydro capacity).

But a 100% goal is not fantasy, especially in Europe. Germany has committed to an electricity supply that is at least 80% renewable, possibly as high as 100%, by mid-century. Denmark already produces around 100% of its own needs at times from renewable sources, as does Norway and Iceland, thanks to hydropower and geothermal heat. Sweden’s new Climate Act commits the country to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. But they still have a long way to go."

"These tree-planting drones are firing seed missiles to restore the world’s forests - In a remote field south of Yangon, Myanmar, tiny mangrove saplings are now roughly 20 inches tall. Last September, the trees were planted by drones.",https://www.fastcompany.com/90329982/these-tree-planting-drones-are-firing-seed-missiles-to-restore-the-worlds-forests,"In a remote field south of Yangon, Myanmar, tiny mangrove saplings are now roughly 20 inches tall. Last September, the trees were planted by drones. It’s early proof of technology that could help restore forests at the pace needed to fight climate change.

“We now have a case confirmed of what species we can plant and in what conditions,” says Irina Fedorenko, cofounder of Biocarbon Engineering, the startup that makes the drones. The right combination of species and specific environmental conditions made the restoration work. “We are now ready to scale up our planting and replicate this success.”

The startup, which also uses drones to plant trees and grasses at abandoned mines in Australia and on sites in other parts of the world, is working with a nonprofit in Myanmar called Worldview International Foundation. To date, the nonprofit has worked with villagers to plant trees by hand. The project began in 2012, after the government began opening the country’s borders to international business. More than six million trees have been planted so far, and the nonprofit plans to plant another four million by the end of 2019. But it also recognizes that humans can’t easily cover the amount of land that could potentially be restored.

Within three states, roughly 350,000 hectares of coastal forest needs to be restored—an area nearly as large as Rhode Island. With about 5,000 trees able to grow in a hectare, that works out to more than a billion trees. “Obviously, planting a billion trees will take a long time without the help of drones,” says Bremley Lyngdoh, founder and CEO of Worldview Impact, a separate nonprofit partnering with the Worldview International Foundation on its work in Myanmar. Two operators working with 10 drones can theoretically plant 400,000 trees in a day.

The drones first fly over an area to map it, collecting data about the topography and soil condition that can be combined with satellite data and analyzed to determine the best locations to plant each seed. Then the drone fires biodegradable pods—filled with a germinated seed and nutrients—into the ground. For the process to succeed in a mangrove forest, several conditions need to be right; if the tide comes in unexpectedly, for example, the seeds could wash away. In tests, Biocarbon Engineering has looked at which species and environmental conditions perform best.

If drones do begin to replant entire forests, humans will still play a critical role. That’s in part because some seeds don’t fit inside the pods. But people living nearby also need a reason to leave the trees standing. “The project in Myanmar is all about community development and enabling people to care for trees, providing them with jobs, and making environmental restoration in a way that it’s profitable for people,” says Fedorenko. “The forest didn’t vanish by itself—the forest was cut down by local people.”

Roughly half of the world’s mangrove forests have been lost. The trees, with twisted roots that reach underwater along coastlines, can store more carbon than trees on land. Mangrove deforestation is responsible for 24 million tons of CO2 emissions each year, according to a 2018 study. They also provide a barrier in storms; when a cyclone hit Myanmar in 2008, killing more than 100,000 people, the impact was also worse because there weren’t as many trees left. Some trees are cut down to make way for aquaculture (ironically, because fish stocks drop dramatically when the trees disappear). The wood is also used to make charcoal."

Stranded fox rescued from iceberg by fishermen who fed him Vienna sausages,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/arctic-fox-rescue-iceberg-1.4720525,"An Arctic fox generally isn't part of a crab fishing boat's bycatch, but one crew from southern Labrador managed just that last week.

Alan Russell of St. Lewis said his ship was about seven kilometres offshore when they spotted something on a nearby iceberg.

""We seen something on the ice. Wasn't sure what it was,"" Russell told CBC's Labrador Morning. ""So we got up closer to it. It was a little fox, Arctic fox. And he wasn't very big. He was soaking wet, and the gulls was trying to pick at him.""

The fox wouldn't come near the fishermen, so they knocked the ice pan into the water and fished him out with a net. (Submitted by Alan Russell)

The crew tried to pull him from the mushroom-shaped iceberg tip, but the skittish fox wouldn't let them close. So they used the boat to knock the ice pan down and fished the fox from the water with a net.

""He was in pretty hard shape because it was so cold in the water,"" said Russell.

Once aboard, the fox — which the crew put in a plastic tote pan — wouldn't eat. But when the ship stopped in Pinsent's Arm for supplies, the crew put some sawdust in the pan to help him dry out.

More importantly, they were able to get him to eat: Vienna sausages.

When the crew brought him on board, the fox was nervous and wouldn't eat. (Submitted by Alan Russell)

""He likes them,"" said Russell.

The crew brought him to port in William's Harbour, where they have been fishing out of, and kept feeding him for a couple of days before letting him go.

""He wasn't aggressive at all,"" Russell said. ""After a while, when he was coming around, he liked us more, because we were feeding him. And he didn't mind us after.""

Russell said he has never seen an animal like that so far from shore. He figures the fox was probably looking for food on solid sea ice and then got caught when it broke up.

""He probably only had another day or so on the ice floe, or it would have foundered,"" he said. ""And the way that the wind was, the ice was probably never going to go back into land. He's a pretty lucky guy.""

Once the fox dried out and had some food, he lost his fear of the fishing crew. (Submitted by Alan Russell)

Russell said that when they last saw the fox, it was happy to be exploring some old dog houses in William's Harbour, a community that was resettled in 2017.

""He looks a lot healthier now. He's running around everywhere, so he should be pretty good to go now.""

That means Costa Rica will have run on more than 98% clean energy over five consecutive years, according to data from the National Center for Energy Control (CENCE).

So far in 2019, 98.84% of Costa Rica’s power has come from renewable resources, the government says, “despite the dry conditions that have prevailed in the region.”

In 2019, Costa Rica has generated 67.5% of its energy from hydropower, 17% from wind, 13.5% from geothermal sources and 0.84% ​​from biomass and solar panels. The remaining 1.16% corresponds to backup plants, Casa Presidencial says.

The numbers do not include the fossil-fuel dependent transportation sector, which is responsible for 66% of hydrocarbon consumption and 54% of carbon dioxide emissions in Costa Rica.

Costa Rica’s decarbonization strategy includes a plan to introduce a modern transportation system in San José that will promote walking and biking, and feature fully electric trains by 2050.

Still, the Costa Rican government says its clean energy generation — which powers more than 1.5 million homes and 225,000 businesses — has saved the country nearly $500 million over the past 20 years over relying on fossil fuels.

Costa Rica has also generated more than $180 million in sales of surplus energy to Central America’s Regional Electricity Market (MER), which has helped power Panama, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala."

The woman, who is from Southern California and fighting a rare form of cancer, gave birth to twins Thursday, according to FOX 11. She named her new son and daughter Ryan and Rainy, and all three are fine.

This exciting news comes just days after the 36-year-old, who was already a mother to three other children with her husband, found a bone marrow donor to treat her acute myeloid leukemia following a viral internet search, as described in the video above.

After none of her family members proved to be a match, Rabaca turned to the worldwide registry for donors. Even with 30 million people on the registry, there was no match for Rabaca. But her plea for a donor did not fall on deaf ears.

Approximately 40,000 people registered in the National Marrow Donor Program after hearing Rabaca’s story, FOX 11 reports — and one was a perfect match.

“With tears running down my face and my heart full of hope I want to say THANK YOU LORD!” Rabaca shared on Facebook. “Thank you to my family, friends, people around the country that I don’t even know that have shown support and especially that have signed up for BE THE MATCH!”

Joining the Be the Match Registry is simple. After answering a few questions online about your medical history, you receive a cheek swab kit in the mail. You swab your cheek and then mail the DNA sample back to the registry. Rabaca has found her match, but there are many other patients in desperate need.

Tragically, Aoife (5), who was full of fun and had an amazing imagination, died that summer.

However, during her time at the hospital, Aoife was still able to laugh thanks to funny characters known as Clown Doctors.

Clown Doctor Keith Singleton explained: ""We would tell jokes, make fun of her daddy (Adrian), which was particularly popular, and do magic tricks.

""Aoife's mammy Aine told us that her daughter's eyes shone brightly and that they heard her amazing hearty laugh, which let them all escape from the reality of the situation.""

The Clown Doctors' funding from The Humour Foundation of Ireland ""ran out a few years ago thanks to the recession"".

However, Keith said: ""A lovely couple, Aine and Adrian were not about to let the Clown Doctors drive off into the sunset in our comedy car.

""They took action and fundraised to ensure the Clown Doctors returned to the wards.

""Aoife's Clown Doctors are currently funded by the Friends of Aoife Hendrick.""

The Clown Doctors are a team of carefully chosen, professional performers trained to work in hospitals.

They help create fun, laughter and creativity on the wards by parodying medical procedures and hospital jargon, helping to ease the fear and stress for children and parents.

Oversized medical equipment, 'red-nose' transplants, 'cat' scans and funny bone examinations are just a few examples of what might take place during a visit from a Clown Doctor.

Aoife's Clown Doctors hope to expand, so as to be able to reach as many children as possible.

""We are in the process of getting our full charity status,"" Keith said: .

Brittany Crocker | Knoxville

Show Caption Hide Caption Keaton Jones Commended By Celebrities For Opening Up About Bullying Keaton, a sixth-grader at Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville in Union County, sparked a national conversation about bullying after a video of him went viral over the weekend.

The anti-bullying video of a Union County middle schooler went viral over the weekend, garnering the attention of the Tennessee Titans and the University of Tennessee Vols football teams.

Kimberly Jones posted the video of her son, Keaton, on her Facebook page Friday shortly after 12:30 p.m. She said she had just picked Keaton up from school because he was too afraid to go to lunch as a result of bullying.

Despite some other media reports, Keaton is not a student in Knox County, according to Carly Harrington, Knox County Schools spokesperson. Rather, he attends Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville, in Union County. He used to attend Knox County but left in July 2017, according to Harrington.

""For the record, Keaton asked to do this AFTER he had me pick him up AGAIN because he was afraid to go to lunch,"" Jones wrote in her Facebook post.

""My kids are by no stretch perfect, and at home, he's as all boy as they come, but by all accounts he's good at school. Talk to your kids. I've even had friends of mine tell me (their) kids were only nice to him to get him to mess with people. We all know how it feels to want to belong, but only a select few know how it really feels not to belong anywhere,"" she wrote.

Federal Study Shows Bullying Affects One In Five Students According to a federal study released on Tuesday, one in every five middle and high school students has complained of being bullied at school, while the number of reported incidents of sexual assaults on college campuses has more than tripled over the past ten years.

In the video, Keaton, crying in the passenger seat, describes having milk poured on him and ham put down his clothes.

""Just out of curiosity, why do they bully? What's the point of it?"" Keaton began. ""Why do you find joy in taking innocent people and finding a way to be mean to 'em? It's not okay.""

Keaton said kids at school make fun of his nose, call him ugly and tell him he has no friends.

Jones, in another social media post on Oct. 18, described one such incident. At a birthday party, she wrote, another boy said he knew Keaton by his scars, one that ""goes all the way across his face.""

Jones wrote that her son was born with a tumor.

""It's not OK!"" Keaton cried in his video. ""People that are different don't need to be criticized about it. It's not their fault. But if you are made fun of, don't let it bother you. They suck I guess. Hard. But it will probably get better one day.""

Within hours, the post had thousands of views. By Saturday night it had been viewed more than 11 million times and shared by nearly 250,000 people.

Vols, Titans get involved

University of Tennessee Vols sophomore wide receiver Tyler Byrd saw the video and tweeted Saturday afternoon that he and several teammates are planning to pay Keaton a visit at school Tuesday.

Shortly thereafter, Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker posted a video of himself reading a quote by Guatama Buddha.

""Our life is shaped by our mind; we become what we think. Joy follows a pure thought like a shadow that never leaves,” he read, before adding, ""You can be whoever you want to be. Sorry that bullying has been taking place at your school. Hopefully this video and all the tweets that are being put out there make awareness to stop bullying.""

Then he extended an invitation to Keaton and his family to join him at the Dec. 31 Titans vs. Jaguars game.

Sentiments from other football players connected to Tennessee followed, offering words of support to Keaton.

Kelsea Ballerini, Dale Earnhard Jr. share messages of support

Country singer Kelsea Ballerini, who grew up in Knoxville, said she would walk into the lunchroom with Keaton and ""watch the bullies say they are sorry to you.""

In a Saturday afternoon Facebook post, Jones responded to the outpouring of support for her son.

""Friends, overwhelmed is the understatement of the world right now. I love each of you for what you are doing,"" she said, adding that she could not read or respond to all of the messages and invitations to join groups that had inundated her mailbox since the viral video.

""I'm humbled by the voice my boy has been given, but he's still just a little boy, and he's a little boy who desperately wants acceptance, that I have to try to find a way to navigate him through the difference in true acceptance and attention,"" she wrote. ""I know God has His hand in this and I trust that the right things will happen in the right time. In the meantime, bear with us.""

Jones could not be reached for a phone interview Saturday.

Hatchlings from vulnerable turtle species spotted for first time in decades on Mumbai beach that was rejuvenated in past two years by massive volunteer cleanup operation. At least 80 Olive Ridley turtles have made their way into Arabian Sea from nests on Versova beach in past week.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/30/mumbai-beach-goes-from-dump-to-turtle-hatchery-in-two-years,"Hatchlings from a vulnerable turtle species have been spotted for the first time in decades on a Mumbai beach that was rejuvenated in the past two years by a massive volunteer cleanup operation.

At least 80 Olive Ridley turtles have made their way into the Arabian Sea from nests on the southern end of Versova beach in the past week, protected from wild dogs and birds of prey by volunteers who slept overnight in the sand to watch over them.

Versova has undergone what the United Nations has called the “world’s largest beach cleanup project” over the past two years, transformed from a shin-deep dump yard for plastics and rubbish to a virtually pristine piece of coastline.

The man who leads the ongoing cleanup operation, the lawyer Afroz Shah, said he started anticipating the turtle hatchings two months ago when farmers on the southern end of the two-mile (3km) beach reported seeing turtles in the sand.

“The moment we got that news I knew something big was going to happen,” he told the Guardian. Last Thursday, some of his volunteers called to say they had spotted dozens of baby Olive Ridley turtles emerging from their nests.

He called the forest department and then went down to the beach with about 25 others, guarding the area while the tiny creatures hobbled across the sand, “making sure not one hatchling suffered a death”, he said.

The Olive Ridley species, thought to be named for the olive-green hue of its upper shell, is the smallest and most abundant sea turtle in the ocean, but is still classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Mothers of the species lay eggs in an enormous mass-nesting process known as arribada. Last month on the coast of the eastern Indian state of Odisha, a record 428,083 Olive Ridley turtles nested simultaneously at the Rushikulya rookery.

Though they nest elsewhere in Mumbai, none had been sighted on Versova beach in decades, due to the acute pollution problem there, Shah said. “I had tears in my eyes when I saw them walking towards the ocean.”

Sumedha Korgaonkar, who is completing a PhD on Olive Ridley turtles with the Wildlife Institute of India, said it was possible small numbers of the turtles had been nesting on the beach in past years. “We can’t say for sure since regular patrolling for turtles nests is not done in Mumbai,” she said.

“Beach cleanups definitely have a positive effect on nesting turtles. Many beaches which are major nesting sites are cleaned prior and during the nesting season by villagers, which increases the chances of getting nests [there].”

For more than two years, Shah has been leading volunteers in manually picking up rubbish from Versova beach and teaching sustainable waste practices to villagers and people living in slums along the coastline and the creeks leading into it.

About 55,000 people live along the beach and the waterways that feed it in the crowded megacity. Shah said he taught them by example, offering to clean communal toilets and pick up rubbish himself before he ever sought their help.

“For the first six to eight weeks, nobody joined,” he said. “Then two men approached me and said, very politely, ‘Please sir, can we wear your gloves?’ Both of them just came and joined me. That’s when I knew it was going to be a success.”

He said the team had cleaned 13m kg of debris from the beach in the past two years and are still going, though their campaign was briefly abandoned in November because of “administrative lethargy” and harassment of volunteers.

India has some of the most polluted waterways and beaches in the world due to rapid, unplanned urbanisation, overpopulation and neglectful attitudes, including to public littering.

“There has been a loss of a sense of belonging,” Shah said. “You can have laws, policies, regulations in place, but if the community doesn’t have a sense of belonging, you can see what happens.”

Agent Alan Berger recalls in “Powerhouse: The Untold Story of Hollywood’s Creative Artists Agency” that “in the third year of Katie’s tenure . . . upcoming budget cuts would involve significant layoffs . . . from senior-level producers to young associate producers — all key contributors to the production of the daily newscast.”

He adds that after Couric met with Sean McManus, CBS News president at the time, “Katie decided . . . to take matters into her own hands” and “voluntarily, and quietly, agreed to cut her CBS salary by over $1 million, creating a savings to preserve the jobs of her associates on the broadcast.”

But the anchor insisted “on two conditions,” Berger says in the book — “the money would be directly used to pay for her staff so that they would not be terminated,” and that “this would be done quietly and with no public or private acknowledgment or announcement about her gesture.” Couric was at CBS from 2006 to 2011."

Iraqi man saved countless lives by joining iSIS and setting up covert ambushes of Suicide bombers. He would then have false news reports claim the attacks succeeded in order to hide the truth.,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/the-iraqi-spy-who-infiltrated-isis-and-saved-countless-lives-1.3595820?mode=amp,"The driver was sweating as his white Kia pick-up truck sped along a rain-slicked Baghdad highway toward a neighbourhood bustling with open-air markets. With every jolt and turn, his pulse quickened. Hidden in the truck’s chassis was 1,100 pounds of military-grade explosives that Islamic State planned to use in an audacious attack on New Year’s Eve shoppers in the Iraqi capital.

A reckless driver on Iraq’s notoriously chaotic roads might clip him, accidentally setting off the bomb. A clash at one of Baghdad’s frequent checkpoints could escalate into gunfire, potentially igniting one hellish fireball. But there was another reason he was afraid. The driver, Capt Harith al-Sudani, was a spy.

For the past 16 months, he had worked as a mole, posing as a militant jihadi in Islamic State while passing critical information to a secret branch of Iraq’s national intelligence agency. His record was stunning: He had foiled 30 planned vehicle-bomb attacks and 18 suicide bombers, according to Abu Ali al-Basri, the agency’s director. Sudani also gave the agency a direct line to some of Islamic State’s senior commanders in Mosul, Iraq.

A 36-year-old former computer tech, he was now, agency officials said, perhaps Iraq’s greatest spy, one of a few in the world to have infiltrated the upper reaches of Islamic State. But now, on this last day of 2016, as he cruised along the four-lane crosstown highway toward his assigned target, the markets of Baghdad al Jdeidah, he had a nagging suspicion that his cover had been blown.

Every day he remained embedded with Islamic State was another day he risked his life. Today he had been caught in a small lie, the second in a matter of months. If the half-ton of C-4 plastic explosive riding alongside him didn’t kill him, Islamic State might. Before he left on this, his penultimate mission, he sent his father a text. “Pray for me,” he said.

Listening to the enemy Iraq’s counterterrorism intelligence unit, the Falcon Intelligence Cell, may be the most important organisation on the front lines of the war on terrorism that almost no one has heard of. This article is based on interviews with the director of the agency, members of Sudani’s unit and its commander, his friends and family members, and a review of transcripts and video of operations, and text messages to and from Sudani.

The rows of photos show Islamic State members who were caught and executed because of the agency’s work. Photograph: Ivor Prickett/The New York Times Little known outside of the highest levels of Iraqi and allied intelligence agencies, the Falcons have placed a handful of spies inside the ranks of Islamic State. Its intelligence helped oust the extremists from their last urban strongholds last year and it now aids the hunt for the group’s leaders, like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Recently, an Iraqi-American sting based on Iraqi intelligence led to the arrest of five senior Islamic State members who had been hiding in Turkey and Syria. Iraqi officials say the Falcons have foiled hundreds of attacks on Baghdad, making the capital the safest it has been in 15 years.

US military officials consider the agency as good as they get among non-western spy services. “It has proved to be an extremely valuable unit,” said Col Sean J Ryan, a spokesman for the US-led military coalition in Baghdad. The Falcons, he said, have diminished the threat of Islamic State by infiltrating its cells, killing its leaders and terrorists, and destroying its weapons.

Basri, the Iraqi intelligence chief, credits the group’s undercover work. “A drone can tell you who has entered a building but it can’t tell you what is being said in the room where the men have gathered,” he said. “We can, because our people are inside those rooms.”

University dropout Not many people in Sudani’s life credited him with the audacity or ambition to be a spy. Not his father, Abid al-Sudani, a strict disciplinarian who demanded unstinting obedience from his eldest son and put him to work after school in his small print shop. Not his professors at Baghdad University, who flunked him.

Admission to Baghdad University is a coveted opportunity. Photograph: Sergey Ponomarev/The New York Times Intoxicated by the freedoms of student life, he blew a coveted opportunity, neglecting his studies and chasing women. His father gave him an ultimatum – buckle down or be kicked out of the family home. “It was a decisive moment for him,” said his youngest brother, Munther. “He was really disappointed that he couldn’t live how he wanted to.”

Sudani settled into an arranged marriage and returned to school, studying English and later, Russian. He took a mundane job monitoring surveillance systems for Iraq’s oil infrastructure. At the same time, near daily terrorist attacks were tearing Iraq apart. They ended up giving Sudani an opportunity, and a purpose.

As the government and the US occupation forces struggled to stem the insurgency in post-Saddam Iraq, Basri, then the intelligence director in the prime minister’s office, created a special unit with a narrow mission: targeting terrorist leadership ranks.

In 2006, he recruited 16 men from Iraq’s elite military units and police academies. He called his new unit Al Suquor, or the Falcons. “I searched for them like a man searches for a wife,” he said. “We were ready to take on any challenge.”

Another of Sudani’s brothers, Munaf, was an early recruit. While Harith was bored with his job and spent most evenings playing video games or hanging out in tea shops, Munaf came home from work brimming with enthusiasm.

Munaf urged his brother to apply, saying his computer and language skills made him an attractive recruit. Harith did, and in 2013 was offered a job monitoring web traffic and telephone calls of terrorist suspects. The change transformed him. “He was enthusiastic about his life for the first time in a long time,” said Munther. “He was happy. We all could see it.”

Sudani volunteered. His commanding officer, Gen Saad al-Falih, said he was motivated by photos of children killed in Islamic State attacks. “He couldn’t let them do that,” Falih said. “He was a father himself.” Sudani was promoted to captain and began training to pass as a jihadi.

When he was young, the Sudani family had lived in Ramadi, in Iraq’s Sunni Muslim heartland. The Sunni minority had ruled Iraq under the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. After the Americans ousted him in 2003, extremists exploited the anger of disempowered Sunnis to build the insurgency that would later become the Islamic State.

Captain Sudani’s wife Raghad Chaloob looks at photographs of her late husband at her home in Baghdad. Photograph: Ivor Prickett/The New York Times Sudani’s ability to adopt the Ramadi accent would help his credibility with the group. But as a Shia, he was unfamiliar with Sunni rituals and prayer. So he pored over the Koran, memorising verses favoured by jihadis and learning the chants they used for praying and killing.

He would become known as Abu Suhaib, an unemployed man from a predominantly Sunni neighbourhood in Baghdad. His mission: infiltrate a notorious Islamic State lair in Tarmiyah, a town near the intersection of two highways that was a hub for suicide bombers heading to the capital.

On a September night before his mission was to start, he stayed up with his brother Munaf, drinking tea and listening to crickets chirp in the warm air as Munaf gave him a pep talk. “He was the first of us to volunteer for such a mission,” Munaf said. “It was a real risky thing he was doing.”

The next morning, Sudani walked into a mosque in Tarmiyah that the local Islamic State cell used for meetings. He stayed inside all day, longer than he and his superiors had planned. Munaf, who was part of the surveillance team monitoring his brother, was certain that something had gone terribly wrong.

Around dusk, he recognised his brother’s loping silhouette coming to the prearranged exfiltration spot. Sudani reported a success – the cell had welcomed Abu Suhaib. He was going back to live with them in Tarmiyah.

The bomb courier His first days with Islamic State were filled with training on religion and explosives. A few weeks later, a senior Islamic State official in Mosul called. He assigned Sudani a key part in the logistics chain for suicide bomb missions in Baghdad. Believing him to be a Baghdad native, the group considered him crucial to get bombers past checkpoints on the outskirts of the capital and inside the city.

In weekly phone calls, Mosul would order Sudani to meet suicide bombers arriving in Tarmiyah from Islamic State-held territory, or to pick up a vehicle bomb. Each time, he would alert the Falcons. Their task would be to intercept him and his deadly packages before they reached Baghdad.

A chase car would follow Sudani as he drove, using jamming equipment to block the signal to the bomb’s detonator, which is usually set off remotely by mobile phone. Communicating by phone or hand signals, his comrades would direct him to a place where they could disable the bomb. If he was transporting a bomber, they would lure him out of the car to be arrested or killed.

Then the Falcons would stage fake explosions and issue fake news releases, sometimes claiming large casualties – part of the effort to keep Sudani’s cover intact.

The pressure took a toll on his health. He complained of chest pains, which he thought were anxiety attacks. “Imagine being the driver of a truck filled with 300 kilograms of explosives,” Munaf said. “You are thinking you could die at any moment. He did this over and over again.”

Stern, strict and traditional: Captain Sudani’s father, Abid al-Sudani, with his wife, Laisa Hashim Shuaith, and one of Sudani’s daughters. Photograph: Ivor Prickett/The New York Times His long, unexplained absences from home raised fresh tensions within the family. Only his father and Munther knew about his secret life. His wife, Raghad Chaloob, thought he was neglecting her and their three children. “I regret that he didn’t tell me,” she said later, sitting in their one-bedroom apartment within the Sudani family house. “I guess he knew I would be worried if I knew the truth. No one wants her son to grow up without a father.”

Suspicion and lies The longer Sudani worked undercover, the greater his risk of exposure. Still, he chose to continue. Falih said Sudani told him that he had finally found a purpose in life. “It was a golden time for us,” Falih said. “It was a golden time for him.”

The Falcons’ operations were crucial in turning the momentum of the US-led coalition’s battle against Islamic State. Its intelligence led to the deaths of seven top Islamic State leaders and guided dozens of coalition air strikes, according to Hisham al-Hashimi, an independent Iraqi security analyst.

By mid-2016, there was growing optimism that the group could be defeated. Sudani’s handlers in Mosul had increased his duties, asking him to scout neighbourhoods and cafes in Baghdad as targets for possible attacks. On one such mission, he tried to sneak in a rare visit home. While there, his Islamic State commander called, demanding to know where he was. Sudani said he was at the target neighbourhood.

The commander told him he was lying, citing his phone’s GPS co-ordinates. That may have been the first red flag. Munaf told his brother that it was time to end his mission. Sudani refused. By December, however, he was firmly in Islamic State’s crosshairs. The group was on its heels militarily, losing ground in Syria and struggling to hold on to Mosul. Its response was to carry out more and bigger terrorist attacks, loudly declaring its continued relevance by inspiring mayhem around the world.

On December 19th, the group sent a tractor-trailer careening through a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 and wounding dozens. On December 31st, the Mosul commander told Sudani he had been chosen to take part in a spectacular New Year’s Eve attack, a series of co-ordinated bombings in multiple cities around the world.

Sudani picked up the white Kia in the eastern Baghdad neighbourhood of Al Khadra. As usual, he phoned the Falcons to discuss where they would intercept him.

Coming undone The plan began to unravel as soon as he veered off the city’s main crosstown highway toward the Falcons’ safe house. His phone rang. It was Mosul, asking his location. Sudani assured the caller that he was en route to the target. The handler said he was lying. Sudani frantically struggled to invent an excuse. He told Mosul that he must have made a wrong turn.

Captain Harith al-Sudani’s wife, Raghad Hasan Chaloob, centre, and their three children, Riyam, Rawan and Muamal on the roof of their home in Baghdad. Photograph: Ivor Prickett/The New York Times Spooked, he called his Falcons teammates, telling them they needed a rendezvous much closer to the planned attack site. He turned the truck-bomb back on the road to Baghdad al Jdeidah. Munaf, who was part of the chase team, used hand signals to direct his brother to the new meeting point.

Eight agents dismantled the bomb. They removed the electronic detonator, 26 plastic bags of C4, ammonium nitrate and ball bearings from the chassis and door panels of the vehicle. In minutes, Sudani was back on the road to the market and parking the pick-up at its intended location.

Just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, Arabic media, citing Iraqi security officials, reported a white truck had exploded outside Al Bayda Cinema in Baghdad al Jdeidah, causing no casualties. Sudani’s mission was a success. What he didn’t know was that Islamic State had planted two bugs in the truck, allowing the extremists to hear his entire conversation with the Falcons.

“He felt that he was under suspicion,” Falih said later. “We just didn’t realise how much.”

The set-up In early January 2017, Islamic State called Sudani for another mission. It would be his last. He was sent to a new location, a farmhouse outside Tarmiyah. It was too remote to monitor and had no easy escape route. Munaf told him not to risk it, saying the change of procedure was suspicious. Sudani decided to go.

“Looking back, I can’t believe that he trusted them,” Munaf said. “I think he was blinded by a need to make us proud.”

On the morning of January 17th, he entered the farmhouse. Just after sunset, the Falcons team alerted Falih that something was wrong. Munaf called their usually stern father, who broke down. “I had never seen him cry before,” Munaf said. “He kept pleading with me to save his son, but there was nothing I could do.”

Because Tarmiyah was an Islamic State stronghold, it took three days for Iraq’s security forces to plan and mount a rescue operation. A combined army and police force raided the farmhouse. One Iraqi officer was killed. When the building was cleared, there was no sign of Sudani.

Iraqi border guard troops patrol the Syrian border near Qaim this year. Captain Sudani may have spent his final days there. Photograph: Ivor Prickett/The New York Times For six months, the Falcons gathered evidence. They discovered the bugs in the Kia truck. Informers suggested that the jihadis had taken Sudani to Qaim, an Iraqi town controlled by Islamic State and beyond the government’s reach. In August, the Islamic State released a propaganda video showing militants executing blindfolded prisoners. The Falcons were certain that Sudani was one of them. “I grew up with him, shared a bedroom with him,” Munaf said. “I don’t need to see his face to know my brother.”

‘A wound on my heart’ In death, Sudani has achieved a level of fame unusual in the shadow world of spies. Iraq’s joint operations command issued a statement about his sacrifice for the nation. The Falcons published an ode to his bravery. On the rutted, dirt road in front of his father’s house, a pair of giant posters lauding the hero-son adorn the courtyard wall. A portrait of him is tattooed across Munther’s chest.

Posters outside the Sudani family home in Baghdad feature larger-than-life photos of Captain Sudani and poems of mourning written by his father. Photograph: Ivor Prickett/The New York Times But the Sudani family is still struggling to get what they consider proper respect. Because they do not have a body, they have been unable to obtain a death certificate, a prerequisite to receive benefits due to fallen servicemen. “I have a wound on my heart,” said the father, Abid al-Sudani. “He lived and died for his country. The nation should cherish him the way I do.”

For the Falcons, Sudani’s successes helped it win bigger budgets, a wider appreciation among allies and better training for its men. The Americans and the Russians are now helping it penetrate Islamic State, Iraqi intelligence officials say."
"Ex-Con skips job interview, Takes shirt off and saves the life of a car crash victim",http://cbsn.ws/2ukiBOE,"It had only been seven days since he got released from prison, but Aaron Tucker had already done the impossible — he landed a job interview.

Last Thursday, the 32-year-old from Bridgeport, Connecticut, woke up at 5 a.m., grabbed a dress shirt he had been given at the halfway house he was living in, and hopped onto a city bus to meet the manager at a nearby Dinosaur Bar-B-Que.

He was starting to drift off to sleep, then awoke and looked up to check the stop. He was startled to see a car hit a tree and flip over.

The bus driver quickly hit the brakes and came to a stop.

""Are you going to help?"" he shouted to the bus driver.

""No, but if you get out I'm going to leave,"" the driver replied, explaining that he had to stick to his route.

Tucker didn't let that stop him. He jumped off the bus and sprinted toward the totaled car, which was upside down and spewing smoke. He kneeled down next to the passenger-side window and saw the driver covered in blood.

Aaron Tucker, 32, is being hailed a hero for running to the aid of a car crash victim in Connecticut. GoFundMe

""The guy had a lot of blood coming from his head,"" Tucker told CBS News.

He unbuckled the man's seatbelt and dragged him away from the vehicle as it started to catch on fire. Several others also ran over to help, including three employees from a local auto body shop who brought over a fire extinguisher.

""You're going to be all right,"" Tucker repeated to the man as they lay on the pavement. ""Your family wants to see you. Keep your eyes open.""

Tucker pulled off his shirt and used it to help stop the man's head from bleeding. Within minutes, firefighters and EMTs arrived.

""I had a grip on his arm to keep him calm as they put an oxygen mask on him,"" Tucker said. ""I just wanted to make sure he was all right, and that's what I did.""

Tucker skipped his interview in order to stay with the man until an ambulance arrived. The man was taken to Norwalk Hospital and was in stable condition as of Wednesday, the Westport News reported. Police are still investigating the crash.

""I feel like a job can come and go, but a life is one time thing,"" Tucker said. ""The job just wasn't in my mind at that time.""

Community members who read a local news story about Tucker's heroic rescue decided to help the man turn his life around. They set up a GoFundMe page, raising more than $16,000 in only a day.

Kami Evans, a Westport community activist, used several Facebook pages she managed to help organize donation drives, collecting clothes and non-perishable goods for Tucker and his 21-month-old son.

""I think everybody was just so moved. This guy did such a selfless act,"" Evans told CBS News. ""It wasn't about anything but doing the right thing — and he did the right thing.""

A business owner reached out to Evans Friday to offer Tucker a tailored suit so he will have confidence at his future job.

The suit will come in handy, as job offers have started rolling in since Tucker's story was shared.

""I've been given a lot of job offers,"" Tucker said. ""Right now, I don't have the money, so I want to get the best job I can to support my son.""

Tucker said any money he makes will go toward taking care of his family.

""I got locked up three weeks before my son was born,"" Tucker explained. ""When he was born, I got a phone call from the hospital. I heard my son crying in the background, and right then and there I was like, 'I'm changing my life.'""

Tucker got his GED and became a tutor in prison, hoping to be a role model for his son.

""I came out here with nothing, literally nothing,"" Tucker said. ""But I knew if I worked hard things are going to come my way."""
It’s a Boy! San Diego Zoo Announces Birth of Endangered Pygmy Hippo,https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/its-a-boy-san-diego-zoo-announces-birth-of-endangered-pygmy-hippo/2304231/,"The San Diego Zoo has announced the latest addition of its wild family – a male pygmy hippopotamus whose successful birth was the first of its kind at the zoo in more than 30 years.

The zoo welcomed the new bundle of joy on April 9, when 4-year-old pygmy hippopotamus Mabel gave birth in an indoor habitat for her species. Mabel, who is a first-time mother, gave birth to a 12.4 pound calf who is doing well, according to the zoo.

“Mom and calf are doing very well, they said – and the calf is nursing and getting lots of attention from the first-time mother,” San Diego Zoo Global said in a statement.

Within just a few hours of being born, the calf was able to walk and follow his mother around. He’s been “surpassing the milestones that wildlife care specialists watch for in a young pygmy hippo,” the zoo said.

The month-old calf, who does not yet have a name, has been able to successfully explore water and demonstrated hippo instincts to close his nostrils and hold his breath under water. With that, wildlife specialists granted the young hippopotamus full access to the pool in the maternity yard.

Zoo officials said it will be about another month for Mabel and the calf to have access to the main habitat.

Because hippos don't live in family groups, the now 25-pound calf will not be introduced to his father since they do not play a role in raising offspring, the zoo said.

Pygmy hippos are an endangered species that are found in only four countries: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire. There are fewer than 2,500 pygmy hippos in the wild due to threats that include farming, human settlement in its environment and logging."

Down to zero – No elephants poached for whole year in African park,https://www.fauna-flora.org/news/zero-no-elephants-poached-whole-year-african-park?utm_medium=email&utm_source=uspl&utm_campaign=welcome-niassa&utm_content=welcome-article,"One of Africa’s last great wilderness areas has just celebrated an extraordinary landmark – an entire year during which not a single elephant has been recorded killed by poachers. In the context of the savage onslaught that has seen literally thousands of these magnificent animals slaughtered for their ivory in recent years, this is a remarkable statistic.

Mozambique’s Niassa National Reserve covers over four million hectares of miombo woodland, meandering rivers and majestic inselbergs. On the ground, it is difficult to comprehend Niassa’s magnitude. From the air, the bigger picture emerges; it takes one and a half hours to cross the reserve in a light aircraft. Niassa harbours an estimated 40% of Mozambique’s entire elephant population, not to mention impressive numbers of sable antelope, Cape buffalo and numerous other species characteristic of this landscape.

Spectacular herds of herbivores are just one feature of a tapestry that is rich in wildlife. The reserve is also one of the most important refuges on the entire continent for two of Africa’s most charismatic – and seriously threatened – carnivores: the lion and wild dog.

Ironically, it is the very scale of this landscape that poses one of the greatest threats to the long-term survival of the wildlife it supports. The effective conservation management of an area the size of Denmark presents enormous logistical difficulties. The recent resurgence in the demand for ivory and consequent explosion in poaching activity – which reached a peak in 2017-18 in Niassa – has exacerbated that problem.

Fauna & Flora International (FFI) is among the many conservation organisations that have been supporting Niassa – and working with the impoverished communities whose livelihoods depend on the reserve’s natural resources – for a number of years. A painstaking rehabilitation process begun in 2002 saw us make tremendous strides in halting the decline in the reserve’s wildlife populations after years of conservation neglect.

By 2012, it looked as though Niassa was beginning to turn a corner. This proved to be a false dawn, however. A sudden, exponential rise in ivory poaching and a surge in illegal mining and logging activity threatened to undermine a decade of conservation achievement.

Swift intervention was required to safeguard the future of Niassa’s elephants and the reserve’s other remarkable biodiversity. As plans were being drawn up to split Niassa into different zones, FFI took the strategic decision to secure a key area of the reserve situated at the coalface of the poaching threat and home to the most significant concentrations of wildlife. Chuilexi Conservancy was the result.

Formed from three adjoining tourism concessions, Chuilexi Conservancy is critical to the survival of Niassa’s wildlife. This ‘reserve within a reserve’ is a huge area in its own right, covering well over half a million hectares. It was carefully chosen for investment by FFI to ensure maximum conservation impact by protecting the highest densities of wildlife within the most severely threatened part of Niassa as a whole.

But Chuilexi is just one piece in the overall jigsaw. In an area as vast as Niassa, working collaboratively across all the concessions is the only way to achieve meaningful conservation success at the big picture level.

This incredible zero-casualty count over a 12-month period is a tribute to the collective efforts of all partners involved in safeguarding a crucial population of the world’s largest land mammal. In partnership with the National Administration for Conservation Areas, the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society has played a key role in this respect.

The groundbreaking achievement also owes a great deal to political will and, in particular, the direct intervention of Mozambican President Felipe Nyusi. He personally authorised the deployment of a rapid intervention police force, which has led to the dramatic turnaround in Niassa’s fortunes and raised hopes that the elephant population may actually recover.

After visiting the reserve in November 2018, President Nyusi approved the presence of special forces for a further year, during which they will continue to work hand in hand with rangers and provide them with training in the skills and techniques needed to combat poaching in the longer term.

Rob Harris, FFI’s country manager in Mozambique, is cautiously optimistic: “It feels as though a tipping point has been reached thanks to the combination of high-level government support and the steady strengthening of anti-poaching activities over many years. Together this has acted as a successful deterrent to elephant poaching and we are now seeing very promising results.”

Nevertheless, continued vigilance will be required to ensure that the ever-present threats to Niassa are kept at bay: “The indications are that issues remain with lions and other iconic species, so the combination of national-level support and on-the-ground effort must be maintained to improve the situation for all wildlife, and to keep elephant poaching at zero.”"

Hungover customer brings heaps of business to struggling Alberta fish and chip shop,http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/calgary/whitbies-fish-and-chips-lethbridge-1.3737483,"Up until a few days ago, business was ""absolutely terrible"" at John McMillan's little fish and chips shop in Lethbridge, Alta.

But that all changed after a very hungry and hungover customer walked through his doors.

""I had a few drinks the night before and I was feeling like some grease,"" Colin Ross told the Calgary Eyeopener on Friday.

He struck up a conversation with the friendly 69-year-old owner, who fixed him a three-piece halibut on a bed of fries.

Ross devoured his meal and his hangover began to dull. As clarity set in, he realized the shop was empty.

""I just seen a really good establishment with really good food that deserved a lineup through the door.""

He told the owner he was going to help him.

""He says, 'I've got 2,000 friends on Facebook,'"" said McMillan, who didn't really know what that meant because he's ""not into a lot of computer stuff.""

Lineups out the door

Ross's glowing review of Whitbie's Fish & Chips on his Facebook page has had more than 8,000 shares and has brought hundreds of new customers through the door.

""Our business has just gone right through the roof to the point where, you know, we've got people waiting an hour and a half to an hour and three quarters for their dinner,"" McMillan said.

The owner has had to quickly recruit family and friends to help him out, but sure isn't complaining.

"Against All Odds, Mountain Gorilla Numbers Are on the Rise",https://www.ecowatch.com/mountain-gorilla-numbers-on-the-rise-2582376835.html,"By Jason Bittel

The news coming out of East Africa's Virunga Mountains these days would have made the late (and legendary) conservationist Dian Fossey very happy. According to the most recent census, the mountain gorillas introduced to the world in Gorillas in the Mist, Fossey's book and the film about her work, have grown their ranks from 480 animals in 2010 to 604 as of June 2016. Add another couple hundred apes living in scattered habitats to the south, and their population as a whole totals more than 1,000. Believe it or not, this makes the mountain gorilla subspecies the only great apes known to be increasing in number.

At first glance, 1,000 gorillas might not seem like a big deal. The International Union for Conservation of Nature still classifies the subspecies as critically endangered. Poaching and habitat destruction still threaten these giant primates with expressive faces and, as Fossey found, close-knit families. But to truly appreciate their population today, you have to go back more than half a century.

Mountain gorilla numbers were in veritable free fall during the 1960s, when Fossey began to study them closely. While she was working tirelessly to habituate the apes to her presence, livestock grazers were driving their herds ever farther into gorilla habitat. Humans were also clearing forests for charcoal and agriculture and setting snares to catch antelope and buffalo—snares that would also doom any great apes they inadvertently snagged. Meanwhile, poachers were increasingly targeting gorillas and their young for meat, trophies, and even the exotic pet trade.

The mountain gorilla population hit its nadir in 1981 when trackers counted just 242 individuals. At the time, Fossey said she didn't expect the subspecies to survive long enough to see the new millennium. Tragically, it was Fossey who didn't make it to the end of the century. In 1985 the world-renowned primatologist was murdered at her Rwandan research camp, Karisoke. The circumstances surrounding her death remain mysterious to this day.

Studying and protecting mountain gorillas has often meant great personal sacrifice. Over the past 20 years, more than 170 rangers have lost their lives while protecting the animals and their habitat. Just this past April, five rangers and their driver were ambushed and gunned down in Virunga National Park in the deadliest attack in the park's history; a local militia is thought to have been responsible.

The charcoal industry and the ever-present threat of homemade wire snares still endanger the gorillas, but those threats are seen as a consequence of people trying to survive in a region without many economic opportunities. ""The local communities who live next to the gorillas are often extremely poor and reliant on the natural resources found in the national parks,"" writes Tara Stoinski, president and CEO of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International.

Stoinski said this is why it's important to loop locals into mountain gorilla recovery efforts. The Fossey Fund works to provide better access to food, water, and security, as well as education and job training, ""so people are directly benefiting from the gorillas,"" she said. And in Rwanda, 10 percent of the park's entrance fees go directly toward improving the lives of local communities.

Furthermore, the slow but steady gains in mountain gorilla numbers show that quite a lot of people care about these beleaguered animals and are willing to work together to protect them. The census required cooperation from three separate governments (Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), as well as numerous conservation organizations and locals living near the park.

Trackers spent 12 hours each day traversing ravines, climbing mountains, and generally trying to survive in the jungle, all while looking for piles of the animals' dung. The researchers sampled the dung for DNA, allowing them to determine just how many of these primates are out there. The DNA also provided clues about individual gorillas that had been known since birth but had disappeared in the past dozen years. The census found 13 such ""lost"" gorillas, which the scientists see as proof that despite a small population size, the apes are still capable of dispersing, mixing with other groups, and keeping their gene pool as robust as possible. ""There is hope,"" said Stoinski. ""The gorillas are improving despite incredible odds.""

Stoinski said the gorillas' perseverance may inspire still more conservation efforts by showing people that they can make a difference, even when the outlook is grim. After all, the mountain gorillas never gave up—and neither have the men and women risking their lives to save them.

"The number of undernourished people in India has declined by 60 million in over a decade, according to a UN report",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/number-of-undernourished-people-declines-in-india-obesity-in-adults-on-the-rise-un-report/article32075399.ece,"The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report estimated that almost 690 million people globally were undernourished (or hungry) in 2019, up by 10 million from 2018

The number of undernourished people in India has declined by 60 million in over a decade, according to a UN report which said that there were less stunted children but more obese adults in the country.

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, released on Monday, estimated that almost 690 million people globally were undernourished (or hungry) in 2019, up by 10 million from 2018.

The report — considered the most authoritative global study tracking progress towards ending hunger and malnutrition — said that the number of undernourished people in India declined from 249.4 million in 2004-06 to 189.2 million in 2017-19.

In percentage terms, the prevalence of undernourishment in the total population in India declined from 21.7 % in 2004-06 to 14 % in 2017-19, it said.

The two subregions showing reductions in undernourishment — eastern and southern Asia — are dominated by the two largest economies of the continent — China and India.

Despite very different conditions, histories and rates of progress, the reduction in hunger in both the countries stems from long-term economic growth, reduced inequality, and improved access to basic goods and services, it said.

The report is prepared jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

It further said that the prevalence of stunting in children under 5 years of age in India declined from 47.8% in 2012 to 34.7% in 2019 or from 62 million in 2012 to 40.3 million in 2019.

More Indian adults became obese between 2012-16, the report said.

The number of adults (18 years and older) who are obese grew from 25.2 million in 2012 to 34.3 million in 2016, growing from 3.1 % to 3.9 %.

The number of women of reproductive age (15-49) affected by anaemia grew from 165.6 million in 2012 to 175.6 million in 2016.

The number of infants 0-5 months of age exclusively breastfed grew from 11.2 million in 2012 to 13.9 million in 2019.

The hungry are most numerous in Asia, but expanding fastest in Africa.

Across the planet, the report forecasts, that the COVID-19 pandemic could push over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020.

In percentage terms, Africa is the hardest hit region and becoming more so, with 19.1 % of its people undernourished.

At the current trends, by 2030, Africa will be home to more than half of the world’s chronically hungry.

The COVID-19 is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems - understood as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food.

While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by COVID-19, it said, adding that the setback throws into further doubt the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal two, whose target is achieving zero hunger.

The latest estimates are that a staggering three billion people or more cannot afford a healthy diet.

In sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, this is the case for 57 % of the population - though no region, including north America and Europe, is spared.

In 2019, 191 million children under five were stunted or wasted - too short or too thin. Another 38 million under-fives were overweight.

Among adults, meanwhile, obesity has become a global pandemic in its own right.

The study calls on the governments to mainstream nutrition in their approaches to agriculture; work to cut cost-escalating factors in the production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing of food - including by reducing inefficiencies and food loss and waste.

It also urges them to support local small-scale producers to grow and sell more nutritious foods, and secure their access to markets; prioritise children’s nutrition as the category in greatest need; foster behaviour change through education and communication; and embed nutrition in national social protection systems and investment strategies.

The report noted that generally, cash transfer programmes are considered an appropriate instrument to increase dietary diversity in well-connected urban or rural contexts, while in-kind transfers are more appropriate for remote areas, where access to markets is severely limited.

In India, for instance, the country’s Targeted Public Distribution System represents the largest social protection programme in the world, reaching 800 million people with subsidised cereals that can be purchased from more than 500,000 fair price shops across the country.

In India, rural business hubs have facilitated linking smallholder farmers to rapidly growing urban markets.

Apart from procuring food products from the farmers, these hubs provide services such as farm inputs and equipment, as well as access to credit.

Having food processing, packaging and cooling facilities at the same location allows consumers to benefit from economies of agglomeration and, on the whole, reduce transaction costs throughout the food supply chain.

This model in India has given rise to rural supermarkets that provide cheaper staple food, it added."

Nurse in Texas develops masks with better filtration than N95,https://nypost.com/2020/04/17/nurse-in-texas-develops-masks-with-better-filtration-than-n95/,"The chief executive nurse at University Health System has developed a mask that has better filtration than N95 masks.

Nurse Tommye Austin used AC filter material she purchased at Lowe’s to create 600 masks as reserves as San Antonio, Texas, prepares for a surge in coronavirus hospitalizations that is expected in May, according to reports by KSAT.

“In the event that we get a surge of COVID-19 patients in San Antonio, which is predicted to happen in May, we are making sure we have adequate and sufficient equipment for employees,” Austin told KSAT. “Once we learned that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] had given us the ability to create masks, rather than using a bandanna or a handkerchief, we decided to look at creating our own N95.”

Austin said the masks fit and resemble an N95 mask, but research and testing done by the Southwest Research Institute says the new prototype actually has better filtration than the original masks.

“The mask has a filtration rate of 99.5 percent with one material and has a 97.8 percent filtration efficiency with another material we are using,” Austin said. “So if the N95 masks have a 95 percent filtration efficiency, that means it can eliminate at least 95 percent of the virus or bacteria trying to get through the mask.”

Austin said she hopes to produce and stockpile at least 6,500 more masks that can each be used twice if they are cleaned with correct sanitation equipment and protocols similar to what would be used on N95 masks.

“We have been working with the Southwest Research Institute in making sure that we just not develop something we think is a good product but something that we know is a good product by using science,” Austin said. “It doesn’t have what we call carbon dioxide buildup, which could make you dizzy or (give you) a headache. It is comfortable and you can wear it for long periods of time.”

Austin said her hospital is sharing their design with other facilities in the region in hopes it can be of use to health care workers who are struggling to meet the demands of a growing pandemic.

“Hearing the stories from the nurses in New York and other hot spots, it was just heartbreaking. As a nurse, we are to be advocates for people, so my primary goal was not to make money off this mask or anything. The main purpose of this mask was to keep people safe.”"

Brewing company creates beer in honor of prematurely born baby hippo Fiona. 25 percent of the beer sales proceeds is being donated to the zoo's care team.,https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2017-05-25/brewing-company-creates-beer-in-honor-of-baby-hippo-fiona,"CINCINNATI (AP) — The Cincinnati Zoo's prematurely born hippo named Fiona is getting a new beer in her honor.

Listermann Brewing Company is releasing a Team Fiona New England-style IPA. The hippo's care team helped brew the beer.

And the brewing company says 25 percent of the beer sales proceeds is being donated to the zoo's care team.

The brewing company describes the beer as having a soft mouth feel, hazy appearance with a fruit-juice flavor.

Fiona was born at the zoo in January, weighing just 29 pounds (13 kilograms). She now weighs more than 100 pounds (45 kilograms). Zoo caretakers are preparing to move her to a group of hippos that includes her parents.

Listermann's general manager says watching Fiona grow up has been a joy."
Dolly Parton Donates $1 Million to Children's Hospital in Honor of Niece,https://www.newschannel5.com/news/dolly-parton-donates-1-million-to-childrens-hospital-in-honor-of-niece,"Dolly Parton spent Thursday at Vanderbilt's Children's Hospital to celebrate a deeply personal milestone. Her niece, Hannah Dennison, turns 30-years-old on Sunday - a birthday Parton wasn't always sure she'd be able to celebrate.

""Twenty-six years ago is when Hannah was diagnosed with leukemia and for five years we didn't know if we'd be keeping her or not,"" Parton told a room full of doctors, nurses, patients and families. ""But Hannah now stands here as our chemo hero. She shows that miracles do happen with good care, great doctors and great nurses.""

Parton met some of those doctors and nurses last fall when she visited the hospital to release her first-ever children's album. During that visit, she decided to donate $1 million to the hospital.

""They took such good care of her and just looking at the little faces of the kids going through this and the parents who suffer so much as well; it's just touching and moving,"" she said. ""If you're in a position where you can do something, you should do something.""

In return, the Children's Hospital dedicated it's second floor butterfly garden to Dennison on Thursday.

""Now that we have Hannah's butterfly garden, we may come up and do little shows now and then and bring some joy to the kids,"" Parton said. ""Or just come up and say, 'Hey, I got my guitar, want to sing some songs?' Bring a few smiles to the kids faces."""
"Boy, 8, collects more than 1,000 toys for children of Puerto Rico.",http://abcnews.go.com/us/boy-collects-1000-toys-children-puerto-rico/story?id=51722790,"Boy, 8, collects more than 1,000 toys for children of Puerto Rico Jayden Perez was given Giants game tickets and wanted to pay it forward.

 -- This Christmas has been the season of giving, not getting, for an 8-year-old boy in New Jersey whose home has become a bit like Santa's workshop.

On Dec. 3, Jayden Perez, a third-grader in Woodland Park, New Jersey, held a toy drive at his home to collect toys for children in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico.

His mother, Ana Rosado, told ABC News today that in September, her boss had given Jayden, a New York Giants fan and football lover, one pretty epic gift: tickets to a Giants game. Rosado said it was a gift just because, not for Jayden's birthday or any special reason.

On video, she captured Jayden breaking down in tears of joy after being given the tickets.

Rosado said that also around that time, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. She and Jayden volunteered to help. The two collected donations and helped pack and ship them out. She said the two helped put together more than 40 boxes.

After Thanksgiving, Rosado said Jayden came to her with his own, new idea: He'd been blessed with Giants tickets so he wanted to pay it forward to the children of Puerto Rico.

""He said, 'Mom, I'm concerned kids aren't going to get toys,'"" she said. ""That really touched me.""

Jayden told her that he wanted to donate his Christmas gifts to the children but Rosado took it a step further: have a toy drive.

Rosado posted the event on social media and word spread with help from local media outlets.

She said that so far, the drive had netted more than 1,000 toys but that there were more toys coming this week. Rosado said a man had even reached out to her from Pennsylvania, saying he had a trailer of toys that had been donated from his community.

""I'm so overwhelmed,"" Rosado said. ""I'm so proud of my son. ... I didn't expect so many toys.""

She said that a shipping company was also helping them to get the toys to Puerto Rico. Initially, Rosado said, two of her friends had planned to fly to the island to help distribute the toys. But, she said today, she and Jayden would now be going Jan. 4 to celebrate Three Kings' Day.

It will be his first trip to the island, she said.

Rosado said they planned to bring some toys to an orphanage that had reached out to her for help and then they'd travel Jan. 5 and Jan. 6 to several small cities that had been hit hard by Maria.

So far, Jayden has more than 30 boxes of toys packed up and ready to be shipped.

""He has such a great heart,"" Rosado said. ""I know that my son is doing good out there."""

"France to distribute free medical cannabis, launch experiment in 2021",https://mjbizdaily.com/france-to-distribute-free-medical-cannabis-launch-experiment-in-2021/,"The French government published a long-awaited decree this week detailing how a limited medical cannabis experiment will be carried out.

It was also confirmed that up to 3,000 patients will be able to participate in the experiment.

The first prescriptions are now expected to occur in March 2021.

The experiment will be limited in time – two years starting with the first prescription or March 31, 2021, whichever comes first.

The decree also determined that the Ministry of Health and Solidarity is responsible for the execution of the project.

The minister, with the opinion of the general director of the French Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM), will decide:

The characteristics, composition, pharmaceutical form and technical specifications of the cannabis-based medical products.

The list of conditions for which doctors will be able to prescribe medical marijuana within the experiment.

The specific procedures for importing, storing, distributing and controlling the cannabis .

Nicolas Authier, a university professor and chair of the ANSM scientific committee on medical cannabis, told Marijuana Business Daily that “an invitation to tender for the selection of cannabis-based products” will be proposed in the coming days.

Because cultivation of high-THC cannabis is still illegal in France, Authier believes the suppliers “will probably be foreign … in collaboration with pharmaceutical laboratories established in France and licensed for narcotics.”

“Five more months of work before the first prescriptions,” he added, “but France is now officially committed to access to medical cannabis.”

The ANSM will be responsible for implementing a patient registry that will be updated, with the consent of patients, by doctors and pharmacies.

The registry will serve several pharmacovigilance-related purposes.

As is typical in Europe, medical cannabis will be prescribed only as last resort.

Doctors and pharmacies will have to complete a mandatory training program, but their participation in the trial will be voluntary.

The budget necessary for authorities to be able to carry out the experiment still needs to be approved by the French parliament.
